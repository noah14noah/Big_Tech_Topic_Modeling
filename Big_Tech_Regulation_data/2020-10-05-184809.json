Progressives, conservatives and the Trump administration are probing the internet giants. Two companies are particularly in the crosshairs of lawmakers and regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It does not happen everyday that Greg Walden, a longtime Republican Congressman from Oregon and Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Senator and progressive presidential candidate, agree on a key political issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Walden, who was a key player in the GOP's failed effort to repeal and replace President Obama's signature health care law that made health care available for millions of Americans, and Elizabeth Warren, who campaigns for an even more expansive health insurance reform called Medicare for All, agree that it is time to regulate the US-based internet giants.</p><p>Already last year when Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testified before Congress, Walden offered a pointed - and it turns out - prophetic inquiry. \"At what point is a platform like that a common carrier in the information age?,\" he asked, referring to the US government's definition of a utility which, applied to Facebook, would enable the Federal Communications Commission to regulate the company. What gives Walden's willingness to consider regulating Facebook even more weight is the fact that Facebook operates a data center in his electoral district.</p><p>Warren, meanwhile, made breaking up Google, Facebook and Amazon a key plank of her election campaign. After the rollout of a policy proposal on how Warren plans to unwind Big Tech, last month saw the erecting of a billboard in the heart of Silicon Valley that calls for the breakup of the major internet companies.</p><p>From darling to target</p><p>With their pronounced views on regulating Big Tech, Walden and Warren may earlier have been outliers in their respective parties, but over the past year the notion that Google, Facebook, Amazon and others have accrued too much power and should be regulated has rapidly evolved from fringe to mainstream.</p><p>\"These corporations were really the darlings of American commerce, and it's hard to believe, as someone who has been working on these issues for three or four years, how quickly that has changed, not just among progressives, but also among conservatives here in the US,\" saidSarah Miller, vice president of the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think tank in Washington. \"So if I were sitting in Silicon Valley I would start to get a little bit worried right now.\"</p><p>That's because a barrage of inquiries about the power and conduct of Google, Facebook and co. is coming from all sides. The House Judiciary Committee just announced a broad, bipartisan antitrust probe into the Big Tech companies. Meanwhile the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reportedly divided up oversight of the four major internet players Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple and are exploring antitrust investigations. Several US states have also expressed concerns about the power of Big Tech firms and could launch their own investigations.</p><p>Washington catching up with rest of the world</p><p>That Washington, after years of looking away, is now prepared to take a hard look at the de facto monopolistic power that the Big Tech companies have acquired in recent years (according to many scholars) is welcome - and long overdue, said Spencer Weber Waller, director of the Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies at Loyola University in Chicago.</p><p>\"I think it's terrific. The rest of the world gets it,\" he said, noting that the EU and major European countries like Germany have been focused on the power of these companies for some time. \"And I am pleased that the United States is spending more attention and resources to look at it.\"</p><p>That the growing debate over the power of the internet giants coincides with the US presidential election campaign only raises public awareness of the issue that features as a key component of the platforms of not just Warren, but many of the more than a dozen Democratic candidates. President Donald Trump has also repeatedly talked about potentially breaking up the Big Tech companies.</p><p>Historic campaign issue</p><p>While Republicans and Democrats want to rein in Big Tech, they often do so for different reasons. \"Some conservatives don't like the tech giants because they are biased politically, some progressives don't like the tech giants because they think they are abusing their corporate power,\" said Weber Waller. But the end result is the same: more scrutiny for Big Tech.</p><p>That the issue of monopoly power of US companies, not just in the internet sector, but also in the pharmaceutical industry, could evolve into a significant 2020 campaign topic is historic, said Weber Waller. \"I can only think of one presidential election that in the US really turned on what people's view on antitrust were and that goes all the way back to 1912.\"</p><p>That election was noteworthy because of its focus on the abuse of power by business interests and economic inequality, but also because it featured four candidates - a Republican, a Democrat, a Socialist and a former president, Theodore Roosevelt, who ran for the Progressive Party.</p><p>It's too early to tell whether corporate power will shape the upcoming election like it did it more than a century ago. But it is already a huge leap that it is now mainstream to advocate for the breakup of the Big Tech companies, a position long held by the Open Markets Institute.</p><p>Breaking up Facebook and Amazon</p><p>\"These companies in our view are some of the world's most dangerous monopolies,\" said Open Markets' Miller. That's because Google and Facebook have de facto \"control over the way people communicate and receive news all over the world.\"</p><p>As a consequence and a first step, she added, \"we have called on the Federal Trade Commission to break up Facebook and to reverse some of the acquisitions that were approved erroneously, Instagram and WhatsApp in particular.\"</p><p>But Amazon, she noted, should also be broken because of its monopolistic market power. \"Amazon is seeking to become the railroad of 21st century commerce where anyone who wants to participate in the economy in a meaningful way has to ride the rails of Amazon to get to their customers.\"</p><p>To be sure, a breakup of Facebook or Amazon is not imminent and would be something like a revolution in light of the US government's past comparatively deferential behavior toward major corporations. But since the 2016 presidential election we also know that even highly unexpected things can happen.</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8R-VXD1-DXMS-83KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1089\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 7, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There is, therefore, going to be intense offshore interest in the Morrison government's approach to regulating in the digital age.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government's action plan was set out on Thursday in its response to the final report of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) digital platforms inquiry that was tabled in July.</p><p>That 623-page report, with its 23 recommendations, is regarded as the broadest and most comprehensive investigation of the digital behemoths ever undertaken. That explains the worldwide interest in developments in a market that is almost insignificant to the technology companies that dominate the digital environment.</p><p>The competition regulator's brief, and its recommendations, covered issues including reforms to traditional competition law, data privacy, the relationship between the big tech companies and traditional media, fake news, copyright enforcement and unfair trading practices.</p><p>Internationally, the big regulatory issues (tax is being dealt with as a separate and equally vexatious issue) have been data privacy, the impact of the tech companies on traditional media and the way the companies exploit their dominance.</p><p>The government supports, in principle, the ACCC recommendations that would strengthen digital privacy rights, giving consumers a greater ability to understand the nature of the personal data the companies are collecting from them and how it is being used before they consent to their data being exploited.</p><p>It supports, again in principle, the development of a voluntary code of conduct in response to the imbalance of bargaining power between digital platforms and news media businesses, with the threat of a mandatory code if the parties can't reach agreement.</p><p>It has also endorsed a recommendation that media regulation should be reformed to produce a platform-neutral regulatory framework.</p><p>In a response to the prevalence of \"fake news\" on social media platforms, it will ask them to develop voluntary codes of conduct for \"disinformation and news quality\", with a threat that there will be stronger action taken if the companies don't produce satisfactory responses.</p><p>A concern about the dominance that network effects provide companies such as Google and Facebook (the more users they have the more users and advertisers are attracted/compelled to join them) is that they might use that dominance to commercial advantage, favouring advertisers, businesses or services that are most profitable or disadvantaging competitors and the less-profitable users.</p><p>The government has agreed to an ACCC recommendation that a digital platforms branch should be created within the commission to examine the competition and consumer protection issues raised by the big digital platforms, providing funding of $27 million over four years.</p><p>\"Data sovereignty\" is the catch-phrase being used to describe the global pushback against the commercialisation of individuals' data without proper informed consent. Generally, users of the platforms aren't aware of how much of their data is being collected and being shared for profit with third parties.</p><p>Nor, given that the algorithms used by the platforms, can businesses be certain they aren't being discriminated against or placed at a competitive disadvantage against the vertically-integrated platforms' own services or those of its business partners. The proposed digital platforms branch will be charged with monitoring, investigating and policing those kinds of issues.</p><p>The use of voluntary codes, in the first instance at least, to rebalance the relationship between the traditional news media and the digital platforms and to address fake news illustrates how complex and difficult to legislate those issues are.</p><p>The platforms have decimated traditional media's revenue bases and, by also cherry-picking their content and fragmenting their audiences, are eroding the foundations of conventional news media.</p><p>They also, however, deliver audiences and some revenue to traditional media, which makes the relationship somewhat more complicated than simply one of predator and prey.</p><p>The code, as the ACCC envisages it, will involve more sharing of the platform's data with media companies; earlier notification of changes to the way it ranks and displays content and fairer negotiations over the sharing of revenue, or compensation payments, for profiting from media content.</p><p>In opting for codes over legislation, the ACCC and government would be very aware that, separate to the complexity of the relationships, trying to enforce an Australian legal regime - when the companies concerned have, relative to their operations elsewhere, only modest interests in this market - might be problematic.</p><p>The ACCC also recommended amendments to competition laws that, among less controversial items, would enable it to consider whether a proposed merger would remove a \"potential competitor\".</p><p>That would significantly extend the ACCC's merger powers and significantly lower the threshold for a successful commission action to stop an acquisition.</p><p>It isn't surprising the ACCC would seek to use the inquiry to try to increase its power and reach.

There is, therefore, going to be intense offshore interest in the Morrison government's approach to regulating in the digital age.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government's action plan was set out on Thursday in its response to the final report of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) digital platforms inquiry that was tabled in July.</p><p>That 623-page report, with its 23 recommendations, is regarded as the broadest and most comprehensive investigation of the digital behemoths ever undertaken. That explains the worldwide interest in developments in a market that is almost insignificant to the technology companies that dominate the digital environment.</p><p>The competition regulator's brief, and its recommendations, covered issues including reforms to traditional competition law, data privacy, the relationship between the big tech companies and traditional media, fake news, copyright enforcement and unfair trading practices.</p><p>Internationally, the big regulatory issues (tax is being dealt with as a separate and equally vexatious issue) have been data privacy, the impact of the tech companies on traditional media and the way the companies exploit their dominance.</p><p>The government supports, in principle, the ACCC recommendations that would strengthen digital privacy rights, giving consumers a greater ability to understand the nature of the personal data the companies are collecting from them and how it is being used before they consent to their data being exploited.</p><p>It supports, again in principle, the development of a voluntary code of conduct in response to the imbalance of bargaining power between digital platforms and news media businesses, with the threat of a mandatory code if the parties can't reach agreement.</p><p>It has also endorsed a recommendation that media regulation should be reformed to produce a platform-neutral regulatory framework.</p><p>In a response to the prevalence of \"fake news\" on social media platforms, it will ask them to develop voluntary codes of conduct for \"disinformation and news quality\", with a threat that there will be stronger action taken if the companies don't produce satisfactory responses.</p><p>A concern about the dominance that network effects provide companies such as Google and Facebook (the more users they have the more users and advertisers are attracted/compelled to join them) is that they might use that dominance to commercial advantage, favouring advertisers, businesses or services that are most profitable or disadvantaging competitors and the less-profitable users.</p><p>The government has agreed to an ACCC recommendation that a digital platforms branch should be created within the commission to examine the competition and consumer protection issues raised by the big digital platforms, providing funding of $27 million over four years.</p><p>\"Data sovereignty\" is the catch-phrase being used to describe the global pushback against the commercialisation of individuals' data without proper informed consent. Generally, users of the platforms aren't aware of how much of their data is being collected and being shared for profit with third parties.</p><p>Nor, given that the algorithms used by the platforms, can businesses be certain they aren't being discriminated against or placed at a competitive disadvantage against the vertically-integrated platforms' own services or those of its business partners. The proposed digital platforms branch will be charged with monitoring, investigating and policing those kinds of issues.</p><p>The use of voluntary codes, in the first instance at least, to rebalance the relationship between the traditional news media and the digital platforms and to address fake news illustrates how complex and difficult to legislate those issues are.</p><p>The platforms have decimated traditional media's revenue bases and, by also cherry-picking their content and fragmenting their audiences, are eroding the foundations of conventional news media.</p><p>They also, however, deliver audiences and some revenue to traditional media, which makes the relationship somewhat more complicated than simply one of predator and prey.</p><p>The code, as the ACCC envisages it, will involve more sharing of the platform's data with media companies; earlier notification of changes to the way it ranks and displays content and fairer negotiations over the sharing of revenue, or compensation payments, for profiting from media content.</p><p>In opting for codes over legislation, the ACCC and government would be very aware that, separate to the complexity of the relationships, trying to enforce an Australian legal regime - when the companies concerned have, relative to their operations elsewhere, only modest interests in this market - might be problematic.</p><p>The ACCC also recommended amendments to competition laws that, among less controversial items, would enable it to consider whether a proposed merger would remove a \"potential competitor\".</p><p>That would significantly extend the ACCC's merger powers and significantly lower the threshold for a successful commission action to stop an acquisition.</p><p>It isn't surprising the ACCC would seek to use the inquiry to try to increase its power and reach. It has a history of arguing for more power and the extension sought is consistent with its attempts to use hypothetical markets and competitors when it opposes mergers.</p><p>The government, recognising that the legislation the commission is seeking would apply, not just to digital platforms but all businesses, noted that courts could already consider these matters while committing to a broad consultation process next year on the proposed amendments to merger laws.</p><p>That's a consultation big non-digital businesses will take seriously and with some trepidation, as they should, given that they lost the debate when the ACCC successfully lobbied for the controversial introduction of an \"effects'' test for misuse of market power cases.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520217531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR0-77M1-JBJ7-N4FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1002\"/><timeReceived>02:31 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

That explains the worldwide interest in developments in a market that is almost insignificant to the technology companies that dominate the digital environment.</p><p>The competition regulator's brief, and its recommendations, covered issues including reforms to traditional competition law, data privacy, the relationship between the big tech companies and traditional media, fake news, copyright enforcement and unfair trading practices.</p><p>Internationally, the big regulatory issues (tax is being dealt with as a separate and equally vexatious issue) have been data privacy, the impact of the tech companies on traditional media and the way the companies exploit their dominance.</p><p>The government supports, in principle, the ACCC recommendations that would strengthen digital privacy rights, giving consumers a greater ability to understand the nature of the personal data the companies are collecting from them and how it is being used before they consent to their data being exploited.</p><p>It supports, again in principle, the development of a voluntary code of conduct in response to the imbalance of bargaining power between digital platforms and news media businesses, with the threat of a mandatory code if the parties can't reach agreement.</p><p>It has also endorsed a recommendation that media regulation should be reformed to produce a platform-neutral regulatory framework.</p><p>In a response to the prevalence of \"fake news\" on social media platforms, it will ask them to develop voluntary codes of conduct for \"disinformation and news quality\", with a threat that there will be stronger action taken if the companies don't produce satisfactory responses.</p><p>A concern about the dominance that network effects provide companies such as Google and Facebook (the more users they have the more users and advertisers are attracted/compelled to join them) is that they might use that dominance to commercial advantage, favouring advertisers, businesses or services that are most profitable or disadvantaging competitors and the less-profitable users.</p><p>The government has agreed to an ACCC recommendation that a digital platforms branch should be created within the commission to examine the competition and consumer protection issues raised by the big digital platforms, providing funding of $27 million over four years.</p><p>\"Data sovereignty\" is the catch-phrase being used to describe the global pushback against the commercialisation of individuals' data without proper informed consent. Generally, users of the platforms aren't aware of how much of their data is being collected and being shared for profit with third parties.</p><p>Nor, given that the algorithms used by the platforms, can businesses be certain they aren't being discriminated against or placed at a competitive disadvantage against the vertically-integrated platforms' own services or those of its business partners. The proposed digital platforms branch will be charged with monitoring, investigating and policing those kinds of issues.</p><p>The use of voluntary codes, in the first instance at least, to rebalance the relationship between the traditional news media and the digital platforms and to address fake news illustrates how complex and difficult to legislate those issues are.</p><p>The platforms have decimated traditional media's revenue bases and, by also cherry-picking their content and fragmenting their audiences, are eroding the foundations of conventional news media.</p><p>They also, however, deliver audiences and some revenue to traditional media, which makes the relationship somewhat more complicated than simply one of predator and prey.</p><p>The code, as the ACCC envisages it, will involve more sharing of the platform's data with media companies; earlier notification of changes to the way it ranks and displays content and fairer negotiations over the sharing of revenue, or compensation payments, for profiting from media content.</p><p>In opting for codes over legislation, the ACCC and government would be very aware that, separate to the complexity of the relationships, trying to enforce an Australian legal regime - when the companies concerned have, relative to their operations elsewhere, only modest interests in this market - might be problematic.</p><p>The ACCC also recommended amendments to competition laws that, among less controversial items, would enable it to consider whether a proposed merger would remove a \"potential competitor\".</p><p>That would significantly extend the ACCC's merger powers and significantly lower the threshold for a successful commission action to stop an acquisition.</p><p>It isn't surprising the ACCC would seek to use the inquiry to try to increase its power and reach. It has a history of arguing for more power and the extension sought is consistent with its attempts to use hypothetical markets and competitors when it opposes mergers.</p><p>The government, recognising that the legislation the commission is seeking would apply, not just to digital platforms but all businesses, noted that courts could already consider these matters while committing to a broad consultation process next year on the proposed amendments to merger laws.</p><p>That's a consultation big non-digital businesses will take seriously and with some trepidation, as they should, given that they lost the debate when the ACCC successfully lobbied for the controversial introduction of an \"effects\" test for misuse of market power cases.</p><p>'The government supports, in principle, the ACCC recommendations that would strengthen digital privacy rights.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc78dc1pfu6rp14lylt9gr</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR1-W381-JD34-V019-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

That explains the worldwide interest in developments in a market that is almost insignificant to the technology companies that dominate the digital environment.</p><p>The competition regulator's brief, and its recommendations, covered issues including reforms to traditional competition law, data privacy, the relationship between the big tech companies and traditional media, fake news, copyright enforcement and unfair trading practices.</p><p>Internationally, the big regulatory issues (tax is being dealt with as a separate and equally vexatious issue) have been data privacy, the impact of the tech companies on traditional media and the way the companies exploit their dominance.</p><p>The government supports, in principle, the ACCC recommendations that would strengthen digital privacy rights, giving consumers a greater ability to understand the nature of the personal data the companies are collecting from them and how it is being used before they consent to their data being exploited.</p><p>It supports, again in principle, the development of a voluntary code of conduct in response to the imbalance of bargaining power between digital platforms and news media businesses, with the threat of a mandatory code if the parties can't reach agreement.</p><p>It has also endorsed a recommendation that media regulation should be reformed to produce a platform-neutral regulatory framework.</p><p>In a response to the prevalence of \"fake news\" on social media platforms, it will ask them to develop voluntary codes of conduct for \"disinformation and news quality\", with a threat that there will be stronger action taken if the companies don't produce satisfactory responses.</p><p>A concern about the dominance that network effects provide companies such as Google and Facebook (the more users they have the more users and advertisers are attracted/compelled to join them) is that they might use that dominance to commercial advantage, favouring advertisers, businesses or services that are most profitable or disadvantaging competitors and the less-profitable users.</p><p>The government has agreed to an ACCC recommendation that a digital platforms branch should be created within the commission to examine the competition and consumer protection issues raised by the big digital platforms, providing funding of $27 million over four years.</p><p>\"Data sovereignty\" is the catch-phrase being used to describe the global pushback against the commercialisation of individuals' data without proper informed consent. Generally, users of the platforms aren't aware of how much of their data is being collected and being shared for profit with third parties.</p><p>Nor, given that the algorithms used by the platforms, can businesses be certain they aren't being discriminated against or placed at a competitive disadvantage against the vertically-integrated platforms' own services or those of its business partners. The proposed digital platforms branch will be charged with monitoring, investigating and policing those kinds of issues.</p><p>The use of voluntary codes, in the first instance at least, to rebalance the relationship between the traditional news media and the digital platforms and to address fake news illustrates how complex and difficult to legislate those issues are.</p><p>The platforms have decimated traditional media's revenue bases and, by also cherry-picking their content and fragmenting their audiences, are eroding the foundations of conventional news media.</p><p>They also, however, deliver audiences and some revenue to traditional media, which makes the relationship somewhat more complicated than simply one of predator and prey.</p><p>The code, as the ACCC envisages it, will involve more sharing of the platform's data with media companies; earlier notification of changes to the way it ranks and displays content and fairer negotiations over the sharing of revenue, or compensation payments, for profiting from media content.</p><p>In opting for codes over legislation, the ACCC and government would be very aware that, separate to the complexity of the relationships, trying to enforce an Australian legal regime - when the companies concerned have, relative to their operations elsewhere, only modest interests in this market - might be problematic.</p><p>The ACCC also recommended amendments to competition laws that, among less controversial items, would enable it to consider whether a proposed merger would remove a \"potential competitor\".</p><p>That would significantly extend the ACCC's merger powers and significantly lower the threshold for a successful commission action to stop an acquisition.</p><p>It isn't surprising the ACCC would seek to use the inquiry to try to increase its power and reach. It has a history of arguing for more power and the extension sought is consistent with its attempts to use hypothetical markets and competitors when it opposes mergers.</p><p>The government, recognising that the legislation the commission is seeking would apply, not just to digital platforms but all businesses, noted that courts could already consider these matters while committing to a broad consultation process next year on the proposed amendments to merger laws.</p><p>That's a consultation big non-digital businesses will take seriously and with some trepidation, as they should, given that they lost the debate when the ACCC successfully lobbied for the controversial introduction of an \"effects\" test for misuse of market power cases.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc78dc3yk6rfk1461fjly0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR1-W381-JD34-V08H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1002\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

It is great to see Australia establishing a comprehensive record upon which to evaluate exactly what's happening.\" Google and Facebook have engaged in a more dynamic dialogue with publishers over the past year about what can be done to help news organisations entice more paying customers.</p><p>Google, for example, last year ended \"First Click Free\" under chief executive Sundar Pichai following a campaign by News Corp chief Robert Thomson. The demise of the policy, which enabled users of Google's search engine to bypass paywalls on news websites, has helped publishers boost subscriptions.</p><p>For publishers, however, serious concerns persist about Google and Facebook's opaque business practices as well as their sudden ability to change the terms of engagement without any prior warning.</p><p>The Australian has learnt that Google late last year quietly expanded the snippets in search results under its influential News vertical to 320 characters from 165. It appears the change, which will undoubtedly impact click-through rates on articles because of Google's 95 per share of the Australian search market, was not communicated to publishers with many finding out about the move after the fact.</p><p>Asked whether Google considered the impact on publishers, a spokesman would only say: \"The character limit is not fixed and from time to time we do test different character limits to better understand user behaviour.\" More recently Google announced its Chrome browser will block certain types of online advertisements, a change Google promoted as part of an effort to rid the internet of spammy ads like pop-ups to make it more user-friendly.</p><p>But publishers have criticised Google's move as self-serving, pointing out that the company exerted too much influence on the process that selected which ad types to block.</p><p>The suspicion is that Google is attempting to steer more advertisers to its own sites and products, which are less likely to be blocked by the Chrome browser. The browser is used by more than 59 per cent of internet users.</p><p>This is entirely consistent with the way in which Google and Facebook abuse their power in search and social media against publishers.</p><p>Google's ad tech is ubiquitous. It owns the dominant product to buy, place and serve ads across the entire web.</p><p>From ad server DoubleClick, supply-side platform AdMeld and ad networks including AdSense, Google Display Network as well as AdMob to demand-side platform Bid Manager and ad server Campaign Manager, Google owns the technology at nearly every point in the pipeline.</p><p>Not only does Google sell search ads, it sells the ad tech that is used to sell ads. But few internet users realise that the majority of ads they see online pass through one of Google's products.</p><p>Nearly two years ago Google launched the Accelerated Mobile Pages project, or AMP, with great fanfare.</p><p>The idea was to make the mobile web pages of news publishers who use the product's code load much faster when users search for news on Google.</p><p>Google positioned AMP as a boon for publishers, but the reality is very different. It has since emerged that Google has directed more traffic to those AMP pages and less to publishers' full mobile websites.</p><p>For some publishers that is a problem as their AMP pages do not generate advertising revenue at the same rate as their full mobile sites because of limitations related to the types of ad units Google will allow.</p><p>It's a similar dynamic to the strategy Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg employs to dominate social media. When Facebook's Instant Articles service was launched there was no way for publishers to publish links to their homepages.</p><p>Clicking the publisher's name took users to the publisher's Facebook page, with Instant Articles hosted on Facebook's servers so it could collect personal data.The good news is that Australia's competition regulator can begin to address this problem with its inquiry into the digital media market following months of lobbying by Google Australia boss Jason Pellegrino and local Facebook managing director Will Easton.

It is great to see Australia establishing a comprehensive record upon which to evaluate exactly what's happening.\" Google and Facebook have engaged in a more dynamic dialogue with publishers over the past year about what can be done to help news organisations entice more paying customers.</p><p>Google, for example, last year ended \"First Click Free\" under chief executive Sundar Pichai following a campaign by News Corp chief Robert Thomson. The demise of the policy, which enabled users of Google's search engine to bypass paywalls on news websites, has helped publishers boost subscriptions.</p><p>For publishers, however, serious concerns persist about Google and Facebook's opaque business practices as well as their sudden ability to change the terms of engagement without any prior warning.</p><p>The Australian has learnt that Google late last year quietly expanded the snippets in search results under its influential News vertical to 320 characters from 165. It appears the change, which will undoubtedly impact click-through rates on articles because of Google's 95 per share of the Australian search market, was not communicated to publishers with many finding out about the move after the fact.</p><p>Asked whether Google considered the impact on publishers, a spokesman would only say: \"The character limit is not fixed and from time to time we do test different character limits to better understand user behaviour.\" More recently Google announced its Chrome browser will block certain types of online advertisements, a change Google promoted as part of an effort to rid the internet of spammy ads like pop-ups to make it more user-friendly.</p><p>But publishers have criticised Google's move as self-serving, pointing out that the company exerted too much influence on the process that selected which ad types to block.</p><p>The suspicion is that Google is attempting to steer more advertisers to its own sites and products, which are less likely to be blocked by the Chrome browser. The browser is used by more than 59 per cent of internet users.</p><p>This is entirely consistent with the way in which Google and Facebook abuse their power in search and social media against publishers.</p><p>Google's ad tech is ubiquitous. It owns the dominant product to buy, place and serve ads across the entire web.</p><p>From ad server DoubleClick, supply-side platform AdMeld and ad networks including AdSense, Google Display Network as well as AdMob to demand-side platform Bid Manager and ad server Campaign Manager, Google owns the technology at nearly every point in the pipeline.</p><p>Not only does Google sell search ads, it sells the ad tech that is used to sell ads. But few internet users realise that the majority of ads they see online pass through one of Google's products.</p><p>Nearly two years ago Google launched the Accelerated Mobile Pages project, or AMP, with great fanfare.</p><p>The idea was to make the mobile web pages of news publishers who use the product's code load much faster when users search for news on Google.</p><p>Google positioned AMP as a boon for publishers, but the reality is very different. It has since emerged that Google has directed more traffic to those AMP pages and less to publishers' full mobile websites.</p><p>For some publishers that is a problem as their AMP pages do not generate advertising revenue at the same rate as their full mobile sites because of limitations related to the types of ad units Google will allow.</p><p>It's a similar dynamic to the strategy Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg employs to dominate social media. When Facebook's Instant Articles service was launched there was no way for publishers to publish links to their homepages.</p><p>Clicking the publisher's name took users to the publisher's Facebook page, with Instant Articles hosted on Facebook's servers so it could collect personal data.The good news is that Australia's competition regulator can begin to address this problem with its inquiry into the digital media market following months of lobbying by Google Australia boss Jason Pellegrino and local Facebook managing director Will Easton. A 39-page issues paper set to be released later today by the ACCC and obtained by The Australian notes that: \"The use of large sets of personal data for commercial purposes raises competition concerns, as well as broader policy issues.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20180226Australian25000361048620</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRC-KNP1-JD3N-51H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 26, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NWS (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The DOJ is leading the investigations into Google and Apple, while the Federal Trade Commission scrutinizes Facebook (which it previously fined $5 billion for consumer protection violations related to data privacy) and Amazon. In addition to these investigations, the FTC has ramped up its focus on the technology sector by establishing a dedicated Technology Enforcement Division.</p><p>The federal agencies are not alone: the US House of Representatives' Antitrust Subcommittee is investigating the same four companies in parallel, with Democratic committee chair David Cicilline hiring vocal critics of big tech (including Lina Khan, author of a prominent academic article calling for antitrust enforcement against Amazon) to assist with the investigation. On the US Senate side, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who launched an investigation of Google while Missouri Attorney General, is among the loudest voices calling for investigation. State attorneys general hailing from both political parties have launched probes of their own, with Texas' Republican AG Ken Paxton and New York's Democratic AG Letitia James leading the way for dozens of states.</p><p>The state-level investigations are understood to focus primarily on the tech platforms' advertising businesses, while federal investigations appear to be reviewing both conduct and certain prior transactions (such as Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp).</p><p>The state tech investigations are part of a broader trend toward more antitrust enforcement, which is perhaps best exemplified by the unprecedented challenge to the proposed T-Mobile and Sprint merger. There, 14 states brought a case, which went to trial in December 2019, to block the merger despite DOJ and FCC approval of the deal.</p><p>Aggressive Proposals From Democratic Enforcers and Presidential Candidates</p><p>Antitrust has taken center stage in the political arena, with Democrats leading a charge for stronger enforcement. Democratic 2020 presidential candidates in particular have outlined tough stances on merger enforcement and even called for the breakup of large companies. Elizabeth Warren is rumored to be considering a proposal that would bar companies with $40 billion in annual revenue from engaging in M&amp;A.</p><p>While Warren and other candidates' proposals are far from becoming law, they are not alone in calling for more enforcement. The two minority Democratic FTC commissioners have authored a number of sharp dissents calling for more aggressive enforcement in actions, and the majority Republican commissioners agreed to more modest measures.</p><p>As an example, when a Republican majority required divestiture of a psoriasis treatment drug to approve the merger of pharmaceutical giants Bristol-Meyers Squibb and Celgene, both Democrats dissented. Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter lamented high drug prices and called for a broader framework that would go beyond assessing product overlaps to \"consider whether any pharmaceutical merger is likely to exacerbate anticompetitive conduct by the merged firm or to hinder innovation.\" Commissioner Rohit Chopra likewise advocated a broad-ranging approach that would consider whether a merger will \"facilitate a capital structure that magnifies incentives to engage in anticompetitive conduct or abuse of intellectual property\" or \"deter formation of biotechnology firms that fuel much of the industry's innovation.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p>See FTC Requires Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Celgene Corporation to Divest Psoriasis Drug Otezla as a Condition of Acquisition (November 2019), available here.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Increased Scrutiny of DOJ Settlements</p><p>Pursuant to a 1974 statute known as the Tunney Act, DOJ antitrust consent decrees must be filed in federal court and determined to be in the public interest by a judge following a 60-day public comment period. Historically, Tunney Act procedures have been a formality, and merger parties have routinely closed their transactions while the judicial determination is pending, with DOJ's blessing. But at least one federal judge has recently sought to reinvigorate the review process.</p><p>In October 2018, the DOJ reached a divestiture settlement with CVS and Aetna to approve their $69 billion merger. District of Columbia District Court Judge Richard Leon harshly criticized the parties and the DOJ for allowing the transaction to close before his public interest determination and questioned the adequacy of the settlement. Judge Leon held evidentiary hearings with live testimony from witnesses opposed to the transaction, a step never before taken in a Tunney Act review of a merger settlement. The witnesses were allowed to testify to a wide range of concerns, over DOJ's objection that the Tunney Act authorized the court to evaluate only the adequacy of the consent decree to remedy the specific harms DOJ had alleged.</p><p>Ultimately, Judge Leon found the decree to be in the public interest and approved it without alterationsthough not until nearly a year after the consent decree was filed. It remains to be seen whether other judges will follow Judge Leon's lead or require material changes to settlements negotiated by the DOJ and merging parties, but if they do, the shift could significantly delay closing of DOJ-reviewed mergers with settlements.</p><p>Board Takeaways</p><p>These developments all show that antitrust enforcement un the US is alive and well. Importantly, historical practices cannot be counted on, given the new enforcers (State AGs) coming into play and the changes to once-rote procedures (consent decree approvals). While the focus on tech enforcement is rightly attracting headlines, boards in all industries should be aware of these changes, too.</p><p>ANTITRUST IN EUROPE</p><p>Following on 2019 as another active year for antitrust enforcement in Europe, all signs point to continued vigorous enforcement in 2020.</p><p>A New Commission</p><p>The new European Commission, headed by President Ursula von der Leyen, took office on December 1, 2019. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager (having been nominated for a second consecutive term on September 10, 2019) not only resumed her role as Competition Commissioner, but President von der Leyen also appointed Ms. Vestager one of her three Executive Vice Presidents, in which capacity Ms. Vestager will now also be responsible for helping make \"Europe Fit for a Digital Age\" (as described below). Ms. Vestager will serve in both positions for the Commission's five-year term.</p><p>Notwithstanding Ms. Vestager's reputation as a tough enforcer of EU competition law after her first five years in office, President von der Leyen has said she expects Ms. Vestager to further strengthen the Commission's enforcement efforts over the next five years. Her mission letter to Ms. Vestager noted that this should include the Directorate General for Competition improving case detection, speeding up investigations and facilitating cooperation with and between other (European National and non-European) competition authorities.</p><p>President von der Leyen also encouraged Ms. Vestager to actively use sector inquiries into new and emerging markets that are shaping European economies and society. She asked that Ms. Vestager develop tools and policies to better tackle the distortive effects of foreign state ownership and subsidies in the EU internal market. She stressed the importance of a level playing field that provides businesses with the incentive to invest, innovate and grow and noted that EU state aid rules should support such a level playing field where market failures have created distortions.</p><p>In her role as Executive Vice President, Ms. Vestager will set the strategic direction of and chair the Commissioners' Group on a Europe Fit for the Digital Age. As President von der Leyen outlined, this role will include:</p><p> Developing and implementing a long-term strategy for Europe's industrial future that maximizes investment in research and development.Working on a new SME strategy focused on supporting small businesses, entrepreneurs and startups by reducing regulatory burdens and enabling them to make the most of digitization.Coordinating the European approach to artificial intelligence, including its human and ethical implications.Coordinating a European strategy on data, including examining how Europe can use and share non-personalized big data to develop new technologies and business models that create wealth for European societies and businesses.Coordinating the work on upgrading liability and safety rules for digital platforms, services and products as part of a new Digital Services Act.Coordinating the work on digital taxation.</p><p>Ms. Vestager will be supported as Competition Commissioner by the Directorate General for Competition and new Director General Olivier Guersent. While Mr. Guersent started his career at the Commission in 1992 as part of DG Competition's Merger Task Force, he has served in a variety of roles at the Commission since then, including most recently as Director General of the Directorate on Financial Stability, Financial Services, and the Capital Markets Union. Cecilio Madero Villarejo is now Deputy Director General for Mergers, Kris Dekeyser Deputy Director General for Antitrust, and Carles Esteva Mosso Deputy Director General for State Aid. The Commission's Secretariat General will support Ms. Vestager in her role as coordinator of the digital portfolio.</p><p>Merger Control</p><p>The Commission's efforts to strengthen competition enforcement will likely mean an extension of the recent trend toward longer and more document-heavy pre-notification \"investigations\" in merger control cases generally, more in-depth (Phase II) merger reviews, and more blocked mergers. In 2019, high-profile mergers prohibited by the Commission included the Wieland/Aurubis/Schwermetall, Siemens/Alstom, and Tata Steel/Thyssen Krupp transactions.</p><p>It will also mean continued aggressive enforcement of the Commission's gun-jumping rules (similar to its investigation of, and 28 million fine imposed on, Canon in June 2019 for partially implementing its acquisition of Toshiba Medical Systems without merger control approval) and stiff sanctions on parties that fail to provide accurate and complete information as part of the merger control process (just as the Commission fined General Electric 52 million for providing incorrect information during the Commission's investigation of its takeover of LM Wind in April 2019).</p><p>Cartels</p><p>With respect to cartel enforcement, boards should continue to expect vigorous activity on the Commission's part. Until recently, the Commission has enjoyed a full pipeline of cartel cases generated by successive immunity and leniency applications, in particular in the automotive and financial sectors.</p><p>While there are signs that the continued growth in private damages actions in Europe may have dampened the appetite for potential immunity applicants to come forward and limited the number of immunity applications received by the Commission, the Commission has instead focused on and brought investigations in areas outside the conventional \"seller\" cartel context. It has several ongoing cases aimed at potential coordination between buyers on industrial pricing benchmarks and on the development of clean emission technology for cars. Indeed, in November 2019, the Commission opened an investigation into a possible purchasing cartel among two larger French retailers Casino and Intermarche.</p><p>Abuse of Dominance</p><p>Boards should also expect continued tough enforcement of European abuse of dominance rules, including, when necessary, the use of interim measures to prevent imminent harm. 2019 saw a range of abuse investigations initiated and concluded. In June 2019, the Commission issued a Statement of Objections against Broadcom alleging its abuse of a dominant position in the markets for \"systems on a chip\" for TV set-top boxes and modems. Fearing imminent \"irreparable harm to competition,\" the Commission then took the unusual step of imposing interim measures on Broadcom in October 2019, forcing Broadcom to cease applying provisions that the Commission views as anticompetitive in contracts with six of Broadcom's main customers.</p><p>The Commission also opened an investigation in July 2019 into Amazon's potential misuse of sensitive data from independent retailers that sell on its marketplace. Also in 2019, the Commission fined Qualcomm 242 million for abusing its alleged dominance in 3G baseband chipsets by engaging in predatory pricing with a view to forcing its competitor, Icera, out of the market, and it fined Google 1.49 billion for the misuse of its alleged dominant position in the market for the brokering of online search adverts.</p><p>Impact on Antitrust Enforcement</p><p>With a strong and experienced team behind Ms. Vestager and a clear mandate from President von der Leyen, boards of directors should fully expect a further strengthening of effective antitrust enforcement by the European Commission in the years to come. This will be true particularly in new and developing markets, and in markets where the Commissioner's role as Competition Commissioner overlaps with her position as the head of the Commission's digital portfolio.</p><p>ANTITRUST IN CHINA</p><p>In 2019, the Chinese antitrust authority prioritized institutional integration, legislation and enforcement in the high-tech, public utilities, automotive, pharmaceutical, construction materials and consumer goods industries. Antitrust litigation in China continued to be active and increasingly involved complicated legal issues, such as standard essential patents and ability to arbitrate antitrust disputes.</p><p>Increasingly Important Role of Local Agencies</p><p>In January 2019, State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) granted a general authorization to its provincial branches (i.e., provincial AMRs) to carry out behavioral investigations in their own provinces, without the need to seek individual authorization from SAMR prior to commencing a new case. This step is believed to be designed to ease staff shortage at central-level SAMR. The 16 out of 17 behavioral investigations closed and published in 2019 were carried out by provincial AMRs.</p><p>The central-level SAMR, apart from handling merger review and high-profile behavioral investigations, has been focusing on unifying enforcement standards, coordinating and supervising provincial AMRs and training investigative forces.</p><p>New Implementation Rules and Guidance to Unify Antitrust Enforcement</p><p>SAMR issued a series of new implementation rules, including three interim implementation rules on antitrust investigations of restrictive agreements, abuse of dominance, and abuse of administrative power, as well as rules and guidelines that cover subjects such as handling of complaints, whistleblower rewards and competition compliance programs. These rules unified and provided more clarification on antitrust enforcement proceedings in China.</p><p>SAMR specifically clarified that antitrust fines for restrictive agreements and abuse of dominance (i.e., 1-10% of revenues in the preceding year) should be calculated based on the total revenues of the company infringing the law, instead of the revenues generated from the sales of the relevant products related to the infringement. SAMR also clarified that illegal gains should be confiscated whenever possible. Noting that in previous cases antitrust fines were sometimes calculated based on revenues of the relevant products and that confiscation of illegal gains did not often occur, we expect this new guidance to increase the antitrust monetary liability for offending companies.</p><p>In addition, SAMR has been accelerating the work to amend China's 11-year-old Anti-Monopoly Law (AML). Proposed amendments to the AML were published for public comment on January 2, 2020. Of special note, the proposed amendments address the possible criminalization of antitrust violations and possible involvement of the public security authority in antitrust investigations.</p><p>Targeted Behaviors and Industrial Sectors in Behavioral Investigations</p><p>Antitrust investigations focused on three types of anticompetitive behaviors in 2019, including cartel (eight cases), abuse of dominance (five cases) and resale price maintenance (four cases). For example, Shanghai AMR penalized the Chinese subsidiary of an US chemical company, Eastman Chemical, for engaging in exclusive dealing through multiple commercial arrangements (including minimum purchase requirements, take-or-pay clauses, most-favored-nation clauses, and other rebates) that aimed to lock in a significant portion (more than 75%) of customers' demand.</p><p>The public utilities, automotive, pharmaceutical, construction materials and consumer goods industries attracted the most attention of the antitrust authority in 2019. Among them, construction materials was probably the sector receiving the most intensive antitrust scrutiny, with four price-fixing cartels and one abuse of dominance case closed by provincial AMRs.</p><p>Merger Control Review Timeline and Revival of \"Hold-Separate\" Remedy</p><p>SAMR reviewed and closed 433 merger cases from January to December 29, 2019, of which 428 transactions were unconditionally approved, five were approved with conditions, and none were prohibited. About 78% of the approved merger cases were reviewed under the simplified procedure, most of which were cleared within 30 days after the formal review was started. The review timeline for cases not subject to the simplified procedure was, however, less predictable and varied significantly, which may increasingly be the case if the AML's recently proposed \"stop the review clock\" mechanism is adopted. The average review time for the five conditionally approved cases was almost 400 days after filing.</p><p>In reviewing complex merger cases, SAMR has continued to be receptive to behavioral remedies and unconventional remedies. All of the five conditional clearances in 2019 involved behavioral remedies, and three of them (Cargotec/TTS Group, II-VI/Finisar, and Royal DSM/Garden Bio-Chem) revived the \"long-term hold-separate\" remedy. The long-term hold-separate remedy has been one of China's most controversial antitrust enforcement practices as it prevents the transacting parties from realizing the expected efficiencies and synergies of the transaction and intrudes into the parties' daily business operations due to the expansive oversight authorities granted to the monitoring trustee. Such remedy was imposed in four cases during 2011 and 2013, one in 2017, as well as the three in 2019.</p><p>Another unconventional remedy imposed in 2019 was restriction on supply to downstream competitors. In Novelis/Aleris, SAMR, in addition to requiring a divestiture, also prohibited the parties from supplying in China an upstream input cold-rolled sheets to any downstream aluminum automotive body sheet competitor for 10 years. It is unclear what specific antitrust issue this supply restriction remedy was intended to address as supply continuity to downstream competitors post-transaction would normally be viewed as pro-competitive.</p><p>Judicial Developments</p><p>The Supreme People's Court (SPC), China's highest court, handed down several important rulings in 2019 on interesting antitrust issues:</p><p> Legal test for Retail Price Maintenance (RPM). In Hainan Yutai v. Hainan Price Bureau, the SPC, for the first time, acknowledged different legal tests previously applied by China's antitrust authority and Chinese courts. In short, the SPC confirmed that the Chinese antitrust authority can continue to presume the existence of anticompetitive effect from an RPM agreement unless rebutted by the company (though it still remains to be seen how a company can successfully rebut the illegality presumption), whereas a plaintiff in a civil antitrust litigation will need to prove the anticompetitive effect of an RPM agreement to prevail.Ability to arbitrate antitrust disputes. In Hohhot Huili v. Shell, the SPC ruled that the arbitration clause in a distribution agreement does not exclude the court from reviewing the antitrust disputes between the parties of the agreement. Nevertheless, the ruling did not view antitrust issues as matters that cannot be arbitrated.Litigations involving Standard Essential Patents (SEPs). The latest judgment on the FRAND royalty rate in China was handed down by a Nanjing court in Huawei v. Conversant, which took the \"top-down\" approach instead of the comparable licensing method. As shown in this case, Chinese technology companies that were sued related to SEPs overseas increasingly choose to file parallel lawsuits in China. Other recent examples include Huawei v. InterDigital and Xiaomi v. Sisvel.</p><p>Impact of the Geopolitical Environment</p><p>While there was no prohibition decision or significant delay that resulted from the US-China trade tension in the vast majority of merger cases involving US companies in 2019, there have been consistently strong and widespread complaints from local stakeholders, particularly in the high-tech sector, which have in several cases complicated the review process and led to unconventional remedies that were not intended to address transaction specific antitrust issues. With regard to behavior investigations, we did not see any strong sign showing that US companies were particularly targeted or subject to much more severe antitrust penalty.</p><p>China Antitrust: A New Decade With a New Law</p><p>Antitrust enforcement in China continued to be in the spotlight in 2019, particularly given the geopolitical tensions. In light of the newly proposed amendments to the AML, which are still being discussed but indicate, to some extent, the direction of China's antitrust development, continued imposition of unconventional merger remedies, more unpredictable merger review timetables, highlighted behavioral investigations and increased penalties for non-compliance (including failure to notify, non-compliance with remedies, and non-cooperation with antitrust investigations) appear to be on the horizon for 2020.</p><p> To view original article, please click here.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

In recent years, as overall M&amp;A activity has continued a decade-long climb, antitrust and competition enforcers around the world have continued to scrutinize thousands of transactions for their impact on competition. In a number of cases, this scrutiny resulted in prolonged investigations, closing delays, significant divestiture remedies, litigation, and abandoned deals. Enforcers and legislators in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are considering significant overhauls to their traditional frameworks for evaluating transactions, including those involving nascent competitors and transactions in the tech and pharmaceutical sectors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The potential legislative and policy changes on the horizon, along with the ongoing evolution of enforcement priorities and practices, are relevant across all industries and jurisdictions. Gibson Dunn's 2020 Antitrust Merger Enforcement Update and Outlook addresses a number of important trends and enforcement priorities for firms and companies planning M&amp;A transactions that may raise antitrust or competition law questions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gibson Dunn's Antitrust and Competition Law Practice</p><p>Repeatedly recognized by Chambers and other publications as one of the top antitrust practices in the world, Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher's worldwide Antitrust and Competition Law Practice Group numbers over 150 lawyers located throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. Our antitrust team includes former high-ranking officials from the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"), the U.S. Solicitor General's Office and the European Commission, as well as Fellows of the American College of Trial Lawyers.</p><p>Gibson Dunn's Antitrust and Competition Law Practice Group has extensive experience successfully representing clients in a broad range of industries in antitrust investigations of mergers conducted by enforcement agencies in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions. Gibson Dunn's merger clearance practice draws on its skilled competition lawyers in the United States, Europe and Asia, using its deep experience with enforcement authorities throughout the world.</p><p>Gibson Dunn takes a highly proactive approach to merger clearance and related investigations through early analysis of potential antitrust issues and engagement with regulators to efficiently obtain approval of the largest and most complex transactions. In the past several years, we have successfully assisted clients in securing clearance for transactions in a wide range of industries, including obtaining unconditional clearance for several transactions after second request investigations by the DOJ and the FTC.</p><p>In addition, no law firm has a more distinguished record of success than Gibson Dunn in handling high-stakes antitrust litigation. Our results demonstrate why the largest companies in the world call on us when the stakes are highest and when the path to success is most challenging.</p><p>The United States (DOJ and FTC)</p><p>The DOJ and the FTC continue to be aggressive in enforcing the nation's antitrust laws. The agencies have allocated substantial resources to reviewing mergers in specific sectorsnamely tech and pharmaand have developed new guidelines for vertical mergers.</p><p>State antitrust enforcers also came to the fore in 2019, perhaps most visibly in the pending trial of the states' challenge to T-Mobile's proposed acquisition of Sprint. The states' efforts to litigate this pending merger, despite its approval by the DOJ (subject to divestitures), along with multiple state AG-led antitrust investigations in the tech industry, show that state enforcers' have an increasingly active merger enforcement docket.</p><p>Looking ahead, 2020 is an election year. Although it is far too early to speculate on how the election or its results may impact antitrust enforcement with respect to mergers, the topic of antitrust enforcement and corporate consolidation has been widely discussed on the campaign trail. Major candidates on the Democratic side have advocated strengthening antitrust enforcement. Some have co-sponsored legislation that, if passed into law, may make it far more difficult for certain mergers (particularly large mergers) to win antitrust approval. There have also been bipartisan efforts to investigate antitrust concerns in burgeoning markets, which include more investigations into so-called \"killer acquisitions\" where an alleged dominant firm acquires an upstart competitor.</p><p>Thus, it is safe to predict that the results of the election will influence the direction of antitrust merger enforcement, but how and to what degree remain unclear. Meanwhile, the FTC and the DOJ have been quite active on multiple fronts.</p><p>By the Numbers: HSR Filings Increase with M&amp;A Activity as DOJ Second Request Investigations Fall</p><p>In the wake of the Great Recession of 2008, M&amp;A activity dropped to historically low levels. In fiscal year (\"FY\") 2009, the number of transactions reported to the DOJ and the FTC under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (\"HSR\") Act dropped to less than one-third of the number reported in the fiscal year before the financial crisis began.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p>A \"fiscal year\" or \"FY\" covers the period of October 1 of the prior year through September 30 of the current year. For example, FY 2018 covers October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018. Unless otherwise noted, the figures depicted in this section were derived from the FTC and DOJ Hart-Scott-Rodino Annual Report. Fed. Trade Comm'n, Bureau of Competition, and Dep't of Justice, Antitrust Div., Hart-Scott-Rodino Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2018 (2019), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-bureau-competition-department-justice-antitrust-division-hart-scott-rodino/fy18hsrreport.pdf\">https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-bureau-competition-department-justice-antitrust-division-hart-scott-rodino/fy18hsrreport.pdf</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>In the decade that followed, U.S. economic activity and M&amp;A volume steadily increased year-over-year. HSR filings reached decade-high levels over the past two years, indicating that M&amp;A has fully recovered from the financial crisis.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>Estimate of FY 2019 HSR filings based on public FTC early termination data.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>But what about the level of antitrust scrutiny? Changes in the percentage of second requests issued can serve as one proxy for the intensity of federal merger enforcement. Because they require substantial investigative resources, second requests are typically reserved for transactions that, in the agencies' view, raise serious competition concerns.</p><p>On that score, the rate of second request investigations of HSR-reportable transactions has fallen since FY 2016. The percentage of HSR-reportable transactions subject to a second request declined to 2.2% in FY 2018, marking the second year in a row the second request rate fell under 3%. By comparison, the agencies' second request rate averaged approximately 3.5% during the prior eight years (FY 2009 through FY 2016), and a full percentage point below the annual rate since 2002 (3.2%).</p><p>The decline is significant. Had the second request rate matched the 3.5% average in prior years, the DOJ and the FTC would have issued 74 second requests in FY 2018that would have meant 29 (or 39%) more second requests than they actually issued (45).</p><p>There has been a particularly large decline in the rate of DOJ second requests. DOJ-issued second requests represented only 0.9% of all HSR-reportable transactions in FY 2017 and FY 2018, half the DOJ's average rate over the prior eight fiscal years (1.8%).</p><p>Similarly, although M&amp;A activity has increased significantly in recent years, merger challenges have remained relatively flat. Challenges involve instances in which the agencies file a complaint in court claiming a transaction violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act, resulting in a trial, settlement, or abandonment of the deal. The number of challenges in each of the past two reported fiscal years (41 and 39, respectively) is in line with the average number of challenges per year (approximately 41) the prior eight years.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>These figures include challenged transactions that were not HSR-reportable.</p></bodyText></footnote> HSR filings, however, have increased by 15%. Thus, the agencies' challenges have not increased at the same clip as reportable M&amp;A activity.</p><p>To be sure, these figures are not the final word on whether antitrust scrutiny of mergers has increased or decreased, or whether a merger is more likely to receive scrutiny today than it was several years ago, or a year from now. The analysis of whether any particular merger is likely to harm competition is a fact-intensive exercise and outcomes will vary from case to case. In the aggregate, however, these figures show (i) the percentage of HSR-reportable deals that result in a second request has declined in recent years, (ii) the decline in the second request rate is particularly pronounced for the DOJ, and (iii) the number of mergers challenged by the agencies has not increased in recent years despite a marked increase in HSR-reportable M&amp;A activity.</p><p>Congress Weighs in on Merger Enforcement</p><p>Congressional interest in antitrust enforcement and reform has been high this past year, likely in anticipation of the 2020 primaries and presidential election.</p><p>Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed legislation that would transform merger enforcement. The bill's most notable provisions would effectively ban \"mega-mergers\"that is, mergers where either company has annual revenue of at least $40 billion; each company has annual revenue of at least $15 billion; the merged company would have more than 45% of relevant market share as a seller or more than 25% as a buyer; or where the deal would result in there being fewer than four remaining competitors with at least a 10% market share. Other presidential candidates have also put forward proposed reforms to agency merger review. Senator Amy Klobuchar has twice introduced legislation that would make it more difficult to obtain antitrust approval for contested mergers.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote4\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p>Press Release, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Klobuchar Introduces Legislation to Modernize Antitrust Enforcement and Promote Competition (Feb. 1, 2019), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/2/klobuchar-introduces-legislation-to-modernize-antitrust-enforcement-and-promote-competition\">https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/2/klobuchar-introduces-legislation-to-modernize-antitrust-enforcement-and-promote-competition</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Both bills would shift the burden of proof to defendants in large mergers to prove that their transaction is not anticompetitive and would prohibit the FTC from accepting remedies to address antitrust violations.</p><p>Although these bills have little chance of becoming law this year, depending on the results of upcoming elections, they signal attempts to fundamentally change antitrust enforcement when it comes to M&amp;A transactions. These efforts could gain traction under a new administration. And given the bipartisan interest in antitrust enforcement and corporate consolidation generally, congressional interest in antitrust is unlikely to abate anytime soon.</p><p>Tech Acquisitions under the Microscope</p><p>Over the past year, the DOJ and the FTC launched significant antitrust investigations of U.S. tech companies. According to the DOJ's press release, their review would examine \"whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power\" and if such entities \"are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote5\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>Press Release, Dep't of Justice, Office of Pub.

While not unprecedented, the use of Section 2 in the merger context is unusual and could foreshadow the agencies' approach to future enforcement cases.</p><p>These and other recent FTC cases suggest the FTC is open to examining a broader range of theories. More specifically, these cases suggest the FTC is focused on the effect of mergers on the development of potentially competing early-stage pipeline treatments, even if the treatments are years away from reaching patients.

It is also a sign that there remains considerable uncertainty and debate regarding the treatment of mergers between vertically related entities.</p><p>On the FTC side, the Commission ruled on three mergers over the course of 2019 in which the Commissioners debated vertical issues. First, Staples Inc., the world's largest office supply retailer, acquired Essendant Inc.,34 the largest office products wholesale distributor in the United States. In approving this vertical transaction, the FTC agreed to a consent decree requiring Staples to restrict access to commercially sensitive information regarding Essendant's customers, who were also Staples's competitors.35 The majority statement from the three Republican commissioners, including Chairman Simons, emphasized that when evaluating vertical mergers, the Commission must provide concrete evidence and theories \"supported by factors\" rather than \"hypothetical\" anticompetitive results.36 Commissioners Chopra and Slaughter dissented, criticizing the remedy and the majority's argument that vertical mergers are generally efficiency-enhancing and procompetitive.37</p><p>Second, the FTC cleared health insurer UnitedHealth's acquisition of DaVita's kidney dialysis centers, but Commissioners Slaughter and Chopra voiced concern that the merger would incentivize UnitedHealth to steer its insured patients to its own dialysis centers, harming competing centers.38 While urging the FTC to challenge the transaction in court, the two Democratic Commissioners acknowledged the \"significant litigation risks\" of any such challenge.39</p><p>Third, another kidney dialysis-related merger, in which Fresenius Medical Care acquired NxStage Medical, was also approved by a split (3-2) Commission vote based on disagreements regarding the vertical aspects of the merger.40 The three Republican Commissioners explained that foreclosure or higher costs to rivals were unlikely, based on the staff's investigation, given the merged company's incentive to maximize the profits of the acquired business. They also pointed to evidence of recent entry as assuaging any concern that the merger would raise entry barriers. The two Democratic Commissioners dissented, voicing the view that Fresenius would have strong profit incentives to raise rivals' costs and foreclose access to NxStage's machines.</p><p>In the wake of this string of vertical merger cases, the DOJ and the FTC published draft Vertical Merger Guidelines (\"Draft Guidelines\") on January 10, 2020.41 The Draft Guidelines address the analytical framework the agencies use to assess competitive harms that may result from mergers that \"combine two or more companies that operate at different levels of the supply chain.\"42 The Draft Guidelines are open for public comment until February 11, 2020, and are expected to be finalized shortly thereafter.</p><p>The Draft Guidelines are a significant and much-needed update to the existing \"1984 Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines,\" which no longer reflected modern agency enforcement practices or the economic tools the agencies use to evaluate vertical mergers. As such, it is the hope that, as FTC Chairman Simons has stated, the Draft Guidelines will bring \"[g]reater transparency about the complex issues surrounding vertical mergers.\"43</p><p>The Draft Guidelines do not represent a significant departure from existing agency policies or enforcement priorities. At a high level, the Draft Guidelines:</p><p> Describe how relevant markets and newly defined related products are assessed in vertical mergers.Provide insight as to how the agencies evaluate market shares and concentration in conjunction with other evidence when determining whether a merger will substantially lessen competition. Specifically, the agencies:  May look at output shares in a relevant market that uses the related products as an indicator of the competitive significance of the related products.Consider a safe harbor in vertical mergers where the parties' share of the relevant market and the related product is 20% or less. Describe the ways in which a vertical merger could have unilateral anticompetitive effects, including by (1) allowing the merged firm to foreclose a rival from or raise a rival's costs to a related product, and (2) enabling the merged firm to access competitively sensitive information of its upstream or downstream rivals, causing the merged firm to restrain its competitive response.Describe the ways in which a vertical merger could lead to anticompetitive coordinated effects by, for example, eliminating (or weakening) a disruptive \"maverick\" competitor or by facilitating anticompetitive coordination.Discuss how the elimination of double marginalization through a vertical merger can benefit both the merged firm and downstream buyers. The Draft Guidelines note that \"[t]he Agencies will not challenge a merger if the net effect of elimination of double marginalization means that the merger is unlikely to be anticompetitive in any relevant market.\"State that the agencies will consider other efficiency claims using the same approach set forth in Section 10 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines.</p><p>Despite these provisions in the Draft Guidelines, however, there remains a degree of uncertainty on several fronts going forward.</p><p>The most significant open issue is that the Draft Guidelines do not discuss the agencies' prevailing policies on the appropriate remedies in cases in which they conclude the vertical merger is likely to harm competition. The DOJ's 2011 Policy Guide to Merger Remedies (\"2011 Remedies Guide\") included both structural and conduct remedies for vertical mergers.44 But in 2018, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim withdrew the 2011 Remedies Guide and expressed his strong preference for structural remedies, such as divestitures, over behavioral remedies as they are easier to enforce.45 The DOJ has voiced this position multiple times in the past two years, including during the AT&amp;T/Time Warner trial46 and separately.47 One DOJ official recently signaled that revised remedy guidelines are in the works, although there is no timetable for their publication.</p><p>The FTC has also noted that it \"typically disfavors behavioral remedies,\" even in the vertical merger context.48 Nevertheless, the Commission recently approved deals with behavioral remedies, including Northrop Grumman's acquisition of Orbital ATK in mid-201849 and the Staples/Essendant50 transaction in early 2019.</p><p>Finally, aside from the 20% safe harbor, the agencies do not provide specifics regarding what levels of market share or foreclosure trigger antitrust concerns, or whether concerns arise even in cases in which the merged firm's upstream or downstream share is low. That determination will depend on the specific facts and businesses at issue.</p><p>The FTC's two Democratic Commissioners abstained from supporting the Draft Guidelines. Although the Draft Guidelines will reflect the policy of the FTC, it remains to be seen whether the Guidelines are retained if and when there is a change in administrations.</p><p>For more on the Draft Guidelines, please review our  publication on the subject.51</p><p>The DOJ Turns to Arbitration to Resolve Merger Challenge</p><p>On September 4, 2019, the DOJ filed a complaint challenging Novelis Inc.'s proposed acquisition of Aleris Corporation.52 According to the complaint, Novelis and Aleris are two of four North American producers of aluminum auto body sheet metal. The DOJ alleged the merger between them would harm competition if left unremedied.</p><p>Rather than approve a remedy, however, the DOJ agreed to refer the issue of market definition to binding arbitration pursuant to the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996.53 Under the terms, if the DOJ prevailed on its proffered (and more narrow) definition of the market, the parties would execute an agreed-upon remedy. If the parties prevailed, then the merger would proceed without any remedy.</p><p>This new arbitration approach would avoid the time and expense of proceeding through trial. It may also serve as a test case for merger matters involving disputes over core issues relating to the marketplace. As explained in a  separate client alert, however, the availability of arbitration may well be limited to cases in which the issues in dispute are well-defined and discrete.54</p><p>The DOJ Updates Model Timing Agreement</p><p>The DOJ revised its Model Timing Agreement in December 2019. Timing agreements, which are a fixture of merger investigations involving the DOJ and the FTC, ensure that the agencies have sufficient time to evaluate a transaction prior to closing.</p><p>The revised 2019 agreement seems to further Assistant Attorney General Delrahim's goal of shortening the time needed to complete merger reviews. The 2019 agreement removes references from the model agreement that allowed the Deputy Assistant Attorney General to authorize an extension of time for the Division if a decision is not reached within 60 days after compliance with the second request, a document search of more than 20 individuals, and depositions of more than 12 individuals for each merging party. The import of these changes remains to be seen, but it appears to alleviate the burden of complying with a second request.</p><p>China</p><p>2019 was another very active year for China's State Administration for Market Regulation (\"SAMR\"). Out of the 448 transactions reviewed, five were subject to remedies but none was prohibited. The conditional approval decisions show that the SAMR continues to rely on creative remedies such as hold-separate remedies, commitments to supply products and services on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, and the implementation of antitrust compliance mechanisms.</p><p>In addition, the SAMR has continued going after merger parties for failing to notify. On the procedural side, the SAMR's decision in Novelis's proposed acquisition of Aleris shows the risks in opting for a simplified decision.</p><p>Finally, 2020 is likely to be a very important year for merger enforcement. Indeed, the SAMR has published proposed amendments to the Anti-Monopoly Law for comments. The proposed changes include higher fines for merger-related conduct, in response to long-standing concerns that the current fines are too low.</p><p>Legislative Developments</p><p>Since its establishment in March 2018, the SAMR has introduced a number of legislative enactments and guidelines, which not only codify the practices of its predecessors, but also introduce notable changes to merger enforcement.</p><p>Most recently, on January 2, 2020, the SAMR released a draft amendment to the Anti-Monopoly Law (the \"Draft Amendment\") for public consultation.55 The Draft Amendment seeks to increase penalties for breaches of merger-related conduct, including gun-jumping, failure to notify reportable transactions and breach of commitments in conditionally approved cases. The increased fines for gun-jumping are notable. The current version of the Anti-Monopoly Law (\"AML\") imposes a maximum fine of RMB 500,000 (approximately $72,200) for merger-related conduct. The Draft Amendment proposes to change the maximum fine to 10% of the infringing party's turnover in the previous financial year.</p><p>The Draft Amendment now explicitly defines \"control\" as the ability to \"exert or potentially exert a decisive influence on another undertaking's production and operation activities or other major decisions.\" Both the new fine and the definition of control are in line with the practice in the European Union.</p><p>In addition, the Draft Amendment now allows the SAMR to \"stop the clock\" during a merger investigation (for instance, if the transaction parties supplement their notification with additional materials) and codifies the SAMR's ability to carry out sub-threshold investigations and to amend the turnover notification thresholds from time to time. Lastly, the Draft Amendment now explicitly states that parties are \"responsible for the authenticity of their submissions.\"</p><p>From a practical standpoint, the SAMR has improved the transparency of its merger review process by increasing the frequency of its publication of unconditional approvals. Since the second quarter of 2019, the SAMR has been issuing its unconditional clearance decisions on its website on a weekly, instead of monthly basis.</p><p>Noteworthy Transactions</p><p>In 2019, the SAMR reviewed a total of 448 concentrations, which represents a slight increase from 2018. Out of 448 concentrations, 443 were approved unconditionally and five were approved subject to remedies. There were no prohibited concentrations in 2019.56 The SAMR took between seven to 17 months to complete its review of conditionally approved cases. Notably, the SAMR asked the parties in all five conditionally approved cases to withdraw and refile their notifications, allowing the SAMR to further extend its review period. Each of the conditional approvals is discussed in turn, below.</p><p>KLA-Tencor's proposed acquisition of Orbotech.57 On February 13, 2019, California-based semiconductor company KLA-Tencor secured the SAMR's conditional approval of its proposed acquisition of Orbotech, an Israeli manufacturer of semiconductor equipment. The SAMR found that the parties had multiple vertical and adjacent relationships in the broader market for semiconductor equipment. In order to address the SAMR's concerns regarding foreclosure, tying and information exchange, the parties agreed to the following remedies: (1) continue to supply semiconductor process-control equipment and services to downstream Chinese manufacturers on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (\"FRAND\") terms; (2) not bundle or tie semiconductor process-control, deposition and etching equipment or impose unreasonable conditions in sales of such products; and (3) ensure that they do not obtain competitively sensitive information about Chinese manufacturers of deposition and etching equipment.</p><p>Cargotec's proposed acquisition of TTS.58 On July 5, 2019, the SAMR issued its conditional approval of Cargotec's proposed acquisition of TTS. The parties, two Scandinavian cargo-handling equipment suppliers, had horizontal overlaps in eight product markets: hatch covers; roll-on equipment; cargo lifters; anchor winches; and the aftersales services for each of these products. The SAMR identified competition concerns in the markets for hatch covers, roll-on equipment and cargo lifters, as the parties had combined market shares between 50% and 60% in each of these markets. The SAMR imposed a range of behavioural remedies, including a hold-separate remedy. Cargotec and TTS agreed to hold their businesses separate in China for two years and to set up firewalls to ensure that the businesses are independent and do not exchange competitively sensitive information. This hold-separate remedy would automatically expire after two years. Cargotec also agreed to continuously supply the relevant products to Chinese customers and to refrain from increasing prices in China for five years.</p><p>II-VI's proposed acquisition of Finisar.59 On September 18, 2019, the SAMR granted its conditional approval of II-VI Incorporated's proposed acquisition of Finisar. The parties, two photonics companies based in the United States, had horizontal overlaps in four markets, vertical relationships in three markets, and were also active in adjacent markets. To address the SAMR's competition concerns in the market for wavelength selector switches (in which the top three players, including the parties, had a combined market share of 95%), the parties agreed to a hold-separate remedy for three years, as well as firewalls to prevent the exchange of competitively sensitive information. Moreover, the parties agreed to continue supplying wavelength selector switches to customers on FRAND terms. Unlike in Cargotec/TTS, the SAMR did not grant an automatic sunset clause; the parties in this transaction are required to apply to the SAMR to lift the commitments.</p><p>Proposed joint venture between Royal DSM and Garden Bio-Chem.60 On October 18, 2019, the SAMR published its conditional approval decision in respect of Netherlands-based Royal DSM and China's Zhejiang Garden Biochemical High-Tech's (\"Garden Bio-Chem\") proposed joint venture. The scope of the joint venture was limited to the production of DHC, a chemical precursor for cholesterol-based vitamin D3. The SAMR expressed concerns that the JV parties may coordinate the prices and amounts of core raw material for vitamin D3 production. The SAMR referenced the parties' strength in the market: they are the top two suppliers of veterinary vitamin D and two out of the top three suppliers of human vitamin D in China and worldwide. The SAMR also noted that the parties had a large amount of technical knowledge and patents which further strengthened their market powers and barriers to entry. Garden Bio-Chem's high market shares in the global and Chinese markets for lanolin cholesterol, a key ingredient in the production of vitamin D3 also gave rise to foreclosure concerns. In light of these concerns, the SAMR required a comprehensive set of behavioural remedies that would expire automatically after five years. The parties agreed to a hold-separate remedy, pursuant to which they must keep their vitamin D3 businesses completely independent, including the procurement of cholesterol needed for the JV's production of DHC. Garden Bio-Chem also committed to supply cholesterol to vitamin D3 suppliers on FRAND terms. The parties also committed to maintain independent operations in the JV, including measures to prevent the exchange of competitively sensitive information, separation of the JV's offices, IT systems and production facilities from those of the parent companies, independent employees, and a prohibition on the executive management of the JV from manufacturing or selling vitamin D3 and cholesterol for three years after the termination of their employment by the JV. The scope of the JV would be limited to DHC production and both the JV and the parties committed not to publicly disclose the prices of cholesterol and vitamin D3 absent a customer request or where disclosure is required by the law. Lastly, the SAMR required the JV to implement mechanisms to ensure its compliance with the various commitments.</p><p>Novelis's proposed acquisition of Aleris.61 In August 2018, U.S. aluminium producer, Novelis, filed a notification to SAMR under the simplified procedure regarding its proposed acquisition of rival Aleris. The SAMR initially accepted the notification, but upon the receipt of a third party's objections, revoked its acceptance in October 2018 and asked the parties to refile under the regular procedure. More than a year after the initial filing, on December 20, 2019, the SAMR published its conditional clearance decision. The SAMR identified competition concerns in two separate markets for interior and exterior aluminium auto-body sheets in which the parties had a combined market share of 70 to 80%. The SAMR expressed concerns that the transaction may eliminate competitive constraints and narrow downstream car manufacturers' procurement options. In addition, the SAMR expressed concerns about coordination, in light of a Novelis joint venture with one of its major competitors, which led SAMR to conclude that Novelis has been \"maintaining a good cooperative relationship\" with competing firms. To address these concerns, Aleris agreed to divest its interior and exterior aluminium auto-body sheet business in the European Economic Area. The combined entity would also refrain from supplying cold-rolled plates in China to any competitors that operate in the market for auto-body sheets for a period of 10 years unless the parties applied to the SAMR for an early release. This decision is a useful reminder that there is a risk of significant delays if the parties elect to file under the simplified procedure using market definitions that are too narrow.</p><p>Failure to File</p><p>The SAMR continued to proactively enforce against failures to notify reportable transactions. In 2019, the SAMR published 17 failure-to-file decisions, imposing financial penalties ranging between RMB 300,000 (approximately $43,300) to RMB 400,000 (approximately $57,800) on each infringing party.62 In one noteworthy action, the SAMR imposed a penalty of RMB 300,000 (approximately $43,300) on each of Praxair and Nanjing Oil Refinery for failing to notify a joint venture that they established six years prior, in 2013. This decision signals to transaction parties that the SAMR's probe is not limited to only recent joint ventures and mergers.</p><p>The European Union</p><p>After reaching a historic high point in 2018 with 414 mergers notified to the European Commission (the \"Commission\"), the number of notified mergers decreased to 382 in 2019, which is more in line with the number of notified mergers in previous years.63</p><p>2019 also brought about a decrease in the number of Phase II investigations: eight investigations launched compared to 12 in the previous year.</p><p>Most notably, however, in 2019, the Commission issued three prohibition decisions in Phase II merger investigations, the highest number since 2001.</p><p>Another notable development in 2019 was that no Phase II mergers were cleared unconditionally under Article 8(1) (compared to four in 2018), while six Phase II mergers were cleared subject to commitments (similar to 2018).</p><p>The 2019 Prohibition Decisions</p><p>Siemens/Alstom - February 201964</p><p>The Commission's prohibition of the Siemens/Alstom merger was the most debated case in 2019 and continues to spark conversation about whether wider public interest considerations, such as creating European champions fit for competition on global markets, should factor into EU merger control.</p><p>The Commission prohibited the transaction on grounds of horizontal overlaps creating anticompetitive effects in the European markets for high-speed and very high-speed trains as well as mainline signalling systems. As part of its investigation, the Commission assessed the global competitive landscape, in particular potential competition from Chinese suppliers. However, with regard to both signalling systems and trains, the Commission concluded that the entry of Chinese competitors into Europe was highly unlikely to be a competitive constraint on the merging parties in a foreseeable future.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission rejected the parties' proposed divestitures, which included the grant of a license for the high-speed train businesses of the respective parties, as well as the divestiture of one of Siemens's urban signalling businesses, Siemens's entire on-board Automatic Train Protection (\"ATP\") business, and Alstom's ATP European Train Control System, as insufficient to alleviate the competitive concerns.</p><p>Wieland/Aurubis - February 201965</p><p>Wieland's proposed acquisition of Aurubis Rolled Products and Aurubis's stake in Schwermetall, would have resulted in a combined market share of more than 60% of European pre-rolled strip sales. The Commission found that the proposed transaction would have enabled Wieland to raise input costs for smaller competitorswhich at the time were sourcing a significant part of their pre-rolled requirements from Schwermetallas there were no suitable alternative suppliers. Although Wieland suggested divesting two Aurubis plants, the majority of the market participants considered this remedy inadequate to address the Commission's competition concerns, as the two plants would have lost access to the cost-competitive and high quality supplies of pre-rolled strip from Schwermetall.</p><p>Tata Steel/ThyssenKrupp - June 201966</p><p>The proposed creation of a joint venture between Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp would have combined the flat carbon steel and electrical steel activities of the second- and third-largest producers of flat carbon steel in the EEA, respectively. The creation of the joint venture was prohibited, as the Commission found it would have led to anticompetitive effects in the market for metallic coated and laminated steel products for packaging and the market for automotive hot dip galvanized steel products. According to the Commission, the merger would have established a market leader in a highly concentrated industry, resulting in reduced choice of suppliers and higher prices for metallic-coated and laminated steel products for European customers. During its investigation, the Commission considered the role of imports from third countries, but found that customers of the relevant products could not turn to imports to offset potential price increases caused by the proposed merger. Furthermore, the proposed divestures were considered insufficient, as they did not include adequate assets capable of serving the customers in the relevant geographic market.</p><p>The Ensuing Political Debate</p><p>The Commission's prohibition of the Siemens/Alstom merger, and to some extent of the Tata Steel/ThyssenKrupp joint venture, reignited the debate of whether wider public interest considerations should be included in EU merger control.67</p><p>Critics of the Commission argued that the competitive position of Europe was under threat, in part due to the potential entry of giant Chinese companies sponsored by government subsidies,68 and considered an amendment of merger rules to enable the creation of \"European Champions\" in response to this threat.69 On the other hand, the Commission, as well as a number of national competition authorities and economists, argued that the EU merger review system should not be politicized, so as not to jeopardize the level playing field within the EU70 and to avoid a risk of authorizing anti-competitive transactions.71</p><p>In the wake of the Commission's prohibition of the Siemens/Alstom merger, France and Germany proposed several measures designed to help European companies succeed in competing on the global stage. This included an update of the current merger guidelines to take greater account of competition at the global level, potential future competition, and the time frame for forecasting the development of competition to give the Commission more flexibility when assessing relevant markets.</p><p>The proposal also included a potential right to refer a prohibited merger to the Council of Europe, which could override Commission decisions on grounds of public interests.72 A similar option exists under the German merger control regime, in which the Minister of Economics can authorize a merger that was prohibited by the German antitrust authority for anticompetitive effects if the restraint of competition is outweighed by advantages to the economy as a whole resulting from the concentration, or if the concentration is justified by an overriding public interest.73</p><p>Commenters asserted that if it was possible for the Council to overrule competition decisions or allow for non-competition considerations to play a decisive role in vetting mergers, \"Europe could find itself in a downward spiral of economic inefficiency and political arbitrariness, ushering in mistrust and internal divisions as larger Member States would ultimately be able to impose their will on those with smaller economies - hardly contributing towards strengthening its position in the global economy.\"74</p><p>Nonetheless, the Commission acknowledges the need to address the concerns that others are not playing by the same rules and could misuse Europe's openness against Europe's own strategic interests. On this basis, the Commission has set out a strategy to create a more level playing field, which includes making the World Trade Organization fit for purpose and growing the EU's arsenal of defensive tools, such as foreign investment scrutiny.75</p><p>Other Trends</p><p>Continued Focus on Procedural Infringements</p><p>In 2019, we saw a continuation of the Commission's increased focus on procedural infringements of merger control rules.76</p><p>The Commission's Fine to Canon for Gun-Jumping77</p><p>Following Canon's acquisition of Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation (\"Toshiba\") by way of a so-called \"warehousing\" transaction, which included as a first step the acquisition of 5% of the share capital of Toshiba with non-controlling voting rights and an option to acquire all shares in Toshiba, and the exercise of the voting rights in the second step, the Commission imposed two fines totaling 28 million on Canon for so-called gun-jumping in June 2019. Canon notified the transaction between the two steps, and the Commission cleared the transaction on September 19, 2016. Subsequently, however, the Commission initiated proceedings regarding Canon's completion of the first step of the transaction prior to notification and clearance. In the Commission's view, Canon was obligated to notify the transaction prior to implementing the first step, as the two steps qualified as a single, notifiable transaction. By completing the first step prior to notification and clearance, Canon had \"jumped the gun\" by failing to observe stand-still requirements under EU merger control rules.</p><p>The Commission fines parties for allegedly providing incorrect information in merger filings. The Commission is also pursuing monetary fines against parties who allegedly provided incorrect information in their merger filing. One fine levied in 2019 reached 52 million. The fine highlights the Commission's continued effort to battle what it claims are procedural infringements. As Commissioner Vestager made clear, \"[the Commission's] merger assessment and decision-making depends on the Commission being sure that companies are not jumping the gun and implementing mergers without our approval[].\"79 On a practical level, the Commission's increased focus on procedural infringements underlines the necessity for companies to ensure that sufficient procedures are in place to secure compliance with competition law in relation to a transaction and to seek competition law advice at the earliest possible stage of the process.</p><p>Increased Relevance of Internal Documents during Merger Review</p><p>In 2019, the Commission continued a trend of increasing reliance on internal documents provided by parties as part of its investigations. Already in September 2014, the then-acting deputy director-general for mergers, Carles Esteva Mosso, stated that in addition to economic submissions, \"internal documents play a more important role [for difficult merger investigations] than ten years ago.\"82 By way of example, the parties were required to submit 2.7 million documents in the merger proceedings concerning Bayer/Monsanto, 800,000 documents in the Siemens/Alstom case and 400,000 documents in the merger proceedings concerning Dow/Dupont.83</p><p>This increases the burden on the merging parties and risks slowing down merger reviews. Furthermore, it could result in an \"information overload bias,\" or rather, a situation in which the quality of the Commission's assessment declines due to the huge amount of internal documents to process under time pressure.</p><p>In January 2018, Commissioner Vestager announced that best practices on the use of internal documents would be published, but this is still pending. So far, the requests for data are only governed by the request for information provisions in the EU Merger Regulation (\"EUMR\"). In the same vein, the EUMR provides little guidance on the extent of legal professional privilege when dealing with document requests during merger control proceedings.</p><p>To view the full article, please  click here.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

In our personal and public life, we don't trust easily. Between kingdoms and fiefdoms, tribes and clans. Between slave merchants and slave agents. Between the church and the state. Between nations. Between the state and its citizens. Between Big Tech like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and their users. Distrust reigns, even between a husband and a wife who each needs a marriage contract to trust the other to keep his or her vows; yet just about anything could still happen to that marriage. Anything. And today, there is increasing distrust between man and robots. Distrust is virtually everywhere. There is a problem of trust.</p><p>Trust is invaluable, and it is scarce. If trust were a commodity, people would chase it with lots of money. If trust were a currency, it would trump any other currency in the world. But trust is neither a commodity like gold nor a currency like the Naira or Dollar. Trust is an intangible, priceless value. It is so highly-demanded in the societyand increasingly sothat the business of trust today is a trillion-dollar industry. From accountants to lawyers, bankers to brokers, insurers to agents, the business of trust has become the innovation of middlemen or trusted third parties whose innovative solutions have continued to help parties essentially manage distrust. A simple scenario: For Party A to do business with Party B, it goes through party C. This is a typical contract between two parties, such as for example, a Chinese manufacturer and a Nigerian distributor who each consults a lawyer to safely complete a transaction for delivery of goods to Lagos. In a variant scenario, for Party A to enjoy access to object C, it must go through Party B. For example, a bank customer and his or her bank for the purpose of accessing financial services, including savings. What the bank, a central authority, does with the bank customer's savings is beyond his or her control.</p><p>Commercial and investment banks, trusted third parties, typically use people's hard-earned savings to offer loans and invest in mortgage securities. Where these loans and investments are high-risk, sooner or later, things go south. The banks declare bankruptcy. There is massive job loss. The economy becomes unstable. Panic. Dreading an impending contraction of the economy, the government deeps hands into the people's moneytaxpayer's moneyto bail out the eligible banks. The same government, for economic stimulus, then instructs the central bank to print more money. In economic matters such as this, political considerations must be factored in too. So, quantitative easing is preferred to tighter regulation. The side effects? Crisis. Economic stimulus soon stimulates inflation, consequently making the hard-earned money of the people lose value. Significant value. A familiar scenario? Indeed.</p><p>That was the  Financial Crisis of 2008 in the United States. The crisis led to the global financial squeeze that left many people negatively affected. Seeing how financial institutions lost customers' money and the government simply printed more money, distrust set in. Dissatisfied, many people started demanding a currency that was not under the control of any central authority. Not the banks; not the government. Neutral money. Enter a cryptocurrency in 2009. Decentralized and limited, this cryptocurrency was the opposite of fiat currency. Enter the people's money. Money without a central bank. Money without a government. Money without borders. Enter bitcoin ('b' in lower case, denoting the cryptocurrency, not the network, Bitcoin, with 'B' in upper case).</p><p>Decentralization, the key to trust.</p><p>Satoshi Nakamoto. This man, woman, or group believed, in 2008, that it was high time the problem of trust was solved. This time, not by trusting man, but by removing the need for trust in the first place.</p><p>The underlying technology behind the invention of bitcoin has been described as a distributed ledger technology that will change the way information is stored, managed, and transferred; a third-generation internet that will make exchange of anything of value possible; a trustless technology that will make for a peer-to-peer, secure, and transparent transaction without any trusted third parties. That underlying technology is blockchain.</p><p>Because blockchain is like that hardworking technical person in the team always working behind the scenes, the concept is not often easy to grab compared to other emerging technologies. PwC hit this point squarely in  'Blockchain is here. What's your next move?', when it observed that \"[b]lockchain's role as a dual-pronged change agentas a new form of infrastructure and as a new way to digitise assets through tokens, including cryptocurrencyis not easy to explain. Think about other new technologies: users can try on virtual reality goggles or watch a drone take flight. But blockchain is abstract, technical and happening behind the scenes.\"</p><p> To read the full article click here</p><p>Originally published 5 June, 2020</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Consumer demand for innovative products and services has allowed these \"tech giants\" to realize rapid growth and also market preeminence.</p><p>There's been a recent populist backlash against the power of these data monopolies, concern over harmful online content or behavior, cybercrime, and political misinformation. But the approach advocated by Sen. Warren and others to break up large tech companies is flawed because it overstates the consequences of being \"big,\" politicizes the role of competition regulators and ultimately will hinder innovation and harm consumers.</p><p>Internationally, too, there is a growing call for government action to curb the strength of the tech giants. Most advanced economies are studying the adequacy of competition law over concerns about increasing market concentration in digital network sectors.</p><p>In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has begun public hearings to examine the need for new antitrust approaches. The FTC recently launched a task force to monitor technology markets designed to investigate potential anti-competitive conduct in the digital sector.</p><p>The United Kingdom is also examining the role of competition in the digital economy, including two recent reports, first by an expert panel entitled \"Unlocking digital competition\" which recommended, among other things, a code of conduct for tech firms to include mandating interoperability and the second report by the House of Lords Committee on Communications recommending a public interest test for data mergers.</p><p>The European Commission began its study of competition in tech markets by releasing an expert report calling for stricter antitrust enforcement.</p><p>In Canada, there have calls for the modernization of Canada's competition laws by the Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, Carolyn Wilkins, and by the Commons Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics report following last year's Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal. In response, the government notes that the current competition legislation provides important protections while it studies the results of its National Digital and Data Consultations.</p><p>In 2018, during my tenure as Canada's Competition Commissioner, the Competition Bureau published an international, award-winning report entitled, \"Big Data and Innovation: Key Themes for Competition Policy in Canada.\" The study recognized that the emergence of companies that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement but confirmed the sufficiency of the current antitrust framework in this space. The report clarified that the Competition Bureau will not condemn companies merely because they are \"big\" or possess valuable big data. A fundamental principle of antitrust is that business success ought not be condemned or punished, even if that leads to dominant firms and concentrated markets. To do otherwise would harm incentives to innovate and deprive markets of important efficiencies like economies of scale and scope. These insights also apply to big data, where efficiencies may relate to network effects.</p><p>Competition enforcement agencies need to apply an evidence-based approach and demonstrate actual economic harm before taking action. Big data holds considerable promise to increase economic efficiency and innovate business practices. It's important for antitrust regulators to maintain a degree of humility and recognize that far-reaching, populist proposals are ill-advised.</p><p>Antitrust law has limits; it should not be expected to address all social problems. There are other laws and policies to address these. For instance, tax laws are better suited to correct wealth inequality, and privacy laws are better suited to safeguard personal data.</p><p>The proposal to dismantle large tech companies by unwinding already completed mergers and to prohibit platform owners from participating on their own platforms is flawed. A respect for property rights and the freedom of contract are fundamental tenets of a free-market economy, along with competition policy which enables long-term economic growth that benefits businesses and consumers alike.</p><p>Expropriating the property rights of a successful company is akin to the nuclear option in antitrust law, especially when less intrusive remedies exist. This dramatic approach would cause significant damage to the economy if it were to use antitrust law to break up large companies in an effort to remedy broad public-interest concerns.</p><p>Restricting successful companies reduces incentives to innovate, invest and compete. Competition enforcement agencies must be empowered to make evidence-based decisions using economic analysis to deal with antitrust issues. Theories and the quest for political wins should not drive policymakers to take hasty actions in the shaping of our markets. Let's exercise care in wielding our regulatory hammers.</p><p>John Pecman is a Senior Business Advisor in the Antitrust/Competition &amp; Marketing group at Canadian law firm Fasken.

We have not been disappointed. On February 19, 2020, the European Commission (the \"Commission\") released its 35-page document entitled \"A European strategy for data,\" becoming just the latest of many developments in that area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The document lays out a vision as to how - through legislation, technical standards and public-private initiatives - the EU can become a future leader in data and create a more permissive data economy.</p><p>The Commission's goal is to create a single European data space - \"a genuine single market for data, open to data from across the world - where personal as well as non-personal data, including sensitive business data, are secure and businesses also have easy access to an almost infinite amount of high-quality industrial data, boosting growth and creating value, while minimising the human carbon and environmental footprint.\" The Commission envisions common European rules to ensure:</p><p> data can flow within the EU and across sectors;European rules and values, in particular personal data protection, consumer protection legislation and competition law, are fully respected;rules for access to and use of data are fair, practical and clear, and there are clear and trustworthy data governance mechanisms in place;there is an open, but assertive approach to international data flows, based on European values.</p><p>The strategy document lays out a number of concerns, problems and obstacles to achieving its vision. One theme that runs throughout is the need to create common interoperable data platforms offering small and medium enterprises (SMEs) access to a host of cloud services and advanced data processing capabilities. As the Commission sees the current state of the data environment as dominated by the big tech companies, it noted that such a high degree of market power can \"enable large players to set the rules on the platform and unilaterally impose conditions for access and use of data.\" But what incentives would exist for companies to share certain data to an EU platform? The Commission states that organizations contributing data \"would get a return in the form of increased access to data of other contributors, analytical results from the data pool, services such as predictive maintenance services, or licence fees.\"</p><p>Generally speaking, the Commission's data strategy includes a number of elements:</p><p> A cross-sectoral governance framework for data access and use. The Commission's proposal for legislation would include a framework for a common European data space that would \"support decisions on what data can be used in which situations, facilitate cross-border data use, and prioritise interoperability requirements and standards within and across sectors.\" This would also include facilitating decisions on \"which data can be used, how and by whom for scientific research purposes in a manner compliant with the GDPR.\"The opening of key public sector data sets. The Commission would work on making more high-quality public sector data available for reuse, in particular in view of its potential for SMEs.Legislative action on issues that affect relations between actors in the data-agile economy. The Commission would seek legislative solutions to provide incentives for horizontal data sharing across sectors, in particular \"addressing issues related to usage rights for co-generated data (such as IoT data in industrial settings), typically laid down in private contracts.\" Notably, the Commission stated it would also seek to identify and address \"any undue existing hurdles hindering data sharing and to clarify rules for the responsible use of data (such as legal liability).\"Legislation regarding limited circumstances where access to data should be made compulsory.</p><p>Ultimately, it appears that a number of forces will be concurrently seeking to reshape the future of the global digital economy. In the EU, the efforts described above, as well as the EU's proposed Digital Services Act, which will impact content on digital platforms, and continuing GDPR enforcement will be influential in this area. In the U.S., regulators are considering antitrust enforcement efforts in the technology sector, legislators are calling for major changes to the immunities under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and privacy and data security legislation and enforcement are impacting data-oriented businesses. Other global initiatives are ongoing as well, such as a sweeping personal data privacy bill recently introduced in India and the prior passage of Brazil's general data protection law which is set to go into effect later this year.

In particular, when exercised against a controller with multinational or global operations, the right to be forgotten only applies to those operations being undertaken within Member States of the European Union (\"EU\").</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The case was referred to the ECJ by the French Council of State following Google's refusal to pay a 100,000 fine imposed in 2016 by the French data protection regulator, the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libert\u00e9s (\"CNIL\"). The fine was imposed because Google refused to de-reference (remove) links to search listings, containing personal data which was detrimental to an individual, from Google domains outside of the EU. Google refused despite receiving a formal notice from the CNIL to remove the relevant personal data from all versions of its search engines worldwide. Finding in favour of Google, the ECJ held that Google and other search engines are required to delist search results from domains within the EU, but not globally.</p><p>In reaching its decision, the ECJ examined Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) [2016]</p></bodyText></footnote> (\"GDPR\"), Articles 12 and 14 of the Data Protection Directive,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data [1995] (repealed by the GDPR)</p></bodyText></footnote> and the seminal 2014 Google Spain<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote4\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p>C 131/12 Google Spain SL and Google Inc. v Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos (AEPD) and Mario Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez [2014]</p></bodyText></footnote> judgment, which first recognised the 'right to erasure' under existing EU law. The ECJ emphasised that the right to protection of personal data was not absolute and must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote5\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>Google LLC v CNIL (n 1), para 60</p></bodyText></footnote> The ECJ acknowledged that this balancing exercise may result in variations between countries, depending on the weight afforded to each applicable right, including the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote6\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p>ibid</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>While the decision arguably represents a triumph for 'big tech', it is also a pragmatic approach to the extra-territorial application of the GDPR and an acknowledgement of the technical limitations of enforcing the right to be forgotten across jurisdictions. Had the scope of the CNIL's formal notice against Google been upheld by the ECJ, Google, and other search engines, would have been required to delist sensitive information from search domains worldwide following a successful delisting request. The ECJ appeared to recognise Google's concern that this would have had \"serious chilling effects on the web\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote7\"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p>Peter Fleischer, Google Global Privacy Counsel, 'Implementing a European, not global, right to be forgotten' (Google Europe Blog, 30 July 2015)</p></bodyText></footnote> and also appeared mindful of the potential for overbreadth of EU law, noting that \"numerous third States do not recognise the right to de-referencing or have a different approach to that right.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote8\"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p>Google LLC v CNIL (n 1), para 59</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Before examining the implications of the decision, we set out some context on the right to be forgotten and the way in which it is applied in the EU and Australia.</p><p>What is the 'right to be forgotten'?</p><p>The ECJ first recognised the 'right to erasure' or 'right to be forgotten' in Google Spain.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote9\"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p>Google Spain SL and Google Inc. (n 4)</p></bodyText></footnote> In this case, a Spanish citizen argued that Google should remove search results relating to the repossession of his home many years earlier, on the basis that the results were no longer relevant. In ruling against Google Spain, the ECJ held that, amongst other things, individuals have the right, under certain circumstances, to have data removed where the data are inaccurate, inadequate or irrelevant, or exceed the purpose for which the data were processed.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote10\"/><label>10</label><bodyText><p>ibid, para 92</p></bodyText></footnote> However, the ECJ noted that the right to erasure must be balanced against other fundamental rights, including freedom of information and matters of public interest.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote11\"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p>ibid, paras 68, 91, 81, 97</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Article 17 of the GDPR has since enshrined the right to be forgotten, providing data subjects with a right to erasure of their information in a number of defined circumstances; for example, where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or processed, or where a data subject withdraws consent.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote12\"/><label>12</label><bodyText><p>GDPR (n 2), Art. 17(1)</p></bodyText></footnote> Furthermore, although draft guidelines<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote13\"/><label>13</label><bodyText><p>European Data Protection Board, Guidelines 5/2019 on the criteria of the Right to be Forgotten in the search engines cases under the GDPR (part 1) - Adopted on 2 December 2019 (2019) 10</p></bodyText></footnote> recently published by the European Data Protection Board appear to raise doubts as to the potential applicability of Article 17(3) exceptions to the right to be forgotten, in the context of delisting requests, Article 17(3) nevertheless has developed the balancing test adopted in Google Spain, recognising that the right to be forgotten is not an absolute right.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote14\"/><label>14</label><bodyText><p>GDPR (n 2), Art. 17(3)</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Although this article focuses on the decision in Google LLC v CNIL, notably, another decision concerning the right to be forgotten was handed down by the ECJ on the same day. In GC and Others v CNIL,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote15\"/><label>15</label><bodyText><p>C-136/17 GC and Others v Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libert\u00e9s (CNIL) [2019]</p></bodyText></footnote> the ECJ ruled that, in relation to search results relating to criminal proceedings, search engine operators must ensure search results are amended as necessary to ensure \"the overall picture it gives the internet user reflects the current legal position\" of an individual. <footnote><anchor id=\"fnote16\"/><label>16</label><bodyText><p>ibid, para 78</p></bodyText></footnote> The case was brought before the ECJ by unnamed individuals following the CNIL's refusal to issue formal notices on Google to de-reference various links to web pages containing sensitive data about those individuals. The ECJ concluded that the prohibition on processing certain categories of sensitive personal data applied to search engine operators, but noted that a balance must be struck between the fundamental rights of the person requesting the de-referencing and persons potentially interested in that information. <footnote><anchor id=\"fnote17\"/><label>17</label><bodyText><p>ibid, para 66. Also see Court of Justice of the European Union, 'The prohibition on processing certain categories of sensitive personal data applies also to operators of search engines' (Press Release No 113/19, 24 September 2019)</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>To demonstrate the different ways in which countries have struck the balance between the right to be forgotten and other rights and considerations, we now examine Australian law as a counterpoint.</p><p>A comparable 'right to be forgotten' in Australia?</p><p>The Australian Privacy Principles (\"APP\") enshrined in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (\"Privacy Act\") set out the core privacy obligations imposed upon Australian organisations. Unlike the GDPR, the Privacy Act has a significantly narrower scope of application. For example, generally speaking, the Privacy Act only applies to organisations with an annual turnover exceeding AUD3 million, subject to some narrow exceptions. Further, it is worth noting that Australian individuals are not empowered with any positive right to privacy, such as a statutory tort of privacy.</p><p>Unlike the EU, the Privacy Act does not enshrine an explicit right to be forgotten. Although the Privacy Act is not as comprehensive as the GDPR in this respect, there are some similarities. For example, APP 11.2 requires an organisation to destroy or de-identify information that is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, mirroring Article 17(1)(a) of the GDPR.</p><p>Additionally, separate to the Privacy Act, the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 (Cth) establishes a scheme for removing cyberbullying material, targeting an Australian child, from social media services. Under the scheme, the eSafety Commissioner may issue a removal notice to a person who has posted cyberbullying material or to the social media service provider itself.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote18\"/><label>18</label><bodyText><p>Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 (Cth)</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>It is worth noting that in 2014 the Australian Law Reform Commission (\"ALRC\") called for feedback on a proposal to expand the purview of the right to be forgotten in Australia. The ALRC proposed the introduction of a new APP enabling individuals to request destruction or de-identification of personal information that was provided to the entity by the individual.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote19\"/><label>19</label><bodyText><p>Australian Law Reform Commission, Serious Invasions of Privacy in the Digital Era, Discussion Paper 80 (2014) 223-226</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Following submissions, including notably by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (\"OAIC\"), this proposal was rejected. The OAIC opposed the introduction of this right on the basis that it would significantly disrupt business operations of entities that were otherwise permitted to handle the information pursuant to the Privacy Act.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote20\"/><label>20</label><bodyText><p>Australian Law Reform Commission, Serious Invasions of Privacy in the Digital Era, Report 123 (2014) 319-321</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>One can draw parallels between the balancing exercise conducted by the ECJ in Google LLC v CNIL, and the OAIC in its submission. Like the ECJ, the OAIC appears to be seeking to strike an appropriate and proportionate balance of rights.</p><p>However, as noted above, the Privacy Act does not apply to a large majority of Australian organisations turning over less than AUD3 million annually. This begs the question whether the balance is right, with privacy advocates arguing that big businesses should be able to cope with the administrative demands associated with the handling of personal information.</p><p>Nevertheless, the development of Australia's privacy landscape is beginning to see calls for greater erasure powers and measures which will afford individuals greater control over their personal information. For example, Recommendation 16(d) of the Digital Platforms Inquiry attempts to address the bargaining power imbalance between consumers and digital platforms by enabling the erasure of a consumer's personal information without delay where there are no overriding reasons for the APP entity to retain the information.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote21\"/><label>21</label><bodyText><p>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, Digital Platforms Inquiry, Final Report (2019) 470-473</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (\"ACCC\") notes that any erasure request will be counterbalanced by competing public interest reasons, including \"freedom of speech, freedom of the media, public health and safety, and national security\".<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote22\"/><label>22</label><bodyText><p>ibid, 472</p></bodyText></footnote> Similarly, the 'Consumer Data Right', which is currently being rolled out in the banking sector, contains provisions which allow individuals to elect for the deletion of redundant data.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote23\"/><label>23</label><bodyText><p>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, Explanatory Statement - Proposed Competition and Consumer (Consumer Data Right) Rules 2019 - August 2019 (2019) 10</p></bodyText></footnote> As such, while Australia currently lacks a clearly actionable right to be forgotten, a trend appears to be emerging where deletion rights are being created in response to power imbalances which exist in specific industries.</p><p>As similarly contemplated by the ECJ in Google LLC v CNIL, the balancing exercise conducted by the OAIC provides a poignant example of the way in which regulators across countries may weigh competing rights differently. However, these disparities have caused commentators to question whether global privacy laws should be reformed to create greater equivalency between jurisdictions. At present, there is a patchwork of regional and global privacy frameworks affording individuals differing levels of protection and imposing differing levels of compliance.</p><p>What is the significance of the Google LLC v CNIL judgment?</p><p>The decision represents a significant victory for multinational 'big tech' companies, at a time when their use and protection of personal data has become increasingly scrutinised. The decision recognises the importance of balancing individuals' privacy rights against other fundamental freedoms, and notably takes heed of Google's concern that adopting the CNIL's stance on global delisting could result in a \"race to the bottom\", where \"the Internet would only be as free as the world's least free place.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote24\"/><label>24</label><bodyText><p>Fleischer (n 7)</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>In light of the growing focus on data protection regulation globally, and the increasing number of cases being referred to local regulators and the ECJ, the decision provides welcome clarity around the territorial scope of EU data protection laws in this context. That said, the ECJ left open, \"where appropriate\", the possibility of a Member State determining that de-referencing on all versions of a search engine is required.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote25\"/><label>25</label><bodyText><p>Google LLC v CNIL (n 1), para 72</p></bodyText></footnote> Importantly, this acknowledges that Member States remain competent to balance individuals' privacy rights against other fundamental rights, in light of varying national standards. It is yet to be seen whether national data protection regulators will be emboldened by the ECJ's comments.</p><p>Likewise, the inevitable frustration of both EU citizens attempting to access information which has not been delisted outside the EU and individuals striving for a right to be forgotten globally, may lead to more frequent challenges to the weight afforded to privacy rights by individual Member States.</p><p>Finally, it is important to consider the practical challenges of enforcing this limited right to be forgotten. It remains to be seen whether Google's geo-blocking measures will be easily circumvented (for example, through the use of Virtual Private Networks), or whether smaller search engines and intermediaries will have the ability to properly action and enforce territorially limited delisting. If not, this may prove to be an instance where the law is out of sync with modern technological realities.</p><p>For now, the judgment will at least provide a tangible gauge of how Member States differently afford weight to privacy rights and other fundamental freedoms.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The rate at which false information can be spread globally is now a major challenge for governments and their regulatory frameworks, and regulators worldwide are scrambling to implement measures to address the problem. However, the size and reach of such online platforms pose a challenge to policymakers and regulators.</p><p>What is clear is that we are at the start of a long journey, and regulators will come under increasing pressure from government to move more quickly to address these issues. However, the major challenges lie in resolving the material issues around censorship; the levelling of regulation in an increasingly converged digital world; policing the process fairly; and protecting the regulatory process from unnecessarily political influence by using effective agencies that can secure the trust of all stakeholders in the process.</p><p>This article addresses the attempts by three prominent jurisdictions in this space - the United Kingdom (UK), Singapore, and the European Union (EU) - to tackle such issues and provide an outline for what happens next.</p><p>United Kingdom</p><p>A slew of recent examples have been widely reported in the UK media, underlining the impact how widely fake news or false information has spread, and the impact it has had. One prominent example was around the EU referendum, when online channels were used to serve up targeted, fake information designed specifically to undermine institutions and incite anti-EU sentiments. This was very similar to the allegation against Facebook with respect to its role in spreading fake news during Donald Trump's successful US Presidential campaign.</p><p>What is being done?</p><p>While UK regulators like Ofcom regulate broadcast media and the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) and Impress regulate newspapers (online and offline), these regulators have not taken any significant action to tackle fake news.</p><p>The  Cairncross Review Report, 2019 investigated the UK news market and role of digital search engines etc. Amongst other things, it recommended that the online platforms' efforts to improve their users' news experience should be placed under regulatory supervision: the aim being to ensure oversight of the steps online platforms are taking to improve both the quality and the accuracy of the news content they serve. It also recommended that:</p><p> Ofcom should explore the market impact of BBC News, and whether it has inappropriately stepped into areas better served by commercial news providers;a new independent institute be created to ensure the future provision of public interest news;a new Innovation Fund be launched with the aim of improving the supply of public interest news: anda media literacy strategy be developed alongside Ofcom, the media industries and stakeholders.</p><p>In addition to the above, Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee has also been investigating issues around fake news, particularly, what it is, its impact and the responsibilities of social media platforms and search engines in curbing it.</p><p>The Committee's initial report, published in July, 2018, recommended the term 'fake news' should not be used and that a separate working group should be created to target issues around the spreading of misinformation. It is worth noting that as a result of this report, the term 'fake news' has now been banned from use in policy documents or official papers as it is \"a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes\".</p><p>On 18 February 2019, the DCMS Committee issued its final report, calling for:</p><p> a compulsory Code of Ethics for tech companies, overseen by independent regulator - with clear legal liabilities to be established for tech companies if they do not act against harmful or illegal content on their sites;the regulator to be given powers to launch legal action against companies breaching the Compulsory Code of Ethics;government reform of the current electoral communications laws and rules on overseas involvement in UK elections; andsocial media companies to be obliged to take down known sources of harmful content, including proven sources of disinformation.</p><p>The report also notes that Facebook had intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws. It suggested that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) should investigate whether \"Facebook specifically has been involved in any anti-competitive practices and conduct a review of Facebook's business practices towards other developers, to decide whether Facebook is unfairly using its dominant market position in social media to decide which businesses should succeed or fail\".</p><p>The UK Government has also established the National Security Communications Unit, which is tasked with \"combating disinformation by state actors and others\". The decision to set up this unit came at the time an investigation was being conducted into Russia's reported practice of setting up multiple social media accounts to spread falsehoods about the EU referendum.</p><p>The Digital Competition Expert Panel has also recently (March, 2019) published a report on 'Unlocking digital competition', making recommendations for the changes required to the UK's competition law framework in light of current economic challenges posed by digital markets. The report discusses the emergence of some dominant tech firms, which has raised concerns about higher prices for consumers, reduction in choice, impact on quality, impeding innovation and preventing new entrants. Its recommendations include, amongst other things:</p><p> establishing a new 'digital markets unit' tasked with giving people more control over their data by using open standards;requiring large companies to share key data sets with start-ups (while safeguarding personal information); anddrawing up a code of conduct, which would set out acceptable behaviour for tech companies in their relationships with users. </p><p>Facebook has now launched a fact-checking initiative and employed Full Fact, a UK-based charity, to review stories, images and videos and rate them based on accuracy. Full Fact explained that users can flag up content they think may be false, and its team will rate the stories as true, false or a mixture of accurate and inaccurate content. It has also launched a toolkit to help users identify false information.</p><p>As is clear from the above, while there is growing public recognition that the big tech companies are failing in their obligation towards their users in dealing with the spread of misinformation and other illegal content, it remains to be seen whether new laws and regulations to combat the problem will be introduced by the current UK Government.</p><p>It recently (April, 2019) published its Online Harms White Paper, setting out its plans for increasing online safety and proposals to  establish in law a 'new duty of care' for large social media companies, which would hold them to account for tackling online harms, ranging from illegal activity to content that is deemed harmful but is not necessarily illegal. A consultation has been launched to gather views on these plans. This consultation closes on 1 July 2019.</p><p>Singapore</p><p>Singapore is at the forefront of developing legislation to curb the excesses presented around external online influence. According to a 2018 online survey carried out by Ipsos, a marketing research entity in Singapore, 8 in 10 Singaporeans (i.e. 79%) responded said that they were confident in their ability to distinguish between fake and accurate news. But when put to the test, around 91% mistakenly identified at least one out of five fake headlines as being genuine. In September 2018, the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods offered 22 recommendations aimed at helping to prevent the spread of \"deliberate online falsehoods\", noting that there is no single \"silver bullet\" and that a \"multi-pronged\" approach would be necessary to tackle these issues. The Select committee's report found \"four overlapping dimensions of society\" affected by online falsehoods:</p><p> national security;democratic institutions and free speech;individuals;  andbusinesses.</p><p>With elections looming in Singapore, it is likely the government will take steps to combat any risks from external influence.</p><p>Measures suggested by the committee included:</p><p> new legislation giving government the power to swiftly disrupt (limit or block publicity) the spread and influence of online falsehoods;new powers to cut off funding from those who create and spread online falsehoods and funding from those behind the creation and dissemination;introducing appropriate criminal sanctions for violations;government regulation of tech companies, with powers to legally compel them to adopt appropriate measures;public institutions provide timely information to people in response to misinformation; andmedia organisations considering forming a coalition that debunks falsehoods swiftly and credibly.</p><p>In light of the above recommendations, the government has now tabled a new anti-fake news bill. The bill gives powers to authorities to force the correction of online content when there is a \"false statement of fact\" that jeopardises the \"public interest\". Any minister could order the issuance of a \"correction direction\".</p><p>It also authorises the minister to order internet service providers to post statements indicating that content is false, or to disable access to certain content in Singapore. It would also be a crime to publish someone else's personal information with the intention to harass, threaten or facilitate violence against them. According to Bloomberg, Facebook, Google and other tech giants have already raised concerns about the new bill. Amongst others, the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development and the global civil society alliance CIVICUS, have also raised serious concerns about the bill, including curbs on freedom of speech, silencing dissent against government and potential inconsistencies with human rights conventions.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how the government reacts to these criticisms, and what powers it ultimately grants under the legislation. The present trajectory suggests the imposition of a wide-ranging law that grants the authorities material discretion on interpretation.</p><p>European Union</p><p>The European Union (EU) has introduced a number of initiatives to tackle the spread of online disinformation and fake news. In 2017, the European Commission (EC) established a High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) on fake news, which published its first report in March 2018. Disinformation, as defined in this report, includes all forms of false, inaccurate, or misleading information designed, presented and promoted intentionally to cause public harm or for profit.</p><p>The report made a number of important recommendations, including:</p><p> abandoning the term \"fake news\", which was deemed inadequate in explaining the complexity of the situation and leads to confusion in the way researchers discuss these issues and how they are reported on in the media and discussed by policy-makers;public authorities at all EU levels sharing data promptly and efficiently;efforts to counter interference in elections;a commitment by tech platforms to share data;investment in media and information literacy and comprehensive evaluations of these efforts; andcross-border research into the scale and impact of disinformation.</p><p>In April 2018, the EC outlined an approach and self-regulatory tools to tackle online disinformation, including an EU-wide Code of Practice against disinformation.</p><p>Last October, the Code of Practice was signed by Facebook, Google, Twitter and Mozilla, trade associations representing online platforms, and the advertising industry. The purpose of the Code, which will be reviewed annually, is to identify actions that could be put in place to address the challenges relating to fake news.</p><p>The Code includes an annex identifying best practices that signatories will have to adopt to implement its commitments. These commitments include:</p><p> removing accounts and websites that consistently spread misinformation;increasing the use of fact-checking organisations;policing the placement of adverts; andestablishing a clear policy on the misuse of automated systems used to spread of false and misleading information, such as 'bots'.</p><p>Also in 2018, the European Council invited the EC, in cooperation with member states, to produce an action plan with specific proposals to deal with the challenges around disinformation. In December 2018, the EC issued a Joint Communication/Action Plan against Disinformation, focusing on four key areas:</p><p> Improved detection: appointing strategic communication task forces and reinforcing the EU hybrid fusion cell with significant additional specialised staff and data analysis tools.Coordinated response: a dedicated Rapid Alert System, to facilitate the sharing of data and assessments of disinformation campaigns and to provide alerts on disinformation threats in real time.Online platforms and industry:the signatories to the Code of Practice should swiftly and effectively implement the commitments made under the Code of Practice, focusing on actions that are urgent for the European elections in 2019. This includes, in particular, ensuring transparency of political advertising, stepping up efforts to close active fake accounts, labelling non-human interactions (messages spread automatically by 'bots') and cooperating with fact-checkers and academic researchers to detect disinformation campaigns and make fact-checked content more visible and widespread.Raising awareness and empowering citizens through the promotion of media literacy. </p><p>Across Europe, different countries are taking action at a domestic level.</p><p>France enacted legislation in November 2018 to fight against the dissemination during an election period of false information on the internet. The legislation gives the relevant authorities the power to remove false content spread through social media and allows them to block the websites that publish such information. It is considered Western Europe's first official attempt to ban false material. Authorities may also demand greater transparency on the financing behind sponsored content on websites in the three months prior to election periods. It is worth noting that the opposition party is appealing the law to the Constitutional Court on the basis that the measure is disproportionate.</p><p>In Germany, the Network Enforcement Act came into force on 1 January 2018, requiring social network providers, such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, to remove \"manifestly\" unlawful posts within 24 hours or risk fines of up to 50 million. The legislation on this has since been revised following criticism that too much content was being censored. The changes allow incorrectly deleted content to be restored, and require social media companies to set up independent bodies to review posts.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>It is clear the problems caused by the spreading of online falsehoods are only set to increase, there will be growing calls for regulation in this area and action is undoubtedly going to be taken. However, critics of increased regulation suggest there are risks governments could use the law to suppress free speech and increase their ability to monitor their citizens.</p><p>In addition, there can be other pressures on governments in terms of legislating, given the size of many online platforms, the economic power they wield, and their ability to direct and withdraw inward investment. Like discerning misinformation itself, the choices around how to regulate and legislate are not easy, but measures will need to be taken. Critical will be balancing the need for fair and effective review and oversight of the discretionary powers required against the need for speed and effective intervention. While the models and the problems may be new, the legal challenges around due process and effective redress are not.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Previous FCC orders that attempted to regulate internet service providers underwent lengthy litigation from 2010 through 2014. If that's any indication, last week's order will likely be tied up in the courts for months and possibly years. In fact, the 2020 election could alter the FCC's position if a Democrat can win back the White House.</p><p> Second, there's talk in Congress of crafting legislation that would supersede the FCC's authority. And unlike many issues on Capitol Hill, this one might attract bipartisan cooperation.</p><p> Many internet users in rural America find net neutrality an attractive idea since their areas are often served by a single provider. That situation could lead some lawmakers to see those companies as utility monopolies that should be regulated. Properly crafted, a law featuring some regulation may be more palatable to some Republican lawmakers than no regulations.</p><p> Peel back the overheated rhetoric of recent weeks, and both sides on the net-neutrality debate have some interesting, if a bit dry, arguments.</p><p> Those in favor of less regulation have history on their side. In the 1990s, a Democratic president (Bill Clinton) and a Republican Congress agreed that the then-nascent internet should be \"unfettered by Federal or State regulation.\" By doing so, the internet-based economy grew exponentially and American companies became the leaders in a worldwide industry. The wide-open internet world the public enjoys today is the product of a free and unregulated marketplace. Consumers, not government, should determine who provides the best online experience.</p><p> Likewise, proponents of stepped-up regulation have plenty of examples of anti-consumer actions. For example, 10 years ago Comcast blocked file-sharing between customers. Two years later, AT&amp;T wouldn't allow access to Skype and FaceTime apps. The result of these and other Big Tech abuses were the 2015 Obama administration rules.</p><p> The fact the Obama FCC sought solutions through executive fiat says volumes about the overreach of the last administration and the intransigence of the legislative branch. As the internet economy matures and industry behemoths have the ability to restrict smaller competitors and start-ups, there may be defensible reasons to regulate how the internet operates. But those regulations should come from Congress and not a panel of five unelected commissioners.</p><p> What the internet does not need is the winding, unwinding and rewinding of regulations that comes with political-party changes in the White House.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIL-ecaa8fbe81fef3f99a30e0a26e16eb8350fa736f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C28F27DEC55 NWBKIL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R78-TCC1-JBCN-42H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

normalizedValue=\"http://www.voanews.com\">http://www.voanews.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  The inventor of the worldwide web, Tim Berners-Lee, called on Monday for powerful internet platforms and social media companies to be regulated to prevent the internet from being \"weaponized at scale.\"The British computer scientist, in an open letter published on the 29th anniversary of the creation of the web, said a \"new set of gatekeepers\" was now dominant, controlling the spread of ideas and opinions.\"The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale,\" he wrote.\"In recent years, we've seen conspiracy theories trend on social media platforms, fake Twitter and Facebook accounts stoke social tensions, external actors interfere in elections and criminals steal troves of personal data.\"The intervention by the 62-year-old MIT professor comes as some European governments turn to legislation to curb \"fake\" news and hate speech that they fear is undermining the basis of their democracies.In Germany, a law entered force on January 1 that foresees fines of up to 50 million euros ($62 million) on internet platforms that fail to remove hate speech   which is illegal   within 24 hours.French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile plans legislation that would empower judges to order the removal of fake news during election campaigns.And in Brussels, the European Commission has served notice to internet platforms that they must find a way to remove extremist content within one hour of being notified, or face legislation compelling them to do so.Berners-Lee, whose Web Foundation campaigns for a more open and inclusive internet, doubted that companies that have been built to maximize profits can adequately address the problem on a voluntary basis.\"A legal or regulatory framework that accounts for social objectives may help ease those problems,\" he said.Expressing concern over how big internet platforms handle users' data in targeting advertising, Berners-Lee said a balance needed to be found between the interests of companies and online citizens.\"This means thinking about how we align the incentives of the tech sector with those of users and society at large, and consulting a diverse cross-section of society in the process.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

It would make us freer, richer, smarter. It would make us better citizens, better consumers, better humans. This gospel of digital optimism first arrived in the 1990s, when the dotcom boom made it something of a religion. And somehow it persisted, long after the rest of the decade's delusions washed away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's only relatively recently that this\u00a0faith has begun to unravel. Later historians will pinpoint the precise moment, but two obvious traumas stand out: the revelations of Edward Snowden and the election of Donald Trump. The first demonstrated how much the companies who own the internet know about you, and how easily that knowledge can be acquired by government agencies. The second illustrated how deeply the tech industry shapes the public sphere, and how little it cares about basic civic norms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, suddenly, it's open season on Silicon Valley. Even our mildest commentators and most purchased politicians are finding the courage to say critical things. The tech industry still gets everything it wants, of course, and the spectre of meaningful regulation remains distant, at least in the US. But the narrative has shifted. The dotcom dream, stubborn residue of the 1990s, has died.</p><p>Franklin Foer's World Without Mind belongs to this turn. And it couldn't have appeared at a more opportune moment, with the news cycle constantly feasting on fresh infusions of tech mischief, from Facebook's fondness for Russian trolls to Google's forced reorganisation of a major Washington thinktank. Foer is writing for a readership that is ready to re-evaluate the role technology plays in their lives, and to pay closer, less credulous attention to the companies that are building it.</p><p>In Foer's telling, Google wants to hijack human evolution by stockpiling all information to build an artificial mind</p><p>To his credit, he seizes the opportunity. This is not a book of small, gentle criticisms. According to Foer, Silicon Valley threatens our souls and our civilisation. Big tech companies, he believes, are on a global crusade \"to mould humanity into their desired image of it\". And this moulding is highly destructive. It involves the demolition of privacy, individuality, creativity, free will, competitive markets, the media and publishing industries, the distinction between facts and lies, the possibility for political compromise, and the space for solitary contemplation.</p><p>The book describes these demolitions in detail, dwelling in particular on Google, Facebook and Amazon. In Foer's telling, Google wants to hijack human evolution by stockpiling all information and using it to build an artificial mind. Facebook wants to automate away our capacity to think and choose in order to\u00a0forge a more harmonious social whole. Amazon wants to make knowledge worthless and to kill the traditions that\u00a0nurture creativity, culture and complex\u00a0thought.</p><p>Your receptiveness to these claims will probably have a lot to do with how\u00a0technology has touched your life. Foer is candid about how it's touched his. He\u00a0writes as someone with skin in\u00a0the game - as someone who has already lost some skin, in fact. He not only comes from a\u00a0magazine industry decimated by Silicon\u00a0Valley, but is the former editor of a journal that has a specifically tormented history with tech.</p><p>In 2012, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes bought the New Republic, and hired Foer as editor, a position he had previously held from 2006 to 2010. Foer says their relationship began well, then soured when Hughes demanded they turn a profit by becoming \"a technology company\", which essentially meant chasing clicks more aggressively. In 2014, Hughes fired Foer, triggering an editorial crisis that resulted in the resignation of two thirds of the staff.</p><p>Foer writes about his time at the New Republic vividly. He comes across as a humane and honourable editor, the kind any writer would want to write for. He tries to resist the rising power of corporate sponsors, who want to peddle propaganda via \"native advertising\". He tries to resist the ruthless Taylorisation of his contributors into streams of clickable content, ranked by their traffic metrics. Above all, he tries to resist the deprofessionalisation of literary labour, as the economics of writing deteriorate to the point of pauperism.</p><p>One can admire these acts of defiance without sharing all of Foer's nostalgia for the worlds that Silicon Valley killed. After all, the New Republic often played a toxic role in American political life. Its longtime former owner, Marty Peretz, on many occasions expressed anti-Muslim sentiments, and its 1994 publication of excerpts from Charles Murray's The Bell Curve supported the \"race realism\" that survives to this day.</p><p>More broadly, the institutions that Foer celebrates for their stewardship of the public sphere in the era before big tech sometimes stewarded it poorly. Those of us who grew up with the Iraq war rather than Watergate may find it harder to recall a time when journalists placed meaningful constraints on power. Not that we're better served by having Facebook as our information overlord. But there's no doubt that the digital dismemberment of old media has cleared space for new voices. Ideas long banished by editorial boards can now bubble up into the mainstream, propelled by the internet and the communities it sustains.</p><p>In Silicon Valley, he sees a forced collectivisation campaign aimed at melting us down into a Borg-like mass</p><p>These communities couldn't exist without new technologies of connectivity. And this connectivity is what Foer fears the most: the \"hive mind\", he calls it. In Silicon Valley, he sees not merely an industry but a forced collectivisation campaign aimed at melting us down into a Borg-like mass. Solitary genius is replaced by the wisdom of the crowd. The networked mob enforces conformism. Algorithms make it impossible to think for ourselves.</p><p>Leaving aside the question of whether this characterisation is accurate, the more pressing question is whether it's politically useful. Because Foer sees collectivism as the problem, he has trouble imagining collective solutions. He proposes that we each make a personal commitment to consuming more artisanal forms of culture. He asks us to forgo the easy pleasures of technology in favour of \"the sustaining nourishment of the contemplative life\" - a slow-food movement of the soul.</p><p>But there are many who don't find the contemplative life all that nourishing, and others who prefer to draw their nourishment from the new forms of collectivity created by the internet. Telling these people to read more books will do little to curb Silicon Valley's growing power over our lives. At best, it amounts to a lifestyle choice; at worst, it risks alienating potential participants in a political movement to tame the tech industry.</p><p>Politics is about giving people stuff, not making them eat their vegetables. With scepticism about Silicon Valley reaching a record high, there's never been a better time to advance a vision for how to organise technology in a way that benefits everyone, not just a handful of executives and investors. \"We have deluded ourselves into caring more deeply about convenience and efficiency than about the things that last,\" Foer writes. This is a false choice. We can have Twitter andTurgenev. We can keep our humanity intact while enjoying the new tools tech has built - and use politics to make them better.</p><p>\u00b7 Ben Tarnoff is editor of Tech Against Trump, published by Logic magazine.

In his new book, Foer compares the way we feel about technology now to the way people felt about pre-made foods like TV dinners back when they were first invented.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FRANKLIN FOER:                 And we thought that they were brilliant because they did away with pots and pans. We didn't have to go to the store to go shopping every day. And then we woke up 50 years later and realized that these products had been basically engineered to make us fat. They disrupted the whole food economy in our world and made things entirely concentrated. And I worry that the same thing is happening now to the things that we ingest through our mind.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ARI SHAPIRO:                 Foer's book is called \"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat Of Big Tech.\" He says one problem is that companies like Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon control so much of the market.             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 They pose as these neutral marketplaces, yet when they have their own things to sell, they give them special advantages. We saw this with Yelp and Google where Yelp was this great way to get recommendations about what restaurant to go to. And it used to be when you type in a restaurant name into Google, the Yelp review was the first thing that came up. Well, Google saw that this was a good business to be in, and so they started to publish their own user reviews of restaurants. And suddenly those leapfrogged over Yelp.             </p><p>                And so I think we accept these platforms as being neutral. They pose as neutral even if you look at their looks. A search engine seems like it's a mechanical thing, but it's not a mechanical thing. It imposes the economic interests of these companies on the platform, and it imposes their values on the platform as well.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Part of the underlying challenge seems to be that all of these companies - Amazon, Google, Facebook - use algorithms to decide what to show us. And we don't know what those algorithms are.             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 Yeah.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 And if we don't think about those algorithms, we can assume that this is some kind of impartial, objective analysis when really it's not.             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 Right. All these algorithms are constructed by human beings to serve human purposes. They're systems. And these systems are devised in order to create certain outcomes. And so the fact that they're so invisible I think actually enhances their power because most people have the dimmest awareness, if any awareness at all, that Facebook is being patterned to try to give them some information above others. Right now Facebook is obsessed with promoting video because that's where money is to be had. So right now Facebook is loading up your news feed in order to give you much more video.             </p><p>                There are all these media companies - I bet NPR is one of them - that makes certain commitments to certain editorial processes and investments in editorial apparatus in order to achieve certain results on Facebook 'cause Facebook brings a lot of traffic. It's where users are. And then when Facebook somewhat capriciously decides to change its strategy, it hurts all the organizations that are dependent upon Facebook.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 This is where I drop the now somewhat loaded editorial disclosure that NPR receives money from Facebook to produce video content which appears on NPR's Facebook pages.             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 But look how virtuous you are, having a critic of Facebook on air.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 (Laughter) In this book, you don't just argue that we should be clear-eyed about the costs of these free services. You argue that this is actually an existential threat. Explain what that threat is.             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 So if you're of a certain age, you have a good appreciation for the ways in which we've all become a little bit cyborg. I grew up using maps and having a sense of direction, and now I have a phone. I used to try to remember numbers, and now I have - I can just call them up instantly. And that's great. But what's happening right now is that we're in a phase of human evolution where we're merging with machines. And...             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 But why is that a bad thing? Like, so what?             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 So these companies - it's not necessarily a bad thing. But we're not just merging with machines. We've been merging with tools since the beginning of human evolution. And arguably, that's one of the things that makes us human beings. But what we're merging with are machines that are run by companies that act as filters for the way in which we interact and process the world. And so the values of those companies become our values.             </p><p>                We become dependent on these companies in a way in which we've never really been dependent on companies before. And this could all work out in a utopian, beautiful sort of way, or it could unfold as a dystopian sci-fi nightmare. And I just think that because the stakes are so high we have to be extra skeptical.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Are there regulations, are there checks to make sure that, for example, Facebook doesn't manipulate the outcome of an election or Amazon doesn't bury the search results for a book that's critical of Amazon?             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 So the Internet was invented in an age when our entire approach to regulation has been extremely lax. And so you'd think, OK, there must be a law on the books that governs how these corporations can handle our data. Well, you can kind of pull pieces of code - I mean U.S. code - from here and there...             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Not digital code...             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 Not digital code.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 ...But legal code.             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 Legal code that shows, you know, maybe instances where companies could potentially cross boundaries. But there really isn't a coherent approach that we have to regulating these companies. And so they have an incredible amount of freedom.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Europe is way ahead of the U.S. on regulating these companies. They've levied fines against Google for monopolies and other things like that. What's going on here?             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 In my view, the Europeans are acting more American than the Americans, that there's this proud American tradition of worrying about the power of communication companies, that going all the way back to the founding we've tried to limit the power of monopolies that played a role in our democracy. And so even with the U.S. Postal Service, to take the first communications monopoly in the United States, we didn't let them get into the telegraph business. And when Western Union got a monopoly in the telegraph business, we were careful not to let them get into telephony.             </p><p>                And so when I look at what the Europeans are doing and the concerns that they're showing for privacy, which is a concept that Americans essentially invented, when you look at their concern for preserving a competitive marketplace, which is a very, very American concept, I say bravo. Thank you for behaving in a very apple-pie-and-baseball sort of way.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Franklin Foer's new book is \"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat Of Big Tech.\" Thanks for talking with us.             </p><p>FRANKLIN FOER:                 Thanks.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF JAMIE XX'S \"OBVS\")            </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-201709112009</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PFY-6S21-DY1J-T4SJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 11, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CY6C</classCode><className>YELP!

We saw this with Yelp and Google, where Yelp was this great way to get recommendations about what restaurant to go to, and it used to be when you type in a restaurant name into Google, the Yelp review was the first thing that came up. Well, Google saw that this was a good business to be in and so they started to publish their own user reviews of restaurants, and suddenly, those leap-frogged over Yelp.</p><p>And so I think we accept these platforms as being neutral, they pose as neutral. Even if you look at their looks - a search engine seems like it's a mechanical thing, but it's not a mechanical thing. It imposes the economic interests of these companies on the platform, and it imposes their values on the platform as well.</p><p>On how tech companies' algorithms are not impartial</p><p>All these algorithms are constructed by human beings to serve human purposes. They're systems, and these systems are devised in order to create certain outcomes. And so the fact that they're so invisible, I think actually enhances their power because most people have the dimmest awareness, if any awareness at all, that Facebook is being patterned to try to give them some information above others.</p><p>Right now, Facebook is obsessed with promoting video because that's where money is to be had. So right now, Facebook is loading up your News Feed in order to give you much more video. And there are all these media companies - I bet NPR is one of them - that makes certain commitments to certain editorial processes and investments in certain editorial apparatus in order to achieve certain results on Facebook because Facebook brings a lot of traffic. It's where users are. And then when Facebook, somewhat capriciously, decides to change its strategy, it hurts all of the organizations that are dependent upon Facebook.</p><p>Disclosure: Facebook pays NPR and other leading news organizations to produce live video streams that run on the site.</p><p>On why the threat of big tech companies is an existential one</p><p>If you're of a certain age, you have a good appreciation for the ways in which we've all become a little bit cyborg. I grew up using maps and having a sense of direction, and now I have a phone. I used to try to remember numbers, and now I ... can just call them up instantly. And that's great. But what's happening right now is that we're in a phase of human evolution where we're merging with machines.</p><p>It's not necessarily a bad thing, but we're not just merging with machines. We've been merging with tools since the beginning of human evolution and arguably, that's one of the things that makes us human beings. But what we're merging with [now] are machines that are run by companies that act as filters for the way in which we interact and process the world.</p><p>And so the values of those companies become our values. We become dependent on these companies in a way in which we've never really been dependent on companies before. And this could all work out in a utopian, beautiful sort of way, or it could unfold as a dystopian, sci-fi nightmare. And I just think that because the stakes are so high, we have to be extra skeptical.</p><p>On the lack of regulation to limit the influence of tech companies</p><p>The Internet was invented in an age when our entire approach to regulation has been extremely lax, and so you'd think, \"OK, there might be a law on the books that governs how these corporations can handle our data.\"</p><p>Well, you could kind of pull pieces of [legal] code ... that shows maybe instances where companies could potentially cross boundaries, but there really isn't a coherent approach that we have to regulating these companies, and so they have an incredible amount of freedom. ...</p><p>There's this proud American tradition of worrying about the power of communication companies. That going all the way back to the founding, we've tried to limit the power of monopolies that played a role in our democracy. And so even with the U.S. Postal Service to take the first communications monopoly in the United States, we didn't let them get into the telegraph business. And when Western Union got a monopoly in the telegraph business, we were careful not to let them get into telephony.</p><p>And this extends even into our own era back up into the Clinton administration when they put pressure on Microsoft, and really hemmed them in it came to the browser. And were it not for the case that the United States brought against Microsoft, Google probably would've been strangled in its crib.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRTEC-550177421</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRTEC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PFW-X1X1-JDH3-S0X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 National Public Radio \u00ae All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Tech Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 11, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CZVS</classCode><className>CONSUMER RATINGS &amp; REVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001483</classCode><className>RESTAURANT REVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001482</classCode><className>RESTAURANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001483</classCode><className>RESTAURANT REVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001536</classCode><className>SEARCH ENGINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

SOC SCI</p><p>Journalist and author Foer (How Soccer Explains the World) looks at the sociological impact of the Internet to determine how consumers are increasingly dependent upon Facebook for social interaction, Google for information, and Amazon for shopping. Foer describes how these companies collect significant amounts of data about users and, in turn, use this information to manipulate consumer behavior, including their political activities. In particular, the author is dissatisfied with the way journalistic ethics have been abandoned in the quest for the online audience. He explains, \"The election of Donald Trump came with\u2026a sense that we need more committed protectors of truth than the feckless gatekeepers at Facebook and Google.\" He is also distressed that these companies, founded upon idealistic concepts, now use aggressive tax avoidance policies and intensive lobbying to promote their own interests and preserve their bottom line. While Foer pleads for government regulation of the industry, he finds a glimmer of hope in recent statistics that show a preference for paper books over digital formats, giving readers an increased sense of privacy. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> A brief, timely book well worth reading for anyone concerned with privacy.\u2014Harold D.

Steven is an expert in Israeli stock market. We discussed Israel's booming tech sector and the BlueStar Israel Technology ETF ITEQ[8] that focuses on Israeli tech companies.;Israel has more than 90 companies listed on the Nasdaq. Big tech giants have many R...enters located in the country. In particular, Israeli companies are leaders in cybersecurity and autonomous vehicles technologies.Steven explained how such a small country with a population of about 9 million, became a high-tech hub.Given Israel's location, geopolitical risks remain high. We discussed how Israeli companies continue to thrive despite challenges.We then talked about the index, which includes tech companies listed in Israel as well as globally. Steven described how companies are selected and weighted in the index.The ETF holds some well-known companies like Check Point CHKP[9], AmdocsDOX[10], NiceNICE[11], and CyberArkCYBR[12]. These companies are very global in their operations and there are some that are focused on the domestic market.Many US investors have a lot of exposure to US tech and the sector has delivered excellent performance over the past few years. But now there are concerns about increased regulatory oversight and stretched valuations.Steven explained why investors should take a look at this ETF given very low representation of Israeli tech stocks in broader tech indexes.We also talked about BlueStar's indexes in Israel that are increasingly being used by domestic investors, and why that is relevant for ITEQ.To learn more about this ETF, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.iteqetf.com/fund\">http://www.iteqetf.com/fund</url>/[13]And please visit the ETF section of zacks.com for more information on this ETF and other ETFs.Please make sure to tune in for our next podcast.

Elizabeth Warren says her plan to break up Big Tech\u00a0includes severing Amazon\u2019s Marketplace and Basics line of products from the company and reversing what she calls its anti-competitive acquisitions of Whole Foods and Zappos.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least four other candidates vying for the Democratic nomination have also voiced support for antitrust action, although they\u2019ve been lighter on specifics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And yet when it comes to prognosticating Amazon\u2019s future, experts like NYU marketing professor Scott Galloway and Atlantic writer Franklin Foer say that if anything, it\u2019s Amazon\u2019s highly profitable cloud-computing business Amazon Web Services, more commonly known by its acronym, AWS, that will become a separate company.</p><p>There are strong opinions for and against a spinoff, but one thing seems clear: Whatever happens, it will be Amazon\u2019s decision.</p><p>Spinning off AWS, the company\u2019s $400-billion business, is all about self-preservation. No one Adweek spoke with thinks Amazon wants to sever AWS, but some said it may choose that path to control its own destiny, effectively making AWS a sacrificial offering to the regulatory gods.</p><p>Matthew Wilson, associate professor of political science at Southern Methodist University, sees spinning off AWS as a potential strategy to preempt regulators.</p><p>\u201cIf the writing is on the wall and pressure is building for regulatory action \u2026 then [Amazon] might decide to do it in a way they can control,\u201d Wilson said.</p><p>The goal for Amazon would be retaining its other properties thereafter and keeping them intact.</p><p>Eric Clemons, professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School, noted that AWS isn\u2019t a problem from an antitrust perspective as it faces competition from Microsoft, Rackspace, Salesforce and SAP.</p><p>What is more potentially problematic is how Amazon uses the data it has on its third-party sellers\u2014which is under investigation in Europe\u2014and digital assistant Alexa as it evolves into more of a life control system within customers\u2019 homes. Pointing to the latter, Clemons said, think of an Alexa-enabled refrigerator that knows the eggs are going to go bad and reorders them from Whole Foods without any action on the customer\u2019s part or letting them opt to buy the eggs from Walmart, Target or Kroger.</p><p>\u201cIf I were taking a look at a thing that was really powerful and possibly scary, it\u2019s the ability of Amazon to do my shopping for me, even before \u2026 I know I need it,\u201d Clemons said. \u201cOn the one hand, that\u2019s enormously valuable. \u2026 On the other hand, it\u2019s hard to compete.\u201d</p><p>Amazon did not respond to a request for comment on this sacrificial-lamb theory and, to be fair, Clemons was clear he does not see a spinoff coming unless CEO Jeff Bezos concludes the companies are worth more separately.</p><p>But an AWS spinoff might also appease consumers who happen to be voters. And those voters will start to demand elected officials step in if big companies act like bullies.\u201cPoliticians respond to \u2026 pressure by voters,\u201d said Bill Wilmoth, a former U.S. attorney who now practices at the firm Steptoe &amp; Johnson. \u201cEveryone sees Walmart decimate downtowns and Amazon getting rid of retail. \u2026 People may end up getting tired of that conduct by big companies in any industry and start demanding the federal government step in and be more aggressive.\u201d</p><p>More fuel to the fire: Consumers are more aware tech companies have played fast and loose with their personal data. This, in turn, could prompt the public to rise up, which Wilmoth said would be the moment Amazon decides it\u2019s best to spin off AWS.</p><p>\u201cThey always seem to be a step ahead and the government doesn\u2019t move very quickly,\u201d Wilmoth said. \u201cIf it happens, it will be Amazon\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>An AWS spinoff is also more likely if a Democrat is elected in 2020. That\u2019s in part because Republicans are far less likely to pursue an enforcement action or try to extend antitrust laws, said Colin Kass, a partner at the law firm Proskauer who is also co-chair of its antitrust group.</p><p>\u201cSubstantially reducing the size and footprint of the company by spinning off AWS may help to mitigate [additional scrutiny under a future administration],\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo, while it\u2019s not the primary consideration, the partisan political climate is one factor shaping Amazon\u2019s decisions on how to structure itself going forward.\u201d</p><p>However, if Amazon can simply keep its nose clean, it might be able to avert antitrust action altogether, Wilmoth said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in West Virginia. Here, we say, \u2018Hogs feed, but pigs die,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf [Amazon is] a hog and continues to grow nicely and [doesn\u2019t] get too aggressive, they will thrive, they\u2019ll feed. If they overreach, the government will eventually perhaps intervene and cut them up.\u201d</p><p>The argument against spinning off AWS centers on lack of motivation, evidence and precedent.</p><p>Melissa Burdick, a 10-year Amazon veteran who is now co-founder and president of ecommerce platform Pacvue, said she doesn\u2019t expect Amazon to spin off AWS unless it is forced to by the government.</p><p>\u201cI think Amazon will fight tooth and nail [against being broken up],\u201d she said, adding that we\u2019re already seeing Amazon proactively talk about what a small percentage of retail it controls as a means to that end.</p><p>Warren\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but the plan posted on her website says she would \u201cappoint regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,\u201d like Amazon\u2019s deals with Whole Foods and Zappos.</p><p>Yet the $400-billion question is whether Amazon is, in fact, anti-competitive. According to the Federal Trade Commission, that would mean behaving in a way that \u201c[reduces] competition and [leads] to higher prices, reduced quality or levels of service or less innovation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is important to note that it is not illegal for a company to have a monopoly, to charge \u2018high prices\u2019 or to try to achieve a monopoly position by aggressive methods,\u201d the FTC\u2019s website says of anti-competitive behavior. \u201cA company violates the law only if it tries to maintain or acquire a monopoly through unreasonable methods.\u201d</p><p>Anindya Ghose, professor of business at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Amazon is not doing that and questioned why the government would look at a company unless there was misconduct.</p><p>\u201cWhat [is Amazon] doing that is wrong?\u201d he said, \u201cin any sort of legal or ethical or moral way?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to Amazon\u2019s share of the U.S. ecommerce and retail markets\u201448% and around 11%, respectively.</p><p>\u201cWalmart is way bigger, but no one is talking about Walmart,\u201d Ghose said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fashionable.\u201d Plus, he said, rather than making vertical mergers and acquisitions within a given sector to consolidate power, Amazon is expanding horizontally into spaces like digital advertising, cloud services and voice tech.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wilmoth noted the government has been \u201cpretty noninterventional in their approach to antitrust stuff\u201d since the Reagan era.</p><p>\u201cWith Reagan, they got way less confrontational in enforcement and all the administrations since then, either Democrat or Republican, had that hands-off approach,\u201d he said.</p><p>And so, without a fundamental change in the interpretation or the law itself\u2014special legislation that would prevent a company from owning a platform and selling goods on that same platform, for instance\u2014there\u2019s a precedent that indicates Amazon has nothing to worry about.</p><p>\u201cClearly you can, in theory, break up a company like AT&amp;T and Standard Oil, but you can count the number of times that has happened on one hand over the last 100 years of the Sherman Act,\u201d Kass said. \u201cCase law, I don\u2019t think, would support breaking up [tech companies] as a remedy even if you found a violation.\u201d</p><p>And, all this talk about breaking up Big Tech might also just be politicians saying what they think voters, particularly those who\u2019ve lost jobs as a result of automation, want to hear.</p><p>\u201cPoliticians on both sides of the aisle have taken this rhetoric to an extreme level,\u201d Ghose said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s all politics.

He pointed to Microsoft, which was a tech pioneer until the U.S. Department of Justice got involved in 2001, and \u201clook where this landed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is way behind the other big tech companies in every meaningful aspect.\u201d</p><p>Ghose added, \u201cI think the idea of breaking up a company because it\u2019s too big, to me, sounds unfair and extreme.\u201d</p><p>Plus, Burdick said, one of the best things about Amazon is \u201cit\u2019s really into disrupting markets that need disrupting,\u201d (like healthcare). And, without AWS to drive margins, Amazon\u2019s other businesses would face additional pressures, such as having less money to experiment with and therefore fewer swings like Amazon Go.</p><p>\u201cR&amp;D takes time and money,\u201d Burdick said. \u201cThey\u2019re able to self-fund a lot of stuff.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1092281</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBY-3B11-JC8H-T0NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 25, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Take Instagram and WhatsApp away from Facebook, Inc. and say goodbye to Russian trolls, fake news, privacy invasions and an algorithm that shows what Facebook wants you to see?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Much of the online chatter can be summed up in two words: nice dream.</p><p> \"It would not solve the problem,\" says Boston based blogger Josh Bernoff. \"Breaking up Facebook would enable us to have 3 data abusers (Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) instead of one, and I'm not sure why that's better.\"</p><p> The gist of Hughes' Op-Ed and subsequent media tour among many TV shows is that the government needs to take action on behalf of consumers, as it did with AT&amp;T back in 1984.</p><p> Running for president, candidate Elizabeth Warren agreed with Hughes, weighing in on the side of a breakup, and using the hashtag #BreakUpBigTech. Senator Warren (D-Mass.), who wants to apply the hatchet to Facebook, Google and Amazon, says the big tech firms have \"bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p> Alex Kruglov, the founder of small online video gaming startup pop.in, is with Warren and Hughes. Taking away Instagram and WhatsApp would \"create an environment of more competition,\" he says.</p><p> Snapchat invented the idea of disappearing photos, and when Facebook embraced the idea and tried to buy the company, but was rebuffed, Facebook responded by copying the idea and using it on Instagram. The Instagram Story feature is now used by over 500 million people daily, while Snapchat has under 200 million active daily users.</p><p> Kruglov says situations like this, with government monitoring, would open the playing field and make it fairer. What it wouldn't do is get rid of fake news, trolls and the like, but he believes government regulation that enabled competition would have a natural effect of diluting these voices.</p><p> Just like with regulation of utilities and auto companies, regulation would shift the power from the social network back to users, says Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst with Kaleido Insights.</p><p> He doesn't support the idea of a breakup, however, because that would just create consumer confusion, he says.</p><p> We like connecting via Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, because it makes it easier to use the services, just like we like signing on to websites via Facebook connect. And if Facebook had that taken away, some other company, probably Google, would just swoop in and try to connect everyone via its system, he says.</p><p> Readers, what do you think? Should Facebook be broken up?</p><p> In other tech news this week:</p><p> Google held it's big I/O conference for app developers this week, announcing new low-cost phones and a rebranding of Google Home products. Google looked to address consumer burnout over super-expensive smartphones with a new Pixel smartphone for $399. It's not waterproof and doesn't offer wireless charging, but then it doesn't cost $1,000 either. Our Ed Baig says the Pixel 3A phone is a better deal that the Pixel 3, which starts at $799. Google also lent some confusion to its Alexa rival, the Google Home line. Remember that Google Home Hub we loved when it was released last year? It's now called the Nest Home Hub because, well, Google owns Nest, which makes several home automation products, and wanted to beef up the Nest name. A larger edition, selling for $230, the Nest Home Hub Max, will be released in the summer. It will also feature a video camera that follows users around the home, similar to Facebook's Portal device.</p><p> Bret Kinsella, who pens the Voicebot,.ai blog, says we could expect Google to change the name of the Google Home speakers to Nest Home later this year.</p><p> Ride-hailing company Uber went public on Friday, but didn't have a great day, closinbg at $41.57, down from the opening price of $45 a share.</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made a detailed pitch for flying astronauts to the moon by 2024. Blue Origin, the rocket venture from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, will launch a manned mission to the moon, in just a few years. Only three nations have successfully landed on the moon: U.S., Russia and China.</p><p> This week's Talking Tech podcasts:</p><p> While we were away visiting Spain and Portugal, we had several talented folks filling in for us on Talking Tech, and some reruns as well.</p><p> \u2014Veteran analyst Tim Bajarin offered us a preview of Apple's upcoming WWDC developer conference.</p><p> \u2014Shannon Rae Green and Dusty Terrill, the duo that hosts USA TODAY's \"I Tell My Husband The News,\" podcast, weighed in on schools banning Uber Eats.</p><p> \u2014From the vault: our #TalkingTech sitdown with singer Ariana Grande.</p><p> \u2014Melissa Kirsch from \"The Upgrade by Lifehacker\" podcast filled for us with thoughts on how to get off the grid.</p><p> \u2014From the vault: one of our all-time favorites, Talking Tech with comedian Lewis Black.</p><p> That's a wrap for the Talking Tech newsletter.

Googlelooked to address consumer burnout over super-expensive smartphones with a new Pixel smartphone for $399. It's not waterproof and doesn't offer wireless charging, but then it doesn't cost $1,000 either. Our Ed Baig says the Pixel 3A phone is a better deal that the Pixel 3, which starts at $799. Googlealso lent some confusion to its Alexa rival, the GoogleHome line. Remember that GoogleHome Hub we loved when it was released last year? It's now called the Nest Home Hub because, well, Googleowns Nest, which makes several home automation products, and wanted to beef up the Nest name. A larger edition, selling for $230, the Nest Home Hub Max, will be released in the summer. It will also feature a video camera that follows users around the home, similar to Facebook's Portal device.</p><p> Bret Kinsella, who pens the Voicebot,.ai blog, says we could expect Googleto change the name of the GoogleHome speakers to Nest Home later this year.</p><p> Ride-hailing company Uber went public on Friday, but didn't have a great day, closinbg at $41.57, down from the opening price of $45 a share.</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made a detailed pitch for flying astronauts to the moon by 2024.

So no wonder there's such excitement over The Hut Group, the business founded in 2004 by Matthew Moulding that's shooting for a racy \u00a34.5 billion valuation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His Hut's chocka with all kinds of stuff: seven owned \"prestige\" beauty brands plus the Lookfantastic, Skinstore and Mankind websites providing a \"critical route to market\" for 850-plus brands it doesn't own; the Myprotein family of bars and shakes essential to Mr Moulding's habitual shirt-free look; an Ocadoesque tech platform, Ingenuity, bringing the whole \"ecosystem\" of direct-to-consumer ecommerce to more than 1,000 third-party customers, delighting in Hut's skills at everything from warehousing to \"deep consumer insights\"; and, of course, the Hale Country Club in Cheshire, unrelated apparently to the Quindell one \"built on quicksand\".</p><p>What do you call this sort of business? Well, Mr Moulding, 48, calls it a \"vertically integrated digital-first consumer brands group\". Or that, at least, is his short version. And he wants to raise \u00a3920 million for extra branding ammo. It requires no less than eight banks: a red flag, given the typically inverse relation between the number of financial promoters on a float and the success of the listed group. Four of Hut's - Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Cazenove, HSBC and Numis - were part of the dozen at the wheel of Aston Martin's car crash listing.</p><p>Still, eight banks is just for starters. To liven things up, Mr Moulding is also flouting most governance rules. He owns a 17 per cent stake. But he's still insisting on being chairman and chief executive. Even better, for two years he's demanding a \"founder share\": a poison pill that bulletproofs the group from takeover. On top, he's also becoming the group's landlord via the pre-float wheeze of transferring its properties to his personal ownership. He says that, together with the IPO money being raised, that'll leave Hut a stronger business with net cash. But it'll also hand him \u00a319 million a year in rent. One other thing: he wants a bonus scheme that'll land him \u00a3700 million of shares if Hut's value reaches an admittedly stretching \u00a37.25 billion in the next two years.</p><p>In short, Hut's float is designed to wind up the governance wonks. Yet could Mr Moulding's outfit fit the bill for less squeamish investors? Well, no question he deserves credit for turning a Manchester start-up into a fast-growing business employing more than 7,000 people: one with the zeitgeist offer, too, of helping more businesses get online. The London market's short of big tech stocks growing sales by a quarter a year. He's not cashing in any of his own shares. And expect float endorsements from third parties, more impressive, too, than Homebase opting to use Ingenuity: a platform already boasting the likes of Nestl\u00e9 and Coca-Cola.</p><p>Yet the valuation is punchy, even as a multiple of last year's \u00a31.1 billion sales and \u00a3111 million \"adjusted ebitda\". Look through the myriad adjustments and Hut had a \u00a349.1 million pre-tax loss to go with losses of \u00a310.3 million in 2018 and \u00a311.3 million in 2017. Acquisitions skew the figures and even the \"adjusted ebitda margin\" is no stunner at 9.8 per cent.</p><p>Despite Hut's pukka investor register, with other blue chips apparently keen to join, it's no great vote of confidence that top shareholder KKR wants to sell its entire 17.8 per cent stake, even if other big investors aren't selling. And the main foil to Mr Moulding's control-freakery is Zillah Byng-Thorne, the senior independent director already thinly spread as the boss of publisher Future and a Flutter and Gocompare non-exec. Indeed, structured as it is, the float is a pricey punt on Mr Moulding. He obviously thinks Hut's key brand is him.</p><p>                   Walsh's shabby do                   </p><p>Willie Walsh typically avoids pay rows. As British Airways chief, he gave up 2008's bonus after the Heathrow Terminal 5 opening day fiasco. During the financial crisis, he refused to accept 543,103 performance shares in 2009 and \u00a3334,000 of deferred shares in 2010. And then as boss of BA and Iberia's parent IAG, he froze his 2012 and 2013 salary at 2011 levels. Between 2015 and 2019, he's declined a rise in his \u00a3850,000 basic pay. Corona saw him take a 20 per cent pay cut.</p><p>So what is Mr Walsh doing taking an \u00a3883,000 bonus now? He retires at next Tuesday's annual meeting: one heading for an investor revolt, with proxy voting agency ISS calling for a vote against the pay report. Yes, technically the bonus was for last year's performance and half of it will be in deferred shares.

Its impact is clear now, right down to IAG's (EURO)2.75 billion cash-call. And it's hardly as if Mr Walsh needs the money. The bonus is part of \u00a33.2 million total pay last year. Indeed, he's earned \u00a333 million in nine years running IAG. Mr Walsh should waive his bonus.

'It's kind of embarrassing,' she grimaces. Really, she just wanted the pants: a special-edition pair of Imogene + Willie jeans in a vintage wash with a frayed raw hem that cost around $200. 'I don't usually shop like that. I don't usually buy new things, period' \u2014 but the pants were on sale, and she liked them, and 'they were kind of an impulse buy,' facilitated by a new kind of point-of-sale personal loan from a company called Affirm[1].Co-founded by former PayPal chief technology officer Max Levchin, Affirm promises a clear-cut, premium consumer credit experience. </p><p>Since its start in 2012, the company has partnered with more than 1,000 retailers across a variety of categories to make more than 1 million loans with simple interest and predictable pay schedules. The installment loans, made at 10-30 percent annual percentage rates, or APR, and averaging $750 according to the company, are offered for everything from mattresses and plane tickets to motorized skateboards and coding classes to $500 boots and $200 limited-edition denim. Backed by more than half a billion dollars[2] in investments and debt, Affirm is hardly at the radical fringe of consumer finance. It's been dubbed 'the credit card killer.'[3] For merchants[4], Affirm provides exceptional benefits, increasing average order values across the board; perhaps not surprisingly, people will shop more, and more often, when they don't immediately feel the costs. And for many customers, including Jocelyn, the predictable, convenient payments are worth the higher interest rates. Affirm claims to be a more transparent and honest, if not cheaper, line of credit for the underserved. Using internal, proprietary data science and artificial intelligence, the company says it approves 126 percent more borrowers than traditional lenders, based on soft credit pulls[5] and an opaque mosaic of consumer information. Critics say Affirm promotes the worst consumer behavior[6]: carrying high-cost debt for unnecessary goods. Affirm loans don't just allow but entice you to buy something you can't afford in one lump sum. But the loans aren't Affirm's real product \u2014 they're a means to building and perfecting a new underwriting system to determine consumer creditworthiness, powered by machine learning and your personal data. 'Our goal is to be the app on your home screen for all of your financial needs,' says co-founder Max Levchin. 'We are starting by reinventing credit because we believe it is fundamentally broken.' It may still be outmatched by legacy financial companies and big tech firms getting into the payments business, but Affirm seems to mark a new age in the messy business of consumer finance \u2014 one where you too might choose to take out a high-cost pants loan.Over the last century in America, each new small-scale consumer debt product has weathered waves of adoption, regulation, and easing, dictated by the larger economic and political patterns of the country. But arguably no consumer device has proven quite as disruptive as the credit card.After the most recent recession, Congress gained the rare courage to regulate at least some financial institutions and products. The CARD Act[7], passed in 2009, was the most significant legislation in decades to rein in fee-happy, high-interest credit cards. The CARD Act also barred companies from soliciting new customers on college campuses, which helped decrease the number of young people in possession of plastic. For the most part, though, banks and credit cards are regulated not at the federal level but by state usury laws, which limit the amount of interest a lender can charge based on where that lender is incorporated, not where customers live and spend. Which is to say, they are hardly regulated at all, as corporations simply locate in places with corporate-friendly laws. In 2010, South Dakota-based First Premier Bank made waves for charging between 59.9 and 79.9 percent APR[8] on a MasterCard with a $300 limit. The card had nearly 300,000 active users[9] in 2011.Credit issuers rely on just a few large credit bureaus to find the best borrowers \u2014 generally people who will pay their debts, but not too quickly. The standard FICO model that grades consumer creditworthiness is often criticized for including factors that don't necessarily predict a consumer's behavior, like a late bill payment from five years ago, or hefty student loans. In 2015, 31 states won a settlement[10] that limited how credit agencies could collect and report consumer medical debt. In 2017, more new rules[11] stripped negative tax lien and civil judgment from consumer credit reports. Since then, the average FICO score[12] has risen, but many consumers have still been left behind. While more than two-thirds[13] of Americans own at least one credit card, 20 percent[14] are considered subprime, with a FICO score of 600 or below. Another 10 percent are on the bubble.The ethics of lending to the subprime are not particularly clear. Thanks to FICO's market dominance, a subprime consumer may have the ability to repay a loan, but be denied based on financial mistakes he or she made several years in the past. Without access to traditional methods of capital, the subprime are relegated to high-cost tools and services. This is the reluctant, conditional argument in favor of payday lenders, which make money available to people who would otherwise have nowhere else to go, even when they charge on average more than 300 percent APR[15] for small personal loans. And with nearly 50 percent of Americans without $400[16] to cover an emergency expense, the implication is that these loans cover the necessities: rent, utilities, groceries. We accept the inevitability and the usefulness of some debt, and of some people making some money from servicing it. Perhaps it was only a matter of time until American late capitalism was forced to grapple with the mechanisms and ethics of an installment loan product extended purely for the purchase of a pair of pants.Affirm wasn't originally built for pants loans, or at least that's not the founding folklore[17]: Peter Thiel was tired of driving a carless Max Levchin around after they'd sold PayPal, the story goes, but Levchin couldn't qualify for financing on his own. Despite being a prominent member of the PayPal mafia[18], he'd made common 20-something credit mistakes, and had the bad FICO score to prove it. Nathan Gettings, one of Thiel's co-founders at the secretive data analysis and services company Palantir, went on to co-found Affirm with Levchin and former CTO Jeffrey Kaditz. Founders Fund, which Thiel co-organized, led Affirm's $100 million Series D funding round[19] in April 2016, which valued the company at $700 million. 'The core thesis behind Affirm is that there's a large segment of Americans who don't have access to fair and transparent credit, and there's a large part of the population that's mispriced because of the outdated FICO score and the existing credit system,' says Affirm's chief of staff and head of international expansion Ryan Metcalf. Affirm's original flagship consumer product is a new user experience for an old idea: the short-term installment loan, made at the point of sale in partnership with retailers. Where other installment services such as Bread[20], Splitit[21], and Partial.ly[22] work with existing lines of credit and point-of-sale services to create predictable installments for shoppers, Affirm services its own loans but it does not originate them. Affirm may look and act much like a lender, but it's really an asset-backed securitizer[23]; its loans are made by partner Cross River Bank in New Jersey, then Affirm buys the loans back and holds the risk itself. Cross River originates loans for more than a dozen other online lending platforms. In November 2016, it raised $28 million[24] to invest in more support for its financial technology, or fintech, partners and grow its own stable of payment products.While Affirm offers a variable APR between 10 and 30 percent, the upper limit allowed in New Jersey[25], Levchin and Metcalf are loudly opposed to what they consider Affirm's predatory competition. 'You need not look any further than the fact that credit card companies made more profit in fees last year than in interest income,' says Levchin. 'We did not want to be associated with payday lenders or subprime lenders. We think high-fee credit cards are egregious,' Metcalf tells me. 'We realized early on we weren't going to become the most profitable bank in the world \u2014 if and when we become a bank.' Affirm's interest is simple, not compounding, and the added fees are nonexistent. Still, the company's brand of 'ethical lending' and 'honest finance' features a median APR of 19 percent, which hovers between the national credit card average[26] and the national credit-card-for-bad-credit average. For someone with other options, using Affirm is a choice that carries a higher price tag along with greater convenience and clarity. 'Our challenge is we're not a bank,' says Metcalf. 'We don't have the lower cost of capital, so we can't compete on price. We have to compete on user experience.' It's a cost that Affirm does not hide, and one some consumers seem happy to pay. Affirm customers have an average of 2.2 loans with the company, while some shoppers have upward of 50 at a time.'It almost feels like an innovation, but it's not, or it shouldn't be,' says Tracy DiNunzio, founder and CEO of longtime Affirm partner Tradesy. 'The big Affirm innovation is that you can understand your repayment terms.' The far bigger, high-stakes Affirm innovation is its proprietary consumer risk-assessment scoring, or underwriting system. Without the fees that make upward of half of some credit card companies' revenue streams, Affirm has to make up ground with volume. The company proudly lends to consumers who the larger market and traditional credit reporting standards would define as subprime, but its default rate is 'well below the industry average,' says Metcalf. Affirm is heavily incentivized to find those good customers, bad FICO score or not. And it does so by compiling a broader, more complex, and ever-shifting set of details about every loan applicant. 'The secret sauce for the company is the underwriting,' says Jeremy Liew, who led Lightspeed Venture's Series A investment in Affirm in 2014[27]. 'The point-of-sale lending at e-commerce is simply their first application of their underwriting model.' In October, Affirm took its first big step away from a merchant-specific model with a new app that allows consumers to take out loans good for purchases at any retailer \u2014 a new opportunity for swift and wide-scale growth, and millions more loans across every retail category. 'You're buying a thing, and you're paying a fee to spread it out. Our responsibility is to make sure you have the ability and intent to pay it back in full,' says Metcalf. 'At the end of the day, if you do that, it doesn't matter what you're buying.'Fashion is Affirm's third biggest category, behind homewares and travel, and clearly the company's most vexing. The optics simply are not super-great. 'Apparel is really the only criticism we get. Like, oh my God, you're financing a pair of shoes,' says Metcalf. 'We've had this debate internally. We've had this issue with sneakers \u2014 $300, $500 sneakers \u2014 people have reactions to borrowing money for that kind of thing.' Unlike a house, an average pair of pants loses most of its value once it's purchased, and even more once it's used. Unlike a car, its central utility is largely up for debate; it cannot transport you to work or to school, though it may well be of good use when you arrive. And unlike either of those things, it is not presumed to be a large investment purchase to begin with. Betabrand[28] chief marketing officer Aaron Magness tells me he wasn't sure about offering Affirm on his company's relatively affordable items. 'The pants are $78, and the payments are $9 a month. To me, that feels kind of weird,' he says. 'Should you really be placing an order for a $100 pair of pants if you need to break it into a payment plan?'For Magness and Betabrand, that worry turned out to be unfounded. Affirm shoppers on Betabrand were of no lesser means or FICO score than non-Affirm shoppers; they were just choosing to spend this way, ordering several pieces at once. Affirm's fashion retail partners tell the same story over and over again: 'surprising,' 'extraordinary,' 'overperformed from Day 1,' 'I couldn't believe it.' Rebecca Minkoff[29] began accepting Affirm in April. 'We'll do seven figures in volume with Affirm this year,' says Uri Minkoff, creative director for the brand. 'That's just blown us away.' Affirm is not just meeting a demand, but creating one, encouraging shoppers to buy and spend more. Affirm claims an average 75 percent boost in order values across all its merchant partners. Affirm is clearly not just facilitating purchases that would have otherwise happened through other means of credit. Four retailers I spoke with reported significantly higher sales, and more frequent purchases, with Affirm customers. 'It's kind of the point of credit,' says Metcalf. 'It gives you access to things you couldn't afford on a cash basis. It doesn't mean you can't really afford it.'Affirm has also shifted consumer behavior in other ways: The short-term retail loans have helped to create a new kind of fashion economy. 'We call it cyclical commerce. It's a new rental marketplace,' says Metcalf. Just as 'the sharing economy' has proliferated in other sectors over the last 10 years, the idea of renting a dress has become as normal as hailing an Uber to go on a grocery run, or subscribing to software you once would've purchased to own. You can choose from hundreds of styles on Rent the Runway[30], along with Style Lend[31], Amarium[32], Le Tote[33], Gwynnie Bee[34], the Ms. Collection[35], Parcel 22[36], and more \u2014 even good old Ann Taylor has launched a new rental service[37]. Just as rental services have grown, so has the market for used goods. Where your local Crossroads[38] may be willfully capricious, dictated by the tastes of its particular staff, the wisdom of the crowded online resale market tends toward truer values and more efficient, personalized item sorting. Resale sites such as ThredUp[39] and Swap[40] deal largely in less expensive clothing and accessories, but Affirm partner merchants Tradesy[41] and the RealReal[42] specialize in the higher end. While a pair of $200 pants may not hold much of their value over one Affirm pay period, a designer bag will. 'Customers are leveraging credit with Affirm in order to access higher-quality fashion,' says Levchin.It's a dynamic that Tradesy's Tracy DiNunzio saw from the start: customers financing a purchase of, say, a $2,000 Chanel bag, using it for a few months, then selling it back, paying down their loan, and buying something new \u2014 all without ever extending themselves for the full price of the item. She sees it in part as a reaction to fast fashion. 'The combination of the Affirm credit and resale is just really powerful. It lets women shop for a constantly updating wardrobe without laying out very much cash at all,' says DiNunzio. 'You still get the frequency, you have new things all the time, but you're putting products back into the market when you're done with them.' Uri Minkoff has seen this new dynamic in just the few months since partnering with Affirm. 'For us, it spurs a customer who's super-brand loyal. It lets her dollars go longer,' says Minkoff. 'She's buying and reselling our product three to four times a year. Now with Instagram, you don't want to have the same handbag in more than a couple pictures.' We're no longer paying for the ownership of things, but the temporary experience of ownership for short, discrete periods of time, a kind of access that comes at a fraction of the cost, even accounting for an interest up-charge. According to our depressed wages[43], it's not that we would necessarily prefer to temporarily access things rather than own them \u2014 it's just that we're poor now.Affirm is hardly alone in its bid for a piece of the consumer debt market; credit dysfunction has inspired an entire fledgling industry of potential solutions. But with Levchin's PayPal pedigree and more than half a billion in funding, Affirm appears uniquely positioned to succeed in a crowded fintech space. 'Max was definitely a big factor in us deciding to invest in Affirm. But we also have long held the belief that underwriting was the perfect use case for machine learning,' says Lightspeed's Liew. 'We have invested in a number of other fintech companies based on this idea of machine learning-based underwriting and online distribution.' While tens of millions of underserved consumers[44] may be all but ignored by traditional financial services, fintech companies have realized the opportunity in so many Americans who are living, working, buying, and borrowing outside of traditional financial institutions: This as-of-yet overlooked customer base[45] is a captive market opportunity. The fact that these consumers are currently relegated to predatory, subprime services only makes the potential disruption more palatable.Lightspeed is also an investor in ZestFinance, which similarly uses machine learning[46] to lend to the unbanked 'who typically had to resort to payday lending,' says Liew. Dozens more fintech startups[47] are jostling to control this emerging loan market[48], to create the best underwriting model based on available consumer data, and to automate as much of the loan servicing as possible \u2014 while turning a profit, and keeping consumers satisfied. Affirm's customer ratings are, by and large, very positive. It has a Net Promoter score of 82[49], compared with a financial services industry average under 50. Its Better Business Bureau customer reviews are 84 percent positive[50], with an A+ rating. In 2015, Max Levchin joined[51] the advisory board[52] of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government watchdog that collects and acts upon complaints against financial services and institutions. The CFPB has no complaints against Affirm in its public database. However, in April, Affirm faced what appears to be its first consumer lawsuit[53] under the Fair Debt Collection Act. The main plaintiff in a potential class action alleges he'd never heard of Affirm before receiving an opaque debt collections letter saying he owed the company $141.18. He's suing Affirm along with debt collection agency Afni. Lauren Leimbach, executive director of the nonprofit Community Financial Resources[54], questions the transparency on which Affirm so intently prides itself: Is the company providing a tool for the poor and underserved who don't even have $400 to cover an emergency, or an aspirational tool for people who want to buy $400 shoes on a whim? 'I just find it disingenuous that they try to code it like they're trying to serve the underserved. They should just be honest about what they're doing,' says Leimbach, a former vice president at Providian Financial. 'Millennials are like the temporary poor, because they're young. That's a different person than people who are struggling because they've fallen out of the middle class or they can't get out of the working class.''I think that using machine learning for short-term credit is a great application. It is possible to learn and iterate for complicated credit-scoring models that really take advantage of all of the available data,' says Stanford University economist Susan Athey. 'Having a better credit model can be a key strategic advantage, and since Affirm is the first firm offering exactly this type of loan, they can get out ahead of the competition with better models.' But the competition is fierce, and the market is moving far faster than regulators could possibly hope to. 'There are no laws to protect you,' laments Leimbach. 'Consumers need to be advocating for more privacy rules around all this data, but in the meantime, companies looking to make decisions about lending money are going to try all these data elements to find what's predictive. It's rational.'Most of the negative consumer reviews Affirm receives through Net Promoter and the BBB aren't reports of being mistreated by a predatory loan servicer, but of being declined for a loan. A significant portion come from former Affirm customers reporting that, after receiving and paying down one loan, they were denied for another. 'That just seems odd. Research shows that type of behavior is very predictive of future loan paying capability,' says Leimbach. 'As a former credit person, that seems to me that there's something wrong with their model.' Affirm might agree; the model, after all, is constantly in flux by design. 'When you change the credit model, it changes the selection of consumers to take your loans,' says Athey, 'and every time you change, you then need to wait to learn whether the model really worked.' Affirm's long game is not in little interest margins on pants loans, however savvy those loans may be. A true return on the $520 million that firms have invested or loaned to Affirm as of October 2017 would be in the success of an underwriting algorithm that would surface more potential customers for credit \u2014 a risk-assessment tool that would compete with a highly centralized and criticized legacy credit bureau market that hasn't exactly proven[55] to be very tech-savvy itself. 'Banks approach us for this all the time, asking whether they can purchase everything that we've built,' says Metcalf. 'The short answer is no. It's proprietary to us; it's building our company.' The long answer, though, is probably, eventually, yes. 'I think there are great opportunities for us to leverage our own systems, perhaps in partnership with other companies, to improve our customers' lives,' says Levchin. Affirm is hardly[56] alone[57] in building and testing these tools, and FICO itself[58] is expanding its machine learning operations in order to compete. Drawing upon a vast sea of information presents opportunities for customers who've been denied other routes to credit. But predictive algorithms are also capable of becoming automated machines of discrimination despite well-meaning human inputs, purely based on the vast trove of available data and correlations between traits and behaviors. And proprietary, constantly-changing underwriting algorithms that might deem your creditworthiness based on your social media habits[59] are not easily regulated by existing[60] federal laws[61].Other would-be Affirm borrowers said they were rejected, despite their good credit scores, because they had past misdemeanor convictions. 'In February 2015 we started declining for fraud reasons, for what we considered faults of character,' says Affirm's Metcalf. 'In January of this year, we stopped. We don't decline based on criminal history anymore. We found there wasn't a significant correlation in repayments.' Affirm doesn't release data on how many consumers it rejects, but says its notice letters meet Fair Credit Reporting Act requirements. This is a perfectly legal example of a lender choosing not to lend to a potentially risky customer, in service of providing an ostensibly better product. But it also highlights an opportunity for a kind of discrimination once removed. If Affirm would reject all consumers with criminal convictions, it'd be rejecting far more people of color[62] than whites \u2014 without actually discriminating against would-be borrowers based on their race. Even the most well-trained algorithms have no inherent ethic, and have proven time[63] and[64] again[65] to reflect and arguably amplify existing biases, if not provide for decisions that violate the law outright. 'Even in situations where data miners are extremely careful, they can still effect discriminatory results with models that, quite unintentionally, pick out proxy variables for protected classes,' write Solon Barocas and Andrew D. Selbst in the California Law Review[66]. Offering different rates or products to consumers in different zip codes[67] is just one way firms can discriminate based on race without violating the letter of the law. Levchin says Affirm is committed to maintaining full compliance with lending laws, and the company takes steps to protect its machines from learning to discriminate. 'Our models use carefully designed, nonparametric statistical models. We have a clear understanding of the impact a variable has on the underwriting model's prediction,' says Levchin. 'We ensure that the candidate's set of variables to be used for model training do not pose any concern with regards to potential discrimination.' But the rise of big, opaque, life-changing data analysis has concerned lawyers, technologists, and consumer advocates from the National Consumer Law Center[68] to Obama's White House[69] for years. 'Credit-scoring tools that integrate thousands of data points, most of which are collected without consumer knowledge, create serious problems of transparency,' write Mikella Hurley and Julius Adebayo in the Yale Journal of Law and Technology[70]. 'These tools may furthermore obscure discriminatory and subjective lending policies behind a single 'objective' score.' Ultimately the algorithms that could prove to be a force in favor of opening up credit opportunities to the underserved \u2014 for pants, or otherwise \u2014 have just as much capacity to become engines driving further inequity.Almost a year since buying them and a few months since paying them off, Jocelyn Vera Zorn is still happy with her pants. 'Every month when I got the payment alert I was like, 'Yep, still wear the jeans all the time,'' she says, grinning. 'Love 'em.' For Zorn, an ideal Affirm world would be a kind of full-stack shopping credit experience. 'I got so excited about the prospect of the loans, because it's a little different from a credit card. It seems like a good way of budgeting, honing in on your clothing allowance,' she tells me. 'Like, I could just have $150 worth of loan payments out each month. Clothing is something that I spend a lot of money on, so maybe if it was all on Affirm, I could regulate it.' It's not far from Affirm's own plan for the company. In future updates, the Affirm app won't just be a means to new loan products, but a holistic personal financial management tool designed to compete with existing services such as Mint. 'Our whole proposition is: Trust us to help you manage your finances in an intuitive and automatic way,' says Metcalf. 'It'll have machine learning in the back end, connected to your bank accounts, to help you live within your means.' The app could then suggest whether you should pay in cash, or take out an Affirm loan with a 19 percent APR. 'Because we have designed our systems to understand our customers at an individual level, we are able to understand the personal needs of our customers in real time. As a result, we will have opportunities to help them in new, smart, and dynamic ways,' says Levchin. 'We plan to have an active role in the new economy and reinventing credit is really just the beginning.' Metcalf assures that 'those pieces of our company won't be profit centers.' But they will continue to feed Affirm's churning AI core with fresh private consumer detail, from your mortgage to your car to your pants payments.Most of us are not super-savvy, constant shoppers with a revolving closet of designer items. Most clothing is not very expensive, and it depreciates almost immediately. Your second monthly Affirm payment could be more than your item is now worth. Sunk cost isn't something most of us consider when we buy a pair of pants, or a sweater, a pair of shoes, a bra. It's an act of ruthless economic disassociating that can suck the joy out of any small consumer indulgence. If you've ever experienced the profound debasement[71] of attempting to resell your used clothing at a secondhand retailer, you've likely already had this brutal realization: It is nearly worthless. And yet, we need pants. Sometimes we need nice ones for work, or a formal occasion \u2014 well-draped trousers in a classic, hip-skimming cut, an investment piece that we hope to wear for seasons to come, but certainly can't afford in one lump sum. And sometimes \u2014 not often, ideally, but sometimes \u2014 we need special-edition vintage-wash jeans with a raw hem because, well, we just do.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  How much trust does a company need among its customers?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  It's nice, but it's clearly not essential. A lot of people don't trust Uber to look after its drivers or Amazon to pay taxes, but they still use their services.</p><p>  It can often come down to a judgment call. With Facebook, until now, that has been: Do you trust it with your data enough to use the service? And for most people, the answer is still (just about) yes.</p><p>  Soon you may have another: Do you trust Facebook with your cash and transaction history enough to use it for a bank?</p><p>  The company on Tuesday unveiled plans for a new cryptocurrency called Libra. Due to be in use next year, the digital token's value would be tied to traditional currencies like the dollar or euro to keep it stable.</p><p>  It would initially be used for money transfers. But one day, the company hopes, it will lead to other financial services, like loans and credit. And ultimately, Facebook would like it to become a universal digital currency for the internet.</p><p>  Many people's first taste of Libra would be through Facebook's own financial platform, Calibra, whose app and integration with Messenger and WhatsApp could allow billions of users to make and receive payments.</p><p>  ''It's the first time we have the prospect of a cryptocurrency being accessible to so many people,'' said Michel Rauchs, a cryptocurrency expert at the Center for Alternative Finance at Cambridge University.</p><p>  This could be Facebook's lifeboat if targeted ad revenues decline in the privacy-focused future that the company is pursuing in the wake of its data scandals.</p><p>Libra could allow Facebook to become intimately intertwined with the e-commerce industry, noted Rajesh Kandaswamy, an analyst at Gartner. From that, it could skim a healthy cut. It could also win part of the financial transactions market in developing countries.</p><p>  Unsurprisingly, Facebook is doing what it can to gain trust for the initiative. It says it will vest control of the currency to members of the so-called Libra Foundation, which already comprises 27 companies like Visa, Mastercard, eBay, PayPal and Uber, so it will have only limited influence on how it works. And its privacy document is surprisingly extensive.</p><p>  But there's no escaping the deep links to Facebook. The underpinning technology has been created entirely by the company. Its staff put together the Libra Foundation. Most people will experience it on the company's platforms.</p><p>  Scratch at the documentation that describes Libra, and there's more to be skeptical about. Its promise to diffuse control -- at some point in the future -- relies on technology that is not yet developed. And its privacy promise says Calibra would not share financial data with Facebook except in ''limited cases,'' but that seems to provide plenty of wiggle room.</p><p>  It's not just journalists looking for holes: Regulators and lawmakers are skeptical, too. The Senate Banking Committee plans to scrutinize Libra at a July 16 hearing. And the Group of 7 nations is apparently planning to investigate so-called stablecoins like Libra and how they will affect financial stability and money laundering.</p><p>  Such concerns are obviously heightened by Facebook's data privacy and election interference scandals. And now, it will ask users to accept all that and still trust it with their money and transaction records. Libra's success -- maybe even Facebook's -- may depend on it.</p><p>  So, back to that question: How much trust does a company need among its customers? We're about to find out.</p><p>  Big Tech's censorship headache</p><p>  Feel aggrieved that a social network took down your post? Why not sue, claiming that the company provides a digital public square that's protected by First Amendment free-speech rights?</p><p>  That's increasingly a concern for big tech companies, as demand for takedowns of troubling content swells. They had been holding their breath for the outcome of a seemingly unrelated court case about cable TV that could have made dealing with the problem harder.</p><p>  The Manhattan Neighborhood Network disciplined two contributors after a film received complaints for allegedly inciting violence. The contributors sued, claiming that MNN violated their First Amendment rights.</p><p>  If the contributors prevailed and a ruling was vague enough, it could have left the tech companies open to being sued, too. Even the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group that frequently criticizes Big Tech's content moderation, thought it could be problematic.</p><p>  ''If you force platforms to not moderate speech at all, you have a free-for-all online,'' Sophia Cope, a senior staff attorney at the foundation, said. ''There are benefits to moderated platforms,'' she continued -- say, to create coherent, niche communities.</p><p>  In a 5-to-4 decision this past Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that MNN couldn't face the lawsuits. Merely providing a forum for speech wasn't enough to open an organization up to free-speech rights.</p><p>  So, Big Tech dodged a bullet. But later in the week, Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, proposed a bill that would dent immunity of social media platforms from liability for illegal content posted by users. The new bill would demand that companies prove their content-removal practices were ''politically neutral'' to maintain immunity.</p><p>  The tech industry wasn't thrilled. ''This bill forces platforms to make an impossible choice: Either host reprehensible but First Amendment-protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism,'' Michael Beckerman, president and chief executive of the Internet Association, said in a statement.</p><p>  Senator Hawley's bill is unlikely to become law. But it underscores the narrow line that social media companies have to walk as they balance free speech, moderation, regulation and legal action.</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The United States has been hacking Russia's power grid. The Trump administration used new authority to deploy potentially crippling malware deep inside the Russian systems.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 YouTube is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission over video for kids. There's a chance of a fine for the way YouTube collected data about children and allowed them to see harmful content. The company has been weighing changes to the way it handles children's videos.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 You don't want to work at a Facebook moderation center. At its worst-performing such sites in North America, one contractor has died at his desk and conditions are often unsanitary.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Slack went public. After Slack listed its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange, they began trading on Thursday at $38.50, valuing the company at $23.1 billion -- more than triple the $7.1 billion valuation from its last funding round.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Huawei predicts a huge hit from President Trump's attacks. Sales expectations fell to $100 billion for this year and next, from estimates of $125 billion for this year, after the company was blacklisted from trading with American businesses.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Google pledged to help ease the San Francisco housing crisis. It will invest $1 billion in land and money to build homes in the Bay Area.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Big Tech antitrust battles could take us back to the future.

So good morning, everybody, and welcome to Sea Containers, the home of WPP and many of its great agencies.</p><p>I think at the start of a new decade, we thought it appropriate to share with you why we're optimistic about the future for WPP and why we believe we start with tremendous strengths in the technology area and why the changes and investments that we've made over the last 18 months, building on the strengths that we had are starting to have an impact. There's no doubt that technology is changing marketing, but we believe that our mission of creativity powered by technology is the right one. It's the right one for our clients who are looking to change their marketing. It's the right one for our people who want to do fantastic work. And last, and by no means least, it's the right one for our shareholders. And today, we set out our strategy and leave it for you to judge how effective you think that will be.</p><p>So we start with the obligatory safe harbor statement, so you can read that quickly.</p><p>The themes that we're going to cover today center really on 4 areas: around growth, what's the growth opportunity for WPP as marketing and technology collide. Transformation, how we're transforming our business for the benefit of our clients and for growth because really growth is critical to WPP. What's our technology strategy. For the first time, we have a sort of top-down approach to technology, how is that going to come to life and Stephan will talk about that later. And lastly, through the breakout sessions, we'll cover the capabilities we have today through case studies and show you how we're helping our clients to transform and grow.</p><p>And then the starting point, I think we all know that marketing and technology colliding is reshaping how clients need to approach marketing. And we look at really 5 forces here that we'll just cover shortly in more detail. The first is digital media is now leading. It's no longer sort of an analog world with digital to fill in the gaps. Digital is leading. There's a democratization of content creation and content consumption.</p><p>All of the growth is in e-commerce. We like to say today that every company, to some extent, is an e-commerce company, not just retailers but banks or airlines, so skills in e-commerce are critical to companies. We have a lot of strength in that area. The big technology companies are really reshaping the world. And last is a tsunami of data that's changing how business people make decisions, how marketers make decisions and the types of decisions you can make. Also changes how you can reach audiences, how you can target them with messages and how you can measure the results.</p><p>So taking each of those in turn. And it's critical to understand that digital media is now leading today. GroupM estimate that 52% of media is digital, 48% of media is analog. In some markets, China, the U.K., it's more than 52%. In some markets, India, it's less than 52%. But there's no doubt that the direction of travel has changed. It's no longer the case that sort of digital is the stuff you do after you've done your marketing plan. It's now integral to the way that you reach consumers, which is the reason we believe it's integral, it's integrated into the overall marketing effort.</p><p>Second thing to understand is that, increasingly, we're trading with digital media vendors sort of technologically as programmatic media has gone from 10% of digital display to 2/3 of digital display in just 9 years. Our transactions with vendors, the data that we get is increasingly technologically driven rather than driven by hand. And the impact of all these changes are a fragmentation of audience, making it harder for our clients to reach mass audiences as simple as they can, but also easier for them to target specific audiences with messages, giving them new opportunities.</p><p>There's a personalization of marketing, again, it makes it more challenging to communicate broader mass markets, but actually gives our clients opportunities to hit consumers at the right point at the right time with the right message.</p><p>The volume of creative that clients need is exploding. You'll see some of the work that we're doing in production to deal with reducing the cost of content creation in a world where the volume is not twice or 3x but 10x or 20x or sometimes several thousand times the volume of creative that we need.</p><p>Important to understand that the worlds of commerce and content are increasingly merging. You guys have Instagram. You see a photo, you can buy what you see with 3 clicks. So the old days of the marketing department and the sales department sitting in different divisions [can now be] brought together inside our clients, certainly from a consumer perspective.</p><p>And last, but by no means least, with WPP the world's largest media planner and buyer, we need to understand the value of scale in our business. There's no doubt that media scale in terms of volume is still important. It's important to get the best deals, it's important to have beat a early access to technology with clients. It's also key that the scale is shifting from volume of buying to data scale, and we think that with GroupM, with the scale that it has in our business, we'll protect that through the investments they're making in technology.</p><p>So our business has got a lot more complicated. We don't think that makes it any less important. We just think it makes it a little bit tougher for us.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that content creation and consumption is democratizing. We're living in sort of a bipolar world in many ways. WPP's 4 largest media partners are on one side Comcast and Disney; on the other side Google and Facebook, by some distance over the #5 player. So you have 2 companies with highly significant investments in content, 2 companies that are really taking much more content that's created by consumers. You see a world where we expect to have 1 billion subscription video-on-demand players in the next 5 years. Next week, Comcast will launch Peacock, their foray or their initiative in advertiser-funded video-on-demand, and we're very optimistic actually about the potential for advertiser-funded video-on-demand. The evidence says that with lower ad loads, better-quality advertisements, consumers will still watch that. And actually, for many of the generation that grow up not paying for content, we think advertiser-funded video-on-demand will be a very attractive option for them.</p><p>You see growth in new media platforms, TikTok reaching 1 billion users faster than anyone, putting us under -- putting regulators under pressure to understand what it means when a Chinese social media company that has 1 billion users also showing how quickly these platforms can grow.</p><p>A critical audience for our clients has always been sort of the 18 to 34-year-old audience. And here, you can see the impact to these consumption changes happening much more quickly. In the U.S., traditional TV viewing is down 40% since 2015 and internet-based viewing is up 28% -- sorry, has a 28% share of viewing in that audience. So understanding and reaching those consumers through internet-based channels is also critical.</p><p>And then we take the 2 sort of players on the right-hand side, so it's about Google and Facebook. YouTube today, 5 billion views watched. Instagram, a major source of product discovery. So this whole world of content, creation and consumption is changing in many, many ways.</p><p>The third point we talked about was e-commerce. And today, more than 100% of retail growth in nearly all markets that are trying to find an exception is in e-commerce. So if clients do not have the right e-commerce strategy, they will not succeed. So figuring out what we do with Amazon, how we build our own channels to consumers, how we merchandise through walmart.com or tesco.com is a critical skill for our clients. It's also a big growth opportunity for WPP since the acquisitions we've made in the e-commerce area, an area of strength for us in discussions we can have from our clients. And when you think about those 2 trends of the sort of the decline of mass media and the decline of mass retail and the lack of scarcity in both the media market and in the retail market, you can see why many packaged goods companies are facing challenges, because those 2 kind of easy routes-to-market or 2 easier strategies are now challenged.</p><p>Big tech companies are driving a lot of this change, and I'd say no one is safe. And we live in a world where more than ever before, our clients' businesses, whether that's in automotive or retail or packaged goods or even luxury goods, are being transformed by technology. 10 years ago, there were 2 technology companies in the world's most valuable companies; today there are 7. With Saudi Aramco, we're deciding whether to include or exclude it at the top of the chart. But depending on how you think about it, it's still 7 of the 10 world's largest companies are now technology companies.</p><p>And what they do and how they operate and the products they launch are changing the world in a way that other companies need to adapt. Now my view is and our view is that probably no company knows many of these businesses better than WPP. And we are Google's single largest customer, they're our second largest client. We work with many of their technologies. They have several hundred people around the world dedicated to working with WPP and our clients. I use that as an example; we think the same is true at Facebook where we work with them creatively on Instagram, we work them on the media side of the business, similarly we're very closely integrated. And we're integrated with those companies not just through our people, but through the technologies that we use in our media business to trade with them. So we are extremely well positioned to help our clients understand how the world is being adjusted by those companies.</p><p>And then we talked a lot about data. I know it's a big topic in our business. And our view is that clients need help, they need independent counsel and advice to deal with this data tsunami. On the left, we show in the most recent Forrester Wave that highlights the skills that we have inside Wunderman data, in the customer database and customer engagement business.</p><p>And we need to touch briefly on our view of data. Our view is it's critical to drive data into marketing. We need to drive insights from data. We need to drive targeting through data, we need to measure results through data. The best results come from integrating different data sources: can you combine the weather with location data, with context to deliver a message to a consumer to buy a soft drink on a sunny day with an offer. And it's the combination of data that really unlocks the value. It's not sort of single knowing did someone purchase Product X 3 months ago. It may be helpful in some situations, but really what clients are looking for are partners who can help them bring together their data, the media owners' data, data from other places in a privacy-compliant way that respects consumers.</p><p>There's no doubt that the use of PII or personally identifiable information needs to respect consumers, not just because it's the right thing to do, but it's also increasingly mandated by regulators under either GDPR in the U.K., CCPA in the U.S.A. And you'll have seen yesterday the changes that Google made or announced that they're making to the Chrome browser that effectively sort of signs sort of the death knell for the cookie. So we are going to have to think about other ways of using data that respect consumers to target messages.</p><p>One of the initiatives we're working on that we'll talk about later is context-based tracking. So in real time, you look at the context of a page a consumer's on and target messages based on that context. Sounds actually quite like old-fashioned media planning and buy: oh, you're in a golf magazine, we'll serve you a golf app. Anyway, that's in a way what we're going back to. But data can and technology can help us inform messaging and targeting in a much more effective way.</p><p>So our view is that for WPP, we're best to be data integrators, people that can help our clients combine the data and privacy in a safe way, not owners of data. Hence the decision that we made on Kantar and the transaction that happened at the end of the last year. And just to remind you though, we do have a strategic relationship with Kantar and a 40% investment. So they are very tightly integrated into what we need to do where we think it's the right thing to do.</p><p>So we take this all together in a world where every industry is being disrupted. CEOs, CMOs, CIOs are all asking kind of the same questions. And our view is those questions are questions that WPP, collectively, is extremely well-equipped to answer: how do I adopt technology faster to improve my customer experience to meet customer expectations? We live in a world where actually it's not the old adoption curve where companies launch technologies that consumers adopt. We live in a world where consumers have technologies that companies are struggling to adapt. As a bank, can I get my services available on a mobile app that consumers have? So the technology adoption curve is reversed in many ways. We're helping clients adopt technology.</p><p>How do I personalize my marketing in a way that's relevant to consumers, but in a way that's not creepy? Understanding how consumers think about marketing is critical. How do I build my brand online? How do I protect my reputation? How do I know my message appears in a brand-safe environment? These are all questions that through GroupM and through our public relations, public affairs agencies we advise our clients on every day. How do I sell more online? Should I work with Amazon or should I go direct? How do I protect my data, my customer relationships? Is it more important to drive e-commerce growth in the short term? Or is it more important to protect my customers and see longer-term growth? How do I navigate this sort of complex world of competing marketing technology vendors all selling different things that actually many of which do the same thing? Should I work with Adobe or should I work with Salesforce? Or should I take a combination of products from there and stitch my own platform together? And how do I maximize the returns, not just ROI, but also the strategic value of my relationship from the investments that clients make in Google or Facebook or Amazon or Alibaba? At each of those customers, we would be the single largest partner to those.</p><p>So looking at those questions, this is why December 11 last year, we set out a strategy or vision for WPP to be a creative transformation company. And to talk about each of those words, so creative means we live in a world where clients need ideas, they need innovation, they need growth, they need things rooted in those to help them grow. We're a transformation company because we're in the business of helping our clients move their marketing from how they used to market in the past to how they need to market in the future. And we want to be a company and not a group because we need to work as one. That's not to say we don't have different brands in WPP, and you'll see some of those later, and we're very proud that we have an AKQA or an Ogilvy or Mindshare or MediaCom inside WPP. We want them to be strong companies. We also want them to work together. And we need to have a single approach to technology, a single approach to finance, a single approach to HR. And you'll see in Stephan's presentation what that means to have a single approach to technology. So that's the new vision for WPP that's coming to life.</p><p>We also set out at the same time a new offer to deliver to modern marketers. So we asked the question and we talked to our clients, what do modern marketers need to succeed and also to help WPP expand into the markets that they need more of and not the ones that they need less of. And today around 70%, plus or minus, of WPP's business is in the communications area, but we believe the growth area for us are in experience, in commerce and in technology. That's not how we're organized, but it's increasingly how we think about our company and how we think about where we place investments and how that we're doing.</p><p>And technology underpins and transforms and changes each of these areas of our business. And we think there's tremendous value to clients to be able to access those skills and those expertise together in 1 place. Because if you have a great communications campaign, customers need to land on a great experience. If you have a great experience, you can use commerce to start to sell them things. And technology underpins each of those areas because technology is what connects the dots together.</p><p>So WPP starts in these areas with significant strength. We'll touch briefly on what we think those are. The first I think is that for our major clients, increasingly our work transforms how those clients engage with consumers. This is the FordPass initiative we've been working on with Ford for more than 5 years. Today it has more than 6 million global members, with 250,000 members joining each month. It's effectively the heart of Ford's new customer experience with its customers. The app enables you to schedule services, to book your oil change, and it can innovate around that relationship that Ford have with their consumers. And today Ford remains, I'll remind you, WPP's single largest client. We do work like this with many of our clients today.</p><p>Secondly, and again important to understand, that we're reinventing creativity on a much broader canvas. It's not as simple as saying that the big idea is here or the big idea has gone. The creative process has both become -- it needs to both be simple -- how do you distill what a company stands for in a simple idea -- but it has to become a lot more complex because we need to blow that out in all of the channels. This is some work that VMLY&amp;R have done on Fortnite. And for those of you who don't know, Fortnite has 250 million players. And the prize money, should your children be interested, is $3 million. So I think it's the second most rewarded prize in the world after, I think, after the U.S. Masters. So not the end of the world if that's all they do all day long.</p><p>But the campaign that we did for Wendy's who took this idea of fresh, not frozen into the Fortnite game and [spread fire], I think we shared the video with you at the last investor meeting. Creativity is, I can't stress this enough, is critical to activating digital channels because you can't bore customers into engaging with you. And actually the digital world, given the plethora of options, makes it even more important to have better ideas to engage them with these. So you need to find ways to surprise, delight, entertain, inform your customers as they are on the internet. And that I think is why we really are recommitted to reinvesting in creativity at WPP.</p><p>We've made a number of changes over the last 18 months in our agencies, in particular bringing VML and Y&amp;R together and Wunderman and J. Walter Thompson together into integrated agencies. And though the font you might need binoculars to see, the 5 red dots are 5 of WPP's agencies. And you can see from this Gartner study of global marketing agencies 2019, we are very well represented, in particular AKQA, very well represented in this study and evaluated by consultants.</p><p>And the reason we brought the businesses together was we felt that previously we organized around channel, we had agencies focused on television, print, outdoor and agencies focused on CRM channels and we need to be organized actually around our clients, that bringing integrated business together was the right thing to do. And as we said in our quarterly statement, VMLY&amp;R in the third quarter grew both globally and in the U.S., something they haven't done on a combined basis for a number of years.</p><p>And then last strength to highlight are our relationships with what we call the digital endemic clients. So on the left, we show ad spend from the 8 digital endemic clients, that's Amazon, Alphabet, Booking.com, Netflix, IAC, Facebook, Uber and eBay. And I'm pleased to report that each of those to one degree or another is a significant client of WPP, as are Adobe, IBM and Microsoft. And we were looking at the numbers recently and our spend from those sort of digital endemics is up 2.5x since 2015 and represents a significant part of WPP's revenues today.</p><p>So I think the last few key points to mention are one, that our strategy is really a continuation or maybe an acceleration of a decade-long strategy at WPP. And in fact it goes back perhaps even further. We bought 24/7 Real Media in 2007, so 12 years ago. It's not like we've been not reacting to these changes for some time. So we've made significant investments actually over the last 20 years. But in particular the last 10 years, we focused initially on the acquisition of specialist marketing technology and advertising technology companies and boutiques: AKQA, a fantastic -- a creative agency really that works across all of the channels; Essence, that's really brought strong digital capability into WPP; Salmon, an e-commerce company, and I think you'll see Neil, the CEO later; Cognifide that specialize in relationships with Adobe, and I can go on. Those companies were acquired. And in the last 2 to 3 years, we've been integrating them into our global businesses. So Essence has really been integrated much more into GroupM with Christian Juhl stepping up now, the CEO of Essence, to run GroupM last year.</p><p>WundermanThompson, we brought Salmon, Acceleration and Cognifide into WundermanThompson to expand their offer. Verticurl, a B2B expert you'll see later is part of Ogilvy. And then VMLY&amp;R absorbed Rockfish about 2 years ago. So we've gone from a period of acquisition to a period of integration. And what increasingly we think about the next 5 years is a period of transformation. So it's not really about integrating those assets anymore, it's really about driving technology through our business through a much more coordinated strategy and through scaled global programs that address our partners, that address training, that address how we stitch the company together from a technology perspective.</p><p>So that strategy for the next 5 years really builds on 6 points. First, and I think this is really important, how we provide clients with stronger transformational leadership. So in the last 18 months, we've actually changed the leadership on 8 of WPP's top 10 clients and many of those new leaders bring different skills to the business. And really what we're trying to say is that through WPP and throughout [each of our] clients, we can help those clients transform their business and assemble the right mix of capabilities from across WPP to deliver transformation to those clients. And I think that we start then to get out of this habit of just driving, let's say, brand equity or driving sales to really helping clients transform their company and add significantly more value in doing that.</p><p>Secondly, we need to continue to reinvest in and reinvent creativity, and that's critical. We like to say that creativity's in many ways WPP's differentiator, and technology is our growth driver. And creativity is what makes us different from Accenture. It's embedded inside the company. But technology is what will drive our growth and drive our revenues.</p><p>Thirdly, we need to continue to make sure we integrate creative and digital to make our offer more client-centric, so organized around our clients, not organized around channels.</p><p>Stephan will talk about where we're -- will talk about our technology strategy and how we're integrating that across the company. It's important to say we're going to have one view of technology, not multiple views of technology.</p><p>We need to invest in those growth areas of experience, commerce and technology, really with a focus not on making WPP bigger but on differentiating our offer so that we can deliver results to clients.</p><p>And then lastly, partnering closely with the media technologies, so the Alphabets, Facebooks of this world, and the marketing technology companies, the Adobes, Salesforce, IBMs and Microsofts. So that's the strategy and Stephan will talk about what that means from a technology perspective in a moment.</p><p>Just to touch briefly on the breakout sessions and the areas that we'll cover later. So we're really going to have 4 different breakout sessions that we'll rotate. You can rotate through the rooms that cover, I think, some of the key things to understand about our strategy and what we're delivering. The first is around data and AI, so really covering what -- how we approach data and the differentiation in offer and how it drives creativity, how we're using AI and data, and through Xaxis, how we're using data to drive our media business.</p><p>Mel and Ab will talk about marketing technology, how we're using marketing technology in our business and our campaigns and how it's helping us win and succeed with clients.</p><p>Sam and Neil will talk about experience on one side so how do we create customer experiences for clients, and then on commerce, how we're building transaction platforms for our clients.</p><p>And then lastly, Sanja and Dave will talk about the strategic partnerships we have, the value that we get and the benefits to our clients of working with WPP. So that's the agenda. Thank you. And Stephan?</p><p>STEPHAN PRETORIUS, CTO, WPP PLC: Good morning, everyone. So I think many of you were in our session a year ago where I set out technology as a platform for growth for WPP. And I think at the time, if you remember, there were sort of 4 key tenets that I laid out. The first one was that we needed to create a common data and technology platform across WPP. The second was that we needed to really embrace AI and marketing, and we needed to accelerate the implementation and the skill sets for AI within WPP. Thirdly, we talked about our global partnerships and the fact that we had these very strong relationships that were maybe not as coordinated and as leveraged as they could be. And lastly, we talked about skills and how we needed to really fast-track our skills development within the business.</p><p>So a year ago, as I was standing there telling you I was going to do all that, I had no team. I hadn't really worked across the entire organization. And I was, frankly, quite daunted by the change management challenge and the cultural transformation that needed to be done.</p><p>I can be -- I'm very happy to now report that a year later, we haven't really deviated from that strategy. We've kind of refined it to some extent and we've implemented it successfully in the business. But to a large degree, we've not deviated from the core tenets.</p><p>We found that our scaled global partnerships have allowed us to really accelerate growth and commercial benefits and differentiation in the marketplace. We found that there was an enormous amount of innovation distributed across the business in our agencies that can be leveraged. And we found that there were incredible pockets of deep specialization that really allowed us to deliver great work for clients, particularly in the areas of marketing technology, credit technology and media technology.</p><p>And then lastly, this notion of building an OPEN platform where we could share all our data and applications across the business was not only technically possible, it was also culturally embraced by the organization. And I think this is a very important point to make as we go through the detail and before I get into the detail, is that to a large extent, WPP had incredible assets within the business that were maybe not fully leveraged, not fully valued because of the fact that we didn't work together properly and that our companies were quite siloed in terms of execution. We've changed a lot of that through this last year.</p><p>So today, I'm going to answer 4 key questions in terms of how technology is impacting the business. The first one is how do we -- how are we delivering value and differentiation through our partner strategy? Sanja Partalo on my team who runs our strategic partnerships this year, you'll see her later in the breakout. Secondly, how are we capturing the value of this distributed innovation? How are we capturing the value of all the innovation that's happening in the agencies for the group as a whole? And how are we doing that through our OPEN platform?</p><p>Thirdly, we're going to talk about how we're accelerating skills and our people's ability to execute efficiently, but also in novel new ways for our clients and we -- and the push and the investment that we're making in making that a reality across the business at scale. And then lastly, for a little bit of inspiration before you go into the breakouts, I'm going to talk to you about a topic that's very close to my heart, this notion of the future of creativity. And really, as you start thinking about technology impacting the way that people create and the tools they use to create, but also what is possible in terms of execution through technology, this is something that we have to be very conscious of in WPP and we have to be at the forefront of. And I'm going to share with you some very inspirational work we're doing with partners in that area.</p><p>So firstly, partnering for growth. I think you'll maybe remember this kind of partner triangle. As Mark said earlier, we are in the very fortunate position that the companies that are really kind of the world's leading digital media platforms today are in many cases also the world's largest software and infrastructure companies. And thirdly, many of those companies are our direct clients and very significant clients of WPP. And so we have this sort of incredibly privileged position where we can leverage our insights in terms of how to invest marketing and media budgets on their platforms, use their technology to accelerate and make those campaigns better, and then lastly, apply that same work to their own campaigns and their own marketing investments.</p><p>So we've kind of come up with this quite elegant structure, I think, where we focus really on 4 very key things with each of these partners. First one is joint product development, so how do we develop differentiated joint products or software that we use in order to optimize how we work on their programs, and I'll show you some examples of that later. Secondly, how do we get preferential access to data and technology, early access, privileged access, access above and beyond the kind of standard retail accessibility. Lastly -- or thirdly, how do we jointly go to market, how do we sell together to clients. And then lastly, how do we leverage the scale of these companies in order to help our people up-level and up-skill in their respective areas. This has probably been the area that has had the largest immediate impact, I would say, in the last year. Simply by coordinating these activities, simply by renegotiating some of the commercial contracts at a more global level, we've unlocked an enormous amount of value.</p><p>So today, we are really kind of driving strategic joint business plans with these 8 key partners. And in all cases, we're following pretty much the same strategy of those 4 attributes.</p><p>But we also as you can imagine, because of the fact that we're investing our other clients' marketing budgets on these platforms, we're in the position to deliver very unique media optimization tools on these platforms. And I just want to -- I'm not going to go through all the detail of these initiatives, but really just emphasize sort of 2 trends which are really very important. The first one is governance. You'll see governance for the platform all the way through. Governance is really a software application that allows us to run very large global multimarket campaigns and ensure that the way those campaigns are performing complies with best practice and optimization standards. So I think of this as sort of a machine-automated process of optimizing the campaigns that you're running. It's probably a little bit -- it has analogies in financial trading probably more than we often like to believe. So this is a very important category of technology. We generally get about 20% to 30% improvements in campaign performance. And it's really something that's quite unique to WPP and we're very proud of being able to deliver for our clients.</p><p>The second one is this idea of bridge, which is really an ability for us to leverage the data graphs that these companies have on their customers without violating any privacy of those clients or without being able to access the data directly. And again, when you speak to Niel and Nicolas later [by data and AI], this topic of what is the future of customer data in media given the fact that cookies are inevitably now going away, this is our way of ensuring that we can get audience and customer relevance in these platforms without violating anyone's privacy. This is a seismic shift in how digital media planning and buying will be conducted in years to come. Google is sort of the last holdout in terms of deprecating cookies over the next 2 years, but already with Safari and Mozilla, this is a reality we are grappling with. All right.</p><p>In terms of innovating for growth, I think very often when you start in these kind of roles and you look at the activity that's currently happening in the group, there's a temptation to what one of my colleagues called transplanting trees. So you see a beautiful tree in this company and you go, I'd like that, you pick it up and you put it somewhere else and you kill it, right? And I think this is a mistake that, if you read books about innovation and organizational change, many people make. Because there's a tendency to say I want all the best things in one place and then I'll create this wonderful central unit to do product development and everything will be great and we'll kind of deliver it to the masses.</p><p>It turns out that's not really how organizations work. And that's on how humans really like to behave. And across our businesses as we started engaging them deeply on the innovation that we're doing, we came to the realization that the best innovation was happening at the call phase between client problems and expert practitioners. So whether it's in Ogilvy, in WundermanThompson, in AKQA, in some of our boutique businesses, the best innovation was happening really at the call phase between client problems and expert practitioners.</p><p>And so we kind of coined this phrase \"distributed innovation\" as a way to say we're going to accelerate that, we're going to harness that and we're going to encourage people to do more of that because that innovation is relevant. Things that are developed sort of somewhere in an ivory tower often tended not to be relevant at all.</p><p>And so that's all fine and well, but you have to be able to find a way to showcase that innovation, share that innovation and make it available to others in the group. Otherwise, you are simply allowing fragmentation to persist. So we've come up with a brand for our platform, it'll be called WPP OPEN and WPP OPEN is our common technology platform where all our data applications and solutions are going to be showcased and made available across the group. And really this is, in many ways, not an entirely new idea. Many global companies in the world have platforms like this. But I think what's unique about this is that this is really more than just a showcase of tools, this is also a place where people learn, get trained and build communities around these solutions.</p><p>What's absolutely key, and again when you speak to Niel Bornman later in the data and AI section, Niel is driving this work for me, we're taking a very structured approach to how we industrialize the innovation that is happening in the agencies before we make it available to the group as a whole. And really Niel and his team have been incredibly rigorous at going through this sort of whole roster of industrialization principles, about 30 of them, all the way from legal to info sec, to open source code reviews, to making sure the products are properly product marketed, that there are commercial terms against them, that technically it can scale, that there's a support organization to support them. All of which gives us a lot of confidence that as we launch OPEN and start making these innovation and the products within the agencies more broadly accessible, that they will scale successfully and will be adding value to the business.</p><p>So from a kind of a platform perspective, it's quite a sort of simple information design: data application solutions, future makers as our community platform, partners and resources. And just to say, we've not been sitting on our hands. This is live in internal alpha at the moment. We're going through iterations of phased rollout, engaging with teams to train them, get feedback, refine it. And we're looking to launch it fully across the entire business in Q2.</p><p>So I think as you -- anyone who's been part of platform or system rollouts in their own businesses will know, getting buy-in, bringing people with you, making people part of the journey is absolutely key. And again, I want to take my hat off to Niel and his team for how they've done that change management within the business in the last year.</p><p>So this is not a central effort that we're going to sort of release on the organization. This has been a huge collective effort with literally hundreds of people across the business feeding into it, creating content, creating solutions and really kind of buying into the concept as we've been rolling it out.</p><p>Thirdly, let's talk about skills and capabilities. So as you all know, as marketing has become more technologically driven, the skill sets required in order to be an effective modern marketer has really become a lot more diverse. And so you need to understand principles, core principles of marketing, but you also need to understand the details of particular channels and executions and topics, whether it's shopper marketing, retail, e-commerce, digital media, search, social, et cetera, the sort of the landscape intellectually has expanded massively. And similarly, we've had to embrace the technology capabilities, the tools that people use every day. It's not good enough just to know Microsoft Office anymore, you need to have a much wider skillset: Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Experience Cloud, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Google Cloud for compute and analytics. There's a very large set of tools that if you want to be effective in marketing, you need to be able to embrace.</p><p>So we've organized our enablement programs and Sanja Partalo, who you will see later talking about partnerships, has been leading this area for us in addition to the partner strategy. But it's really in 3 categories, it's modern marketing technology, creative and production technologies and then digital media platforms.</p><p>So the first category is very much focused on hard computer science skills, or I guess programming skills. And in many cases, we have teams of people that are incredibly specialized in creative AI, in market simulation, in data analytics, really kind of at the cutting edge of computer science execution.</p><p>The creative and production category, as you would imagine, is very important for us. We have 47,000 people across WPP that work on Adobe Creative Cloud every day. It's the largest community of creators that Adobe has on that platform. But again, it's not enough just to be good at Photoshop and InDesign and these kind of tools. There's a whole series of additional tools that have now come to market that they need to embrace and learn skills on, including voice, including immersive formats like AR and VR and including some creative AI tools.</p><p>And then lastly, for those of you who have maybe looked into this more closely, the ability to execute effectively on digital media platforms is -- relies quite significantly on a deep, deep understanding of the unique intricacies of those platforms. Executing a campaign on Instagram versus Snap, versus Google Search, versus YouTube is incredibly different, entirely different in terms of technical capabilities and restrictions, format sometimes, restrictions in length and rotation animation, et cetera. And the creative execution really kind of works within a different framework in each of these areas. So we have to spend a lot of time teaching not only our technical teams but our creative teams about these platforms so that they can execute within the construct, within the kind of the idiom of that platform.</p><p>So again, this year we've done -- I think we've moved mountains in terms of some of these skill sets. Some of these programs, I think, were well underway already, particularly I think in the area of modern marketing technology with Adobe and Salesforce. But Google Cloud, which is a cloud computing platform, we trained 500 people on Google Cloud this year. That's not insignificant and was extremely well received. So I'm delighted about that.</p><p>And I think you can see the numbers there for yourself. But I think it gives you a sense of the scale of program that we have to run. And again, with a fairly small central team, I think through change management and through organizational integration, we've really kind of managed to get a lot of this done in the last year.</p><p>So the other point I want to make is that probably the worst thing that we've done in our industry over time is that we separated media and creative, right? And even more, in a more fragmented way, we've separated digital, social, media, shopper, e-commerce in these sort of very functional silos. And very often, I say to my team, the value that we can unlock lies in the space between functional areas. In other words, if you combine A, B and C, what do you get, right? If you combine some modern marketing technology skill set with some creative and production skill set and with deep understanding of a digital media platform, what do you get? And so I'm going to show you a video now of some work that we pitched to Instagram successfully earlier last year, which really kind of combines those 3 areas very well. So it combines a very successful, a very unique approach to creativity with a production capability to make the work, to produce the assets -- with a technology platform that allows us to create many, many variants of those executions very successfully.</p><p>So this is a platform that we've created, an offering, a service that we're delivering to Instagram now where we are going to be promoting the Instagram capabilities to their own consumers on Instagram Stories. So let's play the video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>STEPHAN PRETORIUS: So I really love that work. And I think it speaks to 2 things really. The one is that, on the one hand, that combination of creativity production and technology is the kind of idea and the [stickiness] of that idea that if you were to run a start-up in Silicon Valley, you could probably raise a couple of million dollars for and build a successful business on. And there are companies all over the world that are doing exactly that. We have the ability in WPP to, simply by combining 3 areas of capability we already have in the business, to pull something like that together within weeks and deliver it at scale to one of the world's largest social media platforms. So really kind of quite impressive how these things can come together when you bring people together.</p><p>But as I said earlier, it's really important to not only focus on what's possible today, but also what's going to be relevant tomorrow. So we've created these sort of, what we call future maker communities around particular topics of high growth: immersive content is one; voice you're probably very familiar with, but how do you deliver services and skills in voice; and then more recently, creative -- the gaming and eSports; and creative AI.</p><p>Gaming, as all of you know, one of the fastest-growing categories. eSport, which is sort of its real-world instantiation, is really becoming a global phenomenon. User numbers are through the roof and I think particularly brands like Tencent have done incredibly well in investing in gaming and eSports very early on. The ESL, the eSports League, is now at a scale that virtually rivals traditional sports. And we believe that there's a massive communications opportunity for WPP and our clients. So we've made some investments in gaming and eSport investment funds to get really close to that ecosystem through Bitkraft and Courtside. And we partnered very closely with ESL and also an in-game advertising platform called Anzu.</p><p>Creative AI, it's maybe a topic that's a little bit obscure to some of you. If you think about in the sort of everyday culture, this whole topic of deepfakes. Deepfakes are really enabled by creative AI. A more sort of sterile version of deepfakes is really what we call synthetic models. Call it what you want, it's the ability to create content with machines that is entirely based on machine's understanding of what something could look like. It's not represented by anything that exists in real life. And creative AI has many, many applications in marketing today. Adobe is probably one of the companies at the forefront of this. Virtually every single new feature in Adobe Creative Cloud, whether it's Liquify to make faces look smoother, whether it's auto-cropping for videos, converting videos from sort of landscape format to vertical format, all these features are AI-driven.</p><p>And across WPP, AI -- or the adoption of AI in marketing has really accelerated enormously in the last year. Here are sort of 15 examples of things that we've done, that we've executed in the last year where AI has been adopted to marketing. I'll call out just 1 or 2 examples. The Next Rembrandt is a wonderful campaign that WundermanThompson developed where we use the style of a traditional Rembrandt to then superimpose that on any selfie face -- headshot of a person to create new Rembrandts that could not have -- that didn't exist, but you can't really distinguish that they weren't painted by Rembrandt.</p><p>The work we did for TheraFlu, a GSK brand, around flu prediction is another example where we use neural network technology to predict flu outbreaks much, much faster than they were typically possible to be tracked, really allowing us to get in-market with flu, marketing much closer to when it was relevant than in the past. And many other examples.</p><p>But I think the point is simply that in the same way that a couple of years ago you could probably get a company funded if you just called it .ai, last year it sort of increased your valuation if you said you use AI. I think AI is becoming pervasive in terms of applications, particularly in marketing.</p><p>All right. But we need to go even faster and I think this is an area that we are really probably putting the biggest central effort in, in terms of skills acceleration. So we are, through this year, training 50,000 people on AI fundamentals through a kind of a curriculum of courses that we developed with a partner. We're going to train 5,000 data scientists on advanced data and AI applications. And then quite excitingly, we are launching the world's first AI and marketing diploma course with Oxford Sa\u00c3\u00afd Business School. Later this year, this is going to be a -- you'll be able to graduate from Oxford if you want to do it. And it's going to be a half year course on the applications of AI and marketing, all the way from effects to creativity, to data and optimization. So we're really kind of covering all areas of skill set and seniority in the business.</p><p>We are investing quite significantly to accelerate the adoption of AI in our products through a central resource pool of AI experts that we are delivering to our agencies so that they can accelerate product development using AI.</p><p>And then thirdly, we're investing, again quite significantly in research with a range of partners, Stanford, UAL and Oxford, in sort of a couple of topics of AI application, synthetic media probably being the most exciting one, and I'll show you some examples of that later. All right.</p><p>So just to wrap before the Q&amp;A. I think probably the most inspiring area for me of work that we've done is to think about the future of creativity with my team. And if you think about this notion of the -- how consumers are driving a lot of digital adoption, in many ways technology is democratizing creativity. It's becoming easier and easier and cheaper and cheaper to create really compelling work without an enormous amount of capital outlay. And I think that's all very exciting, but we also have to think about how do we make it more inspirational and how do we make it more accessible to a broader audience.</p><p>So I've been again extremely inspired this year working with our partners, particularly with Microsoft, led by Satya Nadella's vision of AI for Good, and also with Adobe in thinking about these ideas of not only the future of creativity from a kind of a technology and business perspective, but also in terms of a purpose agenda around accessibility and making creativity available to a broader audience.</p><p>So at the end of last year, some of you might have been at the event, we had a very successful event at the Microsoft -- new Microsoft store on Oxford Circus where we brought together these ideas in this public event around inspiring, creating and experiencing content in a very real way. And the parrot theme, just to explain it, is that that is an extinct parrot that can only be brought back to life by technology. But we also then sort of extended the idea by thinking about how would someone with a disability create content in this context. I'm going to show you a little bit of a video that kind of captures the event, and then I'll make some final comments on that.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>STEPHAN PRETORIUS: No applause. Tough audience. So I think -- just a couple of comments on that. I think the, firstly, that kind of work is really lighthouse work to inspire our people, to inspire our clients. But I think the -- on the technical level, it's also quite inspirational. If you think what we did there, here's someone with motor neuron disease who painted that watercolor parrot with her eyes. We then used a massive training data set of a course that we found on the internet to create a generative adversarial network to be able to take that model and create a 3D rendering of that parrot that you saw in that final sort of frame. So this is sort of technically quite -- it's wizardry in a way. But I think it's wonderful to link it to a purpose agenda around accessibility and the future of creativity.</p><p>So that's all I have for you now. I think we have half an hour for Q&amp;A. So let's open the floor.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MARK READ: Very good. Do you want to get the chairs out? So we've got 15 minutes for Q&amp;A, or more if you want to eat into your break. So here's the first question. Okay. Why don't we go here and then at the back, yes?</p><p>Matthew? Would someone give Matthew a mic?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Two questions, please. The first one is on how many technology people do you have at the moment? And how many do you think, let's say, in 2 or 3 years you need to have? That's the first question.</p><p>The second question is on, a lot of your focus is around advisory. Do you need to move into sort of technology stack consulting in a bigger way? Do you need to have lots of systems integrators that are going to actually go to clients and actually install technology for them? I know you've got a lot of partnerships with Salesforce and Adobe. But how far do you need to drive into what an Accenture would do?</p><p>MARK READ: Well, I think -- to take the second question first and maybe Stephan can talk about the sort of the number of technologists we have. That is what we do -- that is what we do already. And I guess if you don't understand that, then we haven't been communicating it clearly enough. I mean we are, depending on the year, the largest or second largest systems integration partner to Adobe. I think we're the largest Salesforce Marketing Cloud partner. So our business competes very significantly. Not the whole business, but a significant part of our business competes significantly with Accenture today. So we do already have people that consult on the technology stack and who integrate things for clients and it's not easy to sort of break that out in a way that -- I don't want to be condescending, but you can stick in your models, [you understand] is part of the challenge that we face. We have a business that's shifting and part of the business is in a growth area, part of the business is not in a growth area, if you like. And we have to have that balance and -- but we do have significant businesses in that area that we talked about, that Wunderman commerce, consulting business is really across the company. Stephan, you want to take the technology?</p><p>STEPHAN PRETORIUS: Yes. I mean overall, people dedicated to marketing technology systems integration, we have more than 7,000 people in the business working purely on that day in and day out, competing in the field, advising clients, building marketing technology stacks. Beyond that, we also have a significant number of people, hundreds, working on product development internally. And I think the question about how many people do we need in the future, I think it's a question of degrees and focus of skills, right? So we believe that everyone who works in WPP and works in modern marketing has to be a technologist at some level. So this notion of being a creative technologist is a big focus for our entire creative community. That's 47,000 people, that's maybe half our sort of staff count who have to be creative technologists. And then really as you kind of get into the more specialized areas, obviously you need fewer people, but they sort of make a big impact.</p><p>So I think the -- it's something that we are in that market, as Mark says. And I think in many ways, we've taken a different approach to others in the market. We've not put all those people into one separate organization, we've integrated them into our core companies because we believe that you need to be able to combine an understanding of consumers, creativity, campaign management and technology execution and technology delivery for clients in one offering.</p><p>So when you speak to Mel and Ab later, maybe focus on how they're doing that within Ogilvy and within WundermanThompson, because artificially separating these things, artificially separating data from technology, from creative companies, we don't believe services our client best [interest].</p><p>MARK READ: I mean -- and I had the same thought as Stephan about technologies, I mean if you do not understand technology, you will not be a leader in WPP because that is the conversation that our clients want to have. It's not the whole conversation, right? The key skill for a marketer is understanding of consumers and how they adopt technology. It's not technology itself. If you don't understand both of those things, you won't succeed. At the back there, yes.</p><p>WILLIAM HENRY PACKER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MEDIA EQUITY RESEARCH, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Will Packer from Exane BNP. A couple for me, please. Thank you for this morning's session, very useful. I suppose there does seem to be a bit of a disconnect between what was discussed and your current disclosure on revenue and growth. Could you help us think about connecting those two? For example, what percentage of your revenue comes from services associated to big tech? Or you've highlighted 3 particular areas of high growth, how big are they? How fast are they growing? That's question one.</p><p>And the second question is you -- of all the companies you've talked about today, many of the world's largest and most successful, I suppose the one where both revenue and engagement is growing most rapidly is ByteDance, and on a 5-year view, could shake up the ad market quite significantly. Could you just talk through how you're engaging there? What kind of services you provide for your partners when it comes to ByteDance?</p><p>MARK READ: Yes. So I think on the disclosure point, I mean I wouldn't say -- trying to give you a better sense on what's going we would do. The problem is, I think as Stephan said, for the right reasons, we don't want to organize ourselves in a way that makes financial disclosure easy but doesn't give our clients the right answer. And the reality of our business is there's bits of our business that are growing and there are bits of our business that are declining. Demand by clients to put money on television ads is going to go down. The demand to buy newspaper ads is going to go down. It's just a reality of life. But those same people are being redeployed to do campaigns on ByteDance as you manage -- as you mentioned. So it's just very difficult, if not impossible, to give that. But I understand it's something that if we could give you an easy answer, we'll go back, and John, our new CFO sitting in the front row, one of his tasks will be to look at what we can do and how we can do that.</p><p>On ByteDance, I saw Yiming in China just after I started. And I think China is really interesting because I say to many clients, if you go to China because that's your model for how you're going to market in the future: contactless payments, tons of social content, social content commerce all coming together in platforms like Ali and Tencent. I saw some new products for Amazon when I was in CES last week where they're launching this sort of Amazon [Miles], looked very much like something that you'd see in China. So I think the skills that we have there are really important. And for all our clients in China, we're running TikTok, we're running -- we run campaigns, social, commerce campaigns. Whether it will become as large a social platform outside China as it is inside China, I think will ultimately have to be a question for the politicians, if you like, but we'll see. Thank you.</p><p>WILLIAM HENRY PACKER: Sorry. Just going back up with the question around the high growth areas. Is it -- are they more than 10% of revenue, sub-10% of revenue?</p><p>MARK READ: So when I said communications is 70%, the others are -- 70% plus or minus, the other are 30% plus or minus. But within communications, there's high-growth areas what do you spend on Snap, there's lower-growth areas what do you spend on local newspapers. So it's very difficult for us to carve these things out in a way that's easy, that's simple for you to understand.</p><p>And the way we're organized, we -- let's say, before we brought, let's say, the creative agencies together with the inverted commerce digital agencies, it was easy, right? We had creative agencies that were declining and had declined for 3 or 4 years. And we had digital agencies that were growing. That would meet your disclosure requirement. You can look at the bit that's growing, you can look at the bit that's declining and you can model them out. Problem is that's not the right organizational structure for our clients or our company and you can't run a company that's declining. So organizing ourselves around channels is the wrong thing to do.</p><p>So we just can't organize a company to give you the numbers in the way that for the -- that's insertable into Excel. But we will do it in the right way for our clients. And you're going to have to use your judgment. I mean that's your job. You look at the presentations and decide, are we going to be successful or are we not going to be successful? And that's why you get paid the big bucks if you like or not-quite-so big bucks as may be the case. Anyway, next question here at the front.</p><p>SARAH SIMON, ANALYST, JOH. BERENBERG, GOSSLER &amp; CO. KG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sarah Simon from Berenberg. You're seeing kind of let's say the big players...</p><p>MARK READ: Maybe wait for the mic so people can hear on the webcast, yes?</p><p>SARAH SIMON: Just a question about the Googles and the Facebooks. You're seeing a pretty significant shift to more of a walled garden kind of environment. What do you think the implications of that are for you?</p><p>MARK READ: No, I think it makes some things harder. It makes some -- in some cases, it makes us more valuable. And our key task is to help our clients decide how they allocate their money across those platforms and how they maximize the ROI inside those platforms. When everything was easily trackable across them, when the data flowed more freely than it did, you could say I want to see -- I want to look at that cookie and reach that cookie through Facebook or MySpace or here or here. It was simpler.</p><p>Today, you have to look at each channel on its own and it's a bit like being a stock market analyst. Am I going to invest in gold or bonds or stocks? So each of the walled gardens has become almost an asset class in itself. And so you can optimize inside that asset class, you can optimize inside Google using technology, but it's still something that you need judgment to optimize across. But I still think that makes what we do more valuable because clients need to understand how they do it.</p><p>And I'd make one more point to those clients considering whether they should in-source things or work with an external partner. Our key value is knowing what the benchmarks are, yes? We know the benchmarks for what does it cost to reach someone on a Saturday? What does it cost to reach someone on Google? What does it cost to drive an automotive lead? How does that change from Germany to France? If you're one client working on your own, you only know your own data. So how do you know if you're doing a good job or if you're doing a bad job? I think that the value that agencies bring are those benchmarks. It's not just expertise and talent and technology, all of which I think are critical. But the benchmarks that enable clients to know how they're doing are things that we can bring. So I do think that the walled gardens are -- do not diminish in any way the value that we drive for clients. Yes? Why don't we go here and then to Adrien.</p><p>JULIEN ROCH, MD &amp; EUROPEAN MEDIA ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Julien Roch for Barclays. Apologies, I'm going back to the spreadsheet question.</p><p>MARK READ: What question?</p><p>JULIEN ROCH: The spreadsheet question. So if 70% of your revenue is communication, do you put in there just media and then the merged creative digital? Or have you put in there also PR and specialty? And can we have a bit of a breakdown of the 70%, at least media as we mean discrete these days. I know the rest is more merged. That's the first one.</p><p>Then the second one is, GroupM has its best year ever last year despite the tons of written research saying that media is dying. So can we have an idea of what that means, best year ever? How much did it grow?</p><p>And then the last number question is how much of WPP client revenue went to Google and Facebook in 2019 in terms of dollars?</p><p>MARK READ: Okay. So on the first question, we'll see what we can do to help. So communications is largely creative work, media, public relations, public affairs. Experience would be largely much of the revenue from, let's say, AKQA or a Landor or Brand Union, the designing experiences.</p><p>Commerce would be -- Geometry, which is in the commerce business, but also WundermanThompson Commerce that does commerce work, all the commerce work that we do within Ogilvy. And technology would sit inside many of those companies, but it really is direct-to-client technology revenues. So there's some inside GroupM, there's some inside Ogilvy, there's some inside AKQA, there's some inside WundermanThompson Commerce. It does split out in quite a complex -- inside a complex way.</p><p>We've made a conscious decision to keep our brands. So we think that brands are valued by our clients, not 500, but a meaningful number. And that is the right way to organize, to manage for our people and to deal with multiple clients in the same category. So that's what we're doing there.</p><p>Your second question was around -- yes?</p><p>JULIEN ROCH: GroupM.</p><p>MARK READ: So GroupM was recognized, I think, by one of the media trackers as having more than $50 billion of media spend, so sort of most significant media spend ever. They defended $1 billion of media. They won $1 billion of media that had good growth from assisting clients. And we can't say more about their numbers till our results came out. But I think that they had a good year both in terms of client retention and in terms of winning new business.</p><p>On the spend with Google and Facebook, I think we said 2019, we spent around $7 billion with Google, just under $3 billion with Facebook. So those are roughly the numbers.</p><p>All right. Why don't we do Adrien we said we'd do next here and then Richard. Can you pass it back. Yes?</p><p>ADRIEN DE SAINT HILAIRE, VP &amp; HEAD OF MEDIA RESEARCH, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Adrien from Bank of America. Just, Mark, on your point about China. You said this is the kind of blueprint for marketing going forward. That's what you're telling to your clients. But it's also a market where every agency holding company seems to be in revenue decline or in kind of escrow. So how can we be confident that when China -- or sorry, when the U.S. or U.K., et cetera become like China, then agency-owning companies won't be in revenue decline?</p><p>MARK READ: Yes, I don't come to the same conclusion as you do obviously from that. I think the challenges in China, they're not to do with a sort of China-specific, more to do with the mix of clients that multinational agencies have. I mean our business in China is a fantastic business and has been growing this year. So we haven't had necessarily the challenges that you talked about elsewhere. But I would like to see the growth at a high level. Clearly, the technology has moved even faster in China, which has required us to invest even more. And I think it's a very, very competitive market and there are the Chinese multinational debate.</p><p>So I think that there's a lot of factors going on and I couldn't draw the same conclusion that you've drawn between what's happening in China and what's happening anywhere else.</p><p>Yes, Richard? Or do you want to -- we'll go back first and then we'll come to you, Richard, with a mic, yes.</p><p>LISA YANG, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Lisa Yang from Goldman. The question I have is since you explained your strategy, clearly, we've seen a number of new like, wins like Instagram, your [image] has improved and the other one has returned to growth. Just wondering, could you maybe give us a sense of how you have maybe expanded your scope within your existing clients in terms of whether you might have increased your market share with the existing ones as opposed to all the new business wins we've seen in the press?</p><p>And the second question, if I may, is it looks like you have a quite strong relationship with Google and Facebook. Haven't been talk as much about Amazon. So where do you see your position with Amazon? And what's the future growth opportunity for you with them?</p><p>MARK READ: Yes. I think on the market share point, I think that we have -- coming into 2019, as you know we had a number of losses in 2018 that impacted our revenue in 2019. Clearly, given where our revenues are, we haven't substantially increased, I would say mathematically, we cannot have substantially increased our share with clients.</p><p>What I would say is when I look at the assignments we have with clients, I can see a much greater breadth and a much greater engagement across different types of technology disciplines and in these new growth areas. So I think that we're going through this transformation and we're going through this transition, and to some extent, we're dealing with the sort of historic losses that we had in '18. I'd say '19 was a relatively normal year. The nature of our business is, you win things and you lose things. And I think we did see when we looked at our large clients and we said in Q3, we saw actually that we had better growth. The last couple of years, our largest clients have slightly underperformed the rest of WPP, not by a significant amounts, but by 0.5%, 1%. We saw that reverse a bit in Q3, which I'd say is positive.</p><p>On Amazon, Stephan and I had a big meeting actually with Amazon at CES last week to go through our road map for the year. And we are working with them, maybe not quite as closely with Google because I think their advertising efforts really are ramping up. And it's not as central to Amazon's business as it is, by definition, to Google's business but I think it is important to their business, and we have a joint business plan with them that covers what we spend from a media perspective. But I think it's broader in an interesting way because it covers a lot of work around e-commerce. It covers some of their new product launches. So we haven't gone into detail in every plan, and I think we called those 2 out as the largest. But it does extend and we do, do that with our top 7 to 10 partners.</p><p>Thank you. Richard? I think we've got time for one, Richard, and then one more question and then we will have some time over lunch and after the breakouts for other questions.</p><p>RICHARD EARY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF EUROPEAN MEDIA TEAM, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just on -- you presented a lot in terms of obviously future trends in technology. I mean if we go back to sort of like the in-housing debate, how does technology change that? I mean on one side, it makes it harder because you've actually got to scale the investments. So therefore, actually -- and clients probably don't have the capacity to do it and do it at change and at scale. And then on the other side, you've got the big tech giants consolidating on the other side. So I don't know if you have any views in terms of what happens on the in-housing side and what capabilities may be potentially in-housed different from what we've got today.</p><p>STEPHAN PRETORIUS: Yes. I mean I think there are 2 ways to think about that. On the one hand, in order to manage this more fragmented landscape from a marketing technology perspective, I think it's quite challenging for individual clients. I mean they'll have access to the same kind of retail consumer-level interfaces that you would have if you just were to kind of approach those companies directly. But to really do a good job across all of them, you need a different level of technology. So I do think technology creates a differentiation for us.</p><p>The other thing I would say is that to this point about how to address walled gardens, which a previous question was asked about as well, in many ways we are going back to more traditional ways of understanding media investment planning, market simulation, attribution modeling, which really kind of is more of an above-market perspective on where audiences are working across these walled gardens. So -- and again that's a data and technology and analytics function, which agencies are very well equipped to do. So I think in many ways it plays into -- it becomes a strength for us and a point of differentiation.</p><p>MARK READ: All right. So thank you very much. Those are the questions. So as you know, it's been a busy year for WPP. But I've taken some time off over the last year to learn Hindi and Mandarin. So I'd like to say thank you in that. Can we play the video?</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>MARK READ: Thank you very much.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Mr Bezos is reportedly worth about US$180 billion (S$247.6 billion), and Mr Zuckerberg some US$86 billion. Mr Pichai is reportedly worth a relatively modest US$600 million, and Mr Cook US$625 million.</p><p> The hearing was part of multiple government investigations into the business practices of big tech companies, and whether they should be broken up, as big oil and telecommunications companies were, under US antitrust laws.</p><p> In January, top executives from four smaller, competing companies - wireless speaker maker Sonos, cellphone grip maker PopSockets, gadget start-up Tile, and business software company Basecamp - laid out their complaints to the same antitrust subcommittee.</p><p>Sonos chief executive Patrick Spence said Google and Amazon are able to sell their Home and Echo speakers at artificially low prices because they make money in other ways, so they do not need to profit from speaker sales.</p><p> Rather, they use them to collect consumer data that they then deploy to great effect in their other businesses, he charged.</p><p> But breaking them up will be a long process as the laws themselves will need to be tweaked to deal with the new data-based giants.</p><p> At the end of Tuesday's hearing, Democratic Representative David Cicilline quoted former US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, saying: \"We must make our choice: We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few. But we can't have both.\"</p><p> Behind Mr Cicilline sat Associate Professor Lina Khan, who came to attention in 2017 as a 28-year-old Yale law student when she wrote a paper in the Yale Law Journal making the case for an overhaul of antitrust laws to deal with companies like Amazon.</p><p> \"Amazon is the titan of 21st-century commerce,\" she wrote. \"Although Amazon has clocked staggering growth, it generates meagre profits, choosing to price below cost and expand widely instead.\"</p><p> Pro-regulation congressmen and women maintain that the same can be said of Google and Facebook. At Tuesday's hearing, Democratic Representative Pramilla Jayapal said: \"I think the question again here is when the dominant platform threatens... potential rivals, that should not be a normal business practice.</p><p> \"Facebook is a case study, in my opinion, in monopoly power because your company harvests and monetises our data,\" she told a poker-faced Mr Zuckerberg.</p><p> \"And then your company uses that data to spy on competitors, and to copy, acquire and kill rivals.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-714071</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GB-TWY1-JCF2-802B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Until now, it has largely been up to you to find ways to stay off their collective corporate radar. But instead of having to dig deep into the privacy settings of your phone or an app to opt out of sharing your personal information to do something as pedestrian as, say, rent one of the now-ubiquitous electric scooters, imagine never having to opt in in the first place. As city officials this spring craft a 'privacy-first policy' mandated by voter-approved Proposition B, supporters hope its lofty ambitions will start to become a reality this summer. </p><p>The local regulations \u2014 among the first emerging in cities nationwide \u2014 could fill potential holes in the separate landmark statewide privacy law that takes effect in 2020. San Francisco's initiative might also accelerate efforts to pre-empt cities and states through the adoption of federal standards, which the technology and business lobbies could be expected to water down. Already there are signs that the city could move to the forefront of enforcing limits on data collection and reshaping our relationship with technology companies.Disrupting the DisruptersCity leaders have made bold, but so far not very specific, claims about their ability to limit the personal-information free-for-all that is at the heart of the business model for data brokers, many startups and other digital enterprises. Since passage of the ballot measure in November, supervisors have introduced legislation to restrict or ban surveillance and facial recognition. But the idea of being able to use online services in San Francisco without providing any personal details is the most controversial proposal. It is also potentially the most transformative and disruptive to an industry that has reaped riches from 'disruption.' Previously: S.F. Voters Want Tough Data Privacy Rules, But Obstacles Loom[1] Related: Why Privacy Needs All of Us[2] As officials work to add teeth to the larger privacy framework, critics warn that aggressive regulations could chase companies that make their money mining Big Data out of San Francisco, or into the courts to battle regulators. 'I think it's going to be very difficult to change the business model that underlies a lot of current services, because it enables things to be free,' said Kelsey Finch, an attorney at the Future of Privacy Forum[3], a nonprofit think tank and advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. 'It's hard to have both free products and services and not provide any data. And that will be a logistical hurdle. It may be a political hurdle.' Brian Hofer, who chairs the Oakland Privacy Advisory Commission[4], agrees. 'If the restrictions are perceived as being too cumbersome for the private industries, I think there's going to be a lot of pushback,' he said. Strict regulations would have a 'far-reaching impact in a lot of different technologies,' said Cynthia Cole, a privacy attorney with Palo Alto-based Baker ...tts, which represents more than half the Fortune 500 companies. She cited geolocation and biometric data as rapidly expanding fields that could be drastically affected and whose stakeholders could respond accordingly. 'I think you could have a dissuasive impact on companies saying, 'Are we going to put our offices in San Mateo or Oakland, or are we going to put it in San Francisco?'' Cole said. 'And they might say, 'OK, well, San Francisco has these laws that make it even more stringent, even stricter for us with respect to our business model. So, we're going to just implant ourselves right outside San Francisco instead.''Challenging Big TechThe first warning shot came just a month after city voters endorsed the 11 'guiding principles'[5] in Proposition B, which are the foundation of the privacy policy. The measure covers data collected by city agencies, anyone with a city license, permit or contract, and anyone receiving city funding. In December, District 1 Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer[6] introduced an ordinance to require stores to post signs[7] and notify the city if they are using surveillance cameras to monitor, track or collect data on shoppers. Standard security cameras were exempted. The proposal, which included unspecified 'administrative penalties' for noncompliance, was sparked by a new breed of stores like partially automated Amazon Go[8], which have cameras that 'can sense if a customer reaches out and grabs an item and puts it back down,' said Fewer aide Angelina Yu. 'We felt that it was important to be transparent and upfront that that type of data was being collected and analyzed,' she said. 'It's inferring a lot more data than just a simple transaction. 'We're hoping this will dovetail with a lot of the efforts around 'privacy first,'' said Yu, adding that Fewer's office planned to meet with Amazon. 'We are at this time where it's kind of a Wild West and there's an entirely new range of technologies and spaces where privacy questions are really impacting the real world and our everyday movements and transactions.' In February, Fewer backed off advancing her measure 'at this time' but did not say why.Taking Aim at SurveillanceDistrict 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin[9], who sponsored Proposition B, followed Fewer's proposal in late January by introducing the 'Stop Secret Surveillance Ordinance.'[10] It would require that the Board of Supervisors approve any city department request to acquire new surveillance technology, or use current surveillance equipment in a new way to monitor or track residents and visitors. It would also ban facial recognition by city departments, setting up San Francisco to be the first U.S. city to do so. The proposal is in line with what Sameena Usman, with the Bay Area Council on American Islamic Relations, was hoping for last year, when her group endorsed Proposition B. Usman told the Public Press[11] in October that she saw the city Charter amendment as 'a stepping stone' toward a surveillance ordinance. Though Peskin's plan does not directly cite the privacy-first policy, a fact sheet distributed by his office called it 'an implementation vehicle' of Proposition B. Peskin legislative aide Lee Hepner called it a way to 'build on the mandate of the voters last November to protect their personal information, to protect them from unwarranted intrusion into their private worlds.' Down the line, he said, supervisors might also look at banning facial recognition at private events that receive city permits for the use of public space. Once the privacy policy is in place, it is expected to provide a legal platform on which supervisors might introduce dozens of other transformative regulations applying to city agencies, contractors and any entity that receives permits or payments from the city, which Proposition B calls for.Taking Aim at Business ModelsBut privacy advocates in City Hall envision an expansive agenda moving forward, which if pursued could become a significant headache for business, especially local tech giants that grow by making acquisitions. Hepner said Peskin's office is 'trying to look at data privacy regulation as somewhat of an antitrust tool.' The goal would be to prevent the accumulation of massive amounts of data by large companies that purchase startups solely for that purpose. 'If you are a permittee of the City and County of San Francisco and you are acquired by Amazon or Google or Uber or Lyft, that should force a reevaluation of your permit to see how policies are changing and shifting relative to the exchange and use of people's personal information,' Hepner explained. The city's policy 'does absolutely threaten the business models of some companies,' said the Electronic Frontier Foundation[12]'s director of grassroots advocacy, Shahid Buttar, who evaluated Proposition B as it was being drafted last year. 'Companies will have to let the users decide how they are to participate and how they are to be monetized, as opposed to imposing their own interests on users that want to use their platforms.' The threat of relocation could be private industry's primary negotiating tactic. 'There are ways to put pressure on cities that you don't have that option on a federal level or less so even on a state level,' said attorney Cole, who has numerous gig-economy and other tech clients that expect to be affected by San Francisco's regulations.Seattle's ExperienceSeattle has developed one of the nation's more robust citywide privacy regimes. In 2015, it created privacy principles[13] to guide city government and companies with city contracts. Seattle chief privacy officer, Ginger Armbruster, said that occasionally the city has to tell a vendor 'this just doesn't work for us if you want to do business with the city.' But unlike what San Franciscans envision, Seattle's privacy policy is just advisory and not legally binding. That means with tech giants like Google and hometown Amazon, the city has had to bend. Some private entities have an attitude of 'we take data, we use it, we monetize it, we share it, we do what we want with it because we're a large company and we don't have to negotiate that,' Armbruster said. 'It becomes complicated when we deal with large companies who say, 'These are our data practices, love it or leave it.' There's really no room for discussion,' she added. 'There are times when some of those data practices can be at odds with what we're hoping to do with public data. If we had a choice, we would rather do X, but here we are doing Y because we need to provide the service.'Companies Over-Collect DataArmbruster said transportation-focused companies are especially guilty of over-collecting data not relevant to the services they provide. She said some of her conversations with startups have bordered on comical. 'We ran into that all the time. Like, 'Why are you collecting this information?' 'Well, we just want it.' 'Well, I can understand why you want it, but, you know, help me with what you're doing with it, we have to be specific,'' Armbruster recalled. 'And you know, we didn't feel like we have such a mature process for privacy that we should be talking to a private entity that doesn't have that figured out. But those are the questions you have to ask, and you have to make some real trade-off decisions about that.' Oakland's privacy commission, which advises the city on collection methods and storage of residents' data, has seen the same patterns in which a private partnership 'promises to make our life better, whether it's measuring parking spaces or traffic and there's always some sort of trade-off,' said Hofer. 'Usually they offer us this service for free or at very low cost, but it's in exchange for our data, and we want to know how that data's being used, where it goes, what the purpose is, and put some reasonable guidelines into place,' he added. 'Some of these proposals come to us pretty thin,' Hofer said. 'There's not a lot of analysis. They haven't really studied the impact, they're just trying to figure out how to get large volumes of data and go sell it to their customers, to third parties. The tech mentality is just 'if we can collect it, let's collect it,'' he said. 'Whereas we're coming a little bit more from the legal civil liberty side: 'Should we collect it?'' Hofer said he hopes privacy-first policies cause companies to ask themselves, 'What data do I need to achieve that purpose, and what is the minimum amount of retention to hold the data until I can delete it safely?'Big Data, Big ProfitsFor tech companies, of course, data equal profit. Facebook, Google, Experian, CoreLogic, Acxiom and other data harvesters have been joined by thousands of large and small brokers that buy and sell, or give third parties access to, personal information. International Data Corp., which provides market research for technology and telecommunications companies, has projected[14] that in 2020, Big Data and business analytics will generate more than $210 billion in revenues worldwide. Users' personal information can be the most valuable asset some startups have and the foundation of their business model to attract investors. Hepner said one major goal of San Francisco's privacy policy is to limit the jackpot their founders are seeking. 'If you're providing a service to the public \u2014 an alternative transit service, for instance \u2014 that's great and we want you to provide that service,' said Hepner. 'But if the profit motive of your business is the acquisition of people's personal information, or the potential misuse and abuse of that personal information, and your business model is actually like a data broker and facilitating data-broker monopolies, then that's something that we definitely want to put up some safeguards.' In his February State of the State Address[15], Gov. Gavin Newsom congratulated the Legislature for passing the nation's first state privacy law, saying that 'companies that make billions of dollars collecting, curating and monetizing our personal data have a duty to protect it. Consumers have a right to know and control how their data is being used.' He then proposed a 'data dividend' for Californians, 'because we recognize that your data has value and it belongs to you.' 'California's consumers should also be able to share in the wealth that is created from their data,' he said. A push for standardized, potentially more conservative, national legislation could also be a way for technology giants to reign in far-reaching local or state regulations. 'My hope is that we will get to federal legislation before we get 48 different privacy state laws,' Kalinda Raina, head of global privacy at LinkedIn, said at a January event in San Francisco marking national Data Privacy Day[16]. 'It'd be wonderful to see one law that is operated at the federal level that is consistent and brings the ability for companies to plan throughout the U.S. as to how they're going to comply.' Cole's clients are waiting to see the texts of both the San Francisco and California laws. She's also tracking the evolution of and difference among local and state privacy laws across the country, including San Jose, Denver and New York. 'It's starting to get a little difficult to keep up,' she said. To date, 11 states are considering[17] privacy laws similar to California's. In Washington state, one piece of legislation calls for restricting companies that use personal data for profiling and facial recognition.The Question of EnforcementProposition B directs San Francisco's city administrator to draft the privacy policy by May 31. As of early February, that office was still months away from writing any 'meaningful content,' said spokesman Bill Barnes. 'We already have a lot of laws in San Francisco that govern different types of information,' he said, highlighting the voter-approved Proposition D in 2006, which strengthened restrictions on when the city could disclose private information. 'The city's treatment of private information is generally fairly robust.' The city administrator is also working in the shadow of the state attorney general, who is hammering out the details of the California Consumer Privacy Act[18], which becomes law on Jan. 1, 2020. Buttar, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which defends civil liberties in the digital realm, said that although 'Big Tech is quite active in pushing back against the regulatory schemes that the state Attorney General's Office is building,' he hasn't heard about similar lobbying efforts at the city level, at least not yet. He pointed out one crucial detail of the state law that has yet to be determined: Whether individuals will have a 'private right of action' to sue, and who will enforce the law \u2014 the attorney general or the courts. 'If the private enforcement goes off the table and the AG's office is then the sole source of enforcement, it will likely get inundated by reports of violations and abuse from users around the state,' Buttar said. San Francisco has to wrestle with a similar question: Will enforcement fall to the city attorney? 'How will the compliance mechanisms work? What will the complaint processing look like, what kinds of remedies will or will not be offered?' said the Future of Privacy Forum's Finch, who built a tool Seattle uses to evaluate privacy risks for its open-data program. 'It's very important to be clear with the people of San Francisco what those will be.' The city administrator's spokesman said it was too early to comment. 'As we draft this with the City Attorney's Office, we'll obviously look at everything,' said Barnes. To Buttar, 'The most important aspect of both of these reforms at the state and the municipal level is the empowerment of users and their agency and autonomy, and their right to choose how their information is used. If that's all we get out of these measures, even that would be a pretty big step forward.'

Through books and magazine cover stories, pricey speeches and consultations, the TED-talking University of Toronto professor popularized the early aughts idea that faded cities could revitalize themselves by attracting the talented, intellectual types who made up what he called the \"creative class.\" Lure some hip coffee shops, create an \"arts district,\" play up your gay friendliness, and watch the laptopping masses pour in. Sixteen years after Florida published his first book, \"The Rise of the Creative Class,\" that theory has proved half true. For many small, post-industrial cities without assets like big tech companies and universities, no amount of creative-class marketing would turn things around. </p><p>Elmira, N.Y., for example, saw little return on its investment in the Florida program, as a 2009 story in the American Prospect detailed. But some cities - San Francisco and New York, Austin and Seattle and Washington - have seen the theory work entirely too well, as creative and techy types revitalized downtown neighborhoods to the point where only bankers and software developers can afford to live in them comfortably. Florida's critics jumped on the skyrocketing housing market as evidence that his creative class gospel might have backfired. So at an appearance in Houston earlier this month, put on by the Kinder Institute and the Greater Houston Community Foundation, Florida knew he would face some skeptical questions. The audience didn't disappoint. Someone asked: How did he get his seminal theory so wrong? Florida didn't miss a beat. \"I got wrong that the creative class could magically restore our cities, become a new middle class like my father's, and we were going to live happily forever after,\" he said. \"I could not have anticipated among all this urban growth and revival that there was a dark side to the urban creative revolution, a very deep dark side.\" Florida has been thinking a lot about that dark side lately, for a book he's publishing in the spring called \"The New Urban Crisis.\" It will talk about fixing the affordable housing shortage in desirable areas, connecting cities and their outlying suburbs with mass transit, raising the wages of service workers so they can afford the prices that are rising around them - to knit together a \"patchwork metropolis,\" as he calls it. In short, many of the things that other people have been talking about for many years now, but wrapping it all together with a rhetorical flair that has been his calling card. \"The urban pessimists have a point,\" Florida says. \"We neglected their point, which is that cities are gentrifying, people are being priced out, displaced from their homes. I think we need a new vision for cities that combines an optimistic viewpoint with an understanding of the challenges that re-urbanization brings.\" So how did this self-promoting thought leader come to question his own theory of how the world was supposed to get better? He sat down for an interview after his speech to flesh out the story. As he tells it, he had wanted to include a chapter on inequality in his first book, but it was cut for length. After the book came out, the problem kept getting worse. \"Even though I saw the numbers, I was still naive about the extent to which this was occurring,\" Florida says. \"And hopeful, just overly optimistic and hopeful, that this would somehow work itself out. . I really had to introspect long and hard.\" What really brought the shift was pointed criticism by a group of writers and social scientists who pointed out that Florida's \"creative class\" had either failed to reverse the decline of cities that had lost their economic engines to globalization and automation, or fueled gentrification and inequality in the places where it seemed to work. Other research revealed the conditions that create pockets of poverty, and found a downside to ethnically mixed cities: People in different groups tend to live apart. \"Here's Mr. Diversity, extolling the virtues of diversity in large cities,\" Florida says. \"And what comes back to smash you over the head is that large diverse cities also incubate a horrific level of sorting and segregation.\" A couple years ago, Florida acknowledged that the benefits of these creative clusters did not, in fact, spill over to the waiters and janitors who serve them. Rather, the newcomers reaped the benefits of their own skills, while wages stayed low for people who had lived there all along. The perennial Houston-booster Joel Kotkin, a professor at Chapman University outside Los Angeles who extols the benefits of low taxes and single-family sprawl, seized on the revelation as an admission that Florida was wrong all along. The resulting exchange, Florida says, is what prompted him to write his new book. He emailed Kotkin, telling him how much his work had influenced his thinking. Kotkin wrote back, trying to convey how limited he thought Florida's theories really were, since the majority of people don't actually want to live in the hip urban environments he envisions when they grow up and have kids. \"You can't build an urban theory about where at best 10 percent of the population lives,\" Kotkin says. Accordingly, Florida's new book is about an \"inclusive urbanism,\" about investing in residents' skills rather than yuppifying their neighborhoods, about retrofitting suburbs for people who might want to be able to walk to a grocery store and piping them into the city with commuter rail. He doesn't, however, believe he was wrong to have encouraged cities to target creative professionals and high-tech companies in the first place. While humbled, he's by no means contrite. \"If we stop clustering, if we seize up this influx of diversity and tolerance, we'll choke off our economic growth,\" Florida says. He also has little patience for the tribe of urban libertarians who advocate loosening development restrictions to boost housing construction and bring down prices, as if affordability were simply a matter of supply and demand. (It's not.) \"They drive me ... nuts!\" Florida bursts out. \"What happened to the urban left is it got captured by critical studies, the people who run around in geography departments and who've just given up reality. These are the people who think you're going to rebuild cities by deregulating land use. Welcome to Houston!\" Contra Kotkin, who credits Houston's relative affordability to its laissez- faire regulation, Florida doesn't think Houston is a paragon of urban inclusivity. On a new index he's put together that ranks cities according to their levels of economic segregation and inequality, he says, Houston ranks third. Instead of just allowing unfettered housing construction as a one-shot solution, he advocates for more public investment in affordable rental housing, and land use rules that promote transit, to be financed by redirecting federal highway funds into light rail and high-tech buses. In other words, it sounds very similar to the \"smart growth\" philosophy that has become commonplace in urban planning departments across the country. Probably more complete than his creative class manifesto, but more a product of how the field of urban policy has been changing ahead of him, rather than a path-breaking philosophy to lead it. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lydia.depillis@chron.com\">lydia.depillis@chron.com</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:twitter.com/@lydiadepillis\">twitter.com/@lydiadepillis</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN38538165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M2H-XW11-JC8S-D16G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1230\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

But that is what came to mind when we learned that 47 state attorneys general led by Texas\u2019 Ken Paxton will investigate Google for \u201cpotential monopolistic behavior.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t the first probe of a tech giant nor will it be the last. Other states are looking into Facebook\u2019s market dominance, and various Congressional, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice and European investigations are also underway into the practices of the Internet\u2019s biggest players. The common element is whether online business practices impede competition, suppress innovation and harm consumers.</p><p>The answer is a mix of yes, no and sometimes. Google, Facebook and other tech giants cast large shadows over our lives. They make our lives better, but many business practices regarding privacy, personal data, online speech, online advertising, publishing and competition cause us great concern. A big part of the problem is that Congress has been missing in action on telecom, antitrust and privacy issues for decades.</p><p>Let us be clear: Companies that violate privacy protections, track web activity without permission or misrepresent their actions should be held accountable. Such violators should also bear responsibility for the content they propagate, as other publishers are.</p><p>The problem is that the old rules of policing monopolistic conduct aren\u2019t appropriate to regulate a dynamic technology world. Congress has not addressed the rules of the new game since the Telecommunications Act in 1996 updated telephone industry regulations in the aftermath of the 1984 breakup of the old Bell system.</p><p>Think about that: It took 12 years after Ma Bell was broken up for Congress to act. Now, 23 years since the last telecom reform, the pace of change has been light-years faster.</p><p>Existing laws, from antitrust to privacy, are not suited to address the most glaring practices of big tech companies, such as how they handle consumer data and treat potential competition. So when state or federal regulators attempt to corkscrew old-school antitrust and telecom principles to address newly perceived monopolistic conduct, the risk is less innovation, overregulation and higher prices for consumers.</p><p>The internet is vibrant because the sum is greater than the parts. Voice, music, news, photos, video, advertising and other services that were once separate mediums and industries now are intertwined business models. The question is whether the t structure of the internet, with a very few dominant companies, fairly treats both consumers and creators. There is good reason to doubt it does.</p><p>But the remedy must also recognize the enormous benefits consumers have reaped from the internet. Protecting people\u2019s privacy, as well as reforming the blanket immunity that internet platforms enjoy from civil liability, are appropriate areas for Congress to address, and address soon.</p><p>We appreciate the frustration of the attorneys general with Google. And we accept they are using the tools they have. But those tools are the wrong ones for this fight.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DALNWS-70694538</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DALNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1N-X121-JBKB-W4F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11802</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS</copyright><publicationName>THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15041\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>1 EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The WSJ found that Amazon's marketplace carried products that \"big box retailers' policies would bar from their shelves.\" Earlier this year, RILA submitted comments to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) outlining retailers concerns with the ability of big tech companies to control product information, prices, and quality, and the negative impact this can have on consumers, writing: If the digital interface masks or obfuscates the true identity of the seller, or leaves the misimpression that an item is new and from the manufacturer, or falsely implies that a knock-off item is just like the option from a well-known brand, consumers (as well as regulators and enforcers) have no ability to uncover the truth until after their purchase. </p><p>That harms consumers who do not get what they were looking for, and may not even realize it because the provenance or nature of their item has been obscured by the very information source through which they sought out the item in the first place. Today, the Wall Street Journal confirmed retailers concerns, reporting: A Wall Street Journal investigation found 4,152 items for sale on Amazon.com Inc.s site that have been declared unsafe by federal agencies, are deceptively labeled or are banned by federal regulatorsitems that big-box retailers policies would bar from their shelves. Among those items, at least 2,000 listings for toys and medications lacked warnings about health risks to children. RILA and its members continue to urge the FTC to examine competition and consumer protection in the modern economy and take the next steps with investigations and actions against companies that are deceptively selling products that are counterfeit, compromised, or in any way harmful to American consumers. ### RILA is the US trade association for leading retailers. We convene decision-makers, advocate for the industry, and promote operational excellence and innovation. Our aim is to elevate a dynamic industry by transforming the environment in which retailers operate. RILA members include more than 200 retailers, product manufacturers, and service suppliers, which together account for more than $1.5 trillion in annual sales, millions of American jobs, and more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing facilities, and distribution centers domestically and abroad.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123147223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWK-TJG1-DYTH-G537-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"447\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 23, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Happy  Monday to you and good morning everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for  joining us.  It is Monday, April 23rd.  Your top stories right now 6:00a.m.  on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings on the driver seat on Wall Street this morning, Futures showing a  decline at the start of trading today, down about 40 points on the Dow,  down a fraction on the S&amp;P, and down eight points on the NASDAQ.  More than  a third of the Dow and the S&amp;P500 set to report their first quarter  earnings this week.  It is going to be a monster week for earnings.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alphabet, the name to watch after the close tonight, it comes amid new  concerns surrounding Google's data collection.  Dan Niles Money Manager on  Wall Street this weekend says he thinks Google will miss earnings  estimates.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets tumbling on Friday, Apple dragged the Dow lower after analysts'  reports suggested that smartphone sales could slow in the coming months.   Also, Niles said Apple will miss.  We are watching the fine market this  morning, the 10-year yield creeping closer to three percent, take a look,  up two basis points right now at 2.99 percent on the 10-year.</p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks looking like this, now we do have a lower  opening there as well and lower trading this morning.  CAC Quarante is down  a fraction, CAC Quarante in Paris down a fraction as is the DAX Index in  Germany, down a quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight right across the board, the Hang Seng the biggest loser,  down better than one-half of one percent in Hong Kong.  </p><p>And a pair of former political outsiders inside the Oval Office, President  Trump welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House today  from trade to national security.  We're taking a look at what's on the  agenda for the two world leaders ahead of the state dinner tomorrow night.</p><p>Investigating the investigation, shocking new revelations on the start of  the FBI probe into the Trump campaign.  House Intelligence Chairman Devin  Nunes telling me yesterday about his findings, he explained on Sunday  Morning Futures.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN:  We've long wanted to  know what intelligence did you have that actually led to this  investigation.  So what we found now after the investigators have reviewed  it is that in fact there was no intelligence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No intelligence to launch that investigation.  The very latest  on the investigation coming up.  Plus, another high note for the music  industry, Chinese streaming giant Tencent reportedly planning to go public  where the company is expected to list and that mammoth evaluation.</p><p>Plus, revving up their resume, Harley-Davidson offering an internship of a  lifetime, how college students can get paid to ride coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to talk  about it, FOX BUsines Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO, Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy along with Pollster and the President of Maslansky and  Partners, Lee Carter.  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Good morning.  Great to be  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Happy Monday everybody.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning Maria.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Incredible interview with Devin Nunes, the  Congressman, Head of the House Intelligence Committee.  So I can't wait to  hear that again this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's just a -- it's extraordinary.  We've talked about  how the same FBI agents were overseeing an investigation into Trump and an  investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail usage.  </p><p>And now we find out that with all of the evidence on the Hillary Clinton  side, they didn't have any official intelligence to launch this  investigation.  It sounds like Dagen it was all about the dossier.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All about the dossier.  And that it -- again, this is a thread  that runs through.  The very highest leadership within the FBI and it's  incredible that -- I mean, it really is Devin Nunes who's taking this on to  uncover why a presidential campaign was being investigated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  And he's getting trashed for it at every level.   And yet he's the Chairman of the Intel Committee and has looked at the raw  data and has come up with this, that there was no intelligence used.  Quite  extraordinary, we're going to talk about that this morning and what that  means.</p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got House Majority Leader, California  Congressman Kevin McCarthy in the studio this morning.  White House  Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah is here.  FOX News Senior  Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano along with former U.S. Attorney  and Avenue Strategies Partner, Budd Cummings. </p><p>Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a lot on the table this morning to  talk about.  And, of course, we are also looking at earnings.  Investors  are weighing for Google's parent company Alphabet to report earnings after  the close tonight as the technology giant gears up to report the results  and tell us what the last three months look like.  Analysts expecting the  company to post adjusted earnings of $9.28 a share on revenue of $3.29  billion.  Alphabet is kicking off big techs earnings splits on Wall Street  this week.  We also have Amazon coming out on Thursday.  Mike Murphy, your  thoughts?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think when you see a move in big tech like you saw Apple on  Friday dropped seven points, I think in this market it's a buying  opportunity.  So, Google's going to -- Alphabet's going to come out with  earnings and say, \"We're going to hear from Amazon\" all the big tech  companies, they're all going to post great numbers.</p><p>How the stock reacts, I think the way to play it is if there's a pullback,  it's a buying opportunity because we have underlying strength in the  market, you have underlying strength in these companies.  So any weakness,  I'd be a buyer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe but Dan Niles from Alpha One who's really very thoughtful  on the tech sector, he was my guest on the Wall Street program this weekend  and he said Apple's going to miss and Amazon -- and Google parent, Alphabet  is going to miss.  </p><p>Now, if you had that big sharp decline on Apple on Friday, does the market  -- is the market telling you get ready for a miss and all are we going to  see an even bigger decline if the company comes out and reports a miss?</p><p>MURPHY:  You may.  But remember, Apple under most recent pull off came all  the way down to $151 and right after that, it rallied all the way back up  to $170.  So here, where it's trading in the mid $160s, it's setting up  after Friday's move, it -- I think you're pricing a miss into the stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>MURPHY:  So if there's any more weakness, I'd be a buyer.  But if Apple  misses by a few millions, iPhone Xs in the market, I think that sets up as  a buying opportunity because they have so many other levers that they can  pull.  I think that people are going to be buying iPhones in the third  quarter, in the fourth quarter, so any weakness is a buying.</p><p>CARTER:  Do you think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You should drop the X.  People don't like the X and they've got  expectations that it's going to not meet demand numbers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a flop.  According to some, if you talk to -- I'm not doing  channel checks but I go and -- yes, I've talked to a lot of people who work  in the data -- the cellphone company in the stores, not for Apple but like  -- I won't use the name of the company because I don't want to get the  employees in trouble.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they would know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they tell me if I go in and say, \"Do you like the X?\"   They're like, \"No, don't buy it.  It really is awful.\"  They were like, \"If  you tried an Android phone\" so that would certainly benefit Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, people are unhappy with it.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I haven't had the easiest, same as mine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a $1,000, that's a huge outlay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, expensive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  At a time when Americans really are keeping the purse strings  pretty tight in terms of their spending.</p><p>MURPHY:  One thing on that, if you're going to buy an X, it's 24 months and  they charge $50.00 a month automatically.  So they're giving you an  interest for a loan to finance the purchase of the phone.  So I think  people like that.  And I think no matter what, people are going to buy the  next Apple phone, so I think that's the -- </p><p>CARTER:  If it was selling off the shelf by itself though they wouldn't  have to do that, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MURPHY:  Well, I think you have to define off the shelf -- well no, I think  that's part of their plan.  So number one, off the shelves, they may miss  numbers at top line expectations but they're still selling a ton of iPhone  Xs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what Dan Niles said about this is that they --  he said him and his whole family needed new batteries.  And so they went  and changed the battery in the phone and it was $29.00 and they were fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said, \"I don't need to buy a new phone,\" he said.  And  so I'm looking at my family as a proxy and saying, \"Well all we did was buy  a $29.00 battery and we were good to go and we didn't need the next phone.\"   So that's what he's worried about, the next phone and, of course, the  issues around the X which are real.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I also am curious with regulation if fears are going to play  into stock prices after earnings this week because I know so many people  are talking about, is tech going to be the next area that's going to be  highly regulated like banks were before with all of the data concerns, with  everything that's with Facebook.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That goes right to what Maria mentioned at the top of the show  about the -- this Wall Street Journal story on the amount of information  that Google collects on you, (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the article is called, \"Who has more of your data?  Your  personal data than Facebook?  Try Google.\"  The Journal reporting that  Google's android devices allowed the harvesting of data from billions of  active users without warning.</p><p>What about that?  I mean, I'm talking eight years ago I did a documentary  on Google and that was about the fact that they save all your searches for  two years and then they anonymize the math to two years but why do they say  for the two years anyway?</p><p>MURPHY:  I guess to monetize them, they want to figure out how they can --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- get advertising dollars in by using a data.  But I think where  we are today in 2018, if you're on the internet, if you're on your smart  phone, if you're searching on a computer, if you're searching anywhere,  there are ways for whether it's Google or Apple or Facebook, somebody can  track what you're doing.</p><p>Now, if you don't like that, I guess there are certain ways to try to  backdoor it or opt out of certain things.  But, I think that's just a fact  of life, people are going to know what was --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But what did Sheryl Sandberg say, Dagen?  She said, \"Oh,  we don't have a product to opt out at the high levels, that's a paid  product.\"  In other words, I have to pay them just to secure my data that  is not shared.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's an idea that should -- that actually Walt Mossberg came  up with.  Like, he suggested that Facebook offer a paid service and -- so  they wouldn't share of your data.  </p><p>But this Wall Street Journal article goes into the fact that Google, if  you're logged into Google, you can opt out of how they use your private  information.  But it goes well beyond that because Google Analytics is used  on about 50 million sites and Google Analytics tracks you whether you're  logged in or not, so that's number one.  But Google uses among other  things, you're browsing in search history apps, you've installed  demographics like age and gender from its own analytics and other sources  where -- and other sources like where we've shopped in the real world.</p><p>It's incredible Google's reach and I think that the point of this article  in the Wall Street Journal is Mark Zuckerberg gets called in front of  Congress, he -- and gets grilled about regulation, same thing's going to  happen to Alphabet and Google and Google out to be a little bit more  worried than even Facebook --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what does that mean?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- about regulation, what are they going to do?  Are -- is there  going to be a broad way you can prevent Google from collecting your  information whether you're -- even if you aren't logged into the Google  service.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with new rules, how much does that impact the earnings and  does that change the (INAUDIBLE) on the stock?</p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  Well that's why these companies have been so profitable is  that they can sell your data to advertisers and advertisers know exactly  who you are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we didn't realize how much they were selling.</p><p>MURPHY:  I guess maybe people didn't know exactly how much they were  selling but I think when you went on to the site, I think you knew.  When  you logged in to your computer and looked Mexican vacations, the next time  you log in, there are six sites popping up that are focused on Mexican  resorts or Mexican vacations.  I mean, that's been going on for years from  these companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  But I think that people knew that sort of thing but I don't think  they understood how that translated to so many other -- other things.  And  that the data might used not for what they want it to be used for.</p><p>So if you Google Mexican vacations or getting Mexican vacations, that makes  sense to people.  But when they have -- you have a whole profile online  that says this is who they think you are, your age and that the kinds of  ads are going to serve up based on that, I think a lot Americans are  confused by that and quite frankly are angry that that's happened because  they don't feel it's been transparent to them at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, when you're in a certain place in the world and  all of a sudden you get an ad for that local store that's on the block that  you were in, that's a little spooky -- </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- I'm sorry.  I'm going to switch gears to the White House,  President Trump welcoming French Leader Emmanuel Macron today to Washington  for a three-day visit.  The two are expected to talk about trade ahead of  his trip.  The French president issued a warning to the United States,  listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE:  You cannot make war with your ally.   It's too complicated.  If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade  war against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war (INAUDIBLE)  come on, it's not -- it doesn't work.  You need ally, we are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yet he still agrees with many of President Trump's  policies, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This goes back to something I've talked about repeatedly is that  our allies in terms of trade and on the world stage, we're kind of  blindsided by the steel and aluminum tariffs.  </p><p>If you want -- if you really want to take on China, if China is your  biggest problem globally in terms of unfair trade practices, then you lock  arms with Europe, with Japan and you present a united front.  When you kind  of throw a steel and aluminum tariff in the face of your allies and say,  \"Maybe we'll exempt you, maybe we won't.\"  And there have been many  exemptions it turned out.</p><p>But, again, it was handled so haphazardly and so ham-handedly right out of  the gate with the holding up the -- you got the Commerce Secretary holding  up cans of soup and lecturing the American people about your -- the cost of  this can of soup isn't going on.  It shows the fundamental misunderstanding  of how people will react to inflation and, again, inflation by fiat out of  the White House but also it was a slap on the face to our allies if they  weren't consulted about it in the first place.  They're trying to manage it  now but, again, they're still -- he still got his hair up so to speak.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Messaging issues I guess.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come back, no official  intelligence was used to start the Russia investigation, the so-called  collusion.  The jaw-dropping revelation from House Intel Committee Chairman  Devin Nunes after digging deeper into FBI and DOJ documents, the new  questions in the case, that's right after this break.</p><p>And then Tencent, China's largest music streaming company could launch one  of the biggest technology IPOs ever with a monster valuation.  The  staggering number right ahead, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well a massive manhunt is underway this morning  for the man suspected of killing four people at a Waffle House outside of  Nashville.  Cheryl Caosne on headlines on that now, over to you Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes Maria, good morning to you.  Police say that 29-year-old  Travis Reinking is armed and dangerous.  National public schools are now in  lockdown mode.  We learned yesterday that he was arrested in July of 2017  for being in a restricted area near the White House.</p><p>More than a year before that, Reinking claimed singer Taylor Swift was  stalking him.  Customer James Shaw fearing for his life, took a dangerous  chance to pounce on the shooter to wrestle at least the gun away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES SHAW, JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO:  At the time that he was either  reloading or the gun jammed, or whatever happened, is when I ran through  the swivel door, I hit him with the swivel door.  I managed to get him with  one hand on the gun and then I grabbed it from him and I threw it over the  countertop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the four people who were killed have been identified.   Authority say they are Taurean Sanderlin, Joe Perez, Akilah Dasilva, and  DeEbony Groves.  Sanderlin was an employee at that Waffle House.</p><p>Well, more cancellations today for Southwest Airlines, Southwest has  cancelled at least 100 scheduled flights today and yesterday they cancelled  about 40 to inspect the planes' engines.  This comes after last week's  accident in Pennsylvania that killed one woman on board.  A fan blade broke  off ripping a hole to the plane's wing and then it went into the window on  Friday.  Regulators have ordered emergency inspections on 700 of the same  type of engine that was involved in that accident.  Shares of Southwest  Airlines were down about 17 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, it could be the summer of the hog for some college students.  Harley- Davidson planning to pick eight lucky summer interns and teach them how to  ride bikes.  Then they're going to attend a motorcycle event across the  country, document it all for social media.  It's a 12-week paid internship  open to juniors and seniors who are interested (INAUDIBLE) in social media,  communications, public relations, or marketing.  Taking a look at shares of  Harley-Davidson down about 20 percent so far this year.  I got a kick out  of the story Maria because my neighbor who's 66 yesterday said to me, \"I  want a new Harley\" and I thought, \"Exactly.  And you're 66-years-old.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  What a gig.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty cool.  Get the interns to drive them, ride the bike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A well -- this is a well-known problem that Harley-Davidson's  been having.  What Cheryl mentioned as -- that young people are not buying  motorcycles and not riding motorcycles in this country.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They want to get the young people on the motorcycle so they can  collect data.  See if the big -- it's a theme that they want the data on --</p><p>CARTER:  It's a big conspiracy.</p><p>MURPHY:  That they need data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh God.  </p><p>CARTER: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We get an enormous shout out to James Shaw, wow, what a hero.   Actually in the Waffle House, sees the gunman come in, just moved and acts.   Jumps -- pushes the door into him, jumps on him, and removes the guy's gun.   There he is, James Shaw just a patron at the Waffle House becomes the hero  of the day.</p><p>When they found all those magazines and the other bullets in the shooter's  jacket, you know that he was there for some serious killing and James Shaw  stopped it.  </p><p>MURPHY:  It's great to see a young man being celebrated, to see the FBI  around him, clapping for him.  I mean, we - like you said a true hero and  we should talk about it even more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  I think he's just terrific.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We should keep talking about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every week, let's just talk about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) it out, you are such hero.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And to have that kind of courage, wrestle the gun out of  his hands.  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come back, Hillary  Clinton is now blaming charlatans and the media for her 2016 election loss.   Now it's the media's fault.  Her stunning new comments coming up.</p><p>And then we are watching global currency this morning as the 10-year  Treasury hits a high of -- a four-year high right under three percent.  How  this may impact this week's European Central Bank meeting as well.  Back in  a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures edging lower this morning, investors are waiting on  more earnings.  We are expecting a lower opening for the Dow down 28,  NASDAQ and S&amp;P down just a fraction.  We're also watching the bond market,  the yields on the 10-year hitting 2.99 percent, that is the highest level  since January 2014.</p><p>Joining us right now is Belpointe Chief Strategist, David Nelson.  David,  good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What worries you more, the move towards three percent or the  earnings story?</p><p>NELSON:  The earning story only in the sense that the expectations were  just so high coming into this.  Just before this earning started, J.P.  Morgan was one of the first to report.  </p><p>I looked at an estimate chart and they had literally gone parabolic going  into the earnings.  So expectations are high and so far what I've seen, the  earnings have been fine.  The bigger problem in earning season this time  around is technology.  And I saw your interview with Dan Niles and hit on a  couple of important points.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's do that right now.  Let's see what Dan Niles said  about technology.  He had a real problem with Apple and Google parent  Alphabet.  Here's Dan Niles this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You also think Apple is going to have a miss when it reports.</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  Yes, I do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Apple reports in May, watch for that.  Dan thinks they're  going to miss on the numbers.  Google parent Alphabet, you also think may  miss.  </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I think that one though I like quite a bit over the longer  term.  I think the problem with Google is the exact opposite as with  Facebook.  With Facebook, they guided expenses up 45 to 60 percent this  year before this data breach stuff ever happened.</p><p>When you look at Google, they have expenses model for some reason Wall  Street does, Google doesn't guide.  The Wall Street has expenses modeled to  the -- go up by the slowest pace in the last five years.  And I think the  expenses are actually going to be a bit higher.  I think the revenues will  be fine but I think you're going to have a problem on the margin front  which is why I think the EPS is going to have an issue.  But that's one of  those stocks that after that I think is in really good shape going forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess the question becomes if Apple and Google's parent  Alphabet missed, does that create a reason to sell and sort of lead this  market down and earnings worried?</p><p>NELSON:  It's difficult to have a bull market without tech in the lead.   It's just an item in the script.  This is a missed product cycle for Apple.   I thought the iPhone X was a disappointment.  I have an iPhone7, I so no  need to switch.</p><p>The bigger issue for technology isn't even Apple, it's really Washington.   Make no mistake, what you saw with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, that  was the earth moving under our feet.  Regulation is coming to technology  and that means change business models. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is inviting it, and as that changed, business models take  place and you give consumers the ability to opt out of some or all part of  their data.  Then that data is just simply worthless and that translates to  other companies as well, Google and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's what we've been saying earlier Mike.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  So David, when -- so I agree, you don't want to fight  Washington.  When you're owning a company, you don't want them like  Facebook fighting Washington.  But this could lead -- I see this is a  potential opportunity for the Facebooks and Alphabets and Apples of the  World to start monetizing some of their data, to actually charge consumers  for the data because it's not as if you're going to have a mass equities  away from Google.</p><p>NELSON:  They're going to charge consumers for their data, how about  consumers charging Facebook to use the data, that's another model that  could go out there.  </p><p>MURPHY:  How would -- I don't know how they would put that.</p><p>NELSON:  I don't know, I --</p><p>MURPHY:  You're not going to charge Facebook for something but Facebook  could say, \"Hey, $0.99 per year, $0.99 per quarter, per month.\"</p><p>NELSON:  You mean to not opt in and not have your data use.</p><p>MURPHY:  Or to have a certain type of your data use, let's have a certain  type.  I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's so backwards to me that I'm going to pay them to protect  my privacy.</p><p>NELSON:  I'm not going to do that.</p><p>MURPHY:  You're really paying them to use their service, right?  They've  been giving it to you for free for years.  You've been on it, you've been  using it all the time --</p><p>NELSON:  I think it's just the opposite honestly.  I feel that they're --</p><p>MURPHY:  That you're going to charge Facebook.</p><p>NELSON:  -- extracting a lot of data from me, they're making a lot of money  off of it.  And I think the only other way around for them is if I opt out  of my data then you can charge me to be on that site and pay for a model.   That's something that Sheryl Sanderberg has said that she doesn't want to  do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of the biggest issues is not necessarily Washington but  investors stepping back and saying, \"Have Google and Facebook squeezed as  much information out of us as they possibly can and that they've reached a  ceiling in terms of their ad revenue\" or the revenue that they can -- how  fast they can grow their revenue.</p><p>Google has access to two billion active android mobile devices and that's  where a lot of the data extraction comes from and that's where a lot of the  data that's later used improperly comes from, this is according to one of  these -- a professor quoted in this Wall Street Journal article but I think  in terms of some of these ad companies and even though Apple's had a bad  product cycle with the iPhone X, Apple's in a better position privacy-wise  which Tim Cook has been pretty big in Facebook or Google at this point in  terms of protecting your --</p><p>NELSON:  They're also becoming less iPhone depend at this point and they're  monetizing a lot of their other services, so that's good news for them.   It's a miss product cycle, that's cyclical, we'll get over that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So real quick, the estimates called for profit growth in the  S&amp;P500 of 19 percent for the first quarter.  Are you saying that's too  high?</p><p>NELSON:  I think they -- and we'll probably hit that, maybe even beat that  but the market knows that stocks are discounting that, they knew that's  coming in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So would you sell it to markets right now?  You want to sell  it?</p><p>NELSON:  No, I'm fully invested and I'll pick and choose my points.  If  you're going to try to trade around every wiggle of this market, you're  going to find yourself missing the big runs unless you've got some kind of  tactical program to do that for you, avoid that at all cost.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing to just point quickly, you talk about the overall  earnings growth for the S&amp;P500.  If you look at the major tech companies of  the ones reporting this week, Alphabet is expected to have faster growth in  that 20 percent.</p><p>But Facebook, it's only expected to have earnings per share change of not  even five percent.  Microsoft, less than the overall market, Intel less  than the overall market.  Intel also single digit grower in terms of EPS.</p><p>NELSON:  And that shows expenses going up at Facebook that's why markets  are contracting.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Which is what Niles pointed out.  David, great to see  you.</p><p>NELSON:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, David Nelson joining us there.  Coming up,  shocking new revelations on how the FBI probes into the Trump campaign  really began.  White House's Chairman of -- the House Chairman of the  Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes told me after digging deeper into the  FBI and DOJ documents, he's next.</p><p>And then TV personality and surgeon, Dr. Oz helps students who were  escaping a bus fire on a New Jersey highway, the dramatic video coming up,  back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, April 23rd, happy  Monday, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets  under pressure this morning, down, fractionally, as you can see, ahead of a  big week for earnings.  </p><p>The rising yield on the tenure treasury one issue weighing on markets  again, hovering near three percent right now, up to 2.98 percent.  Rising  yield hitting the equity markets on Friday, the major indices all closing  nearly one percent lower on the day.  And now, all are negative for the  year, 2018.  Global markets also watching earnings this morning.  It is a  big week for earnings.  </p><p>The European indices are down across the board.  It is really a fractional  move, one-third of the Dow, one-third on the S&amp;P 500, report earnings for  the first quarter, this week.  Check Asian markets, declines across the  board.  Here too, fractional moves, Hong Kong, the worst performer.  </p><p>New questions this morning over the Russia investigation, House  Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, telling me on Sunday Morning  Futures that no intelligence was used to actually start this probe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  We've never understood because, you know, we have -- we have access  to these finish intelligence products, and we've never seen one.  We had  never -- so, we thought, well, maybe there was one that went to a different  channel that was kept really quiet, it was secret, it was kept from the  congress and other folks.  Well, in fact, after our investigators reviewed  this, that is not what happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was no intelligence used, the latest revelations from  this investigation and why it actually started.  A remarkable life  remembered, thousands gathered in Houston, this weekend, to celebrate the  life of the First Lady Barbara Bush and her grave site opens to the public,  this morning.  Among the mourners, four presidents and first ladies, this  photo from the funeral, going viral, take a look.  </p><p>Plus, there's this, Dr. Oz, coming to the rescue, he pulled over to help  passengers on a bus that caught fire, the dramatic video, coming up, and  striking a chord with investors, Chinese streaming giant, Tencent,  reportedly planning to go public, details on the giant valuation there as  well.</p><p>And then there's this, Rihanna, getting another brand under her umbrella,  the popstar, unveiling her own line of lingerie, a first look at the latest  addition to her business empire.  But first, Devin Nunes, drawing a line in  the sand, this weekend, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman shared  his newest findings on highly contested collusion between the Trump  campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.  He said this on Sunday  Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  I wanted to know what intelligence did you have that actually led  to this investigation.  So what we've found, now, after the investigators  have reviewed it, is that in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In fact, there was no intelligence.  I actually have to have  him repeat that in my interview.  Joining me right now to talk more about  it is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford.  Christopher,  it's good to see this morning.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you find that as extraordinary as I do?  They didn't have  any intelligence to launch an investigation into Donald Trump and whether  or not there was collusion between Trump and the Russians.  So, where did  they come up with it?  There was no intelligence that led them to believe  this.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I remember there was a full stop in the green room, before your  Sunday show when he said that, everyone looked up, holy smokes, this is a  big revelation.  Now, what it looks like from what I've been doing the  research afterwards, is this may be talking about what has been called the  second dossier because compiled by this guy, Cody Shearer, a long-time  Clinton confidant, someone who is so sketchy that in 1999 Slate Article, if  he didn't exist, the right-wing conspiracy would have to invent this guy.   He pulled together a lot of information.  </p><p>He also appears to, potentially, according to week list (INAUDIBLE)  reporting, be a source for the first dossier.  This becomes, kind of, the  self-licking ice cream -- ice cream cone thing that we've seen before,  where one guy writes a dossier to collaborate another dossier.  It turns  out to be the source for the first dossier, the author of the second  dossier.  And then our intelligence services were using media reports on  the first dossier to collaborate the first dossier.  </p><p>When it turns out that the media sources for those -- for those stories,  was the guy who wrote it himself.  It's just (INAUDIBLE) thing.  And as the  congressman pointed out, this did not come through the proper channels.   Even though some reports came to department of state, through the  Australian government, it didn't go through the proper intelligence  channels, which would be necessary to start intelligence investigation, and  that is extremely concerning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is because now we know that the only evidence or  backing for a FISA warrant to wire-tap, people from the Trump campaign, was  all that dossier which was unverified.  This is not the way America  operates.  This is really an incredible statement that they had no  intelligence on it.  And you wonder if, in fact, now that we know that, is  the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's work, I mean, what is this  investigation about?  Is it just to have an insurance policy so that you  try hard to delegitimize President Trump?</p><p>BEDFORD:  It's hard to keep track on what Mueller's investigation is about  because it seem, right now, to be so far away from where it started Russian  collaboration.  Now, Mueller's investigation is seeking the New York -- New  York Justice Attorney -- excuse me, New York Attorney, on confidants to the  President, violating attorney-client privilege.  </p><p>Things seem to have gone up the rails but there is no telling right now,  there's nothing that I've seen that's going to stop the Mueller  investigation.  And we are coming up on a big fight in the U.S. senate  between Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Mitch McConnell, because  Grassley wants to pass a bill that protects Mueller from even being fired  without congressional review.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I don't think there's anything that's going to stop this  investigation, but we're going to look back in the history books when we  finally get our eyes on these primary documents and we're probably going to  ask what the heck was going on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  You know, I want to get to Hillary Clinton in a  minute, but I just want to say this, Devin Nunes, yesterday, said that  number one, they're investigating the opening of the investigation.  Now,  they know there was no intelligence used, and number two, they're  investigating how they conducted this investigation, the willingness to use  dirt that was funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee  to get a warrant to listen to calls, and then there is a third thing that  he is working on and he's investigating the State Department.  </p><p>He says that's going to come out soon and we're also going to get more  information from this fourth-coming I.G. report which is going to focus on  Jim Comey and the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.  So, I just wonder  what it is at the State Department that the Intel committee is working on.   I think they're looking at all the people who are funnelling information to  the State Department, like as you say, the individual you just mentioned,  as well as Sidney Blumenthal?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  You're right.  And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hillary Clinton, you know, prot,g,es and colleagues, friends.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  She has a lot of friends, a lot of prot,g,es and a lot of people  who were part of what they call the spy network, which is basically headed  by Sidney Blumenthal, who had an email address that was made to look like  it was a White House e-mail address, even though Barack Obama's president,  he pushed him away from being a conspiracy theorist, even though John  Podesta has said he was lost in his own web of conspiracies.  </p><p>He was constantly feeding data back in the Department of State.  And, you  know, most administration s try to make it as easy as possible for the next  administration to come in because it's very important.  The President of  the United States is the most powerful man in the world when he deals with  our foreign policy.  By all accounts, the Department of State set  tripwires, practically, booby trap the White House for the incoming  administration and that is another (INAUDIBLE) really a dark stain on the  outgoing presidency of the last administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll wait for more information on this investigation into the  State Department.  This is big.  Meanwhile, Hillary is out, taking aim at  the press now for coverage of her run in office for 2016.  She's spoken in  an engagement in New York, yesterday.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The mainstream  political coverage was influenced by the right-wing media ecosystem.   Relentlessly, negative news has had a levelling effect that opens the doors  to charlatans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know what to say, Christopher, your thoughts.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Not only that, but then she said she thinks that the press has  gotten more fair since the 2016 election and it has been a course correct  where it's become more objective.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  That's obviously false, and American people can see that from  their lack of trust.  We have the lead reporter on the Hillary Clinton  campaign from the New York Times, admitting that she cried at her desk  after Hillary Clinton lost.  We had people saying it was a conspiracy  theory that Hillary Clinton was in, potentially, bad health.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Just days before she collapsed after 45 minutes in mild weather.   She was treated very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why it's such a joke that the Democrats are going to  be suing the Trump campaign.  They've levelled this lawsuit, when we know  that the FBI, the Department of Justice.  We're all very firmly behind  Hillary Clinton.  We know that, obviously, from all of these texts.  So  it's just laughable, this lawsuit, when it's absolutely the opposite that,  in fact, it was the FBI and the DOJ, trying hard to push Trump down and  make sure he did it when and support Hillary.</p><p>And then we have got these reports about those I.T. guys.  Imran Awan's  father transferred data to a Pakistani senator and former Head of the  Pakistani Intelligence Agency, via a usb drive, Christopher, his son,  Imran, the former ITA to Congressman and Former DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, who made unauthorized access to in-house servers while working on  the Hill.  </p><p>Present Trump tweeted about the matter over the weekend. He wrote this,  just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist Democrats.  This can  be good news and that we will now counter for the DNC server that they  refused to give the FBI.  The Debbie Wasserman Schultz servers and  documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton e-mails.   Christopher, there you go, I mean, we know what happened when the DNC was  hacked.  </p><p>You would think that if you get hacked, you want the might and the power  and the strength of the FBI behind you, to figure out who hacked you, but  that's not what they did.  They would not give their server to the FBI.   They hired a private company to look at the server because they don't want  people to know what was on the server.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Exactly.  And by every bit of our reporting, has pointed to one  thing and that said, Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was then head of the DNC,  has something that she's very concerned about getting out.  When her laptop  was first -- what appears to be her laptop, it's got the username, RepDWS,  was taken by Imran Awan and then left in the congressional building after  he had been barred from the networks and fired by every other congressman,  except for Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  </p><p>He was left there with a copy of his I.D., with a copy of his -- with a  copy of congressional badge and with a note that said, attorney-client  privilege, which is ridiculous, by the way.  Andrew McCarthy has pointed  out that you can't just put a note on evidence that says attorney-client  privilege and had to be taken out.  It was left in a phone booth,  discovered by police at night.  And since then, Debbie Wasserman Schultz  had worked really hard, including threatening the Chief of the Capitol  Police to make sure this laptop is returned.  Now, she's saying she doesn't  care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't understand.  He left the laptop in a phone booth with a  note?  What is he trying to be, a sarcastic?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Well, what it appears -- what it could potentially be and some  people had guessed, is that he's threatening Debbie Wasserman Schultz with  the information that's on that laptop, because first, she was fighting to  keep it away from -- away from the Capitol Police and out of the  jurisdiction.  And now, he is in court, holding that up for the last few  months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Christopher, we'll keep following.  You've  done great reporting on this.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher Bedford, the Daily Caller.  Coming up, Chinese  streaming giant's Tencent, reportedly planning an IPO.  It's going to be  one for the record bucks.  We've got the details, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The grave site for Barbara Bush will be opening  to the public this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Maria, the late first lady was buried over the weekend in a gated  plot at the George H.W. Bush presidential library.  She is now near the  grave of her daughter, Robin, who died from leukemia when she was just  three years old.  The Bush family, sharing photos from the private  ceremony, hundreds of family and friends giving a final farewell.  This day  brought together for former presidents-- the two President Bushes, as well  as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the first lady is also there, including  Melania Trump.  This photo has gone viral, we should say.  And in a tribute  to his wife's commitment to literacy, former President Bush wore a pair of  socks decorated with stacks of colorful books.  </p><p>Well, celebrity health expert Dr. Oz has captured this video of a burning  bus on the New Jersey turnpike with high school students running away.  Dr.  Oz pulled over to film the chaotic scene and made sure the students got to  safety.  A staff can be seen carrying luggage, instruments away from that  bus.  That group was coming back from a musical in New York.  Dr. Oz shared  the video on his Facebook page, saying he was thankful that everybody got  out safely.  This is not Dr. Oz's first roadside rescue.  He was in an  honorary firefighter after helping victims of a crash on the same highway  back in 2015.  </p><p>Well, the China's largest music streaming 10 Cent Music is preparing to go  public.  They're expected to be one of the biggest technology IPOs ever.   This valuation could exceed $25 billion.  10 Cent Music says it has got  about 700 million monthly active users.  This coming, of course, after  Spotify successfully went public on the New York Stock Exchange earlier  this month.  </p><p>And let's stay with music because Rihanna is planning to reduce -- release  a line of lingerie.  The singer modeling the collection herself.  She posts  in her underwear on Instagram.  Not clear when exactly her new products are  actually going to be released.  But last year, he successfully launched her  own make up line during New York Fashion Week.  Another celebrity, Maria,  getting on the I'm-going-to-make-and-sell-it-too bandwagon, and she's  probably doing pretty well.  Her makeup is done very well, we should say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes, that's been a real success.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Expanding her empire.</p><p>MURPHY:  More power to her.  I love it.  She's got the music, she's got the  make-up, she's got lingerie.  Awesome!  I love to see that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to say something? </p><p>CARTER:  I just want to say how much I love the picture of the Bush family  with all of the presidents at the funeral.  I love H.W.'s socks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they're great.  Coming up, as companies transform the way  we work, live, and play, the way the start-ups look for office face to  stuck in that time work.  That's where Squarefoot comes in.  The details on  the real estate disruptor right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ahead winds for growing business is finding  office space.  The one company, Squarefoot, is trying to make the process a  lot easier and more transparent now.  The company recently announced it has  raised $7 million in a series eight round financing that led by Mike Murphy  and his firm Rosecliffe with us this morning.  Mike is now joining  Squarefoot's board of directors and joining us right now to talk more about  it is the CEO and co-Founder of Squarefoot, Jonathan Wasserstrum.  Good to  see you, Jonathan.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>JONATHAN WASSERSTRUM, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, SQUAREFOOT:  Thanks for having me  guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we know about the retail market and things like truly in  the market.  Tell us how your firm differs from the competition and how you  try to provide transparency in real estate. </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Yes, groups like (INAUDIBLE) have done a great job on their  essential side pushing forward that transparency.  When we start the  business several years ago, we thought it was stupid that you couldn't go  online and do the same thing for office space -- that's what we set out to  do. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do it?</p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Well, we do a couple of things: we bring transparency to that  market that traditionally had none by allowing prospective tenants to go  online and look at space.  And we also have technology that we have built  for in-house transactions team and for the clients who we work with to  guide them to that process to make it a whole bunch more easy.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, we were first introduced to Jonathan when we are moving our  offices from midtown down to the flat iron district.  And just going online  and searching for space, we saw the Squarefoot -- that's how we originally  met them.  And we see an opportunity for them to bring to the commercial  market what companies like Compass and Red Thin have done for their  residential market.  So, now, if you want to find an office, office space,  you go right on their site, to Squarefoot.com, you look at what you want:  how many feet, how many employees, what you want to spend, and they'll pull  it up for you right on your smartphones.  So, we think this is how people  will get office space in the future.</p><p>CARTER:  it's pretty extraordinary.  We're talking about one of the things.   I was wondering what happens to commercial real estate with trends both in  and how people were working, and also, we're talking a little bit about  what that means of retail space right now in so many empty store fronts.   Can you tell me a little bit about that?  </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Yes.  It's a way that people are working.  There's been a  proliferation with groups like we work and all the flexible space writers.   We think it's great for the industry.  It brings a whole much more  flexibility to the market.  It means transactions can happen a lot quicker.   The traditional leases of three to five years or maybe a thin of the past?   I don't think I'd go that far.  I think it depends on the right solution  for the right company at the right time.  Retail has been a really  interesting thing, and everybody has been reading and talking about the  death of retail for a while.  It's probably a little bit overblown in my  opinion.  I think that it just takes a little bit to reset pricing  expectations now from historically where companies can make a whole bunch  of money with retail outlets, but a lot of that is moving online.  So,  we're just going to have to start adjusting sale price and expectations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the pushback from traditional commercial real estate  brokers and how they might be retaliating against you?  Because they're not  going to standby and just take it.  </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Hopefully, they won't be marching the streets too soon.  So,  we are brokers ourselves, so we work within the confines of the traditional  industry.  There's really two groups from the brokers' perspective: there's  the groups that represent landlords, and there's the groups that represent  tenants.  To those who represent the landlords, we're their bestfriend,  where a whole new conduit that they've never had for them to access people  actually looking for the space in the market.  And for the groups that  represent the tenants -- you know, the groups like I used to work at a guy  who runs real estate for us now.  I used to work at (INAUDIBLE) -- they  focus more on the big guys, right?  So, Fox needs office space, or the  average 500,000 Squarefoot user needs office space, you should work with  JLL.  Great!

Happy Monday to you and good morning everybody. I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us. It is Monday, April 23rd. Your top stories right now 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings on the driver seat on Wall Street this morning, Futures showing a decline at the start of trading today, down about 40 points on the Dow, down a fraction on the S&amp;P, and down eight points on the NASDAQ. More than a third of the Dow and the S&amp;P500 set to report their first quarter earnings this week. It is going to be a monster week for earnings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alphabet, the name to watch after the close tonight, it comes amid new concerns surrounding Google's data collection. Dan Niles Money Manager on Wall Street this weekend says he thinks Google will miss earnings estimates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets tumbling on Friday, Apple dragged the Dow lower after analysts' reports suggested that smartphone sales could slow in the coming months. Also, Niles said Apple will miss. We are watching the fine market this morning, the 10-year yield creeping closer to three percent, take a look, up two basis points right now at 2.99 percent on the 10-year.</p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks looking like this, now we do have a lower opening there as well and lower trading this morning. CAC Quarante is down a fraction, CAC Quarante in Paris down a fraction as is the DAX Index in Germany, down a quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight right across the board, the Hang Seng the biggest loser, down better than one-half of one percent in Hong Kong.</p><p>And a pair of former political outsiders inside the Oval Office, President Trump welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House today from trade to national security. We're taking a look at what's on the agenda for the two world leaders ahead of the state dinner tomorrow night.</p><p>Investigating the investigation, shocking new revelations on the start of the FBI probe into the Trump campaign. House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes telling me yesterday about his findings, he explained on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN: We've long wanted to know what intelligence did you have that actually led to this investigation. So what we found now after the investigators have reviewed it is that in fact there was no intelligence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: No intelligence to launch that investigation. The very latest on the investigation coming up. Plus, another high note for the music industry, Chinese streaming giant Tencent reportedly planning to go public where the company is expected to list and that mammoth evaluation.</p><p>Plus, revving up their resume, Harley-Davidson offering an internship of a lifetime, how college students can get paid to ride coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to talk about it, FOX BUsines Network's Dagen McDowell. Rosecliff CEO, Managing Partner, Mike Murphy along with Pollster and the President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter. Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS: Good morning. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Happy Monday everybody.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES: Good morning Maria.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Incredible interview with Devin Nunes, the Congressman, Head of the House Intelligence Committee. So I can't wait to hear that again this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's just a -- it's extraordinary. We've talked about how the same FBI agents were overseeing an investigation into Trump and an investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail usage.</p><p>And now we find out that with all of the evidence on the Hillary Clinton side, they didn't have any official intelligence to launch this investigation. It sounds like Dagen it was all about the dossier.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All about the dossier. And that it -- again, this is a thread that runs through. The very highest leadership within the FBI and it's incredible that -- I mean, it really is Devin Nunes who's taking this on to uncover why a presidential campaign was being investigated.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. And he's getting trashed for it at every level. And yet he's the Chairman of the Intel Committee and has looked at the raw data and has come up with this, that there was no intelligence used. Quite extraordinary, we're going to talk about that this morning and what that means.</p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got House Majority Leader, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy in the studio this morning. White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah is here. FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano along with former U.S. Attorney and Avenue Strategies Partner, Budd Cummings.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a lot on the table this morning to talk about. And, of course, we are also looking at earnings. Investors are weighing for Google's parent company Alphabet to report earnings after the close tonight as the technology giant gears up to report the results and tell us what the last three months look like. Analysts expecting the company to post adjusted earnings of $9.28 a share on revenue of $3.29 billion. Alphabet is kicking off big techs earnings splits on Wall Street this week. We also have Amazon coming out on Thursday. Mike Murphy, your thoughts?</p><p>MURPHY: I think when you see a move in big tech like you saw Apple on Friday dropped seven points, I think in this market it's a buying opportunity. So, Google's going to -- Alphabet's going to come out with earnings and say, \"We're going to hear from Amazon\" all the big tech companies, they're all going to post great numbers.</p><p>How the stock reacts, I think the way to play it is if there's a pullback, it's a buying opportunity because we have underlying strength in the market, you have underlying strength in these companies. So any weakness, I'd be a buyer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Maybe but Dan Niles from Alpha One who's really very thoughtful on the tech sector, he was my guest on the Wall Street program this weekend and he said Apple's going to miss and Amazon -- and Google parent, Alphabet is going to miss.</p><p>Now, if you had that big sharp decline on Apple on Friday, does the market -- is the market telling you get ready for a miss and all are we going to see an even bigger decline if the company comes out and reports a miss?</p><p>MURPHY: You may. But remember, Apple under most recent pull off came all the way down to $151 and right after that, it rallied all the way back up to $170. So here, where it's trading in the mid $160s, it's setting up after Friday's move, it -- I think you're pricing a miss into the stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MURPHY: So if there's any more weakness, I'd be a buyer. But if Apple misses by a few millions, iPhone Xs in the market, I think that sets up as a buying opportunity because they have so many other levers that they can pull. I think that people are going to be buying iPhones in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter, so any weakness is a buying.</p><p>CARTER: Do you think --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You should drop the X. People don't like the X and they've got expectations that it's going to not meet demand numbers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's a flop. According to some, if you talk to -- I'm not doing channel checks but I go and -- yes, I've talked to a lot of people who work in the data -- the cellphone company in the stores, not for Apple but like -- I won't use the name of the company because I don't want to get the employees in trouble.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they would know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they tell me if I go in and say, \"Do you like the X?\" They're like, \"No, don't buy it. It really is awful.\" They were like, \"If you tried an Android phone\" so that would certainly benefit Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, again, people are unhappy with it. And --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I haven't had the easiest, same as mine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's a $1,000, that's a huge outlay.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, expensive.</p><p>MCDOWELL: At a time when Americans really are keeping the purse strings pretty tight in terms of their spending.</p><p>MURPHY: One thing on that, if you're going to buy an X, it's 24 months and they charge $50.00 a month automatically. So they're giving you an interest for a loan to finance the purchase of the phone. So I think people like that. And I think no matter what, people are going to buy the next Apple phone, so I think that's the --</p><p>CARTER: If it was selling off the shelf by itself though they wouldn't have to do that, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MURPHY: Well, I think you have to define off the shelf -- well no, I think that's part of their plan. So number one, off the shelves, they may miss numbers at top line expectations but they're still selling a ton of iPhone Xs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You know what Dan Niles said about this is that they -- he said him and his whole family needed new batteries. And so they went and changed the battery in the phone and it was $29.00 and they were fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he said, \"I don't need to buy a new phone,\" he said. And so I'm looking at my family as a proxy and saying, \"Well all we did was buy a $29.00 battery and we were good to go and we didn't need the next phone.\" So that's what he's worried about, the next phone and, of course, the issues around the X which are real.</p><p>CARTER: Yes. I also am curious with regulation if fears are going to play into stock prices after earnings this week because I know so many people are talking about, is tech going to be the next area that's going to be highly regulated like banks were before with all of the data concerns, with everything that's with Facebook.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That goes right to what Maria mentioned at the top of the show about the -- this Wall Street Journal story on the amount of information that Google collects on you, (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the article is called, \"Who has more of your data? Your personal data than Facebook? Try Google.\" The Journal reporting that Google's android devices allowed the harvesting of data from billions of active users without warning.</p><p>What about that? I mean, I'm talking eight years ago I did a documentary on Google and that was about the fact that they save all your searches for two years and then they anonymize the math to two years but why do they say for the two years anyway?</p><p>MURPHY: I guess to monetize them, they want to figure out how they can --</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>MURPHY: -- get advertising dollars in by using a data. But I think where we are today in 2018, if you're on the internet, if you're on your smart phone, if you're searching on a computer, if you're searching anywhere, there are ways for whether it's Google or Apple or Facebook, somebody can track what you're doing.</p><p>Now, if you don't like that, I guess there are certain ways to try to backdoor it or opt out of certain things. But, I think that's just a fact of life, people are going to know what was --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But what did Sheryl Sandberg say, Dagen? She said, \"Oh, we don't have a product to opt out at the high levels, that's a paid product.\" In other words, I have to pay them just to secure my data that is not shared.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's an idea that should -- that actually Walt Mossberg came up with. Like, he suggested that Facebook offer a paid service and -- so they wouldn't share of your data.</p><p>But this Wall Street Journal article goes into the fact that Google, if you're logged into Google, you can opt out of how they use your private information. But it goes well beyond that because Google Analytics is used on about 50 million sites and Google Analytics tracks you whether you're logged in or not, so that's number one. But Google uses among other things, you're browsing in search history apps, you've installed demographics like age and gender from its own analytics and other sources where -- and other sources like where we've shopped in the real world.</p><p>It's incredible Google's reach and I think that the point of this article in the Wall Street Journal is Mark Zuckerberg gets called in front of Congress, he -- and gets grilled about regulation, same thing's going to happen to Alphabet and Google and Google out to be a little bit more worried than even Facebook --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what does that mean?</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- about regulation, what are they going to do? Are -- is there going to be a broad way you can prevent Google from collecting your information whether you're -- even if you aren't logged into the Google service.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And with new rules, how much does that impact the earnings and does that change the (INAUDIBLE) on the stock?</p><p>MURPHY: Right. Well that's why these companies have been so profitable is that they can sell your data to advertisers and advertisers know exactly who you are --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we didn't realize how much they were selling.</p><p>MURPHY: I guess maybe people didn't know exactly how much they were selling but I think when you went on to the site, I think you knew. When you logged in to your computer and looked Mexican vacations, the next time you log in, there are six sites popping up that are focused on Mexican resorts or Mexican vacations. I mean, that's been going on for years from these companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: But I think that people knew that sort of thing but I don't think they understood how that translated to so many other -- other things. And that the data might used not for what they want it to be used for.</p><p>So if you Google Mexican vacations or getting Mexican vacations, that makes sense to people. But when they have -- you have a whole profile online that says this is who they think you are, your age and that the kinds of ads are going to serve up based on that, I think a lot Americans are confused by that and quite frankly are angry that that's happened because they don't feel it's been transparent to them at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And by the way, when you're in a certain place in the world and all of a sudden you get an ad for that local store that's on the block that you were in, that's a little spooky --</p><p>CARTER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- I'm sorry. I'm going to switch gears to the White House, President Trump welcoming French Leader Emmanuel Macron today to Washington for a three-day visit. The two are expected to talk about trade ahead of his trip. The French president issued a warning to the United States, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE: You cannot make war with your ally. It's too complicated. If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade war against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war (INAUDIBLE) come on, it's not -- it doesn't work. You need ally, we are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet he still agrees with many of President Trump's policies, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This goes back to something I've talked about repeatedly is that our allies in terms of trade and on the world stage, we're kind of blindsided by the steel and aluminum tariffs.</p><p>If you want -- if you really want to take on China, if China is your biggest problem globally in terms of unfair trade practices, then you lock arms with Europe, with Japan and you present a united front. When you kind of throw a steel and aluminum tariff in the face of your allies and say, \"Maybe we'll exempt you, maybe we won't.\" And there have been many exemptions it turned out.</p><p>But, again, it was handled so haphazardly and so ham-handedly right out of the gate with the holding up the -- you got the Commerce Secretary holding up cans of soup and lecturing the American people about your -- the cost of this can of soup isn't going on. It shows the fundamental misunderstanding of how people will react to inflation and, again, inflation by fiat out of the White House but also it was a slap on the face to our allies if they weren't consulted about it in the first place. They're trying to manage it now but, again, they're still -- he still got his hair up so to speak.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Messaging issues I guess.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, no official intelligence was used to start the Russia investigation, the so-called collusion. The jaw-dropping revelation from House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes after digging deeper into FBI and DOJ documents, the new questions in the case, that's right after this break.</p><p>And then Tencent, China's largest music streaming company could launch one of the biggest technology IPOs ever with a monster valuation. The staggering number right ahead, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well a massive manhunt is underway this morning for the man suspected of killing four people at a Waffle House outside of Nashville. Cheryl Caosne on headlines on that now, over to you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes Maria, good morning to you. Police say that 29-year-old Travis Reinking is armed and dangerous. National public schools are now in lockdown mode. We learned yesterday that he was arrested in July of 2017 for being in a restricted area near the White House.</p><p>More than a year before that, Reinking claimed singer Taylor Swift was stalking him. Customer James Shaw fearing for his life, took a dangerous chance to pounce on the shooter to wrestle at least the gun away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES SHAW, JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO: At the time that he was either reloading or the gun jammed, or whatever happened, is when I ran through the swivel door, I hit him with the swivel door. I managed to get him with one hand on the gun and then I grabbed it from him and I threw it over the countertop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well the four people who were killed have been identified. Authority say they are Taurean Sanderlin, Joe Perez, Akilah Dasilva, and DeEbony Groves. Sanderlin was an employee at that Waffle House.</p><p>Well, more cancellations today for Southwest Airlines, Southwest has cancelled at least 100 scheduled flights today and yesterday they cancelled about 40 to inspect the planes' engines. This comes after last week's accident in Pennsylvania that killed one woman on board. A fan blade broke off ripping a hole to the plane's wing and then it went into the window on Friday. Regulators have ordered emergency inspections on 700 of the same type of engine that was involved in that accident. Shares of Southwest Airlines were down about 17 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, it could be the summer of the hog for some college students. Harley- Davidson planning to pick eight lucky summer interns and teach them how to ride bikes. Then they're going to attend a motorcycle event across the country, document it all for social media. It's a 12-week paid internship open to juniors and seniors who are interested (INAUDIBLE) in social media, communications, public relations, or marketing. Taking a look at shares of Harley-Davidson down about 20 percent so far this year. I got a kick out of the story Maria because my neighbor who's 66 yesterday said to me, \"I want a new Harley\" and I thought, \"Exactly. And you're 66-years-old.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great. What a gig.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pretty cool. Get the interns to drive them, ride the bike.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A well -- this is a well-known problem that Harley-Davidson's been having. What Cheryl mentioned as -- that young people are not buying motorcycles and not riding motorcycles in this country.</p><p>MURPHY: They want to get the young people on the motorcycle so they can collect data. See if the big -- it's a theme that they want the data on --</p><p>CARTER: It's a big conspiracy.</p><p>MURPHY: That they need data.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh God.</p><p>CARTER: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We get an enormous shout out to James Shaw, wow, what a hero. Actually in the Waffle House, sees the gunman come in, just moved and acts. Jumps -- pushes the door into him, jumps on him, and removes the guy's gun. There he is, James Shaw just a patron at the Waffle House becomes the hero of the day.</p><p>When they found all those magazines and the other bullets in the shooter's jacket, you know that he was there for some serious killing and James Shaw stopped it.</p><p>MURPHY: It's great to see a young man being celebrated, to see the FBI around him, clapping for him. I mean, we - like you said a true hero and we should talk about it even more.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely. I think he's just terrific.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We should keep talking about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Every week, let's just talk about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) it out, you are such hero.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And to have that kind of courage, wrestle the gun out of his hands. All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, Hillary Clinton is now blaming charlatans and the media for her 2016 election loss. Now it's the media's fault. Her stunning new comments coming up.</p><p>And then we are watching global currency this morning as the 10-year Treasury hits a high of -- a four-year high right under three percent. How this may impact this week's European Central Bank meeting as well. Back in a moment right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Futures edging lower this morning, investors are waiting on more earnings. We are expecting a lower opening for the Dow down 28, NASDAQ and S&amp;P down just a fraction. We're also watching the bond market, the yields on the 10-year hitting 2.99 percent, that is the highest level since January 2014.</p><p>Joining us right now is Belpointe Chief Strategist, David Nelson. David, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What worries you more, the move towards three percent or the earnings story?</p><p>NELSON: The earning story only in the sense that the expectations were just so high coming into this. Just before this earning started, J.P. Morgan was one of the first to report.</p><p>I looked at an estimate chart and they had literally gone parabolic going into the earnings. So expectations are high and so far what I've seen, the earnings have been fine. The bigger problem in earning season this time around is technology. And I saw your interview with Dan Niles and hit on a couple of important points.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, let's do that right now. Let's see what Dan Niles said about technology. He had a real problem with Apple and Google parent Alphabet. Here's Dan Niles this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You also think Apple is going to have a miss when it reports.</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS: Yes, I do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Apple reports in May, watch for that. Dan thinks they're going to miss on the numbers. Google parent Alphabet, you also think may miss.</p><p>NILES: Yes. I think that one though I like quite a bit over the longer term. I think the problem with Google is the exact opposite as with Facebook. With Facebook, they guided expenses up 45 to 60 percent this year before this data breach stuff ever happened.</p><p>When you look at Google, they have expenses model for some reason Wall Street does, Google doesn't guide. The Wall Street has expenses modeled to the -- go up by the slowest pace in the last five years. And I think the expenses are actually going to be a bit higher. I think the revenues will be fine but I think you're going to have a problem on the margin front which is why I think the EPS is going to have an issue. But that's one of those stocks that after that I think is in really good shape going forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I guess the question becomes if Apple and Google's parent Alphabet missed, does that create a reason to sell and sort of lead this market down and earnings worried?</p><p>NELSON: It's difficult to have a bull market without tech in the lead. It's just an item in the script. This is a missed product cycle for Apple. I thought the iPhone X was a disappointment. I have an iPhone7, I so no need to switch.</p><p>The bigger issue for technology isn't even Apple, it's really Washington. Make no mistake, what you saw with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, that was the earth moving under our feet. Regulation is coming to technology and that means change business models.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is inviting it, and as that changed, business models take place and you give consumers the ability to opt out of some or all part of their data. Then that data is just simply worthless and that translates to other companies as well, Google and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's what we've been saying earlier Mike.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. So David, when -- so I agree, you don't want to fight Washington. When you're owning a company, you don't want them like Facebook fighting Washington. But this could lead -- I see this is a potential opportunity for the Facebooks and Alphabets and Apples of the World to start monetizing some of their data, to actually charge consumers for the data because it's not as if you're going to have a mass equities away from Google.</p><p>NELSON: They're going to charge consumers for their data, how about consumers charging Facebook to use the data, that's another model that could go out there.</p><p>MURPHY: How would -- I don't know how they would put that.</p><p>NELSON: I don't know, I --</p><p>MURPHY: You're not going to charge Facebook for something but Facebook could say, \"Hey, $0.99 per year, $0.99 per quarter, per month.\"</p><p>NELSON: You mean to not opt in and not have your data use.</p><p>MURPHY: Or to have a certain type of your data use, let's have a certain type. I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's so backwards to me that I'm going to pay them to protect my privacy.</p><p>NELSON: I'm not going to do that.</p><p>MURPHY: You're really paying them to use their service, right? They've been giving it to you for free for years. You've been on it, you've been using it all the time --</p><p>NELSON: I think it's just the opposite honestly. I feel that they're --</p><p>MURPHY: That you're going to charge Facebook.</p><p>NELSON: -- extracting a lot of data from me, they're making a lot of money off of it. And I think the only other way around for them is if I opt out of my data then you can charge me to be on that site and pay for a model. That's something that Sheryl Sanderberg has said that she doesn't want to do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One of the biggest issues is not necessarily Washington but investors stepping back and saying, \"Have Google and Facebook squeezed as much information out of us as they possibly can and that they've reached a ceiling in terms of their ad revenue\" or the revenue that they can -- how fast they can grow their revenue.</p><p>Google has access to two billion active android mobile devices and that's where a lot of the data extraction comes from and that's where a lot of the data that's later used improperly comes from, this is according to one of these -- a professor quoted in this Wall Street Journal article but I think in terms of some of these ad companies and even though Apple's had a bad product cycle with the iPhone X, Apple's in a better position privacy-wise which Tim Cook has been pretty big in Facebook or Google at this point in terms of protecting your --</p><p>NELSON: They're also becoming less iPhone depend at this point and they're monetizing a lot of their other services, so that's good news for them. It's a miss product cycle, that's cyclical, we'll get over that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So real quick, the estimates called for profit growth in the S&amp;P500 of 19 percent for the first quarter. Are you saying that's too high?</p><p>NELSON: I think they -- and we'll probably hit that, maybe even beat that but the market knows that stocks are discounting that, they knew that's coming in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So would you sell it to markets right now? You want to sell it?</p><p>NELSON: No, I'm fully invested and I'll pick and choose my points. If you're going to try to trade around every wiggle of this market, you're going to find yourself missing the big runs unless you've got some kind of tactical program to do that for you, avoid that at all cost.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One thing to just point quickly, you talk about the overall earnings growth for the S&amp;P500. If you look at the major tech companies of the ones reporting this week, Alphabet is expected to have faster growth in that 20 percent.</p><p>But Facebook, it's only expected to have earnings per share change of not even five percent. Microsoft, less than the overall market, Intel less than the overall market. Intel also single digit grower in terms of EPS.</p><p>NELSON: And that shows expenses going up at Facebook that's why markets are contracting.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Which is what Niles pointed out. David, great to see you.</p><p>NELSON: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, David Nelson joining us there. Coming up, shocking new revelations on how the FBI probes into the Trump campaign really began. White House's Chairman of -- the House Chairman of the Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes told me after digging deeper into the FBI and DOJ documents, he's next.</p><p>And then TV personality and surgeon, Dr. Oz helps students who were escaping a bus fire on a New Jersey highway, the dramatic video coming up, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, April 23rd, happy Monday, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets under pressure this morning, down, fractionally, as you can see, ahead of a big week for earnings.</p><p>The rising yield on the tenure treasury one issue weighing on markets again, hovering near three percent right now, up to 2.98 percent. Rising yield hitting the equity markets on Friday, the major indices all closing nearly one percent lower on the day. And now, all are negative for the year, 2018. Global markets also watching earnings this morning. It is a big week for earnings.</p><p>The European indices are down across the board. It is really a fractional move, one-third of the Dow, one-third on the S&amp;P 500, report earnings for the first quarter, this week. Check Asian markets, declines across the board. Here too, fractional moves, Hong Kong, the worst performer.</p><p>New questions this morning over the Russia investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, telling me on Sunday Morning Futures that no intelligence was used to actually start this probe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES: We've never understood because, you know, we have -- we have access to these finish intelligence products, and we've never seen one. We had never -- so, we thought, well, maybe there was one that went to a different channel that was kept really quiet, it was secret, it was kept from the congress and other folks. Well, in fact, after our investigators reviewed this, that is not what happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: There was no intelligence used, the latest revelations from this investigation and why it actually started. A remarkable life remembered, thousands gathered in Houston, this weekend, to celebrate the life of the First Lady Barbara Bush and her grave site opens to the public, this morning. Among the mourners, four presidents and first ladies, this photo from the funeral, going viral, take a look.</p><p>Plus, there's this, Dr. Oz, coming to the rescue, he pulled over to help passengers on a bus that caught fire, the dramatic video, coming up, and striking a chord with investors, Chinese streaming giant, Tencent, reportedly planning to go public, details on the giant valuation there as well.</p><p>And then there's this, Rihanna, getting another brand under her umbrella, the popstar, unveiling her own line of lingerie, a first look at the latest addition to her business empire. But first, Devin Nunes, drawing a line in the sand, this weekend, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman shared his newest findings on highly contested collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. He said this on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES: I wanted to know what intelligence did you have that actually led to this investigation. So what we've found, now, after the investigators have reviewed it, is that in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: In fact, there was no intelligence. I actually have to have him repeat that in my interview. Joining me right now to talk more about it is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford. Christopher, it's good to see this morning.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you find that as extraordinary as I do? They didn't have any intelligence to launch an investigation into Donald Trump and whether or not there was collusion between Trump and the Russians. So, where did they come up with it? There was no intelligence that led them to believe this.</p><p>BEDFORD: I remember there was a full stop in the green room, before your Sunday show when he said that, everyone looked up, holy smokes, this is a big revelation. Now, what it looks like from what I've been doing the research afterwards, is this may be talking about what has been called the second dossier because compiled by this guy, Cody Shearer, a long-time Clinton confidant, someone who is so sketchy that in 1999 Slate Article, if he didn't exist, the right-wing conspiracy would have to invent this guy. He pulled together a lot of information.</p><p>He also appears to, potentially, according to week list (INAUDIBLE) reporting, be a source for the first dossier. This becomes, kind of, the self-licking ice cream -- ice cream cone thing that we've seen before, where one guy writes a dossier to collaborate another dossier. It turns out to be the source for the first dossier, the author of the second dossier. And then our intelligence services were using media reports on the first dossier to collaborate the first dossier.</p><p>When it turns out that the media sources for those -- for those stories, was the guy who wrote it himself. It's just (INAUDIBLE) thing. And as the congressman pointed out, this did not come through the proper channels. Even though some reports came to department of state, through the Australian government, it didn't go through the proper intelligence channels, which would be necessary to start intelligence investigation, and that is extremely concerning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really is because now we know that the only evidence or backing for a FISA warrant to wire-tap, people from the Trump campaign, was all that dossier which was unverified. This is not the way America operates. This is really an incredible statement that they had no intelligence on it. And you wonder if, in fact, now that we know that, is the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's work, I mean, what is this investigation about? Is it just to have an insurance policy so that you try hard to delegitimize President Trump?</p><p>BEDFORD: It's hard to keep track on what Mueller's investigation is about because it seem, right now, to be so far away from where it started Russian collaboration. Now, Mueller's investigation is seeking the New York -- New York Justice Attorney -- excuse me, New York Attorney, on confidants to the President, violating attorney-client privilege.</p><p>Things seem to have gone up the rails but there is no telling right now, there's nothing that I've seen that's going to stop the Mueller investigation. And we are coming up on a big fight in the U.S. senate between Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Mitch McConnell, because Grassley wants to pass a bill that protects Mueller from even being fired without congressional review.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD: I don't think there's anything that's going to stop this investigation, but we're going to look back in the history books when we finally get our eyes on these primary documents and we're probably going to ask what the heck was going on?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. You know, I want to get to Hillary Clinton in a minute, but I just want to say this, Devin Nunes, yesterday, said that number one, they're investigating the opening of the investigation. Now, they know there was no intelligence used, and number two, they're investigating how they conducted this investigation, the willingness to use dirt that was funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee to get a warrant to listen to calls, and then there is a third thing that he is working on and he's investigating the State Department.</p><p>He says that's going to come out soon and we're also going to get more information from this fourth-coming I.G. report which is going to focus on Jim Comey and the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. So, I just wonder what it is at the State Department that the Intel committee is working on. I think they're looking at all the people who are funnelling information to the State Department, like as you say, the individual you just mentioned, as well as Sidney Blumenthal?</p><p>BEDFORD: You're right. And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hillary Clinton, you know, prot\u201ag\u201aes and colleagues, friends.</p><p>BEDFORD: She has a lot of friends, a lot of prot\u201ag\u201aes and a lot of people who were part of what they call the spy network, which is basically headed by Sidney Blumenthal, who had an email address that was made to look like it was a White House e-mail address, even though Barack Obama's president, he pushed him away from being a conspiracy theorist, even though John Podesta has said he was lost in his own web of conspiracies.</p><p>He was constantly feeding data back in the Department of State. And, you know, most administration s try to make it as easy as possible for the next administration to come in because it's very important. The President of the United States is the most powerful man in the world when he deals with our foreign policy. By all accounts, the Department of State set tripwires, practically, booby trap the White House for the incoming administration and that is another (INAUDIBLE) really a dark stain on the outgoing presidency of the last administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll wait for more information on this investigation into the State Department. This is big. Meanwhile, Hillary is out, taking aim at the press now for coverage of her run in office for 2016. She's spoken in an engagement in New York, yesterday. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The mainstream political coverage was influenced by the right-wing media ecosystem. Relentlessly, negative news has had a levelling effect that opens the doors to charlatans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know what to say, Christopher, your thoughts.</p><p>BEDFORD: Not only that, but then she said she thinks that the press has gotten more fair since the 2016 election and it has been a course correct where it's become more objective.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: That's obviously false, and American people can see that from their lack of trust. We have the lead reporter on the Hillary Clinton campaign from the New York Times, admitting that she cried at her desk after Hillary Clinton lost. We had people saying it was a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was in, potentially, bad health.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: Just days before she collapsed after 45 minutes in mild weather. She was treated very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why it's such a joke that the Democrats are going to be suing the Trump campaign. They've levelled this lawsuit, when we know that the FBI, the Department of Justice. We're all very firmly behind Hillary Clinton. We know that, obviously, from all of these texts. So it's just laughable, this lawsuit, when it's absolutely the opposite that, in fact, it was the FBI and the DOJ, trying hard to push Trump down and make sure he did it when and support Hillary.</p><p>And then we have got these reports about those I.T. guys. Imran Awan's father transferred data to a Pakistani senator and former Head of the Pakistani Intelligence Agency, via a usb drive, Christopher, his son, Imran, the former ITA to Congressman and Former DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who made unauthorized access to in-house servers while working on the Hill.</p><p>Present Trump tweeted about the matter over the weekend. He wrote this, just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news and that we will now counter for the DNC server that they refused to give the FBI. The Debbie Wasserman Schultz servers and documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton e-mails. Christopher, there you go, I mean, we know what happened when the DNC was hacked.</p><p>You would think that if you get hacked, you want the might and the power and the strength of the FBI behind you, to figure out who hacked you, but that's not what they did. They would not give their server to the FBI. They hired a private company to look at the server because they don't want people to know what was on the server.</p><p>BEDFORD: Exactly. And by every bit of our reporting, has pointed to one thing and that said, Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was then head of the DNC, has something that she's very concerned about getting out. When her laptop was first -- what appears to be her laptop, it's got the username, RepDWS, was taken by Imran Awan and then left in the congressional building after he had been barred from the networks and fired by every other congressman, except for Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p><p>He was left there with a copy of his I.D., with a copy of his -- with a copy of congressional badge and with a note that said, attorney-client privilege, which is ridiculous, by the way. Andrew McCarthy has pointed out that you can't just put a note on evidence that says attorney-client privilege and had to be taken out. It was left in a phone booth, discovered by police at night. And since then, Debbie Wasserman Schultz had worked really hard, including threatening the Chief of the Capitol Police to make sure this laptop is returned. Now, she's saying she doesn't care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't understand. He left the laptop in a phone booth with a note? What is he trying to be, a sarcastic?</p><p>BEDFORD: Well, what it appears -- what it could potentially be and some people had guessed, is that he's threatening Debbie Wasserman Schultz with the information that's on that laptop, because first, she was fighting to keep it away from -- away from the Capitol Police and out of the jurisdiction. And now, he is in court, holding that up for the last few months.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. Christopher, we'll keep following. You've done great reporting on this. Thanks so much.</p><p>BEDFORD: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Christopher Bedford, the Daily Caller. Coming up, Chinese streaming giant's Tencent, reportedly planning an IPO. It's going to be one for the record bucks. We've got the details, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The grave site for Barbara Bush will be opening to the public this morning. Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Maria, the late first lady was buried over the weekend in a gated plot at the George H.W. Bush presidential library. She is now near the grave of her daughter, Robin, who died from leukemia when she was just three years old. The Bush family, sharing photos from the private ceremony, hundreds of family and friends giving a final farewell. This day brought together for former presidents-- the two President Bushes, as well as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the first lady is also there, including Melania Trump. This photo has gone viral, we should say. And in a tribute to his wife's commitment to literacy, former President Bush wore a pair of socks decorated with stacks of colorful books.</p><p>Well, celebrity health expert Dr. Oz has captured this video of a burning bus on the New Jersey turnpike with high school students running away. Dr. Oz pulled over to film the chaotic scene and made sure the students got to safety. A staff can be seen carrying luggage, instruments away from that bus. That group was coming back from a musical in New York. Dr. Oz shared the video on his Facebook page, saying he was thankful that everybody got out safely. This is not Dr. Oz's first roadside rescue. He was in an honorary firefighter after helping victims of a crash on the same highway back in 2015.</p><p>Well, the China's largest music streaming 10 Cent Music is preparing to go public. They're expected to be one of the biggest technology IPOs ever. This valuation could exceed $25 billion. 10 Cent Music says it has got about 700 million monthly active users. This coming, of course, after Spotify successfully went public on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month.</p><p>And let's stay with music because Rihanna is planning to reduce -- release a line of lingerie. The singer modeling the collection herself. She posts in her underwear on Instagram. Not clear when exactly her new products are actually going to be released. But last year, he successfully launched her own make up line during New York Fashion Week. Another celebrity, Maria, getting on the I'm-going-to-make-and-sell-it-too bandwagon, and she's probably doing pretty well. Her makeup is done very well, we should say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes, that's been a real success. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Expanding her empire.</p><p>MURPHY: More power to her. I love it. She's got the music, she's got the make-up, she's got lingerie. Awesome! I love to see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You want to say something?</p><p>CARTER: I just want to say how much I love the picture of the Bush family with all of the presidents at the funeral. I love H.W.'s socks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, they're great. Coming up, as companies transform the way we work, live, and play, the way the start-ups look for office face to stuck in that time work. That's where Squarefoot comes in. The details on the real estate disruptor right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Ahead winds for growing business is finding office space. The one company, Squarefoot, is trying to make the process a lot easier and more transparent now. The company recently announced it has raised $7 million in a series eight round financing that led by Mike Murphy and his firm Rosecliffe with us this morning. Mike is now joining Squarefoot's board of directors and joining us right now to talk more about it is the CEO and co-Founder of Squarefoot, Jonathan Wasserstrum. Good to see you, Jonathan. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>JONATHAN WASSERSTRUM, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, SQUAREFOOT: Thanks for having me guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, we know about the retail market and things like truly in the market. Tell us how your firm differs from the competition and how you try to provide transparency in real estate.</p><p>WASSERSTRUM: Yes, groups like (INAUDIBLE) have done a great job on their essential side pushing forward that transparency. When we start the business several years ago, we thought it was stupid that you couldn't go online and do the same thing for office space -- that's what we set out to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you do it?</p><p>WASSERSTRUM: Well, we do a couple of things: we bring transparency to that market that traditionally had none by allowing prospective tenants to go online and look at space. And we also have technology that we have built for in-house transactions team and for the clients who we work with to guide them to that process to make it a whole bunch more easy.</p><p>MURPHY: So, we were first introduced to Jonathan when we are moving our offices from midtown down to the flat iron district. And just going online and searching for space, we saw the Squarefoot -- that's how we originally met them. And we see an opportunity for them to bring to the commercial market what companies like Compass and Red Thin have done for their residential market. So, now, if you want to find an office, office space, you go right on their site, to Squarefoot.com, you look at what you want: how many feet, how many employees, what you want to spend, and they'll pull it up for you right on your smartphones. So, we think this is how people will get office space in the future.</p><p>CARTER: it's pretty extraordinary. We're talking about one of the things. I was wondering what happens to commercial real estate with trends both in and how people were working, and also, we're talking a little bit about what that means of retail space right now in so many empty store fronts. Can you tell me a little bit about that?</p><p>WASSERSTRUM: Yes. It's a way that people are working. There's been a proliferation with groups like we work and all the flexible space writers. We think it's great for the industry. It brings a whole much more flexibility to the market. It means transactions can happen a lot quicker. The traditional leases of three to five years or maybe a thin of the past? I don't think I'd go that far. I think it depends on the right solution for the right company at the right time. Retail has been a really interesting thing, and everybody has been reading and talking about the death of retail for a while. It's probably a little bit overblown in my opinion. I think that it just takes a little bit to reset pricing expectations now from historically where companies can make a whole bunch of money with retail outlets, but a lot of that is moving online. So, we're just going to have to start adjusting sale price and expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What about the pushback from traditional commercial real estate brokers and how they might be retaliating against you? Because they're not going to standby and just take it.</p><p>WASSERSTRUM: Hopefully, they won't be marching the streets too soon. So, we are brokers ourselves, so we work within the confines of the traditional industry. There's really two groups from the brokers' perspective: there's the groups that represent landlords, and there's the groups that represent tenants. To those who represent the landlords, we're their bestfriend, where a whole new conduit that they've never had for them to access people actually looking for the space in the market. And for the groups that represent the tenants -- you know, the groups like I used to work at a guy who runs real estate for us now. I used to work at (INAUDIBLE) -- they focus more on the big guys, right? So, Fox needs office space, or the average 500,000 Squarefoot user needs office space, you should work with JLL. Great! I'm (INAUDIBLE). I work with them. But for the average five, 10, 50, even 200 person company, you should be online looking with us, and helping us, and allowing us to help you with your transactions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick, how is the market right? A lot movement or no?</p><p>WASSERSTRUM: A lot of movement, yes. Softening a little bit at the top, but there's always going to be people who needs space.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jonathan, great to see you.</p><p>WASSERSTRUM: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching. Good luck. Jonathan Wasserstrum there. Still ahead, Iran, Syria trade, all pressing issues on the agenda as President Trump welcomes the French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House for a three-day visit in Washington. We are taking your live to the White House with a preview, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Monday to you! It is Monday, April 23rd.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018042301cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5J-VB01-DXH2-645T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8425\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 23, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Meetings</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Market</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Barbara Bush</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tencent</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rihanna</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cody Shearer</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Slate Article</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hillary Clinton</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robert Mueller</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FBI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DOJ</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Imran Awan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Debbie Wasserman Schultz</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George H.W.

Happy  Monday to you and good morning everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for  joining us.  It is Monday, April 23rd.  Your top stories right now 6:00a.m.  on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings on the driver seat on Wall Street this morning, Futures showing a  decline at the start of trading today, down about 40 points on the Dow,  down a fraction on the S&amp;P, and down eight points on the NASDAQ.  More than  a third of the Dow and the S&amp;P500 set to report their first quarter  earnings this week.  It is going to be a monster week for earnings.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alphabet, the name to watch after the close tonight, it comes amid new  concerns surrounding Google's data collection.  Dan Niles Money Manager on  Wall Street this weekend says he thinks Google will miss earnings  estimates.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets tumbling on Friday, Apple dragged the Dow lower after analysts'  reports suggested that smartphone sales could slow in the coming months.   Also, Niles said Apple will miss.  We are watching the fine market this  morning, the 10-year yield creeping closer to three percent, take a look,  up two basis points right now at 2.99 percent on the 10-year.</p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks looking like this, now we do have a lower  opening there as well and lower trading this morning.  CAC Quarante is down  a fraction, CAC Quarante in Paris down a fraction as is the DAX Index in  Germany, down a quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight right across the board, the Hang Seng the biggest loser,  down better than one-half of one percent in Hong Kong.  </p><p>And a pair of former political outsiders inside the Oval Office, President  Trump welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House today  from trade to national security.  We're taking a look at what's on the  agenda for the two world leaders ahead of the state dinner tomorrow night.</p><p>Investigating the investigation, shocking new revelations on the start of  the FBI probe into the Trump campaign.  House Intelligence Chairman Devin  Nunes telling me yesterday about his findings, he explained on Sunday  Morning Futures.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN:  We've long wanted to  know what intelligence did you have that actually led to this  investigation.  So what we found now after the investigators have reviewed  it is that in fact there was no intelligence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No intelligence to launch that investigation.  The very latest  on the investigation coming up.  Plus, another high note for the music  industry, Chinese streaming giant Tencent reportedly planning to go public  where the company is expected to list and that mammoth evaluation.</p><p>Plus, revving up their resume, Harley-Davidson offering an internship of a  lifetime, how college students can get paid to ride coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to talk  about it, FOX BUsines Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO, Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy along with Pollster and the President of Maslansky and  Partners, Lee Carter.  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Good morning.  Great to be  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Happy Monday everybody.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning Maria.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Incredible interview with Devin Nunes, the  Congressman, Head of the House Intelligence Committee.  So I can't wait to  hear that again this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's just a -- it's extraordinary.  We've talked about  how the same FBI agents were overseeing an investigation into Trump and an  investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail usage.  </p><p>And now we find out that with all of the evidence on the Hillary Clinton  side, they didn't have any official intelligence to launch this  investigation.  It sounds like Dagen it was all about the dossier.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All about the dossier.  And that it -- again, this is a thread  that runs through.  The very highest leadership within the FBI and it's  incredible that -- I mean, it really is Devin Nunes who's taking this on to  uncover why a presidential campaign was being investigated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  And he's getting trashed for it at every level.   And yet he's the Chairman of the Intel Committee and has looked at the raw  data and has come up with this, that there was no intelligence used.  Quite  extraordinary, we're going to talk about that this morning and what that  means.</p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got House Majority Leader, California  Congressman Kevin McCarthy in the studio this morning.  White House  Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah is here.  FOX News Senior  Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano along with former U.S. Attorney  and Avenue Strategies Partner, Budd Cummings. </p><p>Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a lot on the table this morning to  talk about.  And, of course, we are also looking at earnings.  Investors  are weighing for Google's parent company Alphabet to report earnings after  the close tonight as the technology giant gears up to report the results  and tell us what the last three months look like.  Analysts expecting the  company to post adjusted earnings of $9.28 a share on revenue of $3.29  billion.  Alphabet is kicking off big techs earnings splits on Wall Street  this week.  We also have Amazon coming out on Thursday.  Mike Murphy, your  thoughts?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think when you see a move in big tech like you saw Apple on  Friday dropped seven points, I think in this market it's a buying  opportunity.  So, Google's going to -- Alphabet's going to come out with  earnings and say, \"We're going to hear from Amazon\" all the big tech  companies, they're all going to post great numbers.</p><p>How the stock reacts, I think the way to play it is if there's a pullback,  it's a buying opportunity because we have underlying strength in the  market, you have underlying strength in these companies.  So any weakness,  I'd be a buyer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe but Dan Niles from Alpha One who's really very thoughtful  on the tech sector, he was my guest on the Wall Street program this weekend  and he said Apple's going to miss and Amazon -- and Google parent, Alphabet  is going to miss.  </p><p>Now, if you had that big sharp decline on Apple on Friday, does the market  -- is the market telling you get ready for a miss and all are we going to  see an even bigger decline if the company comes out and reports a miss?</p><p>MURPHY:  You may.  But remember, Apple under most recent pull off came all  the way down to $151 and right after that, it rallied all the way back up  to $170.  So here, where it's trading in the mid $160s, it's setting up  after Friday's move, it -- I think you're pricing a miss into the stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>MURPHY:  So if there's any more weakness, I'd be a buyer.  But if Apple  misses by a few millions, iPhone Xs in the market, I think that sets up as  a buying opportunity because they have so many other levers that they can  pull.  I think that people are going to be buying iPhones in the third  quarter, in the fourth quarter, so any weakness is a buying.</p><p>CARTER:  Do you think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You should drop the X.  People don't like the X and they've got  expectations that it's going to not meet demand numbers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a flop.  According to some, if you talk to -- I'm not doing  channel checks but I go and -- yes, I've talked to a lot of people who work  in the data -- the cellphone company in the stores, not for Apple but like  -- I won't use the name of the company because I don't want to get the  employees in trouble.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they would know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they tell me if I go in and say, \"Do you like the X?\"   They're like, \"No, don't buy it.  It really is awful.\"  They were like, \"If  you tried an Android phone\" so that would certainly benefit Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, people are unhappy with it.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I haven't had the easiest, same as mine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a $1,000, that's a huge outlay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, expensive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  At a time when Americans really are keeping the purse strings  pretty tight in terms of their spending.</p><p>MURPHY:  One thing on that, if you're going to buy an X, it's 24 months and  they charge $50.00 a month automatically.  So they're giving you an  interest for a loan to finance the purchase of the phone.  So I think  people like that.  And I think no matter what, people are going to buy the  next Apple phone, so I think that's the -- </p><p>CARTER:  If it was selling off the shelf by itself though they wouldn't  have to do that, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MURPHY:  Well, I think you have to define off the shelf -- well no, I think  that's part of their plan.  So number one, off the shelves, they may miss  numbers at top line expectations but they're still selling a ton of iPhone  Xs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what Dan Niles said about this is that they --  he said him and his whole family needed new batteries.  And so they went  and changed the battery in the phone and it was $29.00 and they were fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said, \"I don't need to buy a new phone,\" he said.  And  so I'm looking at my family as a proxy and saying, \"Well all we did was buy  a $29.00 battery and we were good to go and we didn't need the next phone.\"   So that's what he's worried about, the next phone and, of course, the  issues around the X which are real.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I also am curious with regulation if fears are going to play  into stock prices after earnings this week because I know so many people  are talking about, is tech going to be the next area that's going to be  highly regulated like banks were before with all of the data concerns, with  everything that's with Facebook.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That goes right to what Maria mentioned at the top of the show  about the -- this Wall Street Journal story on the amount of information  that Google collects on you, (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the article is called, \"Who has more of your data?  Your  personal data than Facebook?  Try Google.\"  The Journal reporting that  Google's android devices allowed the harvesting of data from billions of  active users without warning.</p><p>What about that?  I mean, I'm talking eight years ago I did a documentary  on Google and that was about the fact that they save all your searches for  two years and then they anonymize the math to two years but why do they say  for the two years anyway?</p><p>MURPHY:  I guess to monetize them, they want to figure out how they can --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- get advertising dollars in by using a data.  But I think where  we are today in 2018, if you're on the internet, if you're on your smart  phone, if you're searching on a computer, if you're searching anywhere,  there are ways for whether it's Google or Apple or Facebook, somebody can  track what you're doing.</p><p>Now, if you don't like that, I guess there are certain ways to try to  backdoor it or opt out of certain things.  But, I think that's just a fact  of life, people are going to know what was --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But what did Sheryl Sandberg say, Dagen?  She said, \"Oh,  we don't have a product to opt out at the high levels, that's a paid  product.\"  In other words, I have to pay them just to secure my data that  is not shared.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's an idea that should -- that actually Walt Mossberg came  up with.  Like, he suggested that Facebook offer a paid service and -- so  they wouldn't share of your data.  </p><p>But this Wall Street Journal article goes into the fact that Google, if  you're logged into Google, you can opt out of how they use your private  information.  But it goes well beyond that because Google Analytics is used  on about 50 million sites and Google Analytics tracks you whether you're  logged in or not, so that's number one.  But Google uses among other  things, you're browsing in search history apps, you've installed  demographics like age and gender from its own analytics and other sources  where -- and other sources like where we've shopped in the real world.</p><p>It's incredible Google's reach and I think that the point of this article  in the Wall Street Journal is Mark Zuckerberg gets called in front of  Congress, he -- and gets grilled about regulation, same thing's going to  happen to Alphabet and Google and Google out to be a little bit more  worried than even Facebook --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what does that mean?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- about regulation, what are they going to do?  Are -- is there  going to be a broad way you can prevent Google from collecting your  information whether you're -- even if you aren't logged into the Google  service.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with new rules, how much does that impact the earnings and  does that change the (INAUDIBLE) on the stock?</p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  Well that's why these companies have been so profitable is  that they can sell your data to advertisers and advertisers know exactly  who you are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we didn't realize how much they were selling.</p><p>MURPHY:  I guess maybe people didn't know exactly how much they were  selling but I think when you went on to the site, I think you knew.  When  you logged in to your computer and looked Mexican vacations, the next time  you log in, there are six sites popping up that are focused on Mexican  resorts or Mexican vacations.  I mean, that's been going on for years from  these companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  But I think that people knew that sort of thing but I don't think  they understood how that translated to so many other -- other things.  And  that the data might used not for what they want it to be used for.</p><p>So if you Google Mexican vacations or getting Mexican vacations, that makes  sense to people.  But when they have -- you have a whole profile online  that says this is who they think you are, your age and that the kinds of  ads are going to serve up based on that, I think a lot Americans are  confused by that and quite frankly are angry that that's happened because  they don't feel it's been transparent to them at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, when you're in a certain place in the world and  all of a sudden you get an ad for that local store that's on the block that  you were in, that's a little spooky -- </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- I'm sorry.  I'm going to switch gears to the White House,  President Trump welcoming French Leader Emmanuel Macron today to Washington  for a three-day visit.  The two are expected to talk about trade ahead of  his trip.  The French president issued a warning to the United States,  listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE:  You cannot make war with your ally.   It's too complicated.  If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade  war against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war (INAUDIBLE)  come on, it's not -- it doesn't work.  You need ally, we are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yet he still agrees with many of President Trump's  policies, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This goes back to something I've talked about repeatedly is that  our allies in terms of trade and on the world stage, we're kind of  blindsided by the steel and aluminum tariffs.  </p><p>If you want -- if you really want to take on China, if China is your  biggest problem globally in terms of unfair trade practices, then you lock  arms with Europe, with Japan and you present a united front.  When you kind  of throw a steel and aluminum tariff in the face of your allies and say,  \"Maybe we'll exempt you, maybe we won't.\"  And there have been many  exemptions it turned out.</p><p>But, again, it was handled so haphazardly and so ham-handedly right out of  the gate with the holding up the -- you got the Commerce Secretary holding  up cans of soup and lecturing the American people about your -- the cost of  this can of soup isn't going on.  It shows the fundamental misunderstanding  of how people will react to inflation and, again, inflation by fiat out of  the White House but also it was a slap on the face to our allies if they  weren't consulted about it in the first place.  They're trying to manage it  now but, again, they're still -- he still got his hair up so to speak.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Messaging issues I guess.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come back, no official  intelligence was used to start the Russia investigation, the so-called  collusion.  The jaw-dropping revelation from House Intel Committee Chairman  Devin Nunes after digging deeper into FBI and DOJ documents, the new  questions in the case, that's right after this break.</p><p>And then Tencent, China's largest music streaming company could launch one  of the biggest technology IPOs ever with a monster valuation.  The  staggering number right ahead, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well a massive manhunt is underway this morning  for the man suspected of killing four people at a Waffle House outside of  Nashville.  Cheryl Caosne on headlines on that now, over to you Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes Maria, good morning to you.  Police say that 29-year-old  Travis Reinking is armed and dangerous.  National public schools are now in  lockdown mode.  We learned yesterday that he was arrested in July of 2017  for being in a restricted area near the White House.</p><p>More than a year before that, Reinking claimed singer Taylor Swift was  stalking him.  Customer James Shaw fearing for his life, took a dangerous  chance to pounce on the shooter to wrestle at least the gun away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES SHAW, JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO:  At the time that he was either  reloading or the gun jammed, or whatever happened, is when I ran through  the swivel door, I hit him with the swivel door.  I managed to get him with  one hand on the gun and then I grabbed it from him and I threw it over the  countertop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the four people who were killed have been identified.   Authority say they are Taurean Sanderlin, Joe Perez, Akilah Dasilva, and  DeEbony Groves.  Sanderlin was an employee at that Waffle House.</p><p>Well, more cancellations today for Southwest Airlines, Southwest has  cancelled at least 100 scheduled flights today and yesterday they cancelled  about 40 to inspect the planes' engines.  This comes after last week's  accident in Pennsylvania that killed one woman on board.  A fan blade broke  off ripping a hole to the plane's wing and then it went into the window on  Friday.  Regulators have ordered emergency inspections on 700 of the same  type of engine that was involved in that accident.  Shares of Southwest  Airlines were down about 17 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, it could be the summer of the hog for some college students.  Harley- Davidson planning to pick eight lucky summer interns and teach them how to  ride bikes.  Then they're going to attend a motorcycle event across the  country, document it all for social media.  It's a 12-week paid internship  open to juniors and seniors who are interested (INAUDIBLE) in social media,  communications, public relations, or marketing.  Taking a look at shares of  Harley-Davidson down about 20 percent so far this year.  I got a kick out  of the story Maria because my neighbor who's 66 yesterday said to me, \"I  want a new Harley\" and I thought, \"Exactly.  And you're 66-years-old.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  What a gig.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty cool.  Get the interns to drive them, ride the bike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A well -- this is a well-known problem that Harley-Davidson's  been having.  What Cheryl mentioned as -- that young people are not buying  motorcycles and not riding motorcycles in this country.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They want to get the young people on the motorcycle so they can  collect data.  See if the big -- it's a theme that they want the data on --</p><p>CARTER:  It's a big conspiracy.</p><p>MURPHY:  That they need data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh God.  </p><p>CARTER: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We get an enormous shout out to James Shaw, wow, what a hero.   Actually in the Waffle House, sees the gunman come in, just moved and acts.   Jumps -- pushes the door into him, jumps on him, and removes the guy's gun.   There he is, James Shaw just a patron at the Waffle House becomes the hero  of the day.</p><p>When they found all those magazines and the other bullets in the shooter's  jacket, you know that he was there for some serious killing and James Shaw  stopped it.  </p><p>MURPHY:  It's great to see a young man being celebrated, to see the FBI  around him, clapping for him.  I mean, we - like you said a true hero and  we should talk about it even more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  I think he's just terrific.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We should keep talking about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every week, let's just talk about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) it out, you are such hero.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And to have that kind of courage, wrestle the gun out of  his hands.  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come back, Hillary  Clinton is now blaming charlatans and the media for her 2016 election loss.   Now it's the media's fault.  Her stunning new comments coming up.</p><p>And then we are watching global currency this morning as the 10-year  Treasury hits a high of -- a four-year high right under three percent.  How  this may impact this week's European Central Bank meeting as well.  Back in  a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures edging lower this morning, investors are waiting on  more earnings.  We are expecting a lower opening for the Dow down 28,  NASDAQ and S&amp;P down just a fraction.  We're also watching the bond market,  the yields on the 10-year hitting 2.99 percent, that is the highest level  since January 2014.</p><p>Joining us right now is Belpointe Chief Strategist, David Nelson.  David,  good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What worries you more, the move towards three percent or the  earnings story?</p><p>NELSON:  The earning story only in the sense that the expectations were  just so high coming into this.  Just before this earning started, J.P.  Morgan was one of the first to report.  </p><p>I looked at an estimate chart and they had literally gone parabolic going  into the earnings.  So expectations are high and so far what I've seen, the  earnings have been fine.  The bigger problem in earning season this time  around is technology.  And I saw your interview with Dan Niles and hit on a  couple of important points.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's do that right now.  Let's see what Dan Niles said  about technology.  He had a real problem with Apple and Google parent  Alphabet.  Here's Dan Niles this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You also think Apple is going to have a miss when it reports.</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  Yes, I do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Apple reports in May, watch for that.  Dan thinks they're  going to miss on the numbers.  Google parent Alphabet, you also think may  miss.  </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I think that one though I like quite a bit over the longer  term.  I think the problem with Google is the exact opposite as with  Facebook.  With Facebook, they guided expenses up 45 to 60 percent this  year before this data breach stuff ever happened.</p><p>When you look at Google, they have expenses model for some reason Wall  Street does, Google doesn't guide.  The Wall Street has expenses modeled to  the -- go up by the slowest pace in the last five years.  And I think the  expenses are actually going to be a bit higher.  I think the revenues will  be fine but I think you're going to have a problem on the margin front  which is why I think the EPS is going to have an issue.  But that's one of  those stocks that after that I think is in really good shape going forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess the question becomes if Apple and Google's parent  Alphabet missed, does that create a reason to sell and sort of lead this  market down and earnings worried?</p><p>NELSON:  It's difficult to have a bull market without tech in the lead.   It's just an item in the script.  This is a missed product cycle for Apple.   I thought the iPhone X was a disappointment.  I have an iPhone7, I so no  need to switch.</p><p>The bigger issue for technology isn't even Apple, it's really Washington.   Make no mistake, what you saw with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, that  was the earth moving under our feet.  Regulation is coming to technology  and that means change business models. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is inviting it, and as that changed, business models take  place and you give consumers the ability to opt out of some or all part of  their data.  Then that data is just simply worthless and that translates to  other companies as well, Google and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's what we've been saying earlier Mike.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  So David, when -- so I agree, you don't want to fight  Washington.  When you're owning a company, you don't want them like  Facebook fighting Washington.  But this could lead -- I see this is a  potential opportunity for the Facebooks and Alphabets and Apples of the  World to start monetizing some of their data, to actually charge consumers  for the data because it's not as if you're going to have a mass equities  away from Google.</p><p>NELSON:  They're going to charge consumers for their data, how about  consumers charging Facebook to use the data, that's another model that  could go out there.  </p><p>MURPHY:  How would -- I don't know how they would put that.</p><p>NELSON:  I don't know, I --</p><p>MURPHY:  You're not going to charge Facebook for something but Facebook  could say, \"Hey, $0.99 per year, $0.99 per quarter, per month.\"</p><p>NELSON:  You mean to not opt in and not have your data use.</p><p>MURPHY:  Or to have a certain type of your data use, let's have a certain  type.  I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's so backwards to me that I'm going to pay them to protect  my privacy.</p><p>NELSON:  I'm not going to do that.</p><p>MURPHY:  You're really paying them to use their service, right?  They've  been giving it to you for free for years.  You've been on it, you've been  using it all the time --</p><p>NELSON:  I think it's just the opposite honestly.  I feel that they're --</p><p>MURPHY:  That you're going to charge Facebook.</p><p>NELSON:  -- extracting a lot of data from me, they're making a lot of money  off of it.  And I think the only other way around for them is if I opt out  of my data then you can charge me to be on that site and pay for a model.   That's something that Sheryl Sanderberg has said that she doesn't want to  do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of the biggest issues is not necessarily Washington but  investors stepping back and saying, \"Have Google and Facebook squeezed as  much information out of us as they possibly can and that they've reached a  ceiling in terms of their ad revenue\" or the revenue that they can -- how  fast they can grow their revenue.</p><p>Google has access to two billion active android mobile devices and that's  where a lot of the data extraction comes from and that's where a lot of the  data that's later used improperly comes from, this is according to one of  these -- a professor quoted in this Wall Street Journal article but I think  in terms of some of these ad companies and even though Apple's had a bad  product cycle with the iPhone X, Apple's in a better position privacy-wise  which Tim Cook has been pretty big in Facebook or Google at this point in  terms of protecting your --</p><p>NELSON:  They're also becoming less iPhone depend at this point and they're  monetizing a lot of their other services, so that's good news for them.   It's a miss product cycle, that's cyclical, we'll get over that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So real quick, the estimates called for profit growth in the  S&amp;P500 of 19 percent for the first quarter.  Are you saying that's too  high?</p><p>NELSON:  I think they -- and we'll probably hit that, maybe even beat that  but the market knows that stocks are discounting that, they knew that's  coming in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So would you sell it to markets right now?  You want to sell  it?</p><p>NELSON:  No, I'm fully invested and I'll pick and choose my points.  If  you're going to try to trade around every wiggle of this market, you're  going to find yourself missing the big runs unless you've got some kind of  tactical program to do that for you, avoid that at all cost.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing to just point quickly, you talk about the overall  earnings growth for the S&amp;P500.  If you look at the major tech companies of  the ones reporting this week, Alphabet is expected to have faster growth in  that 20 percent.</p><p>But Facebook, it's only expected to have earnings per share change of not  even five percent.  Microsoft, less than the overall market, Intel less  than the overall market.  Intel also single digit grower in terms of EPS.</p><p>NELSON:  And that shows expenses going up at Facebook that's why markets  are contracting.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Which is what Niles pointed out.  David, great to see  you.</p><p>NELSON:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, David Nelson joining us there.  Coming up,  shocking new revelations on how the FBI probes into the Trump campaign  really began.  White House's Chairman of -- the House Chairman of the  Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes told me after digging deeper into the  FBI and DOJ documents, he's next.</p><p>And then TV personality and surgeon, Dr. Oz helps students who were  escaping a bus fire on a New Jersey highway, the dramatic video coming up,  back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, April 23rd, happy  Monday, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets  under pressure this morning, down, fractionally, as you can see, ahead of a  big week for earnings.  </p><p>The rising yield on the tenure treasury one issue weighing on markets  again, hovering near three percent right now, up to 2.98 percent.  Rising  yield hitting the equity markets on Friday, the major indices all closing  nearly one percent lower on the day.  And now, all are negative for the  year, 2018.  Global markets also watching earnings this morning.  It is a  big week for earnings.  </p><p>The European indices are down across the board.  It is really a fractional  move, one-third of the Dow, one-third on the S&amp;P 500, report earnings for  the first quarter, this week.  Check Asian markets, declines across the  board.  Here too, fractional moves, Hong Kong, the worst performer.  </p><p>New questions this morning over the Russia investigation, House  Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, telling me on Sunday Morning  Futures that no intelligence was used to actually start this probe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  We've never understood because, you know, we have -- we have access  to these finish intelligence products, and we've never seen one.  We had  never -- so, we thought, well, maybe there was one that went to a different  channel that was kept really quiet, it was secret, it was kept from the  congress and other folks.  Well, in fact, after our investigators reviewed  this, that is not what happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was no intelligence used, the latest revelations from  this investigation and why it actually started.  A remarkable life  remembered, thousands gathered in Houston, this weekend, to celebrate the  life of the First Lady Barbara Bush and her grave site opens to the public,  this morning.  Among the mourners, four presidents and first ladies, this  photo from the funeral, going viral, take a look.  </p><p>Plus, there's this, Dr. Oz, coming to the rescue, he pulled over to help  passengers on a bus that caught fire, the dramatic video, coming up, and  striking a chord with investors, Chinese streaming giant, Tencent,  reportedly planning to go public, details on the giant valuation there as  well.</p><p>And then there's this, Rihanna, getting another brand under her umbrella,  the popstar, unveiling her own line of lingerie, a first look at the latest  addition to her business empire.  But first, Devin Nunes, drawing a line in  the sand, this weekend, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman shared  his newest findings on highly contested collusion between the Trump  campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.  He said this on Sunday  Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  I wanted to know what intelligence did you have that actually led  to this investigation.  So what we've found, now, after the investigators  have reviewed it, is that in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In fact, there was no intelligence.  I actually have to have  him repeat that in my interview.  Joining me right now to talk more about  it is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford.  Christopher,  it's good to see this morning.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you find that as extraordinary as I do?  They didn't have  any intelligence to launch an investigation into Donald Trump and whether  or not there was collusion between Trump and the Russians.  So, where did  they come up with it?  There was no intelligence that led them to believe  this.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I remember there was a full stop in the green room, before your  Sunday show when he said that, everyone looked up, holy smokes, this is a  big revelation.  Now, what it looks like from what I've been doing the  research afterwards, is this may be talking about what has been called the  second dossier because compiled by this guy, Cody Shearer, a long-time  Clinton confidant, someone who is so sketchy that in 1999 Slate Article, if  he didn't exist, the right-wing conspiracy would have to invent this guy.   He pulled together a lot of information.  </p><p>He also appears to, potentially, according to week list (INAUDIBLE)  reporting, be a source for the first dossier.  This becomes, kind of, the  self-licking ice cream -- ice cream cone thing that we've seen before,  where one guy writes a dossier to collaborate another dossier.  It turns  out to be the source for the first dossier, the author of the second  dossier.  And then our intelligence services were using media reports on  the first dossier to collaborate the first dossier.  </p><p>When it turns out that the media sources for those -- for those stories,  was the guy who wrote it himself.  It's just (INAUDIBLE) thing.  And as the  congressman pointed out, this did not come through the proper channels.   Even though some reports came to department of state, through the  Australian government, it didn't go through the proper intelligence  channels, which would be necessary to start intelligence investigation, and  that is extremely concerning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is because now we know that the only evidence or  backing for a FISA warrant to wire-tap, people from the Trump campaign, was  all that dossier which was unverified.  This is not the way America  operates.  This is really an incredible statement that they had no  intelligence on it.  And you wonder if, in fact, now that we know that, is  the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's work, I mean, what is this  investigation about?  Is it just to have an insurance policy so that you  try hard to delegitimize President Trump?</p><p>BEDFORD:  It's hard to keep track on what Mueller's investigation is about  because it seem, right now, to be so far away from where it started Russian  collaboration.  Now, Mueller's investigation is seeking the New York -- New  York Justice Attorney -- excuse me, New York Attorney, on confidants to the  President, violating attorney-client privilege.  </p><p>Things seem to have gone up the rails but there is no telling right now,  there's nothing that I've seen that's going to stop the Mueller  investigation.  And we are coming up on a big fight in the U.S. senate  between Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Mitch McConnell, because  Grassley wants to pass a bill that protects Mueller from even being fired  without congressional review.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I don't think there's anything that's going to stop this  investigation, but we're going to look back in the history books when we  finally get our eyes on these primary documents and we're probably going to  ask what the heck was going on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  You know, I want to get to Hillary Clinton in a  minute, but I just want to say this, Devin Nunes, yesterday, said that  number one, they're investigating the opening of the investigation.  Now,  they know there was no intelligence used, and number two, they're  investigating how they conducted this investigation, the willingness to use  dirt that was funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee  to get a warrant to listen to calls, and then there is a third thing that  he is working on and he's investigating the State Department.  </p><p>He says that's going to come out soon and we're also going to get more  information from this fourth-coming I.G. report which is going to focus on  Jim Comey and the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.  So, I just wonder  what it is at the State Department that the Intel committee is working on.   I think they're looking at all the people who are funnelling information to  the State Department, like as you say, the individual you just mentioned,  as well as Sidney Blumenthal?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  You're right.  And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hillary Clinton, you know, prot,g,es and colleagues, friends.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  She has a lot of friends, a lot of prot,g,es and a lot of people  who were part of what they call the spy network, which is basically headed  by Sidney Blumenthal, who had an email address that was made to look like  it was a White House e-mail address, even though Barack Obama's president,  he pushed him away from being a conspiracy theorist, even though John  Podesta has said he was lost in his own web of conspiracies.  </p><p>He was constantly feeding data back in the Department of State.  And, you  know, most administration s try to make it as easy as possible for the next  administration to come in because it's very important.  The President of  the United States is the most powerful man in the world when he deals with  our foreign policy.  By all accounts, the Department of State set  tripwires, practically, booby trap the White House for the incoming  administration and that is another (INAUDIBLE) really a dark stain on the  outgoing presidency of the last administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll wait for more information on this investigation into the  State Department.  This is big.  Meanwhile, Hillary is out, taking aim at  the press now for coverage of her run in office for 2016.  She's spoken in  an engagement in New York, yesterday.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The mainstream  political coverage was influenced by the right-wing media ecosystem.   Relentlessly, negative news has had a levelling effect that opens the doors  to charlatans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know what to say, Christopher, your thoughts.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Not only that, but then she said she thinks that the press has  gotten more fair since the 2016 election and it has been a course correct  where it's become more objective.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  That's obviously false, and American people can see that from  their lack of trust.  We have the lead reporter on the Hillary Clinton  campaign from the New York Times, admitting that she cried at her desk  after Hillary Clinton lost.  We had people saying it was a conspiracy  theory that Hillary Clinton was in, potentially, bad health.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Just days before she collapsed after 45 minutes in mild weather.   She was treated very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why it's such a joke that the Democrats are going to  be suing the Trump campaign.  They've levelled this lawsuit, when we know  that the FBI, the Department of Justice.  We're all very firmly behind  Hillary Clinton.  We know that, obviously, from all of these texts.  So  it's just laughable, this lawsuit, when it's absolutely the opposite that,  in fact, it was the FBI and the DOJ, trying hard to push Trump down and  make sure he did it when and support Hillary.</p><p>And then we have got these reports about those I.T. guys.  Imran Awan's  father transferred data to a Pakistani senator and former Head of the  Pakistani Intelligence Agency, via a usb drive, Christopher, his son,  Imran, the former ITA to Congressman and Former DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, who made unauthorized access to in-house servers while working on  the Hill.  </p><p>Present Trump tweeted about the matter over the weekend. He wrote this,  just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist Democrats.  This can  be good news and that we will now counter for the DNC server that they  refused to give the FBI.  The Debbie Wasserman Schultz servers and  documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton e-mails.   Christopher, there you go, I mean, we know what happened when the DNC was  hacked.  </p><p>You would think that if you get hacked, you want the might and the power  and the strength of the FBI behind you, to figure out who hacked you, but  that's not what they did.  They would not give their server to the FBI.   They hired a private company to look at the server because they don't want  people to know what was on the server.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Exactly.  And by every bit of our reporting, has pointed to one  thing and that said, Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was then head of the DNC,  has something that she's very concerned about getting out.  When her laptop  was first -- what appears to be her laptop, it's got the username, RepDWS,  was taken by Imran Awan and then left in the congressional building after  he had been barred from the networks and fired by every other congressman,  except for Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  </p><p>He was left there with a copy of his I.D., with a copy of his -- with a  copy of congressional badge and with a note that said, attorney-client  privilege, which is ridiculous, by the way.  Andrew McCarthy has pointed  out that you can't just put a note on evidence that says attorney-client  privilege and had to be taken out.  It was left in a phone booth,  discovered by police at night.  And since then, Debbie Wasserman Schultz  had worked really hard, including threatening the Chief of the Capitol  Police to make sure this laptop is returned.  Now, she's saying she doesn't  care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't understand.  He left the laptop in a phone booth with a  note?  What is he trying to be, a sarcastic?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Well, what it appears -- what it could potentially be and some  people had guessed, is that he's threatening Debbie Wasserman Schultz with  the information that's on that laptop, because first, she was fighting to  keep it away from -- away from the Capitol Police and out of the  jurisdiction.  And now, he is in court, holding that up for the last few  months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Christopher, we'll keep following.  You've  done great reporting on this.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher Bedford, the Daily Caller.  Coming up, Chinese  streaming giant's Tencent, reportedly planning an IPO.  It's going to be  one for the record bucks.  We've got the details, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The grave site for Barbara Bush will be opening  to the public this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Maria, the late first lady was buried over the weekend in a gated  plot at the George H.W. Bush presidential library.  She is now near the  grave of her daughter, Robin, who died from leukemia when she was just  three years old.  The Bush family, sharing photos from the private  ceremony, hundreds of family and friends giving a final farewell.  This day  brought together for former presidents-- the two President Bushes, as well  as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the first lady is also there, including  Melania Trump.  This photo has gone viral, we should say.  And in a tribute  to his wife's commitment to literacy, former President Bush wore a pair of  socks decorated with stacks of colorful books.  </p><p>Well, celebrity health expert Dr. Oz has captured this video of a burning  bus on the New Jersey turnpike with high school students running away.  Dr.  Oz pulled over to film the chaotic scene and made sure the students got to  safety.  A staff can be seen carrying luggage, instruments away from that  bus.  That group was coming back from a musical in New York.  Dr. Oz shared  the video on his Facebook page, saying he was thankful that everybody got  out safely.  This is not Dr. Oz's first roadside rescue.  He was in an  honorary firefighter after helping victims of a crash on the same highway  back in 2015.  </p><p>Well, the China's largest music streaming 10 Cent Music is preparing to go  public.  They're expected to be one of the biggest technology IPOs ever.   This valuation could exceed $25 billion.  10 Cent Music says it has got  about 700 million monthly active users.  This coming, of course, after  Spotify successfully went public on the New York Stock Exchange earlier  this month.  </p><p>And let's stay with music because Rihanna is planning to reduce -- release  a line of lingerie.  The singer modeling the collection herself.  She posts  in her underwear on Instagram.  Not clear when exactly her new products are  actually going to be released.  But last year, he successfully launched her  own make up line during New York Fashion Week.  Another celebrity, Maria,  getting on the I'm-going-to-make-and-sell-it-too bandwagon, and she's  probably doing pretty well.  Her makeup is done very well, we should say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes, that's been a real success.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Expanding her empire.</p><p>MURPHY:  More power to her.  I love it.  She's got the music, she's got the  make-up, she's got lingerie.  Awesome!  I love to see that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to say something? </p><p>CARTER:  I just want to say how much I love the picture of the Bush family  with all of the presidents at the funeral.  I love H.W.'s socks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they're great.  Coming up, as companies transform the way  we work, live, and play, the way the start-ups look for office face to  stuck in that time work.  That's where Squarefoot comes in.  The details on  the real estate disruptor right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ahead winds for growing business is finding  office space.  The one company, Squarefoot, is trying to make the process a  lot easier and more transparent now.  The company recently announced it has  raised $7 million in a series eight round financing that led by Mike Murphy  and his firm Rosecliffe with us this morning.  Mike is now joining  Squarefoot's board of directors and joining us right now to talk more about  it is the CEO and co-Founder of Squarefoot, Jonathan Wasserstrum.  Good to  see you, Jonathan.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>JONATHAN WASSERSTRUM, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, SQUAREFOOT:  Thanks for having me  guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we know about the retail market and things like truly in  the market.  Tell us how your firm differs from the competition and how you  try to provide transparency in real estate. </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Yes, groups like (INAUDIBLE) have done a great job on their  essential side pushing forward that transparency.  When we start the  business several years ago, we thought it was stupid that you couldn't go  online and do the same thing for office space -- that's what we set out to  do. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do it?</p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Well, we do a couple of things: we bring transparency to that  market that traditionally had none by allowing prospective tenants to go  online and look at space.  And we also have technology that we have built  for in-house transactions team and for the clients who we work with to  guide them to that process to make it a whole bunch more easy.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, we were first introduced to Jonathan when we are moving our  offices from midtown down to the flat iron district.  And just going online  and searching for space, we saw the Squarefoot -- that's how we originally  met them.  And we see an opportunity for them to bring to the commercial  market what companies like Compass and Red Thin have done for their  residential market.  So, now, if you want to find an office, office space,  you go right on their site, to Squarefoot.com, you look at what you want:  how many feet, how many employees, what you want to spend, and they'll pull  it up for you right on your smartphones.  So, we think this is how people  will get office space in the future.</p><p>CARTER:  it's pretty extraordinary.  We're talking about one of the things.   I was wondering what happens to commercial real estate with trends both in  and how people were working, and also, we're talking a little bit about  what that means of retail space right now in so many empty store fronts.   Can you tell me a little bit about that?  </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Yes.  It's a way that people are working.  There's been a  proliferation with groups like we work and all the flexible space writers.   We think it's great for the industry.  It brings a whole much more  flexibility to the market.  It means transactions can happen a lot quicker.   The traditional leases of three to five years or maybe a thin of the past?   I don't think I'd go that far.  I think it depends on the right solution  for the right company at the right time.  Retail has been a really  interesting thing, and everybody has been reading and talking about the  death of retail for a while.  It's probably a little bit overblown in my  opinion.  I think that it just takes a little bit to reset pricing  expectations now from historically where companies can make a whole bunch  of money with retail outlets, but a lot of that is moving online.  So,  we're just going to have to start adjusting sale price and expectations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the pushback from traditional commercial real estate  brokers and how they might be retaliating against you?  Because they're not  going to standby and just take it.  </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Hopefully, they won't be marching the streets too soon.  So,  we are brokers ourselves, so we work within the confines of the traditional  industry.  There's really two groups from the brokers' perspective: there's  the groups that represent landlords, and there's the groups that represent  tenants.  To those who represent the landlords, we're their bestfriend,  where a whole new conduit that they've never had for them to access people  actually looking for the space in the market.  And for the groups that  represent the tenants -- you know, the groups like I used to work at a guy  who runs real estate for us now.  I used to work at (INAUDIBLE) -- they  focus more on the big guys, right?  So, Fox needs office space, or the  average 500,000 Squarefoot user needs office space, you should work with  JLL.  Great!  I'm (INAUDIBLE).  I work with them.  But for the average  five, 10, 50, even 200 person company, you should be online looking with  us, and helping us, and allowing us to help you with your transactions.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, how is the market right?  A lot movement or no?</p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  A lot of movement, yes.  Softening a little bit at the top,  but there's always going to be people who needs space.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jonathan, great to see you.  </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.  Good luck.  Jonathan Wasserstrum there.   Still ahead, Iran, Syria trade, all pressing issues on the agenda as  President Trump welcomes the French President Emmanuel Macron to the White  House for a three-day visit in Washington.  We are taking your live to the  White House with a preview, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Monday to you!  It is Monday, April 23rd.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Happy  Monday to you and good morning everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for  joining us.  It is Monday, April 23rd.  Your top stories right now 6:00a.m.  on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Earnings on the driver seat on Wall Street this morning, Futures showing a  decline at the start of trading today, down about 40 points on the Dow,  down a fraction on the S&amp;P, and down eight points on the NASDAQ.  More than  a third of the Dow and the S&amp;P500 set to report their first quarter  earnings this week.  It is going to be a monster week for earnings.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Alphabet, the name to watch after the close tonight, it comes amid new  concerns surrounding Google's data collection.  Dan Niles Money Manager on  Wall Street this weekend says he thinks Google will miss earnings  estimates.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Markets tumbling on Friday, Apple dragged the Dow lower after analysts'  reports suggested that smartphone sales could slow in the coming months.   Also, Niles said Apple will miss.  We are watching the fine market this  morning, the 10-year yield creeping closer to three percent, take a look,  up two basis points right now at 2.99 percent on the 10-year.</p><p> In Europe this morning, stocks looking like this, now we do have a lower  opening there as well and lower trading this morning.  CAC Quarante is down  a fraction, CAC Quarante in Paris down a fraction as is the DAX Index in  Germany, down a quarter of a percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight right across the board, the Hang Seng the biggest loser,  down better than one-half of one percent in Hong Kong.  </p><p> And a pair of former political outsiders inside the Oval Office, President  Trump welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House today  from trade to national security.  We're taking a look at what's on the  agenda for the two world leaders ahead of the state dinner tomorrow night.</p><p> Investigating the investigation, shocking new revelations on the start of  the FBI probe into the Trump campaign.  House Intelligence Chairman Devin  Nunes telling me yesterday about his findings, he explained on Sunday  Morning Futures.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN:  We've long wanted to  know what intelligence did you have that actually led to this  investigation.  So what we found now after the investigators have reviewed  it is that in fact there was no intelligence.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No intelligence to launch that investigation.  The very latest  on the investigation coming up.  Plus, another high note for the music  industry, Chinese streaming giant Tencent reportedly planning to go public  where the company is expected to list and that mammoth evaluation.</p><p> Plus, revving up their resume, Harley-Davidson offering an internship of a  lifetime, how college students can get paid to ride coming up.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to talk  about it, FOX BUsines Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO, Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy along with Pollster and the President of Maslansky and  Partners, Lee Carter.  Good morning.</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Good morning.  Great to be  here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Happy Monday everybody.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning Maria.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Incredible interview with Devin Nunes, the  Congressman, Head of the House Intelligence Committee.  So I can't wait to  hear that again this morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's just a -- it's extraordinary.  We've talked about  how the same FBI agents were overseeing an investigation into Trump and an  investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail usage.  </p><p> And now we find out that with all of the evidence on the Hillary Clinton  side, they didn't have any official intelligence to launch this  investigation.  It sounds like Dagen it was all about the dossier.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  All about the dossier.  And that it -- again, this is a thread  that runs through.  The very highest leadership within the FBI and it's  incredible that -- I mean, it really is Devin Nunes who's taking this on to  uncover why a presidential campaign was being investigated.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  And he's getting trashed for it at every level.   And yet he's the Chairman of the Intel Committee and has looked at the raw  data and has come up with this, that there was no intelligence used.  Quite  extraordinary, we're going to talk about that this morning and what that  means.</p><p> Joining the conversation, we've got House Majority Leader, California  Congressman Kevin McCarthy in the studio this morning.  White House  Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah is here.  FOX News Senior  Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano along with former U.S. Attorney  and Avenue Strategies Partner, Budd Cummings. </p><p> Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a lot on the table this morning to  talk about.  And, of course, we are also looking at earnings.  Investors  are weighing for Google's parent company Alphabet to report earnings after  the close tonight as the technology giant gears up to report the results  and tell us what the last three months look like.  Analysts expecting the  company to post adjusted earnings of $9.28 a share on revenue of $3.29  billion.  Alphabet is kicking off big techs earnings splits on Wall Street  this week.  We also have Amazon coming out on Thursday.  Mike Murphy, your  thoughts?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think when you see a move in big tech like you saw Apple on  Friday dropped seven points, I think in this market it's a buying  opportunity.  So, Google's going to -- Alphabet's going to come out with  earnings and say, \"We're going to hear from Amazon\" all the big tech  companies, they're all going to post great numbers.</p><p> How the stock reacts, I think the way to play it is if there's a pullback,  it's a buying opportunity because we have underlying strength in the  market, you have underlying strength in these companies.  So any weakness,  I'd be a buyer.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Maybe but Dan Niles from Alpha One who's really very thoughtful  on the tech sector, he was my guest on the Wall Street program this weekend  and he said Apple's going to miss and Amazon -- and Google parent, Alphabet  is going to miss.  </p><p> Now, if you had that big sharp decline on Apple on Friday, does the market  -- is the market telling you get ready for a miss and all are we going to  see an even bigger decline if the company comes out and reports a miss?</p><p> MURPHY:  You may.  But remember, Apple under most recent pull off came all  the way down to $151 and right after that, it rallied all the way back up  to $170.  So here, where it's trading in the mid $160s, it's setting up  after Friday's move, it -- I think you're pricing a miss into the stock.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> MURPHY:  So if there's any more weakness, I'd be a buyer.  But if Apple  misses by a few millions, iPhone Xs in the market, I think that sets up as  a buying opportunity because they have so many other levers that they can  pull.  I think that people are going to be buying iPhones in the third  quarter, in the fourth quarter, so any weakness is a buying.</p><p> CARTER:  Do you think --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You should drop the X.  People don't like the X and they've got  expectations that it's going to not meet demand numbers.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a flop.  According to some, if you talk to -- I'm not doing  channel checks but I go and -- yes, I've talked to a lot of people who work  in the data -- the cellphone company in the stores, not for Apple but like  -- I won't use the name of the company because I don't want to get the  employees in trouble.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But they would know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But they tell me if I go in and say, \"Do you like the X?\"   They're like, \"No, don't buy it.  It really is awful.\"  They were like, \"If  you tried an Android phone\" so that would certainly benefit Google.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, again, people are unhappy with it.  And --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I haven't had the easiest, same as mine.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a $1,000, that's a huge outlay.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, expensive.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  At a time when Americans really are keeping the purse strings  pretty tight in terms of their spending.</p><p> MURPHY:  One thing on that, if you're going to buy an X, it's 24 months and  they charge $50.00 a month automatically.  So they're giving you an  interest for a loan to finance the purchase of the phone.  So I think  people like that.  And I think no matter what, people are going to buy the  next Apple phone, so I think that's the -- </p><p> CARTER:  If it was selling off the shelf by itself though they wouldn't  have to do that, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p> MURPHY:  Well, I think you have to define off the shelf -- well no, I think  that's part of their plan.  So number one, off the shelves, they may miss  numbers at top line expectations but they're still selling a ton of iPhone  Xs.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what Dan Niles said about this is that they --  he said him and his whole family needed new batteries.  And so they went  and changed the battery in the phone and it was $29.00 and they were fine.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he said, \"I don't need to buy a new phone,\" he said.  And  so I'm looking at my family as a proxy and saying, \"Well all we did was buy  a $29.00 battery and we were good to go and we didn't need the next phone.\"   So that's what he's worried about, the next phone and, of course, the  issues around the X which are real.</p><p> CARTER:  Yes.  I also am curious with regulation if fears are going to play  into stock prices after earnings this week because I know so many people  are talking about, is tech going to be the next area that's going to be  highly regulated like banks were before with all of the data concerns, with  everything that's with Facebook.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That goes right to what Maria mentioned at the top of the show  about the -- this Wall Street Journal story on the amount of information  that Google collects on you, (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the article is called, \"Who has more of your data?  Your  personal data than Facebook?  Try Google.\"  The Journal reporting that  Google's android devices allowed the harvesting of data from billions of  active users without warning.</p><p> What about that?  I mean, I'm talking eight years ago I did a documentary  on Google and that was about the fact that they save all your searches for  two years and then they anonymize the math to two years but why do they say  for the two years anyway?</p><p> MURPHY:  I guess to monetize them, they want to figure out how they can --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p> MURPHY:  -- get advertising dollars in by using a data.  But I think where  we are today in 2018, if you're on the internet, if you're on your smart  phone, if you're searching on a computer, if you're searching anywhere,  there are ways for whether it's Google or Apple or Facebook, somebody can  track what you're doing.</p><p> Now, if you don't like that, I guess there are certain ways to try to  backdoor it or opt out of certain things.  But, I think that's just a fact  of life, people are going to know what was --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But what did Sheryl Sandberg say, Dagen?  She said, \"Oh,  we don't have a product to opt out at the high levels, that's a paid  product.\"  In other words, I have to pay them just to secure my data that  is not shared.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's an idea that should -- that actually Walt Mossberg came  up with.  Like, he suggested that Facebook offer a paid service and -- so  they wouldn't share of your data.  </p><p> But this Wall Street Journal article goes into the fact that Google, if  you're logged into Google, you can opt out of how they use your private  information.  But it goes well beyond that because Google Analytics is used  on about 50 million sites and Google Analytics tracks you whether you're  logged in or not, so that's number one.  But Google uses among other  things, you're browsing in search history apps, you've installed  demographics like age and gender from its own analytics and other sources  where -- and other sources like where we've shopped in the real world.</p><p> It's incredible Google's reach and I think that the point of this article  in the Wall Street Journal is Mark Zuckerberg gets called in front of  Congress, he -- and gets grilled about regulation, same thing's going to  happen to Alphabet and Google and Google out to be a little bit more  worried than even Facebook --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what does that mean?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- about regulation, what are they going to do?  Are -- is there  going to be a broad way you can prevent Google from collecting your  information whether you're -- even if you aren't logged into the Google  service.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And with new rules, how much does that impact the earnings and  does that change the (INAUDIBLE) on the stock?</p><p> MURPHY:  Right.  Well that's why these companies have been so profitable is  that they can sell your data to advertisers and advertisers know exactly  who you are --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we didn't realize how much they were selling.</p><p> MURPHY:  I guess maybe people didn't know exactly how much they were  selling but I think when you went on to the site, I think you knew.  When  you logged in to your computer and looked Mexican vacations, the next time  you log in, there are six sites popping up that are focused on Mexican  resorts or Mexican vacations.  I mean, that's been going on for years from  these companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CARTER:  But I think that people knew that sort of thing but I don't think  they understood how that translated to so many other -- other things.  And  that the data might used not for what they want it to be used for.</p><p> So if you Google Mexican vacations or getting Mexican vacations, that makes  sense to people.  But when they have -- you have a whole profile online  that says this is who they think you are, your age and that the kinds of  ads are going to serve up based on that, I think a lot Americans are  confused by that and quite frankly are angry that that's happened because  they don't feel it's been transparent to them at all.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And by the way, when you're in a certain place in the world and  all of a sudden you get an ad for that local store that's on the block that  you were in, that's a little spooky -- </p><p> CARTER:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- I'm sorry.  I'm going to switch gears to the White House,  President Trump welcoming French Leader Emmanuel Macron today to Washington  for a three-day visit.  The two are expected to talk about trade ahead of  his trip.  The French president issued a warning to the United States,  listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE:  You cannot make war with your ally.   It's too complicated.  If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade  war against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war (INAUDIBLE)  come on, it's not -- it doesn't work.  You need ally, we are the ally.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And yet he still agrees with many of President Trump's  policies, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This goes back to something I've talked about repeatedly is that  our allies in terms of trade and on the world stage, we're kind of  blindsided by the steel and aluminum tariffs.  </p><p> If you want -- if you really want to take on China, if China is your  biggest problem globally in terms of unfair trade practices, then you lock  arms with Europe, with Japan and you present a united front.  When you kind  of throw a steel and aluminum tariff in the face of your allies and say,  \"Maybe we'll exempt you, maybe we won't.\"  And there have been many  exemptions it turned out.</p><p> But, again, it was handled so haphazardly and so ham-handedly right out of  the gate with the holding up the -- you got the Commerce Secretary holding  up cans of soup and lecturing the American people about your -- the cost of  this can of soup isn't going on.  It shows the fundamental misunderstanding  of how people will react to inflation and, again, inflation by fiat out of  the White House but also it was a slap on the face to our allies if they  weren't consulted about it in the first place.  They're trying to manage it  now but, again, they're still -- he still got his hair up so to speak.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Messaging issues I guess.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come back, no official  intelligence was used to start the Russia investigation, the so-called  collusion.  The jaw-dropping revelation from House Intel Committee Chairman  Devin Nunes after digging deeper into FBI and DOJ documents, the new  questions in the case, that's right after this break.</p><p> And then Tencent, China's largest music streaming company could launch one  of the biggest technology IPOs ever with a monster valuation.  The  staggering number right ahead, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well a massive manhunt is underway this morning  for the man suspected of killing four people at a Waffle House outside of  Nashville.  Cheryl Caosne on headlines on that now, over to you Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes Maria, good morning to you.  Police say that 29-year-old  Travis Reinking is armed and dangerous.  National public schools are now in  lockdown mode.  We learned yesterday that he was arrested in July of 2017  for being in a restricted area near the White House.</p><p> More than a year before that, Reinking claimed singer Taylor Swift was  stalking him.  Customer James Shaw fearing for his life, took a dangerous  chance to pounce on the shooter to wrestle at least the gun away.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAMES SHAW, JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO:  At the time that he was either  reloading or the gun jammed, or whatever happened, is when I ran through  the swivel door, I hit him with the swivel door.  I managed to get him with  one hand on the gun and then I grabbed it from him and I threw it over the  countertop.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well the four people who were killed have been identified.   Authority say they are Taurean Sanderlin, Joe Perez, Akilah Dasilva, and  DeEbony Groves.  Sanderlin was an employee at that Waffle House.</p><p> Well, more cancellations today for Southwest Airlines, Southwest has  cancelled at least 100 scheduled flights today and yesterday they cancelled  about 40 to inspect the planes' engines.  This comes after last week's  accident in Pennsylvania that killed one woman on board.  A fan blade broke  off ripping a hole to the plane's wing and then it went into the window on  Friday.  Regulators have ordered emergency inspections on 700 of the same  type of engine that was involved in that accident.  Shares of Southwest  Airlines were down about 17 percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, it could be the summer of the hog for some college students.  Harley- Davidson planning to pick eight lucky summer interns and teach them how to  ride bikes.  Then they're going to attend a motorcycle event across the  country, document it all for social media.  It's a 12-week paid internship  open to juniors and seniors who are interested (INAUDIBLE) in social media,  communications, public relations, or marketing.  Taking a look at shares of  Harley-Davidson down about 20 percent so far this year.  I got a kick out  of the story Maria because my neighbor who's 66 yesterday said to me, \"I  want a new Harley\" and I thought, \"Exactly.  And you're 66-years-old.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.  What a gig.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Pretty cool.  Get the interns to drive them, ride the bike.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A well -- this is a well-known problem that Harley-Davidson's  been having.  What Cheryl mentioned as -- that young people are not buying  motorcycles and not riding motorcycles in this country.  </p><p> MURPHY:  They want to get the young people on the motorcycle so they can  collect data.  See if the big -- it's a theme that they want the data on --</p><p> CARTER:  It's a big conspiracy.</p><p> MURPHY:  That they need data.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh God.  </p><p> CARTER: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We get an enormous shout out to James Shaw, wow, what a hero.   Actually in the Waffle House, sees the gunman come in, just moved and acts.   Jumps -- pushes the door into him, jumps on him, and removes the guy's gun.   There he is, James Shaw just a patron at the Waffle House becomes the hero  of the day.</p><p> When they found all those magazines and the other bullets in the shooter's  jacket, you know that he was there for some serious killing and James Shaw  stopped it.  </p><p> MURPHY:  It's great to see a young man being celebrated, to see the FBI  around him, clapping for him.  I mean, we - like you said a true hero and  we should talk about it even more.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  I think he's just terrific.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We should keep talking about him.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Every week, let's just talk about him.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) it out, you are such hero.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And to have that kind of courage, wrestle the gun out of  his hands.  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come back, Hillary  Clinton is now blaming charlatans and the media for her 2016 election loss.   Now it's the media's fault.  Her stunning new comments coming up.</p><p> And then we are watching global currency this morning as the 10-year  Treasury hits a high of -- a four-year high right under three percent.  How  this may impact this week's European Central Bank meeting as well.  Back in  a moment right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Futures edging lower this morning, investors are waiting on  more earnings.  We are expecting a lower opening for the Dow down 28,  NASDAQ and S&amp;P down just a fraction.  We're also watching the bond market,  the yields on the 10-year hitting 2.99 percent, that is the highest level  since January 2014.</p><p> Joining us right now is Belpointe Chief Strategist, David Nelson.  David,  good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What worries you more, the move towards three percent or the  earnings story?</p><p> NELSON:  The earning story only in the sense that the expectations were  just so high coming into this.  Just before this earning started, J.P.  Morgan was one of the first to report.  </p><p> I looked at an estimate chart and they had literally gone parabolic going  into the earnings.  So expectations are high and so far what I've seen, the  earnings have been fine.  The bigger problem in earning season this time  around is technology.  And I saw your interview with Dan Niles and hit on a  couple of important points.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's do that right now.  Let's see what Dan Niles said  about technology.  He had a real problem with Apple and Google parent  Alphabet.  Here's Dan Niles this weekend.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You also think Apple is going to have a miss when it reports.</p><p> DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  Yes, I do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Apple reports in May, watch for that.  Dan thinks they're  going to miss on the numbers.  Google parent Alphabet, you also think may  miss.  </p><p> NILES:  Yes.  I think that one though I like quite a bit over the longer  term.  I think the problem with Google is the exact opposite as with  Facebook.  With Facebook, they guided expenses up 45 to 60 percent this  year before this data breach stuff ever happened.</p><p> When you look at Google, they have expenses model for some reason Wall  Street does, Google doesn't guide.  The Wall Street has expenses modeled to  the -- go up by the slowest pace in the last five years.  And I think the  expenses are actually going to be a bit higher.  I think the revenues will  be fine but I think you're going to have a problem on the margin front  which is why I think the EPS is going to have an issue.  But that's one of  those stocks that after that I think is in really good shape going forward.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I guess the question becomes if Apple and Google's parent  Alphabet missed, does that create a reason to sell and sort of lead this  market down and earnings worried?</p><p> NELSON:  It's difficult to have a bull market without tech in the lead.   It's just an item in the script.  This is a missed product cycle for Apple.   I thought the iPhone X was a disappointment.  I have an iPhone7, I so no  need to switch.</p><p> The bigger issue for technology isn't even Apple, it's really Washington.   Make no mistake, what you saw with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, that  was the earth moving under our feet.  Regulation is coming to technology  and that means change business models. </p><p> Mark Zuckerberg is inviting it, and as that changed, business models take  place and you give consumers the ability to opt out of some or all part of  their data.  Then that data is just simply worthless and that translates to  other companies as well, Google and others.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's what we've been saying earlier Mike.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  So David, when -- so I agree, you don't want to fight  Washington.  When you're owning a company, you don't want them like  Facebook fighting Washington.  But this could lead -- I see this is a  potential opportunity for the Facebooks and Alphabets and Apples of the  World to start monetizing some of their data, to actually charge consumers  for the data because it's not as if you're going to have a mass equities  away from Google.</p><p> NELSON:  They're going to charge consumers for their data, how about  consumers charging Facebook to use the data, that's another model that  could go out there.  </p><p> MURPHY:  How would -- I don't know how they would put that.</p><p> NELSON:  I don't know, I --</p><p> MURPHY:  You're not going to charge Facebook for something but Facebook  could say, \"Hey, $0.99 per year, $0.99 per quarter, per month.\"</p><p> NELSON:  You mean to not opt in and not have your data use.</p><p> MURPHY:  Or to have a certain type of your data use, let's have a certain  type.  I mean --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's so backwards to me that I'm going to pay them to protect  my privacy.</p><p> NELSON:  I'm not going to do that.</p><p> MURPHY:  You're really paying them to use their service, right?  They've  been giving it to you for free for years.  You've been on it, you've been  using it all the time --</p><p> NELSON:  I think it's just the opposite honestly.  I feel that they're --</p><p> MURPHY:  That you're going to charge Facebook.</p><p> NELSON:  -- extracting a lot of data from me, they're making a lot of money  off of it.  And I think the only other way around for them is if I opt out  of my data then you can charge me to be on that site and pay for a model.   That's something that Sheryl Sanderberg has said that she doesn't want to  do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  One of the biggest issues is not necessarily Washington but  investors stepping back and saying, \"Have Google and Facebook squeezed as  much information out of us as they possibly can and that they've reached a  ceiling in terms of their ad revenue\" or the revenue that they can -- how  fast they can grow their revenue.</p><p> Google has access to two billion active android mobile devices and that's  where a lot of the data extraction comes from and that's where a lot of the  data that's later used improperly comes from, this is according to one of  these -- a professor quoted in this Wall Street Journal article but I think  in terms of some of these ad companies and even though Apple's had a bad  product cycle with the iPhone X, Apple's in a better position privacy-wise  which Tim Cook has been pretty big in Facebook or Google at this point in  terms of protecting your --</p><p> NELSON:  They're also becoming less iPhone depend at this point and they're  monetizing a lot of their other services, so that's good news for them.   It's a miss product cycle, that's cyclical, we'll get over that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So real quick, the estimates called for profit growth in the  S&amp;P500 of 19 percent for the first quarter.  Are you saying that's too  high?</p><p> NELSON:  I think they -- and we'll probably hit that, maybe even beat that  but the market knows that stocks are discounting that, they knew that's  coming in.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So would you sell it to markets right now?  You want to sell  it?</p><p> NELSON:  No, I'm fully invested and I'll pick and choose my points.  If  you're going to try to trade around every wiggle of this market, you're  going to find yourself missing the big runs unless you've got some kind of  tactical program to do that for you, avoid that at all cost.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  One thing to just point quickly, you talk about the overall  earnings growth for the S&amp;P500.  If you look at the major tech companies of  the ones reporting this week, Alphabet is expected to have faster growth in  that 20 percent.</p><p> But Facebook, it's only expected to have earnings per share change of not  even five percent.  Microsoft, less than the overall market, Intel less  than the overall market.  Intel also single digit grower in terms of EPS.</p><p> NELSON:  And that shows expenses going up at Facebook that's why markets  are contracting.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Which is what Niles pointed out.  David, great to see  you.</p><p> NELSON:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, David Nelson joining us there.  Coming up,  shocking new revelations on how the FBI probes into the Trump campaign  really began.  White House's Chairman of -- the House Chairman of the  Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes told me after digging deeper into the  FBI and DOJ documents, he's next.</p><p> And then TV personality and surgeon, Dr. Oz helps students who were  escaping a bus fire on a New Jersey highway, the dramatic video coming up,  back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, April 23rd, happy  Monday, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets  under pressure this morning, down, fractionally, as you can see, ahead of a  big week for earnings.  </p><p> The rising yield on the tenure treasury one issue weighing on markets  again, hovering near three percent right now, up to 2.98 percent.  Rising  yield hitting the equity markets on Friday, the major indices all closing  nearly one percent lower on the day.  And now, all are negative for the  year, 2018.  Global markets also watching earnings this morning.  It is a  big week for earnings.  </p><p> The European indices are down across the board.  It is really a fractional  move, one-third of the Dow, one-third on the S&amp;P 500, report earnings for  the first quarter, this week.  Check Asian markets, declines across the  board.  Here too, fractional moves, Hong Kong, the worst performer.  </p><p> New questions this morning over the Russia investigation, House  Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, telling me on Sunday Morning  Futures that no intelligence was used to actually start this probe.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NUNES:  We've never understood because, you know, we have -- we have access  to these finish intelligence products, and we've never seen one.  We had  never -- so, we thought, well, maybe there was one that went to a different  channel that was kept really quiet, it was secret, it was kept from the  congress and other folks.  Well, in fact, after our investigators reviewed  this, that is not what happened.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There was no intelligence used, the latest revelations from  this investigation and why it actually started.  A remarkable life  remembered, thousands gathered in Houston, this weekend, to celebrate the  life of the First Lady Barbara Bush and her grave site opens to the public,  this morning.  Among the mourners, four presidents and first ladies, this  photo from the funeral, going viral, take a look.  </p><p> Plus, there's this, Dr. Oz, coming to the rescue, he pulled over to help  passengers on a bus that caught fire, the dramatic video, coming up, and  striking a chord with investors, Chinese streaming giant, Tencent,  reportedly planning to go public, details on the giant valuation there as  well.</p><p> And then there's this, Rihanna, getting another brand under her umbrella,  the popstar, unveiling her own line of lingerie, a first look at the latest  addition to her business empire.  But first, Devin Nunes, drawing a line in  the sand, this weekend, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman shared  his newest findings on highly contested collusion between the Trump  campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.  He said this on Sunday  Morning Futures.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NUNES:  I wanted to know what intelligence did you have that actually led  to this investigation.  So what we've found, now, after the investigators  have reviewed it, is that in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  In fact, there was no intelligence.  I actually have to have  him repeat that in my interview.  Joining me right now to talk more about  it is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford.  Christopher,  it's good to see this morning.</p><p> CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you find that as extraordinary as I do?  They didn't have  any intelligence to launch an investigation into Donald Trump and whether  or not there was collusion between Trump and the Russians.  So, where did  they come up with it?  There was no intelligence that led them to believe  this.</p><p> BEDFORD:  I remember there was a full stop in the green room, before your  Sunday show when he said that, everyone looked up, holy smokes, this is a  big revelation.  Now, what it looks like from what I've been doing the  research afterwards, is this may be talking about what has been called the  second dossier because compiled by this guy, Cody Shearer, a long-time  Clinton confidant, someone who is so sketchy that in 1999 Slate Article, if  he didn't exist, the right-wing conspiracy would have to invent this guy.   He pulled together a lot of information.  </p><p> He also appears to, potentially, according to week list (INAUDIBLE)  reporting, be a source for the first dossier.  This becomes, kind of, the  self-licking ice cream -- ice cream cone thing that we've seen before,  where one guy writes a dossier to collaborate another dossier.  It turns  out to be the source for the first dossier, the author of the second  dossier.  And then our intelligence services were using media reports on  the first dossier to collaborate the first dossier.  </p><p> When it turns out that the media sources for those -- for those stories,  was the guy who wrote it himself.  It's just (INAUDIBLE) thing.  And as the  congressman pointed out, this did not come through the proper channels.   Even though some reports came to department of state, through the  Australian government, it didn't go through the proper intelligence  channels, which would be necessary to start intelligence investigation, and  that is extremely concerning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It really is because now we know that the only evidence or  backing for a FISA warrant to wire-tap, people from the Trump campaign, was  all that dossier which was unverified.  This is not the way America  operates.  This is really an incredible statement that they had no  intelligence on it.  And you wonder if, in fact, now that we know that, is  the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's work, I mean, what is this  investigation about?  Is it just to have an insurance policy so that you  try hard to delegitimize President Trump?</p><p> BEDFORD:  It's hard to keep track on what Mueller's investigation is about  because it seem, right now, to be so far away from where it started Russian  collaboration.  Now, Mueller's investigation is seeking the New York -- New  York Justice Attorney -- excuse me, New York Attorney, on confidants to the  President, violating attorney-client privilege.  </p><p> Things seem to have gone up the rails but there is no telling right now,  there's nothing that I've seen that's going to stop the Mueller  investigation.  And we are coming up on a big fight in the U.S. senate  between Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Mitch McConnell, because  Grassley wants to pass a bill that protects Mueller from even being fired  without congressional review.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BEDFORD:  I don't think there's anything that's going to stop this  investigation, but we're going to look back in the history books when we  finally get our eyes on these primary documents and we're probably going to  ask what the heck was going on?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  You know, I want to get to Hillary Clinton in a  minute, but I just want to say this, Devin Nunes, yesterday, said that  number one, they're investigating the opening of the investigation.  Now,  they know there was no intelligence used, and number two, they're  investigating how they conducted this investigation, the willingness to use  dirt that was funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee  to get a warrant to listen to calls, and then there is a third thing that  he is working on and he's investigating the State Department.  </p><p> He says that's going to come out soon and we're also going to get more  information from this fourth-coming I.G. report which is going to focus on  Jim Comey and the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.  So, I just wonder  what it is at the State Department that the Intel committee is working on.   I think they're looking at all the people who are funnelling information to  the State Department, like as you say, the individual you just mentioned,  as well as Sidney Blumenthal?  </p><p> BEDFORD:  You're right.  And, you know --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hillary Clinton, you know, prot,g,es and colleagues, friends.  </p><p> BEDFORD:  She has a lot of friends, a lot of prot,g,es and a lot of people  who were part of what they call the spy network, which is basically headed  by Sidney Blumenthal, who had an email address that was made to look like  it was a White House e-mail address, even though Barack Obama's president,  he pushed him away from being a conspiracy theorist, even though John  Podesta has said he was lost in his own web of conspiracies.  </p><p> He was constantly feeding data back in the Department of State.  And, you  know, most administration s try to make it as easy as possible for the next  administration to come in because it's very important.  The President of  the United States is the most powerful man in the world when he deals with  our foreign policy.  By all accounts, the Department of State set  tripwires, practically, booby trap the White House for the incoming  administration and that is another (INAUDIBLE) really a dark stain on the  outgoing presidency of the last administration.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll wait for more information on this investigation into the  State Department.  This is big.  Meanwhile, Hillary is out, taking aim at  the press now for coverage of her run in office for 2016.  She's spoken in  an engagement in New York, yesterday.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The mainstream  political coverage was influenced by the right-wing media ecosystem.   Relentlessly, negative news has had a levelling effect that opens the doors  to charlatans.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know what to say, Christopher, your thoughts.</p><p> BEDFORD:  Not only that, but then she said she thinks that the press has  gotten more fair since the 2016 election and it has been a course correct  where it's become more objective.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BEDFORD:  That's obviously false, and American people can see that from  their lack of trust.  We have the lead reporter on the Hillary Clinton  campaign from the New York Times, admitting that she cried at her desk  after Hillary Clinton lost.  We had people saying it was a conspiracy  theory that Hillary Clinton was in, potentially, bad health.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> BEDFORD:  Just days before she collapsed after 45 minutes in mild weather.   She was treated very well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which is why it's such a joke that the Democrats are going to  be suing the Trump campaign.  They've levelled this lawsuit, when we know  that the FBI, the Department of Justice.  We're all very firmly behind  Hillary Clinton.  We know that, obviously, from all of these texts.  So  it's just laughable, this lawsuit, when it's absolutely the opposite that,  in fact, it was the FBI and the DOJ, trying hard to push Trump down and  make sure he did it when and support Hillary.</p><p> And then we have got these reports about those I.T. guys.  Imran Awan's  father transferred data to a Pakistani senator and former Head of the  Pakistani Intelligence Agency, via a usb drive, Christopher, his son,  Imran, the former ITA to Congressman and Former DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, who made unauthorized access to in-house servers while working on  the Hill.  </p><p> Present Trump tweeted about the matter over the weekend. He wrote this,  just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist Democrats.  This can  be good news and that we will now counter for the DNC server that they  refused to give the FBI.  The Debbie Wasserman Schultz servers and  documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton e-mails.   Christopher, there you go, I mean, we know what happened when the DNC was  hacked.  </p><p> You would think that if you get hacked, you want the might and the power  and the strength of the FBI behind you, to figure out who hacked you, but  that's not what they did.  They would not give their server to the FBI.   They hired a private company to look at the server because they don't want  people to know what was on the server.</p><p> BEDFORD:  Exactly.  And by every bit of our reporting, has pointed to one  thing and that said, Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was then head of the DNC,  has something that she's very concerned about getting out.  When her laptop  was first -- what appears to be her laptop, it's got the username, RepDWS,  was taken by Imran Awan and then left in the congressional building after  he had been barred from the networks and fired by every other congressman,  except for Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  </p><p> He was left there with a copy of his I.D., with a copy of his -- with a  copy of congressional badge and with a note that said, attorney-client  privilege, which is ridiculous, by the way.  Andrew McCarthy has pointed  out that you can't just put a note on evidence that says attorney-client  privilege and had to be taken out.  It was left in a phone booth,  discovered by police at night.  And since then, Debbie Wasserman Schultz  had worked really hard, including threatening the Chief of the Capitol  Police to make sure this laptop is returned.  Now, she's saying she doesn't  care.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't understand.  He left the laptop in a phone booth with a  note?  What is he trying to be, a sarcastic?</p><p> BEDFORD:  Well, what it appears -- what it could potentially be and some  people had guessed, is that he's threatening Debbie Wasserman Schultz with  the information that's on that laptop, because first, she was fighting to  keep it away from -- away from the Capitol Police and out of the  jurisdiction.  And now, he is in court, holding that up for the last few  months.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Christopher, we'll keep following.  You've  done great reporting on this.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Christopher Bedford, the Daily Caller.  Coming up, Chinese  streaming giant's Tencent, reportedly planning an IPO.  It's going to be  one for the record bucks.  We've got the details, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The grave site for Barbara Bush will be opening  to the public this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Maria, the late first lady was buried over the weekend in a gated  plot at the George H.W. Bush presidential library.  She is now near the  grave of her daughter, Robin, who died from leukemia when she was just  three years old.  The Bush family, sharing photos from the private  ceremony, hundreds of family and friends giving a final farewell.  This day  brought together for former presidents-- the two President Bushes, as well  as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the first lady is also there, including  Melania Trump.  This photo has gone viral, we should say.  And in a tribute  to his wife's commitment to literacy, former President Bush wore a pair of  socks decorated with stacks of colorful books.  </p><p> Well, celebrity health expert Dr. Oz has captured this video of a burning  bus on the New Jersey turnpike with high school students running away.  Dr.  Oz pulled over to film the chaotic scene and made sure the students got to  safety.  A staff can be seen carrying luggage, instruments away from that  bus.  That group was coming back from a musical in New York.  Dr. Oz shared  the video on his Facebook page, saying he was thankful that everybody got  out safely.  This is not Dr. Oz's first roadside rescue.  He was in an  honorary firefighter after helping victims of a crash on the same highway  back in 2015.  </p><p> Well, the China's largest music streaming 10 Cent Music is preparing to go  public.  They're expected to be one of the biggest technology IPOs ever.   This valuation could exceed $25 billion.  10 Cent Music says it has got  about 700 million monthly active users.  This coming, of course, after  Spotify successfully went public on the New York Stock Exchange earlier  this month.  </p><p> And let's stay with music because Rihanna is planning to reduce -- release  a line of lingerie.  The singer modeling the collection herself.  She posts  in her underwear on Instagram.  Not clear when exactly her new products are  actually going to be released.  But last year, he successfully launched her  own make up line during New York Fashion Week.  Another celebrity, Maria,  getting on the I'm-going-to-make-and-sell-it-too bandwagon, and she's  probably doing pretty well.  Her makeup is done very well, we should say.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes, that's been a real success.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Expanding her empire.</p><p> MURPHY:  More power to her.  I love it.  She's got the music, she's got the  make-up, she's got lingerie.  Awesome!  I love to see that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You want to say something? </p><p> CARTER:  I just want to say how much I love the picture of the Bush family  with all of the presidents at the funeral.  I love H.W.'s socks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, they're great.  Coming up, as companies transform the way  we work, live, and play, the way the start-ups look for office face to  stuck in that time work.  That's where Squarefoot comes in.  The details on  the real estate disruptor right after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ahead winds for growing business is finding  office space.  The one company, Squarefoot, is trying to make the process a  lot easier and more transparent now.  The company recently announced it has  raised $7 million in a series eight round financing that led by Mike Murphy  and his firm Rosecliffe with us this morning.  Mike is now joining  Squarefoot's board of directors and joining us right now to talk more about  it is the CEO and co-Founder of Squarefoot, Jonathan Wasserstrum.  Good to  see you, Jonathan.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> JONATHAN WASSERSTRUM, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, SQUAREFOOT:  Thanks for having me  guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, we know about the retail market and things like truly in  the market.  Tell us how your firm differs from the competition and how you  try to provide transparency in real estate. </p><p> WASSERSTRUM:  Yes, groups like (INAUDIBLE) have done a great job on their  essential side pushing forward that transparency.  When we start the  business several years ago, we thought it was stupid that you couldn't go  online and do the same thing for office space -- that's what we set out to  do. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you do it?</p><p> WASSERSTRUM:  Well, we do a couple of things: we bring transparency to that  market that traditionally had none by allowing prospective tenants to go  online and look at space.  And we also have technology that we have built  for in-house transactions team and for the clients who we work with to  guide them to that process to make it a whole bunch more easy.</p><p> MURPHY:  So, we were first introduced to Jonathan when we are moving our  offices from midtown down to the flat iron district.  And just going online  and searching for space, we saw the Squarefoot -- that's how we originally  met them.  And we see an opportunity for them to bring to the commercial  market what companies like Compass and Red Thin have done for their  residential market.  So, now, if you want to find an office, office space,  you go right on their site, to Squarefoot.com, you look at what you want:  how many feet, how many employees, what you want to spend, and they'll pull  it up for you right on your smartphones.  So, we think this is how people  will get office space in the future.</p><p> CARTER:  it's pretty extraordinary.  We're talking about one of the things.   I was wondering what happens to commercial real estate with trends both in  and how people were working, and also, we're talking a little bit about  what that means of retail space right now in so many empty store fronts.   Can you tell me a little bit about that?  </p><p> WASSERSTRUM:  Yes.  It's a way that people are working.  There's been a  proliferation with groups like we work and all the flexible space writers.   We think it's great for the industry.  It brings a whole much more  flexibility to the market.  It means transactions can happen a lot quicker.   The traditional leases of three to five years or maybe a thin of the past?   I don't think I'd go that far.  I think it depends on the right solution  for the right company at the right time.  Retail has been a really  interesting thing, and everybody has been reading and talking about the  death of retail for a while.  It's probably a little bit overblown in my  opinion.  I think that it just takes a little bit to reset pricing  expectations now from historically where companies can make a whole bunch  of money with retail outlets, but a lot of that is moving online.  So,  we're just going to have to start adjusting sale price and expectations.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about the pushback from traditional commercial real estate  brokers and how they might be retaliating against you?  Because they're not  going to standby and just take it.  </p><p> WASSERSTRUM:  Hopefully, they won't be marching the streets too soon.  So,  we are brokers ourselves, so we work within the confines of the traditional  industry.  There's really two groups from the brokers' perspective: there's  the groups that represent landlords, and there's the groups that represent  tenants.  To those who represent the landlords, we're their bestfriend,  where a whole new conduit that they've never had for them to access people  actually looking for the space in the market.  And for the groups that  represent the tenants -- you know, the groups like I used to work at a guy  who runs real estate for us now.  I used to work at (INAUDIBLE) -- they  focus more on the big guys, right?  So, Fox needs office space, or the  average 500,000 Squarefoot user needs office space, you should work with  JLL.  Great!  I'm (INAUDIBLE).  I work with them.  But for the average  five, 10, 50, even 200 person company, you should be online looking with  us, and helping us, and allowing us to help you with your transactions.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Real quick, how is the market right?  A lot movement or no?</p><p> WASSERSTRUM:  A lot of movement, yes.  Softening a little bit at the top,  but there's always going to be people who needs space.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jonathan, great to see you.  </p><p> WASSERSTRUM:  Thank you so much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.  Good luck.  Jonathan Wasserstrum there.   Still ahead, Iran, Syria trade, all pressing issues on the agenda as  President Trump welcomes the French President Emmanuel Macron to the White  House for a three-day visit in Washington.  We are taking your live to the  White House with a preview, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Monday to you!  It is Monday, April 23rd.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Happy  Monday to you and good morning everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for  joining us.  It is Monday, April 23rd.  Your top stories right now 6:00a.m.  on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings on the driver seat on Wall Street this morning, Futures showing a  decline at the start of trading today, down about 40 points on the Dow,  down a fraction on the S&amp;P, and down eight points on the NASDAQ.  More than  a third of the Dow and the S&amp;P500 set to report their first quarter  earnings this week.  It is going to be a monster week for earnings.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alphabet, the name to watch after the close tonight, it comes amid new  concerns surrounding Google's data collection.  Dan Niles Money Manager on  Wall Street this weekend says he thinks Google will miss earnings  estimates.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets tumbling on Friday, Apple dragged the Dow lower after analysts'  reports suggested that smartphone sales could slow in the coming months.   Also, Niles said Apple will miss.  We are watching the fine market this  morning, the 10-year yield creeping closer to three percent, take a look,  up two basis points right now at 2.99 percent on the 10-year.</p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks looking like this, now we do have a lower  opening there as well and lower trading this morning.  CAC Quarante is down  a fraction, CAC Quarante in Paris down a fraction as is the DAX Index in  Germany, down a quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight right across the board, the Hang Seng the biggest loser,  down better than one-half of one percent in Hong Kong.  </p><p>And a pair of former political outsiders inside the Oval Office, President  Trump welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House today  from trade to national security.  We're taking a look at what's on the  agenda for the two world leaders ahead of the state dinner tomorrow night.</p><p>Investigating the investigation, shocking new revelations on the start of  the FBI probe into the Trump campaign.  House Intelligence Chairman Devin  Nunes telling me yesterday about his findings, he explained on Sunday  Morning Futures.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN:  We've long wanted to  know what intelligence did you have that actually led to this  investigation.  So what we found now after the investigators have reviewed  it is that in fact there was no intelligence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No intelligence to launch that investigation.  The very latest  on the investigation coming up.  Plus, another high note for the music  industry, Chinese streaming giant Tencent reportedly planning to go public  where the company is expected to list and that mammoth evaluation.</p><p>Plus, revving up their resume, Harley-Davidson offering an internship of a  lifetime, how college students can get paid to ride coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to talk  about it, FOX BUsines Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO, Managing  Partner, Mike Murphy along with Pollster and the President of Maslansky and  Partners, Lee Carter.  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS:  Good morning.  Great to be  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Happy Monday everybody.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning Maria.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Incredible interview with Devin Nunes, the  Congressman, Head of the House Intelligence Committee.  So I can't wait to  hear that again this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's just a -- it's extraordinary.  We've talked about  how the same FBI agents were overseeing an investigation into Trump and an  investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail usage.  </p><p>And now we find out that with all of the evidence on the Hillary Clinton  side, they didn't have any official intelligence to launch this  investigation.  It sounds like Dagen it was all about the dossier.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All about the dossier.  And that it -- again, this is a thread  that runs through.  The very highest leadership within the FBI and it's  incredible that -- I mean, it really is Devin Nunes who's taking this on to  uncover why a presidential campaign was being investigated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  And he's getting trashed for it at every level.   And yet he's the Chairman of the Intel Committee and has looked at the raw  data and has come up with this, that there was no intelligence used.  Quite  extraordinary, we're going to talk about that this morning and what that  means.</p><p>Joining the conversation, we've got House Majority Leader, California  Congressman Kevin McCarthy in the studio this morning.  White House  Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah is here.  FOX News Senior  Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano along with former U.S. Attorney  and Avenue Strategies Partner, Budd Cummings. </p><p>Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a lot on the table this morning to  talk about.  And, of course, we are also looking at earnings.  Investors  are weighing for Google's parent company Alphabet to report earnings after  the close tonight as the technology giant gears up to report the results  and tell us what the last three months look like.  Analysts expecting the  company to post adjusted earnings of $9.28 a share on revenue of $3.29  billion.  Alphabet is kicking off big techs earnings splits on Wall Street  this week.  We also have Amazon coming out on Thursday.  Mike Murphy, your  thoughts?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think when you see a move in big tech like you saw Apple on  Friday dropped seven points, I think in this market it's a buying  opportunity.  So, Google's going to -- Alphabet's going to come out with  earnings and say, \"We're going to hear from Amazon\" all the big tech  companies, they're all going to post great numbers.</p><p>How the stock reacts, I think the way to play it is if there's a pullback,  it's a buying opportunity because we have underlying strength in the  market, you have underlying strength in these companies.  So any weakness,  I'd be a buyer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe but Dan Niles from Alpha One who's really very thoughtful  on the tech sector, he was my guest on the Wall Street program this weekend  and he said Apple's going to miss and Amazon -- and Google parent, Alphabet  is going to miss.  </p><p>Now, if you had that big sharp decline on Apple on Friday, does the market  -- is the market telling you get ready for a miss and all are we going to  see an even bigger decline if the company comes out and reports a miss?</p><p>MURPHY:  You may.  But remember, Apple under most recent pull off came all  the way down to $151 and right after that, it rallied all the way back up  to $170.  So here, where it's trading in the mid $160s, it's setting up  after Friday's move, it -- I think you're pricing a miss into the stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>MURPHY:  So if there's any more weakness, I'd be a buyer.  But if Apple  misses by a few millions, iPhone Xs in the market, I think that sets up as  a buying opportunity because they have so many other levers that they can  pull.  I think that people are going to be buying iPhones in the third  quarter, in the fourth quarter, so any weakness is a buying.</p><p>CARTER:  Do you think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You should drop the X.  People don't like the X and they've got  expectations that it's going to not meet demand numbers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a flop.  According to some, if you talk to -- I'm not doing  channel checks but I go and -- yes, I've talked to a lot of people who work  in the data -- the cellphone company in the stores, not for Apple but like  -- I won't use the name of the company because I don't want to get the  employees in trouble.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they would know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they tell me if I go in and say, \"Do you like the X?\"   They're like, \"No, don't buy it.  It really is awful.\"  They were like, \"If  you tried an Android phone\" so that would certainly benefit Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, people are unhappy with it.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I haven't had the easiest, same as mine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a $1,000, that's a huge outlay.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, expensive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  At a time when Americans really are keeping the purse strings  pretty tight in terms of their spending.</p><p>MURPHY:  One thing on that, if you're going to buy an X, it's 24 months and  they charge $50.00 a month automatically.  So they're giving you an  interest for a loan to finance the purchase of the phone.  So I think  people like that.  And I think no matter what, people are going to buy the  next Apple phone, so I think that's the -- </p><p>CARTER:  If it was selling off the shelf by itself though they wouldn't  have to do that, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MURPHY:  Well, I think you have to define off the shelf -- well no, I think  that's part of their plan.  So number one, off the shelves, they may miss  numbers at top line expectations but they're still selling a ton of iPhone  Xs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what Dan Niles said about this is that they --  he said him and his whole family needed new batteries.  And so they went  and changed the battery in the phone and it was $29.00 and they were fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said, \"I don't need to buy a new phone,\" he said.  And  so I'm looking at my family as a proxy and saying, \"Well all we did was buy  a $29.00 battery and we were good to go and we didn't need the next phone.\"   So that's what he's worried about, the next phone and, of course, the  issues around the X which are real.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I also am curious with regulation if fears are going to play  into stock prices after earnings this week because I know so many people  are talking about, is tech going to be the next area that's going to be  highly regulated like banks were before with all of the data concerns, with  everything that's with Facebook.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That goes right to what Maria mentioned at the top of the show  about the -- this Wall Street Journal story on the amount of information  that Google collects on you, (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the article is called, \"Who has more of your data?  Your  personal data than Facebook?  Try Google.\"  The Journal reporting that  Google's android devices allowed the harvesting of data from billions of  active users without warning.</p><p>What about that?  I mean, I'm talking eight years ago I did a documentary  on Google and that was about the fact that they save all your searches for  two years and then they anonymize the math to two years but why do they say  for the two years anyway?</p><p>MURPHY:  I guess to monetize them, they want to figure out how they can --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- get advertising dollars in by using a data.  But I think where  we are today in 2018, if you're on the internet, if you're on your smart  phone, if you're searching on a computer, if you're searching anywhere,  there are ways for whether it's Google or Apple or Facebook, somebody can  track what you're doing.</p><p>Now, if you don't like that, I guess there are certain ways to try to  backdoor it or opt out of certain things.  But, I think that's just a fact  of life, people are going to know what was --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But what did Sheryl Sandberg say, Dagen?  She said, \"Oh,  we don't have a product to opt out at the high levels, that's a paid  product.\"  In other words, I have to pay them just to secure my data that  is not shared.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's an idea that should -- that actually Walt Mossberg came  up with.  Like, he suggested that Facebook offer a paid service and -- so  they wouldn't share of your data.  </p><p>But this Wall Street Journal article goes into the fact that Google, if  you're logged into Google, you can opt out of how they use your private  information.  But it goes well beyond that because Google Analytics is used  on about 50 million sites and Google Analytics tracks you whether you're  logged in or not, so that's number one.  But Google uses among other  things, you're browsing in search history apps, you've installed  demographics like age and gender from its own analytics and other sources  where -- and other sources like where we've shopped in the real world.</p><p>It's incredible Google's reach and I think that the point of this article  in the Wall Street Journal is Mark Zuckerberg gets called in front of  Congress, he -- and gets grilled about regulation, same thing's going to  happen to Alphabet and Google and Google out to be a little bit more  worried than even Facebook --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what does that mean?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- about regulation, what are they going to do?  Are -- is there  going to be a broad way you can prevent Google from collecting your  information whether you're -- even if you aren't logged into the Google  service.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with new rules, how much does that impact the earnings and  does that change the (INAUDIBLE) on the stock?</p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  Well that's why these companies have been so profitable is  that they can sell your data to advertisers and advertisers know exactly  who you are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we didn't realize how much they were selling.</p><p>MURPHY:  I guess maybe people didn't know exactly how much they were  selling but I think when you went on to the site, I think you knew.  When  you logged in to your computer and looked Mexican vacations, the next time  you log in, there are six sites popping up that are focused on Mexican  resorts or Mexican vacations.  I mean, that's been going on for years from  these companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  But I think that people knew that sort of thing but I don't think  they understood how that translated to so many other -- other things.  And  that the data might used not for what they want it to be used for.</p><p>So if you Google Mexican vacations or getting Mexican vacations, that makes  sense to people.  But when they have -- you have a whole profile online  that says this is who they think you are, your age and that the kinds of  ads are going to serve up based on that, I think a lot Americans are  confused by that and quite frankly are angry that that's happened because  they don't feel it's been transparent to them at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, when you're in a certain place in the world and  all of a sudden you get an ad for that local store that's on the block that  you were in, that's a little spooky -- </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- I'm sorry.  I'm going to switch gears to the White House,  President Trump welcoming French Leader Emmanuel Macron today to Washington  for a three-day visit.  The two are expected to talk about trade ahead of  his trip.  The French president issued a warning to the United States,  listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE:  You cannot make war with your ally.   It's too complicated.  If you make war against everybody, you'll make trade  war against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war (INAUDIBLE)  come on, it's not -- it doesn't work.  You need ally, we are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yet he still agrees with many of President Trump's  policies, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This goes back to something I've talked about repeatedly is that  our allies in terms of trade and on the world stage, we're kind of  blindsided by the steel and aluminum tariffs.  </p><p>If you want -- if you really want to take on China, if China is your  biggest problem globally in terms of unfair trade practices, then you lock  arms with Europe, with Japan and you present a united front.  When you kind  of throw a steel and aluminum tariff in the face of your allies and say,  \"Maybe we'll exempt you, maybe we won't.\"  And there have been many  exemptions it turned out.</p><p>But, again, it was handled so haphazardly and so ham-handedly right out of  the gate with the holding up the -- you got the Commerce Secretary holding  up cans of soup and lecturing the American people about your -- the cost of  this can of soup isn't going on.  It shows the fundamental misunderstanding  of how people will react to inflation and, again, inflation by fiat out of  the White House but also it was a slap on the face to our allies if they  weren't consulted about it in the first place.  They're trying to manage it  now but, again, they're still -- he still got his hair up so to speak.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Messaging issues I guess.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come back, no official  intelligence was used to start the Russia investigation, the so-called  collusion.  The jaw-dropping revelation from House Intel Committee Chairman  Devin Nunes after digging deeper into FBI and DOJ documents, the new  questions in the case, that's right after this break.</p><p>And then Tencent, China's largest music streaming company could launch one  of the biggest technology IPOs ever with a monster valuation.  The  staggering number right ahead, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well a massive manhunt is underway this morning  for the man suspected of killing four people at a Waffle House outside of  Nashville.  Cheryl Caosne on headlines on that now, over to you Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes Maria, good morning to you.  Police say that 29-year-old  Travis Reinking is armed and dangerous.  National public schools are now in  lockdown mode.  We learned yesterday that he was arrested in July of 2017  for being in a restricted area near the White House.</p><p>More than a year before that, Reinking claimed singer Taylor Swift was  stalking him.  Customer James Shaw fearing for his life, took a dangerous  chance to pounce on the shooter to wrestle at least the gun away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES SHAW, JR., WAFFLE HOUSE HERO:  At the time that he was either  reloading or the gun jammed, or whatever happened, is when I ran through  the swivel door, I hit him with the swivel door.  I managed to get him with  one hand on the gun and then I grabbed it from him and I threw it over the  countertop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well the four people who were killed have been identified.   Authority say they are Taurean Sanderlin, Joe Perez, Akilah Dasilva, and  DeEbony Groves.  Sanderlin was an employee at that Waffle House.</p><p>Well, more cancellations today for Southwest Airlines, Southwest has  cancelled at least 100 scheduled flights today and yesterday they cancelled  about 40 to inspect the planes' engines.  This comes after last week's  accident in Pennsylvania that killed one woman on board.  A fan blade broke  off ripping a hole to the plane's wing and then it went into the window on  Friday.  Regulators have ordered emergency inspections on 700 of the same  type of engine that was involved in that accident.  Shares of Southwest  Airlines were down about 17 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, it could be the summer of the hog for some college students.  Harley- Davidson planning to pick eight lucky summer interns and teach them how to  ride bikes.  Then they're going to attend a motorcycle event across the  country, document it all for social media.  It's a 12-week paid internship  open to juniors and seniors who are interested (INAUDIBLE) in social media,  communications, public relations, or marketing.  Taking a look at shares of  Harley-Davidson down about 20 percent so far this year.  I got a kick out  of the story Maria because my neighbor who's 66 yesterday said to me, \"I  want a new Harley\" and I thought, \"Exactly.  And you're 66-years-old.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  What a gig.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty cool.  Get the interns to drive them, ride the bike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A well -- this is a well-known problem that Harley-Davidson's  been having.  What Cheryl mentioned as -- that young people are not buying  motorcycles and not riding motorcycles in this country.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They want to get the young people on the motorcycle so they can  collect data.  See if the big -- it's a theme that they want the data on --</p><p>CARTER:  It's a big conspiracy.</p><p>MURPHY:  That they need data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh God.  </p><p>CARTER: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We get an enormous shout out to James Shaw, wow, what a hero.   Actually in the Waffle House, sees the gunman come in, just moved and acts.   Jumps -- pushes the door into him, jumps on him, and removes the guy's gun.   There he is, James Shaw just a patron at the Waffle House becomes the hero  of the day.</p><p>When they found all those magazines and the other bullets in the shooter's  jacket, you know that he was there for some serious killing and James Shaw  stopped it.  </p><p>MURPHY:  It's great to see a young man being celebrated, to see the FBI  around him, clapping for him.  I mean, we - like you said a true hero and  we should talk about it even more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  I think he's just terrific.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We should keep talking about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every week, let's just talk about him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) it out, you are such hero.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And to have that kind of courage, wrestle the gun out of  his hands.  All right, we'll take a break.  When we come back, Hillary  Clinton is now blaming charlatans and the media for her 2016 election loss.   Now it's the media's fault.  Her stunning new comments coming up.</p><p>And then we are watching global currency this morning as the 10-year  Treasury hits a high of -- a four-year high right under three percent.  How  this may impact this week's European Central Bank meeting as well.  Back in  a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures edging lower this morning, investors are waiting on  more earnings.  We are expecting a lower opening for the Dow down 28,  NASDAQ and S&amp;P down just a fraction.  We're also watching the bond market,  the yields on the 10-year hitting 2.99 percent, that is the highest level  since January 2014.</p><p>Joining us right now is Belpointe Chief Strategist, David Nelson.  David,  good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What worries you more, the move towards three percent or the  earnings story?</p><p>NELSON:  The earning story only in the sense that the expectations were  just so high coming into this.  Just before this earning started, J.P.  Morgan was one of the first to report.  </p><p>I looked at an estimate chart and they had literally gone parabolic going  into the earnings.  So expectations are high and so far what I've seen, the  earnings have been fine.  The bigger problem in earning season this time  around is technology.  And I saw your interview with Dan Niles and hit on a  couple of important points.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's do that right now.  Let's see what Dan Niles said  about technology.  He had a real problem with Apple and Google parent  Alphabet.  Here's Dan Niles this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You also think Apple is going to have a miss when it reports.</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHA ONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  Yes, I do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Apple reports in May, watch for that.  Dan thinks they're  going to miss on the numbers.  Google parent Alphabet, you also think may  miss.  </p><p>NILES:  Yes.  I think that one though I like quite a bit over the longer  term.  I think the problem with Google is the exact opposite as with  Facebook.  With Facebook, they guided expenses up 45 to 60 percent this  year before this data breach stuff ever happened.</p><p>When you look at Google, they have expenses model for some reason Wall  Street does, Google doesn't guide.  The Wall Street has expenses modeled to  the -- go up by the slowest pace in the last five years.  And I think the  expenses are actually going to be a bit higher.  I think the revenues will  be fine but I think you're going to have a problem on the margin front  which is why I think the EPS is going to have an issue.  But that's one of  those stocks that after that I think is in really good shape going forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess the question becomes if Apple and Google's parent  Alphabet missed, does that create a reason to sell and sort of lead this  market down and earnings worried?</p><p>NELSON:  It's difficult to have a bull market without tech in the lead.   It's just an item in the script.  This is a missed product cycle for Apple.   I thought the iPhone X was a disappointment.  I have an iPhone7, I so no  need to switch.</p><p>The bigger issue for technology isn't even Apple, it's really Washington.   Make no mistake, what you saw with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, that  was the earth moving under our feet.  Regulation is coming to technology  and that means change business models. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is inviting it, and as that changed, business models take  place and you give consumers the ability to opt out of some or all part of  their data.  Then that data is just simply worthless and that translates to  other companies as well, Google and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's what we've been saying earlier Mike.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  So David, when -- so I agree, you don't want to fight  Washington.  When you're owning a company, you don't want them like  Facebook fighting Washington.  But this could lead -- I see this is a  potential opportunity for the Facebooks and Alphabets and Apples of the  World to start monetizing some of their data, to actually charge consumers  for the data because it's not as if you're going to have a mass equities  away from Google.</p><p>NELSON:  They're going to charge consumers for their data, how about  consumers charging Facebook to use the data, that's another model that  could go out there.  </p><p>MURPHY:  How would -- I don't know how they would put that.</p><p>NELSON:  I don't know, I --</p><p>MURPHY:  You're not going to charge Facebook for something but Facebook  could say, \"Hey, $0.99 per year, $0.99 per quarter, per month.\"</p><p>NELSON:  You mean to not opt in and not have your data use.</p><p>MURPHY:  Or to have a certain type of your data use, let's have a certain  type.  I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's so backwards to me that I'm going to pay them to protect  my privacy.</p><p>NELSON:  I'm not going to do that.</p><p>MURPHY:  You're really paying them to use their service, right?  They've  been giving it to you for free for years.  You've been on it, you've been  using it all the time --</p><p>NELSON:  I think it's just the opposite honestly.  I feel that they're --</p><p>MURPHY:  That you're going to charge Facebook.</p><p>NELSON:  -- extracting a lot of data from me, they're making a lot of money  off of it.  And I think the only other way around for them is if I opt out  of my data then you can charge me to be on that site and pay for a model.   That's something that Sheryl Sanderberg has said that she doesn't want to  do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of the biggest issues is not necessarily Washington but  investors stepping back and saying, \"Have Google and Facebook squeezed as  much information out of us as they possibly can and that they've reached a  ceiling in terms of their ad revenue\" or the revenue that they can -- how  fast they can grow their revenue.</p><p>Google has access to two billion active android mobile devices and that's  where a lot of the data extraction comes from and that's where a lot of the  data that's later used improperly comes from, this is according to one of  these -- a professor quoted in this Wall Street Journal article but I think  in terms of some of these ad companies and even though Apple's had a bad  product cycle with the iPhone X, Apple's in a better position privacy-wise  which Tim Cook has been pretty big in Facebook or Google at this point in  terms of protecting your --</p><p>NELSON:  They're also becoming less iPhone depend at this point and they're  monetizing a lot of their other services, so that's good news for them.   It's a miss product cycle, that's cyclical, we'll get over that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So real quick, the estimates called for profit growth in the  S&amp;P500 of 19 percent for the first quarter.  Are you saying that's too  high?</p><p>NELSON:  I think they -- and we'll probably hit that, maybe even beat that  but the market knows that stocks are discounting that, they knew that's  coming in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So would you sell it to markets right now?  You want to sell  it?</p><p>NELSON:  No, I'm fully invested and I'll pick and choose my points.  If  you're going to try to trade around every wiggle of this market, you're  going to find yourself missing the big runs unless you've got some kind of  tactical program to do that for you, avoid that at all cost.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing to just point quickly, you talk about the overall  earnings growth for the S&amp;P500.  If you look at the major tech companies of  the ones reporting this week, Alphabet is expected to have faster growth in  that 20 percent.</p><p>But Facebook, it's only expected to have earnings per share change of not  even five percent.  Microsoft, less than the overall market, Intel less  than the overall market.  Intel also single digit grower in terms of EPS.</p><p>NELSON:  And that shows expenses going up at Facebook that's why markets  are contracting.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Which is what Niles pointed out.  David, great to see  you.</p><p>NELSON:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, David Nelson joining us there.  Coming up,  shocking new revelations on how the FBI probes into the Trump campaign  really began.  White House's Chairman of -- the House Chairman of the  Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes told me after digging deeper into the  FBI and DOJ documents, he's next.</p><p>And then TV personality and surgeon, Dr. Oz helps students who were  escaping a bus fire on a New Jersey highway, the dramatic video coming up,  back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, April 23rd, happy  Monday, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets  under pressure this morning, down, fractionally, as you can see, ahead of a  big week for earnings.  </p><p>The rising yield on the tenure treasury one issue weighing on markets  again, hovering near three percent right now, up to 2.98 percent.  Rising  yield hitting the equity markets on Friday, the major indices all closing  nearly one percent lower on the day.  And now, all are negative for the  year, 2018.  Global markets also watching earnings this morning.  It is a  big week for earnings.  </p><p>The European indices are down across the board.  It is really a fractional  move, one-third of the Dow, one-third on the S&amp;P 500, report earnings for  the first quarter, this week.  Check Asian markets, declines across the  board.  Here too, fractional moves, Hong Kong, the worst performer.  </p><p>New questions this morning over the Russia investigation, House  Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, telling me on Sunday Morning  Futures that no intelligence was used to actually start this probe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  We've never understood because, you know, we have -- we have access  to these finish intelligence products, and we've never seen one.  We had  never -- so, we thought, well, maybe there was one that went to a different  channel that was kept really quiet, it was secret, it was kept from the  congress and other folks.  Well, in fact, after our investigators reviewed  this, that is not what happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was no intelligence used, the latest revelations from  this investigation and why it actually started.  A remarkable life  remembered, thousands gathered in Houston, this weekend, to celebrate the  life of the First Lady Barbara Bush and her grave site opens to the public,  this morning.  Among the mourners, four presidents and first ladies, this  photo from the funeral, going viral, take a look.  </p><p>Plus, there's this, Dr. Oz, coming to the rescue, he pulled over to help  passengers on a bus that caught fire, the dramatic video, coming up, and  striking a chord with investors, Chinese streaming giant, Tencent,  reportedly planning to go public, details on the giant valuation there as  well.</p><p>And then there's this, Rihanna, getting another brand under her umbrella,  the popstar, unveiling her own line of lingerie, a first look at the latest  addition to her business empire.  But first, Devin Nunes, drawing a line in  the sand, this weekend, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman shared  his newest findings on highly contested collusion between the Trump  campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.  He said this on Sunday  Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  I wanted to know what intelligence did you have that actually led  to this investigation.  So what we've found, now, after the investigators  have reviewed it, is that in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In fact, there was no intelligence.  I actually have to have  him repeat that in my interview.  Joining me right now to talk more about  it is the Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford.  Christopher,  it's good to see this morning.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you find that as extraordinary as I do?  They didn't have  any intelligence to launch an investigation into Donald Trump and whether  or not there was collusion between Trump and the Russians.  So, where did  they come up with it?  There was no intelligence that led them to believe  this.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I remember there was a full stop in the green room, before your  Sunday show when he said that, everyone looked up, holy smokes, this is a  big revelation.  Now, what it looks like from what I've been doing the  research afterwards, is this may be talking about what has been called the  second dossier because compiled by this guy, Cody Shearer, a long-time  Clinton confidant, someone who is so sketchy that in 1999 Slate Article, if  he didn't exist, the right-wing conspiracy would have to invent this guy.   He pulled together a lot of information.  </p><p>He also appears to, potentially, according to week list (INAUDIBLE)  reporting, be a source for the first dossier.  This becomes, kind of, the  self-licking ice cream -- ice cream cone thing that we've seen before,  where one guy writes a dossier to collaborate another dossier.  It turns  out to be the source for the first dossier, the author of the second  dossier.  And then our intelligence services were using media reports on  the first dossier to collaborate the first dossier.  </p><p>When it turns out that the media sources for those -- for those stories,  was the guy who wrote it himself.  It's just (INAUDIBLE) thing.  And as the  congressman pointed out, this did not come through the proper channels.   Even though some reports came to department of state, through the  Australian government, it didn't go through the proper intelligence  channels, which would be necessary to start intelligence investigation, and  that is extremely concerning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is because now we know that the only evidence or  backing for a FISA warrant to wire-tap, people from the Trump campaign, was  all that dossier which was unverified.  This is not the way America  operates.  This is really an incredible statement that they had no  intelligence on it.  And you wonder if, in fact, now that we know that, is  the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's work, I mean, what is this  investigation about?  Is it just to have an insurance policy so that you  try hard to delegitimize President Trump?</p><p>BEDFORD:  It's hard to keep track on what Mueller's investigation is about  because it seem, right now, to be so far away from where it started Russian  collaboration.  Now, Mueller's investigation is seeking the New York -- New  York Justice Attorney -- excuse me, New York Attorney, on confidants to the  President, violating attorney-client privilege.  </p><p>Things seem to have gone up the rails but there is no telling right now,  there's nothing that I've seen that's going to stop the Mueller  investigation.  And we are coming up on a big fight in the U.S. senate  between Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Mitch McConnell, because  Grassley wants to pass a bill that protects Mueller from even being fired  without congressional review.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I don't think there's anything that's going to stop this  investigation, but we're going to look back in the history books when we  finally get our eyes on these primary documents and we're probably going to  ask what the heck was going on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  You know, I want to get to Hillary Clinton in a  minute, but I just want to say this, Devin Nunes, yesterday, said that  number one, they're investigating the opening of the investigation.  Now,  they know there was no intelligence used, and number two, they're  investigating how they conducted this investigation, the willingness to use  dirt that was funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee  to get a warrant to listen to calls, and then there is a third thing that  he is working on and he's investigating the State Department.  </p><p>He says that's going to come out soon and we're also going to get more  information from this fourth-coming I.G. report which is going to focus on  Jim Comey and the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.  So, I just wonder  what it is at the State Department that the Intel committee is working on.   I think they're looking at all the people who are funnelling information to  the State Department, like as you say, the individual you just mentioned,  as well as Sidney Blumenthal?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  You're right.  And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hillary Clinton, you know, prot,g,es and colleagues, friends.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  She has a lot of friends, a lot of prot,g,es and a lot of people  who were part of what they call the spy network, which is basically headed  by Sidney Blumenthal, who had an email address that was made to look like  it was a White House e-mail address, even though Barack Obama's president,  he pushed him away from being a conspiracy theorist, even though John  Podesta has said he was lost in his own web of conspiracies.  </p><p>He was constantly feeding data back in the Department of State.  And, you  know, most administration s try to make it as easy as possible for the next  administration to come in because it's very important.  The President of  the United States is the most powerful man in the world when he deals with  our foreign policy.  By all accounts, the Department of State set  tripwires, practically, booby trap the White House for the incoming  administration and that is another (INAUDIBLE) really a dark stain on the  outgoing presidency of the last administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll wait for more information on this investigation into the  State Department.  This is big.  Meanwhile, Hillary is out, taking aim at  the press now for coverage of her run in office for 2016.  She's spoken in  an engagement in New York, yesterday.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The mainstream  political coverage was influenced by the right-wing media ecosystem.   Relentlessly, negative news has had a levelling effect that opens the doors  to charlatans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know what to say, Christopher, your thoughts.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Not only that, but then she said she thinks that the press has  gotten more fair since the 2016 election and it has been a course correct  where it's become more objective.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  That's obviously false, and American people can see that from  their lack of trust.  We have the lead reporter on the Hillary Clinton  campaign from the New York Times, admitting that she cried at her desk  after Hillary Clinton lost.  We had people saying it was a conspiracy  theory that Hillary Clinton was in, potentially, bad health.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Just days before she collapsed after 45 minutes in mild weather.   She was treated very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why it's such a joke that the Democrats are going to  be suing the Trump campaign.  They've levelled this lawsuit, when we know  that the FBI, the Department of Justice.  We're all very firmly behind  Hillary Clinton.  We know that, obviously, from all of these texts.  So  it's just laughable, this lawsuit, when it's absolutely the opposite that,  in fact, it was the FBI and the DOJ, trying hard to push Trump down and  make sure he did it when and support Hillary.</p><p>And then we have got these reports about those I.T. guys.  Imran Awan's  father transferred data to a Pakistani senator and former Head of the  Pakistani Intelligence Agency, via a usb drive, Christopher, his son,  Imran, the former ITA to Congressman and Former DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, who made unauthorized access to in-house servers while working on  the Hill.  </p><p>Present Trump tweeted about the matter over the weekend. He wrote this,  just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist Democrats.  This can  be good news and that we will now counter for the DNC server that they  refused to give the FBI.  The Debbie Wasserman Schultz servers and  documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton e-mails.   Christopher, there you go, I mean, we know what happened when the DNC was  hacked.  </p><p>You would think that if you get hacked, you want the might and the power  and the strength of the FBI behind you, to figure out who hacked you, but  that's not what they did.  They would not give their server to the FBI.   They hired a private company to look at the server because they don't want  people to know what was on the server.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Exactly.  And by every bit of our reporting, has pointed to one  thing and that said, Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was then head of the DNC,  has something that she's very concerned about getting out.  When her laptop  was first -- what appears to be her laptop, it's got the username, RepDWS,  was taken by Imran Awan and then left in the congressional building after  he had been barred from the networks and fired by every other congressman,  except for Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  </p><p>He was left there with a copy of his I.D., with a copy of his -- with a  copy of congressional badge and with a note that said, attorney-client  privilege, which is ridiculous, by the way.  Andrew McCarthy has pointed  out that you can't just put a note on evidence that says attorney-client  privilege and had to be taken out.  It was left in a phone booth,  discovered by police at night.  And since then, Debbie Wasserman Schultz  had worked really hard, including threatening the Chief of the Capitol  Police to make sure this laptop is returned.  Now, she's saying she doesn't  care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't understand.  He left the laptop in a phone booth with a  note?  What is he trying to be, a sarcastic?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Well, what it appears -- what it could potentially be and some  people had guessed, is that he's threatening Debbie Wasserman Schultz with  the information that's on that laptop, because first, she was fighting to  keep it away from -- away from the Capitol Police and out of the  jurisdiction.  And now, he is in court, holding that up for the last few  months.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Christopher, we'll keep following.  You've  done great reporting on this.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Christopher Bedford, the Daily Caller.  Coming up, Chinese  streaming giant's Tencent, reportedly planning an IPO.  It's going to be  one for the record bucks.  We've got the details, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The grave site for Barbara Bush will be opening  to the public this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Maria, the late first lady was buried over the weekend in a gated  plot at the George H.W. Bush presidential library.  She is now near the  grave of her daughter, Robin, who died from leukemia when she was just  three years old.  The Bush family, sharing photos from the private  ceremony, hundreds of family and friends giving a final farewell.  This day  brought together for former presidents-- the two President Bushes, as well  as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the first lady is also there, including  Melania Trump.  This photo has gone viral, we should say.  And in a tribute  to his wife's commitment to literacy, former President Bush wore a pair of  socks decorated with stacks of colorful books.  </p><p>Well, celebrity health expert Dr. Oz has captured this video of a burning  bus on the New Jersey turnpike with high school students running away.  Dr.  Oz pulled over to film the chaotic scene and made sure the students got to  safety.  A staff can be seen carrying luggage, instruments away from that  bus.  That group was coming back from a musical in New York.  Dr. Oz shared  the video on his Facebook page, saying he was thankful that everybody got  out safely.  This is not Dr. Oz's first roadside rescue.

They're expected to be one of the biggest technology IPOs ever.   This valuation could exceed $25 billion.  10 Cent Music says it has got  about 700 million monthly active users.  This coming, of course, after  Spotify successfully went public on the New York Stock Exchange earlier  this month.  </p><p>And let's stay with music because Rihanna is planning to reduce -- release  a line of lingerie.  The singer modeling the collection herself.  She posts  in her underwear on Instagram.  Not clear when exactly her new products are  actually going to be released.  But last year, he successfully launched her  own make up line during New York Fashion Week.  Another celebrity, Maria,  getting on the I'm-going-to-make-and-sell-it-too bandwagon, and she's  probably doing pretty well.  Her makeup is done very well, we should say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes, that's been a real success.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Expanding her empire.</p><p>MURPHY:  More power to her.  I love it.  She's got the music, she's got the  make-up, she's got lingerie.  Awesome!  I love to see that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to say something? </p><p>CARTER:  I just want to say how much I love the picture of the Bush family  with all of the presidents at the funeral.  I love H.W.'s socks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they're great.  Coming up, as companies transform the way  we work, live, and play, the way the start-ups look for office face to  stuck in that time work.  That's where Squarefoot comes in.  The details on  the real estate disruptor right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Ahead winds for growing business is finding  office space.  The one company, Squarefoot, is trying to make the process a  lot easier and more transparent now.  The company recently announced it has  raised $7 million in a series eight round financing that led by Mike Murphy  and his firm Rosecliffe with us this morning.  Mike is now joining  Squarefoot's board of directors and joining us right now to talk more about  it is the CEO and co-Founder of Squarefoot, Jonathan Wasserstrum.  Good to  see you, Jonathan.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>JONATHAN WASSERSTRUM, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, SQUAREFOOT:  Thanks for having me  guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we know about the retail market and things like truly in  the market.  Tell us how your firm differs from the competition and how you  try to provide transparency in real estate. </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Yes, groups like (INAUDIBLE) have done a great job on their  essential side pushing forward that transparency.  When we start the  business several years ago, we thought it was stupid that you couldn't go  online and do the same thing for office space -- that's what we set out to  do. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do it?</p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Well, we do a couple of things: we bring transparency to that  market that traditionally had none by allowing prospective tenants to go  online and look at space.  And we also have technology that we have built  for in-house transactions team and for the clients who we work with to  guide them to that process to make it a whole bunch more easy.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, we were first introduced to Jonathan when we are moving our  offices from midtown down to the flat iron district.  And just going online  and searching for space, we saw the Squarefoot -- that's how we originally  met them.  And we see an opportunity for them to bring to the commercial  market what companies like Compass and Red Thin have done for their  residential market.  So, now, if you want to find an office, office space,  you go right on their site, to Squarefoot.com, you look at what you want:  how many feet, how many employees, what you want to spend, and they'll pull  it up for you right on your smartphones.  So, we think this is how people  will get office space in the future.</p><p>CARTER:  it's pretty extraordinary.  We're talking about one of the things.   I was wondering what happens to commercial real estate with trends both in  and how people were working, and also, we're talking a little bit about  what that means of retail space right now in so many empty store fronts.   Can you tell me a little bit about that?  </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Yes.  It's a way that people are working.  There's been a  proliferation with groups like we work and all the flexible space writers.   We think it's great for the industry.  It brings a whole much more  flexibility to the market.  It means transactions can happen a lot quicker.   The traditional leases of three to five years or maybe a thin of the past?   I don't think I'd go that far.  I think it depends on the right solution  for the right company at the right time.  Retail has been a really  interesting thing, and everybody has been reading and talking about the  death of retail for a while.  It's probably a little bit overblown in my  opinion.  I think that it just takes a little bit to reset pricing  expectations now from historically where companies can make a whole bunch  of money with retail outlets, but a lot of that is moving online.  So,  we're just going to have to start adjusting sale price and expectations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the pushback from traditional commercial real estate  brokers and how they might be retaliating against you?  Because they're not  going to standby and just take it.  </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Hopefully, they won't be marching the streets too soon.  So,  we are brokers ourselves, so we work within the confines of the traditional  industry.  There's really two groups from the brokers' perspective: there's  the groups that represent landlords, and there's the groups that represent  tenants.  To those who represent the landlords, we're their bestfriend,  where a whole new conduit that they've never had for them to access people  actually looking for the space in the market.  And for the groups that  represent the tenants -- you know, the groups like I used to work at a guy  who runs real estate for us now.  I used to work at (INAUDIBLE) -- they  focus more on the big guys, right?  So, Fox needs office space, or the  average 500,000 Squarefoot user needs office space, you should work with  JLL.  Great!  I'm (INAUDIBLE).  I work with them.  But for the average  five, 10, 50, even 200 person company, you should be online looking with  us, and helping us, and allowing us to help you with your transactions.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, how is the market right?  A lot movement or no?</p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  A lot of movement, yes.  Softening a little bit at the top,  but there's always going to be people who needs space.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jonathan, great to see you.  </p><p>WASSERSTRUM:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.  Good luck.  Jonathan Wasserstrum there.   Still ahead, Iran, Syria trade, all pressing issues on the agenda as  President Trump welcomes the French President Emmanuel Macron to the White  House for a three-day visit in Washington.  We are taking your live to the  White House with a preview, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Monday to you!  It is Monday, April 23rd.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

But the comments from Mr. McCarthy and others indicated that there was significant bipartisan support for establishing stronger privacy guidelines.</p><p>\u201cThere needs to be a national-level regulation, not state-by-state on what we\u2019re going to do about privacy,\u201d Mr. McCarthy, a California Republican, said in an interview Thursday with The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe should know what data you keep on us. We should be able to take our data and be able to delete our data.\u201d</p><p>Mr. McCarthy said he plans to introduce legislation that would ensure that people know what data companies are tracking and allow them to transfer or delete that data.</p><p>A data-privacy law passed last year in California helped spur action from both Mr. McCarthy and a bipartisan group of lawmakers working on privacy legislation in the Senate. Many view the law, set to take effect in January 2020, as the strictest consumer-privacy law in the U.S</p><p>The California law broadens the definition of what constitutes personal information and gives the state\u2019s consumers the right to prohibit the sale of personal data to third parties and opt out of sharing it altogether.</p><p>\u201cIf California goes into effect and then every other state\u2019s doing one, we\u2019re going to disrupt whatever growth we can have within technology and innovation,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.</p><p>The California law is somewhat similar to Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect last year. One difference is that the California measure includes more provisions allowing consumers to opt out of data sharing as opposed to forcing them to opt in before continuing to use online sites.</p><p>Passage of the California law helped spur the formation in the U.S Senate of a working group last year that is drafting what its members hope will be landmark data-privacy legislation.</p><p>Composed of members of the Commerce Committee, the group includes the panel\u2019s chairman, Roger Wicker (R., Miss.) Sens. Jerry Moran (R., Kan.), Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) and Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii). The group this year added two more high-profile lawmakers: Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, now the GOP whip, and Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the committee\u2019s top Democrat.</p><p>\u201cMy goal is a strong law that\u2019s stronger than California, that\u2019s more workable to innovation than Europe,\u201d Mr. Wicker said Thursday. \u201cAnd that it\u2019s so acceptable to all parties that we can avoid a patchwork of state-by-state.\u201d</p><p>Staff members from the working group are expected to meet Friday to discuss the draft legislation. Mr. Wicker hopes to introduce a bill before the Senate\u2019s August recess, a goal primarily driven by a desire to get the bill passed before the California law takes effect in January, according to a GOP aide familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Mr. Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee\u2019s consumer protection panel, said there was \u201cvery powerful support for privacy legislation across party lines because most people don\u2019t regard it in any way as a partisan issue.\u201d</p><p>Still, there will be plenty of details for lawmakers to tangle over, in particular the interaction between any new federal legislation and the California state law.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big part of this whole discussion\u2014how can we do this in a way that respects the states that do want the strong laws?\u201d said Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass.), who is working on legislation focused on online privacy protections for children under the age of 16.</p><p>Some lawmakers were skeptical that Congress would be able to agree on an approach to privacy guidelines.</p><p>\u201cI hope that we\u2019ll pass something, but you know, we\u2019ll see,\u201d said Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.), a freshman lawmaker who has introduced two bipartisan privacy bills of his own since taking office in January. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much enthusiasm there is for that on the Republican side right now,\u201d he said.</p><p>Technology companies have warmed to a national privacy law as the implementation of the California law approaches, hoping a federal rule would be less stringent and provide a sole set of guidelines. Supporters of big tech companies have warned against regulation that could threaten competition. in the sector.</p><p>Some Democrats have called for taking more forceful action to limit the power of the biggest technology companies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), who is running for president, called in March for breaking up some companies, including Amazon.com Inc.,Google and Facebook, saying they have too much power over the economy, and urged regulation of Google and Facebook as utilities.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy said he disagreed with the idea of breaking up big tech companies.</p><p>\u201cIf you break up a company, it does nothing about privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take away innovation.\u201d</p><p>Separately, the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel last week opened a bipartisan investigation into tech companies and antitrust laws.
