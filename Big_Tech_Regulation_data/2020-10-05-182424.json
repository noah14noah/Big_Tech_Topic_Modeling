We need answers and we need justice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's all the time we have tonight. Make sure you tune in tomorrow. I'll have an exclusive interview with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, a lot of discuss with him. Shannon Bream, the \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" team take it all from here. Shannon?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Laura, thank you very much. We begin on a busy night with Fox News alert.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The number of deaths from coronavirus in the U.S. reaching 100,000. But along with that some good news, the pace of deaths from COVID-19, which has shut down much of the country is actually slowing and it's measurable. It's also true that the pace of real openings is picking up across the country. What does the data tell us about cases in states that decided to lead the way?</p><p>But first, breaking tonight in Minneapolis. This is the scene now with looting and fires still going late into the night. Earlier, you saw our Mike Tobin got caught in the back and forth between rioters and protesters angry over the death of a black man at the hands of a Minneapolis Police officer and police outside the third precinct. Here's part of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: There's one of those flashbangs, they're pretty close to us here. And there is some kind of a chemical irritant and there you see the pepper spray coming out from the police. I got the pepper spray in my eyes.</p><p>So that's seen out here. A lot of back and forth with these demonstrators in the cops.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT, I'm Shannon Bream in Washington. Let's go straight to Mike now live in Minneapolis for the very latest on the situation there at this late hour, and this has been going on as you've tracked it for hours there, Mike, on the ground. What can you tell us?</p><p>TOBIN: Well, it doesn't really seem to be calming down as night has fallen. You can see there are a lot of demonstrators behind me just about a block away from the third precinct from which those officers were dispatched.</p><p>And we're watching this go on through the night. These demonstrators are angry. They understand that the officers were fired. They understand that the President said he's going to expedite an investigation with the FBI and the DOJ., but for them, it's not fast enough and they don't trust the people involved in the system. Here's some of what they had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These people supposed to be protecting and serving us, you know, yes, some that may have happened that was wrong, but at the end of the day, did his life deserved to be taken? You know, I'm saying who's supposed to protect us against those that's supposed to protect us?</p><p>TOBIN: Let's see, this is the...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm holding a sign.</p><p>TOBIN: Let's see it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Protesting the murder of somebody and I'm getting shot at.</p><p>TOBIN: And what he says is that is the wound from a rubber bullet just like this one, you're getting a lot from all the way up at the president who said he's going to -- he says he's going to launch the DOJ and the FBI in this investigation. Why is that not enough? Why not pause and let the wheels of justice go?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because this president has been holding the truth about a damn thing so why should I believe he's going to start doing it now?</p><p>TOBIN: To you, the wheels of justice are just aren't moving fast enough, correct?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. They're not moving at all. They're not moving at all.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOBIN: And fire crews are now at the scene at that auto parts AutoZone store. We saw that an hour ago. The witnesses said it was started with a box of fireworks, it was deliberately set on fire inside of that AutoZone.</p><p>It's also not a short distance away from the Target. It hadn't been inside of it yet. But I understand the Target has been gutted with these angry demonstrators out on the street. The fire crews are at the AutoZone, there's a lot of black smoke, billowing from the AutoZone. I can't really tell just what state the fire is in.</p><p>As I come back and have a look, you've got a lot of people on the street and you've got some more fireworks. They're all running right now, because that's the tear gas coming out of the officers. And I was trying to avoid the crowds and the crowd came to me here.</p><p>That's our scene right now. We got people throwing things back at the officers. Now those are the officers at the third precinct and they're basically guarding the building. And now the tear gas is on the street. They did a pretty good job of clearing the street with the tear gas time.</p><p>And some of what you're looking at the background is also just homemade, or, you know, roadside fireworks that the protesters bought, and they're lighting off in the middle of it. So you can't be confusing that with a non-lethal weaponry that the police are using to disperse the crowd.</p><p>But they just fired off all that tear gas and it looked like it did a pretty good job of clearing, what is Sixth Street here. You got the tear gas, you got the fireworks going off at the same time, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: And, Mike, if you could hear me, let me ask you. This is centered around the third precinct there, the police headquarters. We've seen different images of damage and some aggressive action involving the police precinct there. Can you tell us where the situation stands right now as far as damage to that building, the posture that police are in as they are now having incoming and trying to manage that while keeping people safe and giving them the freedom to protest where they are doing so peacefully?</p><p>TOBIN: Well, the posture keeps changing for the police. As for the building itself, a lot of broken out windows and boarded up doors. The police were taking a posture where they had on helmets. They had truncheons, they had some things like pepper spray with them. They did not have on the heavy body armor that we see sometimes with riot police. They didn't have riot shields with them.</p><p>But that being said, we've seen the bite cops out here as well. And we've seen the horse-mounted police, a large, for lack of a better term, squadron or platoon of horse-mounted Police just came up the street a short time ago, it cleared out the street, just like the tear gas did, but then the protesters seemed to backfill as soon as the presence has gone. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: OK. And one last quick question for you now, Mike, because we want you to be safe and get to safety if you need to move from there. Your assessment initially off the top was this doesn't seem to be calming down, as things are getting later.</p><p>In your assessment just from whatever vantage point you have, is the crowd growing? Is it dispersing? Where do things feel like they're headed at this moment?</p><p>TOBIN: Well, you're going to see it disperse right now because a couple fresh rounds of tear gas just came in. And so, the kids all scatter. And I shouldn't call them kids because there are some adults out here. But the people will all scatter, and then they'll come back. They've got the pepper spray out now as well.</p><p>But, yes, we tried to pick a point where there weren't that many people primarily out of concerns with COVID-19 or been too far into the crowd. Don't do what I do, do what I say. But there's more pepper spray coming. We got to back up. I've had enough spray for one night.</p><p>BREAM: Ok, Mike. You get to safety. We'll stay in touch with you. Thank you. Yes, thank you for your eyes there on the ground and keeping us factually updated and we'll check back with you, but please, get to safety, Mike.</p><p>OK. We want to take from there to another breaking issue further West. Black Lives Matter staging its own protest tonight in Los Angeles, marching through downtown L.A. and blocking the 101 Freeway there. Now we're told the situation there has turned violent.</p><p>Chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher, is on the case from our West Coast newsroom tonight to report on that side, is what you're looking at here. These are now live pictures in Minneapolis. Trace, what can you tell us further west?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Shannon, it's hard to get an exact number but it appears anywhere from 500 to 1,000 people took part in this Black Lives Matter protest in Downtown Los Angeles. And apparently, the event wasn't cleared by city officials because the police presence was almost nonexistent, and the crowd, you could see was very much packed together with very few protesters practicing social distancing guidelines.</p><p>The protest was in response to the death, of course, of George Floyd in Minnesota. It began in L.A. City Hall late today then made its way through the streets of downtown and eventually, as you look at these pictures, that shut down the 101 Freeway before moving back off the freeway and onto the side streets, and there was some confrontation with police when dozens of protesters surrounded a California Highway Patrol cruiser.</p><p>And when the car tried to flee, the CHP car, you can see right there, somebody smashed the back window with a skateboard and then another man wrote on that hood you saw the man kind of fall off there, he hit his head on what appeared to be the concrete and remained on the ground motionless for a short time, but he was later seen with paramedics putting his fist up as if to say that he was OK.</p><p>When a second CHP car, you see there, tried to assist, the crowd also converged around that car smashing its back window as well. Both cars then left. It's unclear if they fled altogether or they move toward other protesters.</p><p>Local media reports there are still protesters in the downtown area. But there had been no more reports of disruptions or police confrontations, at least for the time being.</p><p>Today, Los Angeles Police Chief Michael Moore issued a statement calling the video of the Minnesota police officer disturbing, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Trace, please keep us updated there on the West Coast. Thank you so much.</p><p>So two protests of George Floyd's death in two very different cities tonight across the U.S., both resulting in unrest that we continue to monitor at this hour. Again, this is live, I believe, from Mike Tobin's camera there in Minneapolis as there's back and forth with the police, as Mike has told us several times, and he's been on the receiving end of this, been close enough of it to get the tear gas, the pepper spray, and experienced that for himself.</p><p>But he says the crowds continue to be turned out in full force there tonight, sometimes dispersing with this police activity, but then staying on their ground and standing their ground and staying there.</p><p>So let's talk about how these events are playing out tonight with Fox News contributor, former Washington D.C. police detective, Ted Williams. Good to have you with us tonight, Ted.</p><p>TED WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Shannon. Glad to be with you.</p><p>BREAM: Let's talk about this situation. Our men and women in uniform, the vast majority of them excellent people who voluntarily choose to go on into very dangerous situations every day. There are situations that do require attention. There are lives lost and investigations to be had. They are launched now in this case.</p><p>How do the officers there now on the scene, walk this fine line between respecting people's first amendment rights, protecting the rights to be out there and to protest and to assemble and to push back and to raise attention versus where we've seen some of the things cross over into setting fires, vandalizing stores, and generally a situation that a lot of people think could escalate into something unsafe.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, it's this -- the murder should we say of George Floyd, has ignited these demonstrations there. And the law enforcement officers are trying to control the demonstrators. You know, Shannon, I was in Milwaukee, where we had rights. I was in Baltimore where we had right. I was in Ferguson, Missouri, for Fox where we had rights. And the one common thread that you find all that you've got people who are really upset about what is going on in their community.</p><p>And you have law enforcement on the other side who are saying, hey, look, all of us are not bad. What happened to George Floyd shouldn't happen to anyone. And when you got a man down saying, I can't breathe, I can't breathe, and you can see this on video. This is just reprehensible, it's shocking.</p><p>The law enforcement officers out there are certainly in a zone of danger. But over a period of time, I think that this all will in fact, calm down.</p><p>BREAM: Ted, when we see the officers that we did in that video from Monday, and they're bystanders, there are videos that looks right from area businesses, we're getting a number of angles on what happened and what transpired leading up to George Floyd's death, where does -- is it training that goes wrong? Is it the situation -- the officers in the situation, making a bad call on what they were dealing with? At what point do these officers cross the line into something that their training should have told them otherwise to do or protocol or policy should have told them this was not the way to handle this?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, first of all, as you saw in the video, you had officers standing around while this one officer had his knee on the neck of Georgia Floyd. That is not proper police training procedures, the training itself, are in essence went wrong. But also, you had, at least one rogue officer there.</p><p>Under no circumstances, no circumstances should you ever put your knee on the back of a man's neck. And the man is down, he's handcuffed, and he's hollering, I can't breathe, I can't breathe, and the officer just stood there for at least -- I counted seven minutes. That was inappropriate training. That should not have happened, or I'm sure that this officer and other officers there on that course have not been trained that way in their police academy.</p><p>BREAM: And the President said that he has quickly directed the DOJ and the FBI to get involved to expedite whatever they can in the situation. What do you think comes next for these officers? I mean, is it possible criminal charges, civil lawsuits? Both?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, there's going to be both. I think civil lawsuits are definitely going to take place out there. My friend, Ben Crump is in charge of the investigation for the family.</p><p>Now, what will also happen is that I believed in the coming days that there are going to be a grand jury, and I do believe that the officer who had his knee and his man's back -- on neck -- on his neck that that officer definitely is going to be charged possibly with a second degree murder or manslaughter.</p><p>But there are all lawsuits coming. As you know, the officers, Shannon, have been fired, at least four of them. This is just a hurricane that has come together and it's a very tragic situation that led to a death of a man for led forgery.</p><p>This should not have happened. And I can tell you, I've talked to many good law enforcement officers around the country today, and they wanted to message (INAUDIBLE) and that message is, we're not all like that. We are out to serve and protect our community, not to go out and kill somebody.</p><p>BREAM: And I think that's the last thing that the vast majority of these officers ever want to be involved with. But we'll watch now as this investigation plays out on a number of level -- levels, and we'll see what happens next in this case, involving the death of George Floyd.</p><p>Ted, thank you very much. Good to have you.</p><p>WILLIAMS: My pleasure.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Another Fox News Alert, the official U.S. COVID-19 death toll passes the 100,000 mark earlier this evening. And yet on that same day, we're getting some positive signs emerging about compressing the curve and where the rates are going now.</p><p>White House correspondent Kevin Corke crunching the numbers for us tonight. Good evening, Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Evening, Shannon. a solemn milestone to be sure as the U.S. death toll surpasses 100,000, thanks to the coronavirus.</p><p>I want to take you inside the numbers and share both the number of cases here in the -- in the United States, but also the number of deaths. We're talking again north of 100,000 of them. Very interesting the bulk of the deaths around 70,000 or so coming from just eight states, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, California, and Connecticut, again, about 70,000 or so 70 percent of the U.S. total deaths.</p><p>And for just a bit more context, consider this, counties won by the president back in 2016, reporting just 27 percent of the virus infections and 21 percent of the deaths, even though they comprise roughly 45 percent of Americans, these are generally smaller communities.</p><p>The President, meanwhile, continuing to promote America's progress in the fight against the virus, writing this on Twitter, \"We pass 15 million tests today, by far, the most in the world. Open safely.\"</p><p>And coronavirus task force member, Dr. Anthony Fauci, now says a second wave of infections in the fall is no longer inevitable, thanks to the ramped-up testing capability, and many parts of the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We don't have to accept that as an inevitability. I want people to really appreciate that. It could happen, but it is not inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE: That, of course, Dr. Anthony Fauci.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Vice President of the United States, former Vice President that is, Joe Biden, actually issued a tweet today, it was a video reaction to the death toll. Take a very brief listen as he expresses his sympathy for what has happened to so many Americans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: To all of you who are hurting so badly, I'm so sorry for your loss. This nation grieves with you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE: He said the former vice president, of course, he also blamed the Trump administration for its slow response, is being equally responsible for the growing death toll.</p><p>Meanwhile, at a time of increased tensions with Beijing as the U.S. and China trade barb over the pandemics, the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, certified to Congress today that Hong Kong no longer enjoys a high degree of autonomy from China. That decision could result in the loss of Hong Kong Special trading status with the U.S. threatening it's standing as an international financial hub.</p><p>As for the Chinese, yes, as you can well imagine, Shannon, they are responding tonight, they say this, \"Facts prove again and again that the U.S. is the troublemaker of the world. It is the U.S. who has violated its commitment under the international law. China urges the U.S. to immediately stop its power politics and bullying practices.</p><p>President Trump and Congress will ultimately decide what actions, if any, to take vis a vis, Hong Kong, he has said that he will announce something fairly soon. That is something we will be looking forward to, perhaps as soon as tomorrow, Shannon. I'll keep you posted. But for now, back to you.</p><p>BREAM: We know you will. Kevin Corke, thank you.</p><p>CORKE: You're welcome.</p><p>BREAM: So New York Governor Andrew Cuomo unleashes on Florida Senator Rick Scott today. Well, just so happens, the senator joins us live next. What's he got to say in return? Stick around.</p><p>BREAM: New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, in Washington today met with the president and he's pushing his agenda for a new coronavirus relief package that funds state governments, many of them now in dire financial shape, but not all of that is because of COVID-19.</p><p>Senior correspondent Rick Leventhal reporting from New York tonight. Good evening, Rick.</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good evening. Shannon. The governor of New York says he and the President had a good discussion today, but he'll have to wait until at least next week to find out if he'll get any of the federal dollars he's asking for.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo entered the white house with a mask on his face and a wish list in his back pocket, seeking funds to write his broken budget and to help build major projects including a rail tunnel under the Hudson River and air train to LaGuardia Airport and an expansion of Manhattan's Second Avenue subway line.</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): If he gives us the green light, this is not going to be years of discussion. I have a shovel in the trunk of my car, we'll start this afternoon.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: The Democratic governor says he wants to supercharge his state's reopening, asking the president to cut through red tape to get work started, calling on Republican leadership to approve federal funds for state and local governments crippled by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>CUOMO: You have people saying, well, we don't want to pass a bill that helps democratic states.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Critics, like Florida Republican senator, Rick Scott, say many blue states were in fiscal crisis well before the lockdowns began.</p><p>SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): I don't want to bail out liberal states who don't want to watch a budget.</p><p>CUOMO: This is really an ugly, ugly sentiment. It is an un-American response. We're still the United States of America.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio, says the virus has put the Big Apple nine billion in the red, warning of layoffs and furloughs ahead.</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: There is literally no way that we can solve this problem without federal help.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: But the president of the city's firefighter union says first responders are being used as pawns.</p><p>GERARD FITZGERALD, PRESIDENT, UNIFORMED FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION: I feel that safety has become secondary to progressive agendas or programs. There's plenty of places that money could be cut right now.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: The mayor did cut $6 billion from his latest budget proposal and asked the state to let New York City borrow $7 billion, but says what he really wants is for the Feds to step up and give him the funds. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right. Rick Leventhal there in New York, thank you.</p><p>So Governor Cuomo call them out by name today, and now, he joins us live. Let's go straight to Republican senator from Florida, Rick Scott, to get his reaction. Senator, good to have you back with us.</p><p>No surprise, there's been a lot of back and forth. You've been very vocal on these states saying that blue states quote unquote, should not get bailouts, they say listen, we're hurting. We're so far in the hole. We're going to have to let first responders and teachers and other essential workers go if we don't get this money.</p><p>SCOTT: None American, you know what's un-American, is to keep borrowing so much money that your kids and your grandkids will have all this debt, because we have -- we're not fiscally responsible.</p><p>I got elected when Governor Cuomo got elected back at the end of 2010. Both four states had financial problems. He took a totally different tact. He's borrowed money every year. He doesn't pay down debt, I've dropped late -- dropped about one third of our state debt.</p><p>One third of our state debt, we've cut taxes, and guess what, Cuomo also mad because all these businesses move to Florida because they couldn't afford to live there, and then the people moved here because they got sick and tired of his taxes, his regulation, and his attitude.</p><p>So he's not a fiscal, he doesn't watch the money, and now, he's tired of taxing his citizens towards the citizens of Florida, including a whole bunch of New Yorkers that moved here to get away from him to pay for his excesses.</p><p>I'm not going to have it, it's not going to happen, it's wrong. You look at places like California and Illinois and New Jersey with their unfunded pensions, why are Floridians responsible for these bad balance sheets?</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, for now, the top Republican Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, says we're pumping the brakes on this thing. We have to think it through. So, the top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, says this from the Senate, he says, in a tweet, \"Americans are sick and dying. Americans can't afford rent, have lost their jobs, can't put food on the table to feed their families. But Senator McConnell is just brushing them off by telling them he'll be ready to get back to helping them quote in the next month or so. Unacceptable.\" What's the status of the next round of a relief package?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, first off, let's think about what we've already done, we've spent or committed $3 trillion. Right? Let's take our states for a second, we've given them $50 billion for Medicaid, their Medicaid costs might not have gone up, we've given them $30 billion for education system. We don't know if their costs have gone up.</p><p>We've given them either loans or money over a trillion dollars on top that over $1 trillion that we've given to the businesses and the uninsured to help them. So, at some point, we have to say, how much money can we all borrow? Because we know that our kids, our grandkids are going to be paying for this?</p><p>So I think Leader McConnell is doing the right thing. Let's look at what we're doing. If we -- what can we do to help those unemployed? What can help our small businesses? And what can we do to make sure that the lawyers are not just suing off our businesses and preventing it from opening, because they're trying to comply with how do you keep people safe, and we have all these trial lawyers wanting to sue our businesses, and they're going to scare the living daylights of our business. We've got to have liability, protection for our business, and our first responders.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. And very quickly, do you think that liability protection for business owners will be part of another package? Will there be bipartisan agreement enough to get that in the deal?</p><p>SCOTT: There won't be -- there won't be a deal if there's not liability protection. It's not going to happen. It's going to prevent our small businesses -- all of our businesses from opening, we've got to do it for our health care workers.</p><p>I mean, look at these doctors are out there and nurses are trying to keep people alive. And now these lawyers are going to have the opportunity to sue them if they -- if it doesn't work out perfectly. And they're just learning how to take care of patients. So we've got to take care of the people that are -- there trying to do the right thing here. So if there's no liability protection, I don't believe there'll be a deal.</p><p>BREAM: All right. We'll watch. Senator Rick Scott, thank you for your time tonight.</p><p>SCOTT: Thanks. Bye, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. We are covering the demonstrations and riots on the streets of Minneapolis and L.A. tonight.</p><p>Coming up next, former NFL star, Ben Watson, has a message for the country. He's next.</p><p>BREAM: My next guest has a lot to say about churches, houses of worship, sports trying to open again in the aftermath of COVID-19. That's why originally, we had him joining us tonight. But first we want to discuss what we're seeing the demonstrations and riots in Minneapolis and L.A., following the death of an African-American man, George Floyd who've been in police custody. Former NFL Tight-End Benjamin Watson, also Author of the book \"Under Our Skin\" getting real about race joins us. Benjamin, always good to have you back.</p><p>BENJAMIN WATSON, FORMER NFL TIGHT END: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BREAM: I want to read something from Ben Crump, who is an Attorney now involved with the Floyd family. He and I went to law school together. He wrote this piece in The Washington Post saying this: \"We hear that nagging thought that keeps coming back and demanding us to face it. How many more deaths have not been captured on video? How long has this been going on without witnesses or documentation? Is this an outlier or is this endemic and it starts to feel like genocide?\" Benjamin, how do we have respectful, honest conversation about this very, very difficult subject.</p><p>WATSON: Well, I think the first step is to have a willingness to be uncomfortable, a willingness to be honest a willingness to not be offended and to not offer what-about-isms when people talk about the way they feel. Look, Shannon, I'm tired. I'm tired. I am discouraged. This trauma. You know, we're coming from a few weeks where we've had Ahmaud Arbery, where we've had Breanna Taylor -- we've had a number of these altercation that ended in a black person dying in circumstances that were not right. I think there is a call for justice, and that's what we need.</p><p>And so, to answer your question, we need people willing to engage, we need people willing to listen, and we also need a justice system that is going to do what we expect it to do, which is to bring convictions which is to administer justice equally. And as we're seeing now that we have videotapes and we -- all the stories that we've heard, we can't we can't deny them anymore. They're right in our face. So, the question is really for America: what are we willing to do? What are we willing to do to bring this country back together? What are we willing to do to graph a certain population that is systemically and over a generation and generation, generation known that they've been treated differently? How are we going to bring them back in and make these United States better?</p><p>BREAM: And the President tweeted out today: \"At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation into the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd.\" He said he's asked for that to be expedited. Do you think, and you know, Mike Tobin talked to some of the protesters and folks there tonight about this who said, \"I just don't have faith in the system. I don't feel like this is actually going to get us answers.\" What do you think it would take to restore some confidence in the system so that people could eventually rebuild trust and, and have certainty that justice when the facts are in and these you know, everything comes together that it will be served?</p><p>WATSON: Well, you know, I think that it comes from fourth convictions. And so, we've gotten to a place where we have arrest and we've gotten to a place where there's an investigation. We need convictions, and we need them to be swift. We need justice to be administered very quickly, but this is simply one tentacle, I believe in a larger discussion that has to be had. Sometimes we see instances like this, and it's very easy for all of us to say, you know what, this is wrong. This is, this is racist. This is unjust. But this is one tentacle of a much larger animal that we have to deal with in America that has been our Achilles Heel since our inception.</p><p>It took three constitutional amendments to make a certain part of our populace for citizens. It took several civil rights amendments, even make them citizens to give them the right to vote. And so, these things have built up over time. This isn't an overnight fix, but it's something that we really, really have to grapple with because this is something that can literally tear us apart and we see it tearing us apart right now.</p><p>BREAM: Benjamin Watson, you're always willing to wade into these difficult conversations. Your book, \"Under Our Skin\" is something that does talk about the fears and the prejudice and the trouble that we have but also, there's a hopeful message there. I recommend folks read it and it will spark a lot of conversations that we should all be willing to have. Benjamin, thank you. And thanks for coming back.</p><p>WATSON: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: This is a Fox News Alert. Peter Manfredonia, the suspect, wanted in connection with two homicides in Connecticut is in police custody tonight. The fugitive was apprehended we're told without any incident in Maryland tonight, after a multi-state manhunt that searched on for several days.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The suspect will face justice and this will bring closure. This is what is important for the families of the victims, the victims, all of which have been notified of the arrest immediately after.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Well, coming up, accused of scandal. Poor COVID-19 management and breaking their own lockdown rules, Democratic governors under fire tonight. Texas Lieutenant Governor Republican Dan Patrick weighs in live, next.</p><p>BREAM: Democratic governors are getting a lot of attention during the pandemic, not all of it good tonight many of them are taking heat for refusing to abide by the very guidelines they themselves sets for all the residents of their states. Let's talk about it now with Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a Republican, good to have you with us, Sir.</p><p>LT. GOV. DAN PATRICK (R-TX): Good to be back, Shannon. I call them the Shutdown Six. The biggest six states, all Democratic Governors, you've got Cuomo who's been wrong on everything in New York. You have Murphy, the Bill of Rights is above my paygrade, in New Jersey. You have Pritzker in Illinois. Wolf in Pennsylvania. Whitmer in Michigan, and Newsome. The Shutdown Six. They -- some of them were slow to shut down like in New York, and some of them don't seem to know when to let their people be free. And that's why you Shannon, a thousand people a day, literally, have been moving to Texas, and many of them come from these States.</p><p>BREAM: Well, what do you say to those who say, listen, Texas was one of the states that had a little bit more freedom doing this. There has been a lifting and reopening to a large scale down there in Texas, but there have also been spikes in cases.</p><p>PATRICK: Well, the numbers you can find any one day. For example, the last three days are deaths and every life is precious. We don't we don't diminish one life. To those families, every life is precious, but we've been in single digits. We were up in the 20s today, but we're the lowest per capita if not in the country, one of the lowest. Our hospitalization rate is one of the lowest. We've done it right and we respect the constitution which some of these governors do not; we respect the freedom of people. We, as you know, from day one I've been saying we can do two things at once the, you know, protect our nursing homes which Cuomo did not do and part of his big problems in New York.</p><p>And, and, and let people get out there. It's their own pace, by the way, Shannon, so we've opened up our churches, we've opened up our business, as our restaurants can seat 50 percent. And we have not seen a spike, since we've, you know -- but I think the most aggressive in opening. And I think we've done it the right way, and if people feel comfortable going out, then we want them to go out, and if they don't feel comfortable, then they should, you know, work at their pace. But we're opening up. The traffic is getting much heavier. I was out today and it looked like a normal, it looked like a normal day.</p><p>BREAM: I got to say that was a silver lining around here in D.C., which is still very much closed down, is to not be finding the traffic in the same way that we usually do. We touched on this interesting piece in the New York Times yesterday, which talked about the blue state, red state divide, noting that blue states tend to be more urban, more densely populated areas and they are being hit harder. They say, \"It's not just the Democrats and Republicans disagree on how to reopen businesses, schools in the country as a whole.</p><p>Democrats are far more likely to live in counties where the virus has ravaged the community. While Republicans are more likely to live in counties that have been relatively unscathed by the illness.\" Do you think that's part of where this political divide is over reopening versus not reopening staying home? Because there are areas that are harder hit and they tend to be, those that have Democratic leaders who say: Listen, I'm just trying to protect my people.</p><p>PATRICK: They just made bad decisions. Cuomo was wrong on ventilators, wrong old beds, wrong on needing the Navy ship, wrong on shutting down. Remember how long New York and de Blasio, and all the New Yorker saying, you know, you can keep coming to the various festivals and they were still out there partying while Texas was, was being very careful. We were just ahead of the curve and, and you know, if you look at a state like Pennsylvania, where I once lived, it's not a lot different than Texas in terms of, it's red in between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, and it's very rural between those two cities.</p><p>You know, in Texas, we have big suburban areas. We're not as dense as new as New York or New Jersey, but you know, we've got Dallas, and we have Houston, and we have Austin, and yet we have a lot of wide-open space. I really don't think that's right. I think it's -- the density was a problem for New York, but their policy, you know, every day we would see Cuomo hold court as the Chairman of the Board of this Shutdown Six, and he would hold court like he knew everything, that turned out he knew nothing.</p><p>And he's and, and look I'm not going to be I'm not going to be overly hard on this issue because everyone tried to do their best on in unchartered waters particularly in March, but his policies cost a lot of people their lives when he forced people to go to nursing home. He sent sick people to other people who were sick or made other people sick and that's why the nursing homes is higher than any other state -- wrong policies. But what really aggravates me is that he, he and these other five of the Shutdown Six, they continue to criticize the President and now and I heard your interview with Rick Scott earlier, Rick is absolutely right. Look, 29 million Texan taxpayers do not want to flip the bill for New York City.</p><p>These, these states that I mentioned: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois is totally broke. Michigan, New York, California, they're all underwater. They're deep in debt, Shannon, these -- the liberal policies have been wrong for years, and so it's not to be unexpected. When they had a crisis, they didn't know how to manage it. They couldn't manage good times; they surely don't know how to manage bad times. And this is what we get if we elect Joe Biden who praises those six governors, think about this and criticize the president. The people in the states want to be left free. Like those, you know, the brother, the father and son are on the diner in York, Pennsylvania. They want to be set free, let them run their business.</p><p>BREAM: Well, yes, and listen, a number of these cases involving churches, most especially but some of those Pennsylvania business owners have hit the Supreme Court already. So, we're standing by to see how that plays out. Lieutenant Governor, good to have you with us.</p><p>PATRICK: Always great to be with you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, we would know that Governor Cuomo says the CDC was to blame for his nursing home policy. There are going to be plenty of investigations in that and we'll keep an eye on it. All right, President Trump's war with Twitter escalating tonight. How the President could be planning to crack down on the social media giant, can he? Our tech and legal experts are live, next.</p><p>BREAM: President Trump expected to sign an executive order on social media on Thursday. Just another sign of the times because once upon a time, it was an action that used to be objective and nonpartisan. Fact checking. Now, it's igniting a political firestorm. between the President and big tech. Let's discuss the latest developments. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo. Gentlemen, good to have both of you with us.</p><p>BRENDAN CARR, FCC COMMISSIONER: Good to join you.</p><p>JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: OK, so Senator Marco Rubio tweeting this: \"The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they're considered forums, not publishers. But if they now have decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher, then they should no longer be shielded from liability and treated as publishers under the law.\" I'd love to get reaction from both of you, start with Brendan.</p><p>CARR: Yes, look, since the 2016 election, the far-left has worked to weaponize social media platforms. They are upset that these platforms and their views stood on the sidelines in the 2016 election and acted neutrally. And what we're seeing now is that campaign is bearing fruit and Twitter, among others have decided to engage in partisan political debates taking on the President of the United States directly having to do with mail in ballots. And I think if these entities want to act like political actors, like everyone that has first amendment rights can do, then I think that raises questions about whether they should be getting special treatment above and beyond any other political actor that's out there.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and John, you know, there have been a lot of people tweeting out like, hey, congratulations, Twitter, if you're going to start fact- checking the president, the United States on this stuff, what about the Ayatollahs in Iran? What about the Communist Party in China? I mean, where does Twitter go with this?</p><p>YOO: Twitter's not part of the government. So, they're not actually governed by the first amendment, but it would be a good idea for them to follow the same principles that have allowed our democracy to be so robust and vigorous. And the reason why is how would Twitter actually do the job of censor? We don't even trust judges, we don't even trust our own politicians, elected officials to make the choice. How are they going to choose what's a legitimate idea, what's an illegitimate idea?</p><p>Suppose they start sticking fact-check things on statements they don't like, does that mean that everything else on Twitter is true? Of course, not. So, I think the better thing to do is stay neutral. Be a platform. The more that they start interjecting their choice and ideas about what's a good idea or bad idea, the more they're going to invite government regulation, perhaps maybe the government should change its mind and stop giving it that's free passes a network, the more that they vigorously try to police ideas rather than be a platform.</p><p>BREAM: I mean, Brendan, do you think that, that happens? I mean, there's a there's a dispute about whether the current law would allow the government to do some of this, should the law be changed? Where should we go from here?</p><p>CARR: I think this is an important part of the public debate. And as you mentioned, there's been reports that President Trump is going to sign an executive order as early as tomorrow that might address some of this, including potentially a call for a review of Section 230 and how it applies in today's day and age. I mean, look, we have a situation now where Facebook has stood up this \"oversight board\" in the run up to the 2020 election.</p><p>And that has put sort of neutral arbiters on that board. It stacked it with partisan political actors. One of the first ones on there, Pam Carlin, that name probably rings a bell. She testified in the impeachment hearing in favor of impeaching the president. She made that infamous Baron, Baron Trump line. These are the people that Facebook is trusting with the keys of content moderation heading into the election.</p><p>Now look, I think Zuckerberg himself actually deserves some credit. He has spoken out a lot, including pushing back on Twitter's fact-check, to try to be in favor of more speech. The problem is Facebook is wrong, and this board is an example of it. If you were to put together a group built to tilt the election against the incumbent president, I don't think it would look much different than the oversight board that Facebook has put together and stacked with sort of pro-impeachment, really people that have viscerally emotional reactions to President Trump.</p><p>BREAM: All right, quick, 10 seconds from you to close this out, John.</p><p>YOO: Well, I think that Twitter -- I don't actually listen to Twitter. I don't use Twitter. So, I have missed all these tweets about Joe Scarborough, and so on. But look, maybe that's the best thing that the Twitter could do, would be to try to ban President Trump. It would give him a bigger platform. Maybe Trump would move to some other platform and that'll kill Twitter.</p><p>BREAM: Well, well, let's see. Good to have you both with us, gentlemen. Thanks for weighing in. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020052701cb259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600V-7121-DXH2-6004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7394\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Political</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Relief</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George Floyd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Minneapolis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Peter Manfredonia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Maryland</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Shutdown Six</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>COVID-19 Response</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Texas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Twitter</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fact Check</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODdEMDhDREQzOEQ2NDE2RkE2Njk3RTNEMUM0NTE3MEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

In an interview with The Verge[6] this week, Sen. Ron Wyden, a key voice in Congress on internet policy issues, accused President Donald Trump of \"working the refs, bullying the tech companies, and forcing Twitter and other platforms to print his lies.\"In a surprising move Monday evening, the Trump administration withdrew its nomination[7] of Michael O'Rielly, a Republican, to serve another term as one of the five commissioners at the Federal Communications Commission.Wyden called the administration's reversal a \"disaster\" and warned that pushing nominees to the FCC \u2014 an independent agency \u2014 who only swear loyalty to the president could cause the agency to lose \"any sense of independence,\" according to The Verge.\"One nomination after another is brought up, and the litmus test is: will the nominee do exactly what the president of the United States wants to do on any given issue at any particular moment?\"</p><p> Wyden told The Verge.The Trump administration pulled O'Rielly's nomination just days after he expressed concerns about the FCC regulating how social media companies moderate content on their platforms, which Trump's controversial executive order[8] seeks to do by empowering regulators to curb the companeies' legal protections.\"The First Amendment protects us from limits on speech imposed by the government \u2014 not private actors \u2014 and we should all reject demands, in the name of the First Amendment, for private actors to curate or publish speech in a certain way,\" O'Rielly said during a virtual event[9] hosted by The Media Institute.\"Like it or not, the First Amendment's protections apply to corporate entities, especially when they engage in editorial decision making,\" he said.Trump issued the executive order[10] \u2014 which specifically named Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube \u2014 in May after Twitter fact-checked his tweets[11] falsely claiming that mail-in ballots lead to voter fraud, alleging that the platforms are biased against him and conservative viewpoints.The order directs federal regulators, including the FCC, to review, and ultimately curtail, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act[12], which gives social media companies broad legal authority to moderate speech on their platforms.Legal and tech policy experts said the order was legally dubious and wouldn't hold up in court. (It is already facing one such legal challenge[13]).\"The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump. It does not protect Trump from Twitter,\" Ashkhen Kazaryan, the director of civil liberties at the libertarian think tank TechFreedom told Business Insider's Sonam Sheth and Ashley Gold[14].Wyden, one of the co-authors of Section 230 \u2014 which is widely credited with enabling the growth of today's internet platforms \u2014 also slammed Trump's order.\"This is a deeply flawed idea. Beyond the fact that this is a colossal Constitutional mess, I don't think even Donald Trump believes he's going to be able to get away with this,\" Wyden told The Verge.Trump isn't alone in his dislike of Section 230, however. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have ramped up their criticisms of Section 230 in recent months, but for very different reasons.Former Vice President Joe Biden has also called for Section 230 to be revoked[15], citing platforms' reluctance to enforce their policies against misinformation and hate speech, arguing the current law disincentivizes them from taking action because they're not held liable for content published by users.Republicans, in particular Sen. Josh Hawley, have pushed to get rid of Section 230 protections[16] in an effort to combat what they claim is anti-conservative bias by social media companies. Lawsuits alleging such bias have been largely rejected by courts, also on the grounds that the First Amendment doesn't apply to private companies.

Marco Rubio, R-Florida, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) today introduced the American Data Dissemination (ADD) Act, legislation that would provide a national consumer data privacy law that protects both consumers and the innovative capabilities of the internet economy. By using the Privacy Act of 1974 as its framework, the bill provides overdue transparency and accountability from the tech industry while ensuring that small businesses and start-ups are still able to innovate and compete in the digital marketplace. A one-pager of the bill is available here.</p><p>\"There has been a growing consensus that Congress must take action to address consumer data privacy,\" Rubio said. \"However, I believe that any efforts to address consumer privacy must also balance the need to protect the innovative capabilities of the digital economy that have enabled new entrants and small businesses to succeed in the marketplace. That is why I am introducing the American Data Dissemination Act, which will protect small businesses and startups while ensuring that consumers are provided with overdue rights and protections. It is critical that we do not create a regulatory environment that entrenches big tech corporations. Congress must act, but it is even more important that Congress act responsibly to create a transparent, digital environment that maximizes consumer welfare over corporate welfare.\"</p><p>Specifically, the ADD Act would do the following:</p><p>- Not later than 180 days after enactment of the ADD Act, the FTC is required to submit detailed recommendations for privacy requirements that Congress can impose on covered providers. These requirements would be substantially similar to the requirements applicable to agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974.</p><p>- Not earlier than one year after the date on which the Commission has submitted detailed recommendations (18 months after enactment), the FTC will publish and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress proposed regulations to impose privacy requirements on covered providers that are substantially similar to the requirements applicable to agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974.</p><p>- To ensure Congress acts in a timely manner, if the Congress fails to enact a law based on the recommendations provided by the date that is two years after enactment of this bill, the FTC would promulgate a final rule, not later than 27 months after the date of enactment to impose privacy requirements based on the narrow, congressionally mandated course of action created through this bill.</p><p>Earlier today, Rubio penned an op-ed (<url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/425557-congress-needs-to-address-consumer-data-privacy-in-a\">https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/425557-congress-needs-to-address-consumer-data-privacy-in-a</url>) addressing the need for Congress to address consumer data privacy.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6578924 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6578924</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6W-CG01-JC11-14HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"474\"/><timeReceived>7:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Vasington</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sensata Technologies Holding PLC - CFO, CAO &amp; Executive VP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conference Call Participants</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Brian Arthur Johnson</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Barclays PLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Equity Analyst</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Presentation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, BARCLAYS PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Okay. Let's -- very pleased to have with us, once again at the Industrial Select Conference, Sensata Technologies Holding. We're covering it this year out of the automotive side. Last year it was in the industrial side, although I helped a former analyst with some of the insights into that and was on stage as well. I'm very pleased to have with us this year, Paul Vasington, EVP and CFO; and Joshua Young, VP in IR.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why don't we start with a couple of the ARS -- you have this, the ARS questions. You've got your voting machines in front of you. And number one, do you currently own this stock? I think by now you know how to use the machines. Would you like to vote? You're from Boston. I'm from Chicago. We should always vote early and often.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PAUL S. VASINGTON, CFO, CAO &amp; EXECUTIVE VP, SENSATA TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING PLC: Exactly.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: If you have any deceased shareholders, they can vote, too. So yes, good attendance in the room with people who own the stock. Although -- and so we'll get to some of the bull/bear today (multiple speakers). There's a vocal minority there. Number two, what's your general bias towards the stock?</p><p>(voting)</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: So we're having a little positive...</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Well, I'd say the positive, negative and positives kind of match. (Multiple speakers), it was interesting, 10% were underweight, but there's 0% negative. So that might be a macro call or that might be something -- hopefully some of you will ask questions so I'm not the only one asking questions.</p><p>Why don't I first go in and just talk about how you kind of think about the organic growth potential? Sort of ex this cycle because, of course, we'll talk about HVOR and some of the good cycle trends there that've been negative in prior years. But just the fundamental ability of your end markets in auto, that outgrow production, in HVOR it'd outgrow commercial and our pilot production, in industrial generally, they outgrow GDP. How do you think about your portfolio in particular? Of the 8% of the revenues that you put into RD&amp;E, how much of that would go into sort of brand-new applications? How much into -- at the other end of the spectrum, very mature applications? And the things in the middle, sort of maturing in high growth kind of applications?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: Okay. So just tackle the research, development and engineering question first. So about 8% of our revenue is in research, development and engineering, and that's split half around pure R&amp;D, which is the new design and development work, and the other 4% is in sustaining engineering. It's working on existing products and modifications for existing product applications. Most of that 8% is underpinning growth. It's to launch new products. It's to design, develop and get new products ready for launch when the customer's ready. So I would say, it's highly, highly -- a high percentage of that is really related to our growth model and our growth engine.</p><p>If I think about the business organic growth potential, our Investor Day back in December, we talked about 4 trends that are shaping the industry. It's around clean and efficient, it's around electrification, autonomy and smart and connected. And over the next 3 years, we have an organic growth rate between 4% and 6%. We've talked about 90% of that business being secured, so we have a strong carryover business. Business we have today that carries on. As well as new business we won, which we'll launch over the next 3 years and generate revenue. And most of that is coming out of the clean, efficient and electrification trends, where autonomy and smart connected are very exciting opportunities for us, are a little bit further out in terms of their maturity. So that kind of lays out the -- why we're confident in the growth. The business that we have in place that will support that growth and our ability to execute, which is we believe is very high.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: So let's talk first about automotive. Because in part, we had BorgWarner up on stage here earlier talking about the growth and evolving their business from pure internal combustion to hybrids, of course, to electrification. I guess, as we look at your growth rate this past year, it actually ticked up. There were some cyclical factors that abated, but it does look like -- and then again in Investor Day, that you're getting content outside the engine cylinder, the manifold, some of the traditional pressure-sensing markets. Could you maybe go back and kind of when did you start seeing, in terms of the electrification and the autonomous, the need or the opportunity to move beyond that? When did you begin to put into place some of the building blocks that are now coming into the revenue stream now?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: Okay. The one thing I wanted to add to the previous comment, what also overlays our growth and supports the organic growth is the modernization in China. So as the truck and auto fleets continue to modernize, that's great content growth for Sensata. We've talked about our content there going from $10 to $15, 150%. So that's another factor that you kind of align with those underlying industry trends that gives us great confidence in our ability to execute over the next few years. As it relates to electrification, we do see great content opportunity on hybrid vehicles. So vehicles with an advanced combustion system, the content opportunity there is greater than it would be on an existing gas powertrain vehicle. And we're really well prepared to serve that market. We talked about, we have part of our portfolio is electrified, right? So we're prepared to serve that, able to serve that. That's within our technology platform and the products that we offer.</p><p>As you start thinking about electrification, as it gets more towards EV, I mean, there's certainly things that we do today. We talk about having $25 to $30 of content on the Chevy Volt, as an example. So there are some small examples. That market hasn't really matured. It's hard to get a real view of what the average content will be, but we feel good about the technology we have today to serve the needs of customers today in terms of pure EV. We also see a lot of opportunity as those systems start to advance the electrical system, which is going to be focused on improving range and efficiency of those vehicles, that we're well-positioned with existing technologies to serve those needs. And we see a lot of exciting opportunities in other areas which we think we can intersect. We talked about things around thermal management and battery management systems as a way to do that, which has a lot more content than what we have today in terms of what we have on vehicles. So it feels as if there is a definite and identifiable tailwind that can come from the growth in pure electric vehicles over time.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: So what you're saying is, even if, I don't know, a kind of customer in 2020 walks out of the showroom with an all-electric Mercedes or Tesla or BMW or whatever versus what they would have been buying in 2015, a gas or diesel 3 Series or 5 Series or E-class. You see the constant opportunities not only flat but could increase in that environment?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: Right. And we talked about on Investor Day, an example where if you think about the HVAC...</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Multi-zone.</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: Zone in a vehicle. Today, it's a sensor, one sensor, the air conditioning system, that expanding into sensors that manage heat and other thermal issues related to an electric vehicle. We think that those -- that's just incremental sensors that we would -- pressure sensors that we would not have today available to us. So as that system evolves and the needs become more apparent on what they have to manage and how they have to -- what they need to do to optimize the battery and the range of the vehicle, that's new content for Sensata that we would expect to see on that kind of a vehicle in the future.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Now in terms of sort of the buying groups, so they're the same buying groups, different buying groups?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: Well, it's the same. I think it's leveraging our existing relationship with those customers at the engineer level and we're working with those customers to find solutions to the issues that are developing as they move from -- move into hybrids and moving then into pure electric vehicle.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Now one of the things a lot of -- we had Aptiv up on stage earlier as well, and Borg as well, but one of the things people talk about in the automotive world as we move to electrification is it brings in potentially new competitors. Certainly, it's theory out there that if you're a legacy industrial automotive supplier, fine, you know the people and fossil fuel end of the business. But there's either big tech companies or Asian tech companies are active in things like electronics, power electronics. Do you see any of that in the sensing world in terms of a different competitor set showing up, say, for a battery, thermal monitoring, temperature system than say for a fossil fuel, fossil engine, the emissions control system?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: Yes, on the -- today's platforms, I think it's the same competitors, same level of competitive intensity. I think we're really well positioned to be successful as we see more and more hybrid vehicles on the road. On the EV side, I think others may be better suited to speak to this but so far, what we're looking at is how we take our existing technology in relation to the OEMs to help solve their problems. And then looking at new technologies where we think we can provide the unique value-differentiated option. And I don't think the market's mature enough to know where others may be intersecting that, that we're trying to intersect the same opportunities. I don't have that visibility and I don't see that today but you know...</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: One of the questions that comes up as well is, you bought Schrader in part to get into the Chinese -- to TPMS, which we know is about to boom and in the process of booming in China. So maybe, A, update on that. But secondly, seems like part of the rationale was to get into just wireless sensing. And we had Aptiv up earlier, as you know, they're active in electrical architecture. They're having dialogues with the big OEMs, the leading edge OEMs, particularly in Europe around how do we get wires out of the system? How do we move data around without necessarily having to run twisted pairs? So maybe could you update us on both those parts of the Schrader? Just kind of remind us where we are in the China inflection on TPMS. So then where are you taking that wireless sensing technology into either automotive or industrial applications?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: I guess, a couple of different pieces there. The first is, how is tire-pressure sensing adopting in China. There is regulation that's out there that will come into being in the 2019, '20 time frame. And so when we get to full adoption, full regulation, we think it's about a $100 million business. Today, it's about a $40 million business and we do think that there'll be a continued ramp-up in the revenues as not driven by regulation, but driven by consumer preference, where OEMs are seeing that that's a feature that consumers want. And so they're asking for that feature to be on the car sooner than regulation would otherwise require. So it's a growing business. It will ultimately increase $50 million or so over the next 3 years. And it will be somewhat of a gradual increase and probably more back-end loaded just because regulation will certainly drive it faster. But we are definitely seeing the growth there, and that's great.</p><p>In terms of the wireless capability, what we're doing with pressure sensing, which is part of what we considered when we bought Schrader, is the ability to take their tire-pressure sensing in the automotive market and bring that to the truck market. Although the truck market is regulated, owners are aware of and looking for using tire-pressure sensing to not only drive safety but increase the operating performance and the cost efficiency of the truck. And so there's natural adoption beyond regulation that's happening in the truck market. And then if you then take the fact that we have this wireless capability on the tire-pressure sensing, we're seeing the ability to use that to think about a smart-connected environment around a vehicle like a truck where you can create a network, which exists today for tire-pressure sensing, expand that to more sensors on the vehicle, to be able to sense more things, gather more data and provide that to users to run a more efficient -- wirelessly. Because the difference, it's hard (multiple speakers).</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Is there any early application to that in the pipeline?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: So there's something we talked to investors that we're looking at and thinking that this is -- because of the wireless network, how do we build on that, bring more sensors on to the vehicle, provide more information to the user, to the owner, to the fleet manager, and do that wirelessly from the other cost-effective solution? So that's exciting. And then the other one would be in terms of when we think about battery management and the key things, staying in the range of electric vehicle, how do you get more out of the battery? How do you improve the health, the life of the battery? And being able to manage and understand what's happening at the cell level, but using wireless technology to be able to have that demand of that system, and then communicate that to the car to be able to optimize the performance and do that wirelessly.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: So you can monitor at wireless points without having to additional (multiple speakers)</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: And without having to wire it. And so that you take weight and cost and probably make the manufacturing process a lot easier by being able to do that in a wireless environment.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: And if you talk about integrating the integration. Have you been able to take some of that wireless technology into some of the industrial markets like some of the things CST brought you?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: So another area to go explore, in how to use the wireless environment on the industrial side.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Which then gets to -- okay, you've got these sensors generating data, some coming through wires, but in future increasingly more coming through wireless. How does that position Sensata in a world of automotive big data or just more broadly, the industrial Internet of Things? And is it just -- how do you see that kind of driving your growth? And are there adjacencies where you're not just generating the data, but you're perhaps creating software and other systems that interpret it and act on it?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: I think for the most part, we're focused on the component, being a component supplier of the sensor, the measuring of the phenomenon and then providing the right data to upstream. But there are going to be pockets where we're going to want to move up more because we think we're in a unique position. And I think the one I just described around creating that network on a large vehicle, and whether it's big truck or a trailer, and leveraging our position that we have and then expanding upstream a bit because it makes a lot of sense. I don't -- strategically, that's not we're trying to drive the business across the business, but there will be situations where it makes a lot of sense and we're well positioned to be successful there and we'll likely want to go do that.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Okay. Let's bring up question number 3 about growth, and then I want to get to your other driver of growth. Through-cycle EPS growth for Sensata Technologies. And would you rather have this against the industrial peer group in the other rooms or versus the automotive peer group, your call? Shall we start the clock?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: No, that's fine. We want to be best-in-class.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: So industrial?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: Yes.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Okay. So versus industrial peers. Which makes sense.</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: Yes.</p><p>(voting)</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Okay. So still above or in line with the group growing generally faster than automotive, at least this point in the cycle. Just one thing on the growth, and then I'll get to the margins. HVOR, which had been a headwind in terms of commercial and off-highway builds, now swinging. If we look at the strong recent growth in there, is there any way to dimension how much is just being in the right end markets at the right time? And how much is their end markets where that is happening, but there's also additional content, for example, I would imagine, Chinese construction and trucks?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: So the heavy vehicle and off-road business in 2017 grew 14%. That was with 8% -- 6% market growth, 8% content growth. And so a real strong performance. And we've always had content growth from that business, but we're seeing a lot more content growth now and into over the next 3 years, driven by just the need to continue to clean up exhaust systems, the transition from hydraulic controls on off-road vehicles to electronic controls and interfaces. So there's a lot of great content that's happening over the next 3 years in a business that is having a stronger market than in the past 3 years. And just for everyone's knowledge, I mean, they -- our heavy vehicle and off-road business is in a number of different markets. It's North America truck, it's Class 8, there's Class 5 to 7; it's European truck; it's global construction; it's global agriculture. And then there's some other smaller businesses around motorbikes and RVs that we also serve as well through the HVOR business. So there's a lot of different markets.</p><p>But generally, the market growth has been much stronger than in the last 3 years and that's across the board. And as we look forward to 2018, we're expecting 4% to 5% growth, market growth, production growth in our heavy vehicle and off-road business. On average -- it's on average across all those end markets. And over the 3 years, we talked about 3% growth in market production. So the growth will start to slow from the market, but the content growth will continue to be strong. And so it's going to be in that 6% to 8% range over the next 3 years. So very, very positive, strong content tailwind out of that business.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: So if end markets (multiple speakers)</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: And the other thing that's happening is tire-pressure sensing, as I mentioned earlier, is becoming an important content growth driver for that business. So again, taking the Schrader capability around passenger vehicle, bringing that into the truck market, seeing a lot of adoption because it drives efficiency and safety in those -- for those truck owners.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: So obviously, revenue growth is one way to grow EBIT and EBIT margins through incremental profitability. But what gives you confidence in the EBIT margin expansion of 110 basis points in 2018, 250 basis points over a 3-year period? What gives you confidence? And maybe start -- and I apologize if this is buried in the investor deck, but kind of how much of that is coming from organic growth flowing through and sort of incremental 15% to 20% or so, plus or minus? How much is coming from just shifting to some higher margin products? And then how much is coming from your back-end efficiencies, everywhere from further merger integration to the supply chain efforts you've been talking about?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: So I'll stick with what we laid out in the investor deck that helped bridge the earnings growth over the 3-year period. The first thing is we're going to have a benefit because we're going to have less integration spend. So we had $20 million in 2017, and that's going to be $4 million or $5 million in 2018 as we finish up some of the integration work that we have for both Schrader and CST. So that gives you a tailwind going from '17 to '18 and it continues over the 3-year period. Synergies that we're achieving as we complete the manufacturing moves around Schrader, CST and some other product conversion work we're doing. That generates another $20 million over the next few years, which is, again, that's going to be a margin tailwind. So taking cost out of the existing cost base.</p><p>And then the rest is going to be just the normal productivity initiatives that we have around offsetting price concessions that we see in our automotive business by productivity gains on the cost side for the parts that we're producing. And then we also get operating leverage. So there's fixed cost in the business, and it's a highly variable cost business, but there are some fixed costs where we get operating leverage so we're growing incrementally our volumes higher than our EBIT. And so that also helps bring margin expansion.</p><p>Offsetting that will be the need to continue to invest in the business for the growth that we've won. So we won an NBO. It's a new business win. It takes a number of years to bring that product to market. You have to work with your -- particularly on your -- on the auto and the aerospace side, to work with them to design and get that product ready for production, and that requires investment. And so that is a good investment because it supports the growth that we're going to see over the next 3 to 5 years. And then there's also the investment that we're making to intersect the growth trend that are more in the future around electrification, autonomy and smart and connected. So that's additional investment that we think makes a lot of sense to support those emerging growth trends.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Now you've guided cash flow up 30% in '18, 19% over the longer time. How much of that is driven just by the EBIT? And then what are the other cash levers that we should be thinking about?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: I think the -- a couple of things that stand out. One is the higher earnings. Secondly would be an improvement in terms of working capital management, and that improvement comes from completing the transitions related to the sites that we're integrating. So the transitions take time, the new -- the receiving site needs to get their production up and running and qualified. And so we've built a lot of stock inventory to support that transition to make sure that our customers are going to be served flawlessly as we transition. So we've built a bunch of inventory to enable those transitions to take place and we'll work that inventory down in 2018.</p><p>Now, we're growing so we're still going to have growing working capital, receivables will grow as we grow. But that change in terms of kind of working through that temporary elevation inventory will also generate strong cash flows in '18. And then we've been doing a lot of restructuring the last couple of years, and so we had quite a bit of restructuring spend in 2017 that doesn't repeat at the same level in '18. So those will be 3 things that help support that free cash flow growth above the earnings growth.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Let's bring up question number four. And then, also, does anyone -- which is what should you do with the excess cash? Because I do want to talk about capital allocation.</p><p>(voting)</p><p>So bolt-on M&amp;A, share repurchases, dividends, debt paydown. I want to pause there. Is there any questions from the audience? Okay. Well, let's then talk about capital allocation. Actually, if you could leave that numbers up because it's a good thing to talk around. Given that strong cash flow, at least in our model we have your leverage dropping to 2.2x. You've actually only talked about a target of 2.7x to 3x, I believe. So are you leaving room in that for share repurchases? 27% of the people like it, which is a dead tie with bolt-on M&amp;A. And is there an acquisition, kind of, B, budget, or B -- and B, direction we ought to be thinking about?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: So the last couple of years, we've been deleveraging to get our leverage in a range which we feel very comfortable with. 3x feels comfortable. It's, for Sensata, given our desire to grow and to be acquisitive, it feels like the right place. It gives us access to the capital markets at the right pricing that we would like to get in terms of raising capital. And so with that, and then concerning the free cash flow that will be generated over the next few years, we feel we're in a great place to think about how we deploy capital in a balanced, return-driven way. And so we're talking about M&amp;A, M&amp;A being the area where we expect to get the highest returns. So with 15%, 20% internal rate of return. We showed you examples of Schrader at above 20%. We showed examples of CST at 13% to 15%, which is where we thought when we first bought the company. So we have those expectations of M&amp;A and those returns are obviously higher than buying back shares because there's greater risk. But we also think there will be a time for share repurchase makes a lot of sense, where economically, it delivers for greater returns than any other option we have available to us.</p><p>And so it's going to be balanced. It's going to be returns-driven. It's going to be economic-based. And we just -- we're now in a better position to do that. And also with our redomicile to the U.K., which I would say that we -- thank you for those shareholders who supported that, that was approved by shareholders. So we're moving forward to the next stage of the merger process. That gives us a lot more optionality and flexibility to be able to distribute capital back to shareholders in a more effective way. So we're much -- we're just in a better position: strong cash flows, better leverage, better execution, to be able to generate high returns for shareholders through capital deployment.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Okay. Kind of related to capital deployment, how do you think about ROIC at your company? And you have very strong margins, but at least in your definition of ROIC, it's kind of 12%. And others, I mean, some OEMS we won't mention who define ROIC very creatively and get to 30%. But does your forecast for EBIT improvement improve that ROIC? Are there actions, [white tides] in here in terms of reducing cash or other parts of invested capital? You mentioned finished goods inventory that improved there.</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: So we'll get back to about 13.5% in 2020, based on our definition. And that doesn't assume any aggressive new capital allocation. That's just kind of keeping the share count flat. And so depending on what we do on capital deployment, we can improve that outcome. And certainly, if acquisitions ultimately will initially be a drag, depending on the profit. Because we're not buying -- we're buying companies that have less profitability than we do. And so we try to spend an appropriate amount. If we get those 15% to 20% returns, we get the synergies we're expecting, eventually the ROIC will go up. But even without any deployment, we're going to move this up 150 basis points or so over the next 3 years.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Let's ask question number five. Well, both full of 2018 earnings. So it's inside the [trade desk]. This is the same range for everyone.</p><p>(voting)</p><p>So it's a pretty spikey distribution, right around 16 to 18. How do you think about that? And how do you think about it especially in light of acquisitions?</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: When we -- going back to talking about our peer group, which we showed at the Investor Day, we think that's a great peer group to compare ourselves to into -- and to benchmark of our performance. And in many of the cases, we're performing at the median or above around earnings growth, margin performance, EPS growth, without having a real capital deployment. We're not buying shares. And so just organically through earnings growth. And so we do think that it's a compelling argument that, relative to that peer group and our performance, that the multiple has room to expand. And so that's certainly 60%. 16x or above is a good sign; (multiple speakers) alignment there.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Let's bring up question number six. What do you see as the most significant investment issue? It'd be interesting to see how this compares to last year. The multiples were up 2x, roughly, over last year. But I mean, the market is up, but then you had actually there some people supporting a much higher multiple. So core growth, 58%, similar to 5 years, a little bit higher than last year. And yes, so I think describing -- how do you think about number three? So like more people are thinking capital deployments can (inaudible). I guess, that's to get to the fact that you're now within your leverage targets, and hence that's probably a good thing.</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: Yes, I think it is. I mean, the core growth, I guess it's an issue for 58% of the folks.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: The other interesting thing. I was looking at number four. The -- just raw execution has dropped off appreciably.</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: That's good. If I'm reading the chart right, that's about (multiple speakers).</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Yes, yes. So it's probably -- you've sort of come through that period where the organic growth is mushy with the end markets moving around.</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: The only comment I'd say about the core growth is 4% this year, 4% to 6% over the next 3 years. And I guess for me, the backdrop there is that we're growing and still growing very profitably. And so we're -- the value of that growth in my mind is very good. And so combining the 2 I think it's really important from how Sensata operates and what our strategic objectives are.</p><p>BRIAN ARTHUR JOHNSON: Great. Thank you, Paul. Thank you, Josh. Thank you, folks. Remember, we have a reception at the end of the day after the analyst roundtable.</p><p>PAUL S. VASINGTON: Thanks a lot.

(DISCA), despite <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14249384/1/billionaire-john-malone-s-free-radical-roll-up-propels-discovery-s-buyout-of-scripps.html|agreeing\">https://www.thestreet.com/story/14249384/1/billionaire-john-malone-s-free-radical-roll-up-propels-discovery-s-buyout-of-scripps.html|agreeing</url> to spend $11.9 billion to buy Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. (SNI). The same goes for AMC Networks Inc. (AMCX)\u00a0and Viacom Inc. (VIAB). Time Warner Inc. (TWX) didn't have one either, until CEO <person><nameText>Jeff Bewkes </nameText></person>convinced his board a year ago that the company needed to sell to AT&amp;T Inc. (T).</p><p>Arguably, CBS Corp. (CBS) is building that relationship with All Access and Showtime, though even the path to lasting salvation for broadcast networks is paved with questions about demographics and the future of TV sports rights.</p><p>But back to Fox.</p><p>If CNBC's reporting of the potential transaction was in part of means of floating a trial balloon to gauge investor sentiment, the verdict is clear: The market likes this deal. Fox shares had sunk 5.4% this year before <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/06/21st-century-fox-has-been-holding-talks-to-sell-most-of-company-to-disney-sources.html|CNBC\">https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/06/21st-century-fox-has-been-holding-talks-to-sell-most-of-company-to-disney-sources.html|CNBC</url> reported\u00a0on Monday, Nov. 6, that Fox officials had spoken with their Disney counterparts about selling their TV and film production studios, cable networks such as FX, the Star India networks and the company's 39% stake in European satellite TV operator Sky plc.</p><p>Disney also would acquire Fox's stake in Hulu LLC, the subscription platform jointly owned with Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and Time Warner, riding recent momentum built off \"The Handmaid's Tale.\"</p><p>Fox and Disney representatives declined to comment on the deal talks.</p><p>Fox shares have surged 13.1% this week through Tuesday afternoon, to $28.25, in the wake of the report. Disney hasn't gained as much, but importantly, the shares have advanced. Disney is up 3.4% this week.</p><p>Fox in the above scenario would retain its broadcast network, its regional sports networks, the fast-growing FS1 sports channel, the Fox News Channel and its TV broadcast affiliates. The Murdochs would be left with a trimmed-down company built around news and, especially, sports. Not to mention a lot of cash to build something new and, potentially, unencumbered by pay-TV or brick-and-mortar movie theaters.\u00a0</p><p>The premise of the deal, though, is both astonishing and sobering. The Murdochs apparently have determined that Fox, a company with $28.5 billion in annual revenue, may not have the scale, or a logical path to scale, to compete in this next chapter of the global media and entertainment business. It\u00a0failed three years ago to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/12834725/1/murdoch-rebuffed-as-fox-withdraws-bid-for-time-warner.html|buy\">https://www.thestreet.com/story/12834725/1/murdoch-rebuffed-as-fox-withdraws-bid-for-time-warner.html|buy</url> Time Warner\u00a0for $89 billion and lost out back in 2011 in its bid to acquire the remainder of Sky it doesn't own. U.K. regulators may ultimately reject its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14336396/1/fox-gets-decision-it-didnt-want-on-sky-deal.html|latest\">https://www.thestreet.com/story/14336396/1/fox-gets-decision-it-didnt-want-on-sky-deal.html|latest</url> bid as well.</p><p>Of course, the outlines of media's future have been clear for a few years. Cord-cutting is putting the squeeze on cable networks while technology players are fast entering the content business, proving that anyone can make TV serials if they have a few extra billion dollars. And many do. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) already has jumped into the film and TV business, and Apple Inc. (AAPL) is building some kind of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14273692/1/apple-has-a-big-tv-budget-but-still-needs-a-hit.html|production\">https://www.thestreet.com/story/14273692/1/apple-has-a-big-tv-budget-but-still-needs-a-hit.html|production</url> studio. Facebook Inc. (FB)\u00a0just launched its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14361627/1/facebooks-watch-platform-eventually-will-replace-pay-tv.html|Watch\">https://www.thestreet.com/story/14361627/1/facebooks-watch-platform-eventually-will-replace-pay-tv.html|Watch</url> tab, and Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google just started       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14193133/1/youtube-tv-just-needs-a-fraction-of-overall-youtube-viewers-to-crush-cable.html|YouTube\">https://www.thestreet.com/story/14193133/1/youtube-tv-just-needs-a-fraction-of-overall-youtube-viewers-to-crush-cable.html|YouTube</url> TV, its digital television platform.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"Big media companies are in this enormous transition between linear, where they controlled their own distribution, to a nonlinear, digital world where they have the opportunity at least to have a direct relationship with the consumer,\" Kelly said. \"But that costs a lot of money.\"</p><p>And money is something that Big Tech has in spades. Its players also have built direct-to-consumer platforms, leveraging their talent for technology in ways that Disney and Fox have been (very) slow to embrace. Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google all have direct relationships with consumers. And so does Netflix Inc. (NFLX), of course.\u00a0</p><p>Fox, despite its enormous TV and film production studios, remains beholden to pay-TV operators and movie theaters. That paradigm is slowly changing as Fox pushes more of its content to Hulu and 20th Century Fox president Stacey Snider calls to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14347304/1/netflix-doubles-down-on-movies.html|shorten\">https://www.thestreet.com/story/14347304/1/netflix-doubles-down-on-movies.html|shorten</url> the window between a film's release and its availability for streaming.</p><p>If Disney is willing to take cable networks FX, FXX and National Geographic in a deal headed by 20th Century Fox and its television studios, that would free the Murdochs of trying to figure out how to sustain a business under pressure from fewer subscribers and advertiser migration to Google and Facebook. Yet even then, FX may be too edgy for the Disney brand.</p><p>The deal essentially would cut Fox in half, according to Bernstein Research's Todd Juenger. Roughly $40 billion in assets would be sold to Disney, and roughly $40 billion in assets would remain at a slimmed-down Fox. (A related question is whether a reduced Fox would then remerge with News Corp. (NWSA).</p><p>Of course, there's a very real possibility that this transaction never occurs. Companies talk all the time. It's the fiduciary responsibility of top executives to forever contemplate mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>What is clear is that the Murdochs appear open to selling some of their businesses. There are lots of moving pieces in a company as larger as Fox, but apparently many of those pieces are in play. There's no reason an Apple or Amazon, or even CBS, wouldn't consider acquiring the 20th Century Fox film studio or its television studios.\u00a0</p><p>It's very possible that these talks finally spark the M&amp;A wave that media industry observers have been expecting for years. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google already have crashed the party.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thedeal.com/the-deal-economy-event-form/?utm_source=Deal%20Articles&amp;utm_medium=Web&amp;utm_campaign=Deal%20Economy%20Conference|Join\">http://www.thedeal.com/the-deal-economy-event-form/?utm_source=Deal%20Articles&amp;utm_medium=Web&amp;utm_campaign=Deal%20Economy%20Conference|Join</url> us in New York City on Nov. 30 for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://conferences.thedeal.com/the-deal-economy-conference?utm_source=Deal%20Articles&amp;utm_medium=Web&amp;utm_campaign=Deal%20Economy%20Conference|The\">https://conferences.thedeal.com/the-deal-economy-conference?utm_source=Deal%20Articles&amp;utm_medium=Web&amp;utm_campaign=Deal%20Economy%20Conference|The</url> Deal Economy Conference, where leading industry experts and other influential members of the deal community will gather to discuss key issues that will confront dealmakers in 2018.</emphasis></p><h>DEAL SIZE</h><p>Undisclosed</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-14381077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PY5-1FN1-DY7P-R42W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1242\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Deal, L.L.C.

Dianne Feinstein, D-California, issued the following news release on Sept. 24:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) today introduced the Stop Online Fraudulent Sales of Firearms Act, a bill to prevent gun sellers from circumventing technology companies' terms of service by making it illegal to fraudulently sell firearms and ammunition online.</p><p>\"While some technology companies have banned selling firearms and ammunition on their websites, the problem persists,\" Senator Feinstein said. \"Our bill would make it illegal for gun sellers to circumvent websites' terms of service and continue the underground proliferation of firearms. It's part of a larger effort that needs to be taken to stop the plague of gun violence in our communities.\"</p><p>\"The fact is, no matter how many times big tech companies claim they're cracking down on illegal online firearm sales, determined gun sellers and buyers find new ways to get around it,\" Senator Menendez said, who has continually called out Facebook for its failure to enforce and monitor its own ban on gun sales. \"With this bill, we are making very clear to gun sellers who are caught illegally moving their weapons online: if you make the sale, you will pay the price.\"</p><p>Some technology companies have banned selling firearms and ammunition on their platforms. However, sellers use tactics like misrepresenting guns as other items to circumvent those restrictions.</p><p>For instance, sellers advertise on platforms like Facebook's Marketplace, claiming to sell stickers alongside images of gun makers' logos. Sellers typically ask an interested party to send a private message where buyers then learn the posting was actually for a gun sale and receive details and pricing.</p><p>Last month, Facebook reported it had removed 1.3 million pieces of content related to firearms between April and June 2020 from its platforms.</p><p>\"Internet marketplaces like Facebook are the virtual dark alley where unscrupulous gun sellers go to meet dangerous individuals who are trying to get their hands on a firearm,\" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \"Stopping these illegal sales would save lives, and we applaud Senators Feinstein and Menendez for introducing legislation to do exactly that.\"</p><p>\"Overwhelming majorities of Americans support policies that ensure that individuals who should not possess firearms are not able to purchase them, including online,\" said Kris Brown, president of Brady. \"Brady is grateful to Senators Feinstein and Menendez for addressing a dangerous practice of falsely advertising firearm sales online. Such sales are designed to circumvent the regulations that help keep our families and communities safe. This is a common-sense fix to a growing problem that applies the spirit of our nation's existing gun safety laws to novel, 21st century issues.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7245806 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7245806</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XF-76D1-DYG2-R30F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"483\"/><timeReceived>7:51 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Edward J. Markey, D-Massachusetts, issued the following news release on March 5:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- The KIDS Act addresses harms to children online, including amplification of disturbing and inappropriate content, damaging design features, and manipulative marketing</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), members of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, introduced the Kids Internet Design and Safety (KIDS) Act. As children and teens increasingly spend their time on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat, Congress has yet to implement key safeguards that protect young people's wellbeing in the current digital media environment. New research shows that by the age of 12 more than two-thirds of kids have their own smartphone, and more than twice as many young people watch videos every day than did in 2015. While kids are increasingly living their lives online, new reports have revealed the prevalence of violent and harmful content on popular platforms, the popularity of influencer marketing, and the adoption of design features, like auto-play, that effectively encourage young users to prolong their time spent on apps. Like the Children's Television Act did in 1990, the KIDS Act includes important advertising rules and protects children's interests as the ways that they consume media and entertain themselves evolves.</p><p>\"Today, kids' faces are increasingly covered in the glow of their screens, and it's time to face the chilling reality that some websites and apps are built in ways that harm children,\" said Senator Markey, co-author of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). \"Powerful companies push kids to buy products at every turn online, and top platforms are saturated with disturbing content that no kid should ever be exposed to. As a society, we're playing catch up to the serious risks to kids online, and Congress has a responsibility to say loud and clear that Big Tech needs to get serious about the wellbeing of children and teens.\"</p><p>\"Big Tech has designed their platforms to ensnare and exploit children for more likes, more views, and more purchases,\" said Senator Blumenthal. \"Generations of kids are growing up in online spaces besieged by the crass commercialization of social media influencers, tobacco companies, fast food, and alcohol brands. The KIDS Act puts guardrails in place to reign in recklessness of marketers and Big Tech - protecting children and giving parents some peace of mind.\"</p><p>The KIDS Act addresses these trends and creates new protections for online users under 16 by:</p><p>Damaging Design Features:</p><p>* Banning \"auto-play\" settings lead to prolonged and unhealthy viewing sessions on websites and apps for kids and young teens.</p><p>* Banning push alerts that encourage kids and young teens to pull out their devices and increase screen-time.</p><p>* Banning badges that reward kids and young teens for increasing their time spent on an app or website.</p><p>Amplification of Harmful Content:</p><p>* Prohibiting kids and young teen websites from amplifying violent, inappropriate, and dangerous content.</p><p>* Requiring websites to implement mechanisms for users to report instances in which the website recommends harmful content to kids and young teens.</p><p>Manipulative Marketing:</p><p>* Prohibiting websites from recommending content that includes host-selling, or influencer marketing, such as \"unboxing videos\" to children and young teens.</p><p>* Prohibiting websites from recommending content that involves nicotine, tobacco, or alcohol to children and young teens.</p><p>* Prohibiting websites from exposing children and young teens to marketing with imbedded interactive elements.</p><p>\"Senator Markey has been in this fight for thirty years, and Common Sense thanks him for his steadfast commitment to prioritizing the well-being of kids,\" said James P. Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense Media. \"We urge Congress to pass the KIDS Act, legislation that would provide much-needed protections for kids online by regulating addictive and manipulative design and the commercial and inappropriate content that is currently served up to kids, containing violence, self-harm, and obscenity.\"</p><p>\"This groundbreaking bill will provide children with the 21st Century safeguards they urgently need today,\" said Jeffrey Chester, Executive Director, Center for Digital Democracy.\"Children and teens are being subjected to an unprecedented array of harmful digital marketing practices that undermine their health, security and development. Children in the U.S. have been turned into digital \"guinea pigs\" as marketers and online platforms bombard them with commercial interactive applications designed to unfairly influence their emotions and behaviors. The \"Kids Act\" will ensure that young people will be able to grow up in a world where they are no longer exposed to these unaccountable outside forces.\"</p><p>\"It's long been recognized that children are developmentally vulnerable to advertising and deserve special protections, which is why there are rules that prohibit certain kinds of ads on children's television. But for far too long, the internet has been a wild west where anything goes when it comes to marketing to kids,\" said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood. \"The KIDS Act will provide critical safeguards so that children using online and mobile platforms to learn and connect won't be exposed to unfair, manipulative marketing that undermines their wellbeing. We applaud Senator Markey for his leadership in standing up for kids and families.\"</p><p>\"Much of the modern digital environment is designed by adults, for adults, to market and sell things. Despite the fact that children are avid users of browsers, games, social media, or easily-accessible general audience platforms, children are usually an afterthought in technology design or regulation,\" said Dr. Jenny Radesky, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, University of Michigan Medical School. \"As a result, the onus is on parents to help their child navigate a digital playground in which the platforms themselves are designed to promote arousing and commercial content. Senator Markey's KIDS Act seeks to change this status quo and push platforms and regulations to consider the interests and the health of kids in the context of online media platforms.\"</p><p>\"The 'free' internet comes at a huge cost for kids, who are manipulated into watching a barrage of ads, and marketing disguised as content. For far too long the internet has been a wild west where anything goes, but the KIDS Act will provide critical safeguards so that children using online and mobile platforms to learn and connect won't be exposed to unfair, manipulative marketing that undermines their wellbeing. We applaud Senators Markey and Blumenthal for their leadership in standing up for kids and families,\" said Josh Golin, executive director, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.</p><p>A copy of the legislation can be found here.

Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-VA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) will introduce the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight And Regulations on Data (DASHBOARD) Act, bipartisan legislation that will require data harvesting companies such as social media platforms to tell consumers and financial regulators exactly what data they are collecting from consumers, and how it is being leveraged by the platform for profit.</p><p>\"When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads,\" said Senator Hawley. \"Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold. This bipartisan legislation gives consumers control of their data and will show them how much these 'free' services actually cost.\"</p><p>\"For years, social media companies have told consumers that their products are free to the user. But that's not true - you are paying with your data instead of your wallet,\" said Senator Warner. \"But the overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they're giving up, who else their data is being shared with, or what it's worth to the platform. Our bipartisan bill will allow consumers to understand the true value of the data they are providing to the platforms, which will encourage competition and allow antitrust enforcers to identify potentially anticompetitive practices.\"</p><p>As user data increasingly represents one of the most valuable, albeit intangible, assets held by technology firms, shining light on how this data is collected, retained, monetized, and protected, is critical. The DASHBOARD Act will:</p><p>- Require commercial data operators (defined as services with over 100 million monthly active users) to disclose types of data collected as well as regularly provide their users with an assessment of the value of that data.</p><p>- Require commercial data operators to file an annual report on the aggregate value of user data they've collected, as well as contracts with third parties involving data collection.</p><p>- Require commercial data operators to allow users to delete all, or individual fields, of data collected - and disclose to users all the ways in which their data is being used. including any uses not directly related to the online service for which the data was originally collected.</p><p>- Empower the SEC to develop methodologies for calculating data value, while encouraging the agency to facilitate flexibility to enable businesses to adopt methodologies that reflect the different uses, sectors, and business models.</p><p>The DASHBOARD Act is the second tech-focused bill Hawley and Warner have partnered on. The first was Hawley's Do Not Track Act, which would be modeled after the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) \"Do Not Call\" list and allow users to opt out of non-essential data collection.</p><p>A section-by-section summary of the bill is available here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/414097487/Dashboard-Act-1-Pager\">https://www.scribd.com/document/414097487/Dashboard-Act-1-Pager</url>).</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6770224 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6770224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDS-DDP1-DYG2-R39T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"539\"/><timeReceived>6:55 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, September 30th. The end of the third quarter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sparks flying in Cleveland last night. A contentious debate between President Trump and former VP Joe Biden on a slew of issues, coronavirus, the economy, violence in America. Here's just one of the many heated exchanges of the night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He talks about the art of the deal. China's made -- perfected the art of the steal. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest deficit -- trade deficit with Mexico.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: China ate your lunch, down 18 (ph) percent.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, MODERATE: All right, gentlemen, in -- in --</p><p>TRUMP: China ate your lunch, Joe. And, no wonder, your son goes in and he takes out -- what -- he takes out billions of dollars.</p><p>BIDEN: No (ph).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have full analysis this morning. Up next, we'll hear from Texas Senator Ted Cruz coming up with his reaction.</p><p>Breaking news, something I first reported, now backed up by the bombshell new documents declassified by the director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe. Obama administration officials briefed on an investigative referral to the FBI that Hillary Clinton started the entire Russian witch hunt and approved the plan to vilify President Trump and stir up a scandal, all to distract from her own e-mail scandal.</p><p>This as Jim Comey is set to testify today in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. We're on the latest declassified documents all morning long ahead of the Comey testimony.</p><p>Markets are in the red this morning on this, the final trading day of the month and the third quarter and the morning after the debate. Dow futures right now down 170 points, the Nasdaq futures down 64 and the S&amp;P 500 down 16.25. Coronavirus cases, stimulus uncertainty also among the upsets for the market.</p><p>Yesterday as well, all three indices on pace to snap a five-month winning streak. Take a look, DowIndustrials were down 131 points at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday. The Nasdaq down 30 plus points. And for the month, the markets are showing a decline of between 4 and 7 percent for the major averages.</p><p>Coming up, we're looking at what's next for the markets in the fourth quarter and where the opportunity lies.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>And European markets are also weaker. Investors rattled over a rise in coronavirus case there. Talks of a lockdown in the U.K. As you see, FT 100 down 13, the CAC quarante down 26 and the DAX index lower by 61.</p><p>A mixed story overnight in Asia. We had the China manufacturing purchasing managers index for the month of September. It came in above expectations at 51.5. Of course, this is coming from the Communist Party of China, so we are always skeptical of the numbers.</p><p>It was a fiery debate last night in Cleveland for sure. President Trump and Joe Biden going head to head during the first debate of 2020 and the presidential election. The two clashed on a number of issues, including the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have the Senate. We have the White House. And we have a phenomenal nominee.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. And that say occurs when they vote for United States senators and when they vote for the president of the United States.</p><p>TRUMP: Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point, ten years ago or so, she said, a president and the Senate is elected for a period of time. But a president's elected for four years. We're not elected for three years. I'm not elected for three years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Texas Senator, Senate Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committee member, and author of the new book \"One Vote Away,\" Senator Ted Cruz.</p><p>Senator, it's good to see you. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>I've got to get your reaction. I know you met with Judge Barrett yesterday and your new book outlines the importance of filling the seat. So let me get to that in a moment.</p><p>Give me your reaction to the debate last night, Senator.</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Well, good morning, Maria.</p><p>It was raucous. It was wild. You know, it reminded me a little bit of watching a Detroit Pistons game in the 1980. There were a lot of hard fouls, a lot of missed shots.</p><p>At the end of the day, I don't know that it changed a whole lot of votes. I think all the people that were with President Trump are still with President Trump. And I suspect all the people that were with Joe Biden are still with Biden.</p><p>There were some good moments. There were some moments that stood out. By far, the president's best moment was when he clearly went after Joe Biden on the economy and the shutdown and he made clear that Joe Biden wants to shut down the economy, shut down small business and is destroying jobs and that the president wants to open up the economy and get people back to work and also get people back to school. And I thought Biden was pretty flat- footed in his response. That was the best moment for the president. But there were some pretty bumpy moments last night as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I agree with you that -- I mean I don't feel like you learned all that much and I don't think that it changed people's minds at this point, but, obviously, a raucous night.</p><p>Look, the issue of the Supreme Court came up. You write all about this and have studied this for so many years. You met with Judge Barrett yesterday. Tell me about that as you outlined in the book the importance of filling this seat. What was your expectation going into meeting Judge Barrett? Biden pushed back last night and said no, no, no, we should not be filling the seat until after the election.</p><p>CRUZ: Well, I met with Judge Barrett yesterday, spent about 45 minutes with her at the Capitol. I thought she was very impressive, very serious. She's got impeccable credentials, number one in her class at Notre Dame Law School, law clerk to Justice Scalia, law professor at Notre Dame for 20 years, one of the top federal appellate judges in the country. And, somehow, miraculously, she does all of that while at the same time being a mom to seven kids, which -- which I can't even imagine just doing the latter, much less doing everything else she does on top of that. I thought she's very impressive and a strong nominee.</p><p>You know, in the debate, I wish the president had talked a little bit more about why this debate -- this pick matters. His answer was essentially, I won, I'm president, I get to do this. OK, fine, but -- but -- but why does it make a difference to the American people? And -- and I think that -- that question is really important.</p><p>You mentioned my new book came out yesterday, \"One Vote Away.\" The entire book is really why this makes a difference to the American people, because what it does is it breaks down the key issues before the court. But before I was in the Senate, I was a Supreme Court litigator. That's what I did for a living is argue cases at the Supreme Court. And every chapter of the book takes on a different constitutional liberty from free speech, to religious liberty, to the Second Amendment, to elections and democracy. And it really just tells war stories. It brings people inside, behind the curtain, to understand, all right, what's going on at the court, what are these issues, why does it matter to me. And it's really quite striking. On issue after issue after issue, our basic liberties that we count on, that we value, they were decided in landmark cases, many of which were 5-4 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CRUZ: Many of which I played a really active part in litigating, that -- that -- that we're one vote away from losing those liberties. So I would have liked to see the president explain a little bit more why this nomination -- the American people chose him for a reason. They chose him to put Judge Barrett on the court and -- and I hope in the next debate that the president explains why that matters to the voters sitting at home watching the debate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, I saw yesterday the president tweeted out your book saying that our great First Amendment, great Second Amendment, our right to worship God, so much more comes down to one vote on the court. Ted Cruz has a fantastic new book out about it. Congrats on getting that -- that tweet from the president.</p><p>Walk us through what's at stake today, Senator, because this election may very well be contested on November 3rd.</p><p>CRUZ: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to need a ninth voice there. We are expecting that the court is going to hear an argument against Obamacare pretty soon after the election. So what are the main issues that you think will be in front of Judge Barrett should she get appointed and confirmed?</p><p>CRUZ: Well, I think the whole gamut. And one of the things to remember is that Supreme Court nominations are typically measured in decades and not even years. It's one of the reasons why you don't necessarily focus on one particular case coming up next term or the term after because 30 years from now nobody remembers what those were.</p><p>And, you know, in the book, for example, I have a chapter on free speech that talks about the Citizens United case. Now most people have heard of Citizens United, but they don't really know what was at issue there. They know the Democrats hate the case.</p><p>Citizens United was about the First Amendment right that all of us have as Americans to criticize politicians. And what happened there is a small non- profit called Citizens United made a movie critical of Hillary Clinton. And the Obama Justice Department took the position that they could fine them and punish them for daring to make a movie critical of Hillary Clinton. And the case went all the way to the Supreme Court.</p><p>There was a really chilling exchange at the oral argument where Justice Sam Alito asked the Obama Justice Department, said under your theory of the case, could the federal government ban books? Could they ban books if the books are critical of a politician? And the Obama DOJ said, yes, yes, the federal government can ban books. It was a radical interpretation of the First Amendment.</p><p>Now, thankfully, the Supreme Court rejected that 5-4. But there were four justices prepared to say the federal government can ban movies, can ban books if they're critical of politicians.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes (ph).</p><p>CRUZ: That dramatically weakens our First Amendment rights. And what's striking, Maria, both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden have pledged to nominate justices to reverse that decision. And that's, in a very real sense, how our free speech rights are hanging in the balance at the court, one vote away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. Unbelievable.</p><p>All right, you mentioned Hillary Clinton. I want to take a break. But when we come back, I've got to ask you about this new declassified document that we got from John Ratcliffe yesterday that basically says it was Hillary Clinton's idea to insert Donald Trump into a story about Russia collusion.</p><p>CRUZ: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll talk about this when we come right back with you, Senator.</p><p>Stay with us. We're talking with Senator Ted Cruz.</p><p>We've got breaking news next up.</p><p>Then we've got an exclusive report on China. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Texas Congressman Michael McCaul are here to tell us about that exclusive report on their -- from their China task force. It's a \"First on Fox\" interview. Don't miss it.</p><p>Dagen McDowell and Mark Penn are here all morning long. They are weighing in. You'll hear from them coming up as well.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm back with Senator Ted Cruz this morning.</p><p>And we have breaking news, something that I first reported years ago, now it is backed up by bombshell new Crossfire Hurricane documents. They were declassified by Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe outlined in a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham that Hillary Clinton approved a plan to link then candidate Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin and Russian hacking of the DNC. The letter also says that the Obama administration was briefed on this as well.</p><p>I broke this story while talking with Senator Graham on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday, but now we have the actual documents declassified.</p><p>Senator Ted Cruz, what's your reaction to this?</p><p>CRUZ: Look, it's a stunning revelation and anyone watching this develop, it's not at the end of the day surprising because it was clear this was a political hit job. This was a political hit job from the beginning. One of the very worst legacies of the Obama/Biden administration is they politicized -- and they did -- they did an awful lot to destroy the Department of Justice and the FBI and the intelligence agencies. And they basically turned DOJ and the FBI into oppo research centers and political attack dogs.</p><p>And, in this instance, what was declassified is that Hillary Clinton was personally briefed in July of 2016. So in the middle of the presidential election, she was briefed on a plan, on a scheme, let's accuse Trump of essentially Russia collusion and Hillary, according to the declassified information, she personally signed off on that attack. And then Obama was briefed on it and the Department of Justice began executing that attack.</p><p>It -- it -- that's not the job of DOJ and the FBI. And the political leadership at those agencies have a lot to answer for. I hope they're held accountable for their abuse of power because it did enormous damage to the integrity of the institution.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It certainly did, Senator. And we've been talking about this for a few years.</p><p>On Sunday, I broke news that we are not going to get an interim report from John Durham. It is unlikely that we're going to see any indictments before the election. Perhaps after the election John Durham will tell us some of his conclusions to his criminal investigation into exactly that.</p><p>Do you believe we will see indictments? Will we see accountability for this group of leaders at the top of the FBI, and possibly the CIA, who turned our intelligence agencies into weapons against a political opponent?</p><p>CRUZ: I don't know. I am frustrated, deeply frustrated that people haven't been held accountable yet. I can tell you, when I'm back in Texas, I hear from Texans all the time that just -- just say, what -- what the hell is wrong? Like, they can break the law, they can abuse power and they seem to get off scot free.</p><p>James Comey is going to be testifying before the Judiciary Committee today. I hope that testimony starts to hold him accountable. But I'll tell you, all of these individuals right now seem to be -- there seems to be no consequences for a gross abuse of power.</p><p>By the way, when the Obama/Biden administration targeted General Michael Flynn, who had spent decades serving our country honorably defending this nation and they went after him, they attacked him, it was Barack Obama and Joe Biden personally who were directing much of that attack, briefed on it in the Oval Office, both of them, and yet I'm very disappointed if there's going to be no transparency and no accountability before the election. I think that's the Department of Justice not acting swiftly enough to clean up their own mess and to clean up their own department.</p><p>And if Joe Biden wins, it will get swept under the rug and no one will ever be held accountable. Part of the reason they need to act with some expediency is one of the principle objectives. I mean, it was -- Joe Biden was implicated directly in this conduct. So if he comes in, covering it up, sweeping it under the rug, ignoring the lawyer at the FBI who fraudulently altered a document and lied to the FISA court, all of that's going to be on the agenda.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. You're 100 percent right, Senator. I've been saying this for a long time, Mark Penn. And even though you worked with Hillary Clinton, Mark, you saw this as well. Over the last several years, with me on-set, you knew that there was something that stunk to high heaven here. Your reaction to all of this?</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO CLINTONS: Well, Senator, I don't see how you can say there were no consequences. You get a book contract. You get speaking fees. You get -- you know, look, I think we know a lot more of the facts for -- this time when Comey comes before to the Senate to testify, right? Previously we didn't know about the White House meeting. Did -- did, in fact, Joe Biden talk about the Logan Act? What happened at that meeting? Did, in fact, the FBI director bypass the Justice Department and give this information to the political appointees and not the Justice Department? Did he lie about when he knew that the Hillary Clinton campaign had paid for the dossier and about the sub source? We know so much more now that this questioning ought to be a lot more difficult for Comey. If it's not, then the people running the Senate are just not -- not up to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but, Senator, before you answer that, isn't this a little bit of a sham because it's a public hearing. I mean, come on, he's just going to say that's confidential, I can't get into it, this is specific to what I've been working on. Are we really going to get information from Comey today when you and your colleagues throw these questions at him, as Mark just laid out?</p><p>CRUZ: Look, probably not. Comey is slippery. We've seen Sally Yates before testify. She's very slippery. They're very good at dodging. They don't answer questions. They deflect. It's always somebody else's problem. It's always some -- some other issue.</p><p>And one of the challenges -- a public hearing can be useful for shining a light, for helping get -- make some of those facts public. But a legislative hearing lacks the ability to indict someone, to bring criminal proceedings, to have actual legal consequences attached to their misconduct. That's what needs to happen. I expect -- and, unfortunately, Comey's testimony today is going to be via zoom or distance, which makes it even worse because he's -- I expect him to dodge every question. Doesn't mean that we're not going to press and I'm certainly going to press, but it's no substitute for a grand jury and an indictment holding people accountable for breaking the law. That's what needs to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, who do you think the mastermind of this all was? Was it Hillary Clinton or somebody else?</p><p>CRUZ: From what I've seen, John Brennan was right at the middle of all of this. John Brennan running the Intelligence Agency seems to be pulling an awful lot of the strings. But Comey was right in the middle of it and Hillary an Obama and Biden all personally signed off on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-huh.</p><p>All right, Senator, it's great to see you.</p><p>Senator Ted Cruz. Congrats on the book, \"One Vote Away.\"</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Time for the \"Word on Wall Street.\" Top investors watching your money.</p><p>Joining me right now is Belpointe Asset Management Chief Strategist David Nelson, and Portfolio Wealth Advisors President and Chief Investment Officer Lee Munson.</p><p>Gentlemen, great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>First up, futures slipping this morning after a contentious first presidential debate.</p><p>Lee, what's your outlook heading into October and November? Do you believe that market sentiment is changing after last night's debate?</p><p>LEE MUNSON, PRESIDENT AND CIO, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS: I think market sentiment is starting to cement that it's going to be volatile. See, I think the election itself is going to drive the volatility going forward. It's less about who's going to win. I think last night proved to the American public and investors that going into November we're -- we may -- we're probably not going to have an answer on November 3rd and this could get dragged out for weeks and weeks. If that happens, that's what I've been saying for the past, you know, several weeks, I think that that just solidified last night. It's going to be an opportunity for investors to take advantage of that downward volatility. I think I see selloffs. I think there's concerns about tightening financial conditions.</p><p>While that might be temporary, that's going to happen between now and the end of the year. It's a phenomenal opportunity for people to start buying that weakness because, ultimately, we're going to -- we're going to move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, so you -- you really want to be buying this market then.</p><p>Let me ask you about the retail fallout. In the first six months of 2020, 18 major retailers filed for Chapter 11. This year on pace to eclipse 2010's 48 retail bankruptcies in the wake of the great recession, David.</p><p>What's your outlook and what does this retail fallout tell us about the economy in the fourth quarter and 2021. Here we are in the final day of the third quarter today.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE ASSET MANAGEMENT: It's -- it's probably at the tip of the iceberg. You saw the news last night. Disney announced 28,000 layoffs. There are close proximity businesses. And close proximity businesses are going to be challenged, retail, restaurants, transportation. I'm in information based technology, financial services. So we have remote services to get us through that.</p><p>But you -- these people need some kind of targeted package at this point and there's a reason, Maria, why -- why the ratings for the House and the Senate are probably the lowest in generations because they're failing in their -- in their -- in their job to bring relief to these people. They should put the partisan politics aside.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, look at the IPO market. It is on fire. Palantir will go public today, the software and data analytics company from FaceBook co- founder Peter Thiel hitting the New York Stock Exchange later this morning. It is doing a direct listing.</p><p>What are you expecting here?</p><p>Lee, first to you. I want to get your take, both of you, on the Palantir deal today.</p><p>MUNSON: Well, I love it. It's your way to buy big brother. I think -- I think it's the right IPO for the right time. Listen, we have a frothy market. They're not looking to raise money, which I think is always telling. It's also priced a little bit below their 2015 valuation, around $20 billion.</p><p>But, again, we have a tech company where the founders have complete control. There's a lot of mystery around it. And we're almost 20 years into it. Let's see how it goes. I'm -- I'm interested in the company, quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: David, would you buy this IPO?</p><p>NELSON: I can't, and for the following reason, because they're trying to distance themselves from Silicon Valley. But when it comes to voting rights, they're just like everybody else, the founders, the -- Alexander Karp, Peter Thiel, they're going to have super voting shares. In essence, they can control this company for the rest of their life. They can sell as many shares as they want. They're just like Mark Zuckerberg and others in Silicon Valley in that regard. That's why I won't be buying this company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All the media companies and a lot of the technology companies are just that, you're right, they have super voting control.</p><p>David Nelson, Lee Munson, we'll be watching the deal certainly and this market.</p><p>Great to see you both. Thank you so much.</p><p>Dow Industrials down 169.</p><p>A quick break and then an exclusive report on China. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Texas Congressman Michael McCaul are here to bring us the report. It's a \"First on Fox\" interview and they're up next. It's next.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for being here. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, September 30th. A look at markets this morning, 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast. Futures are indicating a decline at the start of trading. But we are off of the lows of the morning in the final trading day of the month and this, of course, the final trading day of the quarter.</p><p>Dow Industrials down 168 points right now. The Nasdaq down 64, and the S&amp;P 500 lower by 16.5. This after the debate last night, as well as rising coronavirus cases and stimulus uncertainty causing a down day for markets yesterday and this morning. All three major indices are now on pace to snap a five-month winning streak with the Dow Industrials decline yesterday of 131, the Nasdaq was down 32.</p><p>It's been a mixed story. As you see, the markets over the month down between 4 percent and 7 percent for the month of September. In Asia, China's manufacturing purchasing manager's index is out for the month of September. It came in above expectations, 51.5. It is coming from the Communist Party, of course, these numbers, but the Shanghai composite even with that better than expected showing was down overnight by a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, House Republicans' China Task Force releasing a new report which addresses the Chinese Communist Party's, quote, maligned global agenda. The report outlines a blueprint for bipartisan actions Congress and the administration can take to address the threat of China. Policy recommendations include providing a safe harbor for Hong Kong refugees, a bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan, and prioritizing national security.</p><p>Joining me right now in a \"First on Fox Business\" interview is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the chairman of the China Task Force, Congressman Michael McCaul.</p><p>Great to see you, gentlemen. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX): Thanks, Maria.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Thanks for having us on, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Congressman McCarthy, we didn't hear a lot of China last night. I'm glad you're releasing this report this morning. Tell us what's most important.</p><p>MCCARTHY: You know, we tried to do the task force bipartisan. We tried to do it more than a year ago. And, actually, Nancy Pelosi agreed to it. And right before we announced it, she backed out. This is long before Covid.</p><p>And the one thing that we've learned, I think, three major items that come out of this, 60 percent of all the ideas out of here are bipartisan. We need to change our supply chain, not just for medical but every other element of what we deal with within China. We need to innovate when it comes to DOD, especially with AI, something that you have focused a lot on, Maria, in hypersonics (ph) and others. And then we've got to refocus when we look at the Treasury Department. They have a team there for Iran and for North Korea, but they have no team in there especially when it comes to sanctions when it comes to China. You know how much they've been stealing from us.</p><p>So the modernization and the preparation that we need, especially after what we've learned from Covid when it came to the supply chain, you should apply that to almost every element that we have within government of how far behind we were and we can't allow China to continue to do that to us in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I think that's incredible that we don't have that in Treasury --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When we have specific areas of Treasury focused on Iran, North Korea, but -- but not on China. That -- that makes no sense. I'm so glad that you brought this up in this very important report.</p><p>Congressman McCaul --</p><p>MCCARTHY: We know we --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, we just need more mandarin speakers as well. There's so many elements of what we've got -- we were woken up to the real challenge after Covid in the supply chain and looking at every department in government, there's a lot of weaknesses there that China has taken advantage of us of that we really have to open up our eyes and do something much different. And that's what this report really shows the rest of the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this is a very important report.</p><p>Congressman McCaul, let me ask you why it's OK for Joe Biden to dodge questions about China. He dodged all questions relating to his kids when we know that Hunter Biden was on that plane, Air Force Two, and then took money from the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>One issue I think is that China has been very strategic in terms of identifying people that will help them, whether that's in business, in academia or even in Congress.</p><p>How come Nancy Pelosi won't allow the Democrats to be part of this task force?</p><p>MCCAUL: Well, I think they made a big mistake here. They just want to focus on the president. They don't want to focus on where the virus came from. That's China. We want things to be made in America, not made in China. The virus is made in China. But we want manufacturing and jobs made in the United States of America.</p><p>And so what the leader is talking about is supply chain. How can we decouple what's really national security related and bring it back home where it's going to protect our national security, but also provide more manufacturing jobs, be really good for the economy.</p><p>I think, you know, the idea that they dodged that question is clear. You know, I prosecuted the Johnnie Chang (ph) case in 1996 where there -- the Chinese director of intelligence was putting money in the Clinton campaign. We know the Chinese are trying -- the Communist Party are trying to influence this election right now in favor of Joe Biden and I think that should be part of this discussion as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, absolutely. And one of the issues has been the supply chain.</p><p>Congressman McCarthy, you had made a commitment to America in terms of creating jobs should you become the speaker and take the majority in the House of Representatives this upcoming November. That commitment to America zeros in on job creation. How long is it going to take to get these 10 million jobs created that you believe you can fire up from moving supply chains back to America?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, we believe we'll create 10 million new jobs within the next year at the end of it.</p><p>But one of the elements of making that happen is exactly this, taking a lot of these recommendations that are inside this China task force because what it will do is bring the jobs back to America. And when we're looking at the supply chain, just simply, we don't make penicillin, we don't make vitamins in America anymore. Think for a point if this was something beyond Covid, if this was a national defense challenge, would we be able to resupply the businesses that we have or are we too coupled with China itself? What we're finding is the answer is, yes. And China has been utilizing us for quite some time.</p><p>If you go back to 2011, we have a president of the United States, Barack Obama, praising the rise of China and saying it was positive for America. Well, now we're finding out that is not the case. And so we have to rethink what we are doing. That's why we looked at every single department. There's more than 60 percent of this is actually bipartisan. These can be bills that we can move and pass. One-third of them we've already either passed the House or the Senate.</p><p>But you brought a good point up, Maria. Why are the Democrats not helping with this? Why did Nancy Pelosi pull back? I'm not sure what the Communist Party has on the Democrats, but it's pretty powerful.</p><p>And we're reading in the paper a lot of FBI reports that China, the sophistication that they have of what they've been able to do to the supply chain, they're now applying that when it comes to the election and they have determined who they want to win this election, Joe Biden.</p><p>And it was interesting to me how little he would talk about China or even bring up when he was vice president to allow Hunter Biden to fly with him to get billions of dollars from China. He never said anything that he did - - that Hunter did something wrong or that he would stop him if he was to become president of doing that again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, you would have thought that China would have taken up more time in the debate last night. There was about 15 minutes spent on the green new deal and the climate.</p><p>Real quick, before you go, I'm going to speak with Lee Carter in a moment. She's going to give us the dials and what she took away from the debate last night.</p><p>Let me get a quick comment from each of you on what struck you most from the first presidential debate last night.</p><p>Kick us off, Kevin McCarthy.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, the very first thing that struck me the most is that Joe Biden wouldn't answer from the standpoint of who would he appoint to the Supreme Court, a decision that everybody's looking at right now. Why does he not answer that?</p><p>And to ignore the idea of what his son has done, to just say it did not happen, that is a real challenge and it's an ethical question about what's going forward.</p><p>Now, I'd rather have had a real debate, let people be quiet, let people talk about the issues and the ideas moving forward. But many times too, the things that Joe Biden would say, like, shut up, man, and you're a clown, I don't think that's a place for the stage. And I wish -- I wish the commentator would have come back and not allowed Joe Biden not to answer certain questions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we definitely needed more decorum and statesmanship. I totally agree.</p><p>Michael McCaul, what struck you?</p><p>MCCAUL: Yes, look, this is the greatest challenge, both militarily and economically in our generation. For my dad it was World War II. Growing up, it was the Cold War, 9/11. This generation, this is the biggest challenge we have, the greatest foreign policy challenge we have. And it was very -- it wasn't even mentioned last night.</p><p>And, you know, I hope, in the second debate, there will be more focus on what is -- where are the greatest challenges?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCAUL: The president of the United States is the commander in chief of the United States military, conducts foreign policy and the Chinese Communist Party is the greatest national security threat to the long-term interest of the United States. It needs to be brought up. It needs to be debated and part of this presidential election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We also didn't hear anything about Middle Eastern peace, which actually we're seeing for the first time in 40 of years or so.</p><p>MCCAUL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, gentlemen, the conversation continues. Thank you very much for breaking that news on the show with your new China Task Force report.</p><p>Kevin McCarthy and Michael McCaul, we will see you soon.</p><p>Congressman, thank you.</p><p>All of this is in my new book. I hope you will pick it up. Pre-order the book, \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\" That is coming out next month. And you can pre-order it right now at thecostbook.com.</p><p>We'll be right back with Lee Carter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden squaring off last night. It was largely a fiery affair with both candidates talking over one another.</p><p>Pollster and the president of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter, is here with the dials to see how people reacted.</p><p>Let's take a look at President Trump talking about the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You've got to open these states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost just like being in prison. And you look at what's going on with divorce. Look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. It's a very, very sad thing.</p><p>And he'll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country.</p><p>Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records at is does it. We don't need somebody to come in and say, let's shut it down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lee Carter, walk us through all of this.</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: So you can see there Republicans are the red line, independents, yellow, Democrats, the blue line.</p><p>This was one of the better moments for the president last night. People really agree, the economy cannot be shut again. So you can see Republicans and independents, both really favorable towards this, Democrats, not surprisingly, very unfavorable. Almost everything the president said last night the Democrats just completely shot down.</p><p>But this is very consistent with what we've been hearing for quite some time. The worst message that I tested of Joe Biden so far is when he was interviewed and he said he would shut the economy down again. People do not want that. They want us to stay open. They want us to stay safe. And it's really important, they don't want us to be reckless or careless, but they want to know that the economy's going to be open and they want to know the opportunities are coming back.</p><p>The side effects of the economy being shut down are long-lasting and this is something that really, really is important to the American people and the president was smart to address it last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Lee, broadly speaking, did this debate change anybody's minds?</p><p>LEE: Absolutely not. I think -- you know, usually, there's so much talk about do debates even matter. And absolutely they do when you're talking about a close race. So you'll usually see the polls move 2 to 3 percent after -- after a debate. And that's really about the undecides. We still have between 6 and 9 percent of American voters who are undecided, which is kind of hard to imagine in this climate. So if you can move 2 or 3 percent of them, you can really significantly impact the polls.</p><p>What I heard last night from voters was that this didn't change their minds. You saw a third of the voters went for Biden, a third of the voters that I talked to went for Trump and fully a third of the voters said that nobody won. I've never seen that before. I've seen disagreements or 50/50 splits, I mean 5 percent or 10 percent of people who respond saying nobody won. But this was fully a third of folks.</p><p>And when you look at independent voters, when I looked at undecided voters, which I also look at last night, you didn't see any movement, you saw them flat line and in many ways turn out. And what that concerns me most about is these people might turn out for the rest and say, you know what, I give up. This is just too ugly, it's too much and I'm not even going to go to the polls because if this is my choice, I don't want any of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that's a good point.</p><p>That is what I was thinking last night. I was watching it and thinking, well, this is not going over well, that they're talking over each other. But I don't think it's changing anybody's minds. At this point people made their decision.</p><p>How about former Vice President Biden commenting on his role in the Democratic Party. Let's take a look and watch these dials again.</p><p>Lee, you'll walk us through it on the other side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: And one of the big debates we had, with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can, they do, they will under my proposal.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That's not what you've said and it's not what your party has said.</p><p>BIDEN: And that is -- that is simply a lie.</p><p>TRUMP: Your party doesn't say -- your party wants to go socialist medicine --</p><p>BIDEN: That is -- my party is me.</p><p>TRUMP: And socialist health care.</p><p>BIDEN: Right now I am the Democratic Party.</p><p>TRUMP: And they're going to dominate you, Joe, you know that.</p><p>BIDEN: I am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party --</p><p>TRUMP: Not according to Harris.</p><p>BIDEN: Is what I, in fact, approved of.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lee, walk us through it.</p><p>LEE: So, I think this was a -- this was is a really important moment for Joe Biden. He has largely been defined by President Trump as going to the far left, as pandering to Bernie Sanders, as becoming too progressive, as not being a moderate. He clearly stated last night the buck stops here. I am a Democratic Party and these are my decisions. I am going to be more moderate.</p><p>This is really important. And he needs to continue to tell this story because people don't know. Only a third of voters know exactly what Joe Biden is going to do should he become president. They're not sure where he stands on the issues. I'm not sure that last night clarified, but at least this was a start and I think it's a really important starting point for him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he says it, but what is he doing, Lee? He's got a green new deal that's going to cost $2 trillion. That's an AOC plan.</p><p>LEE: Yes, it's a really fair point. And I think looking at how Kamala Harris supported that and was, you know -- is another really important distinction. We're going to have to hear more about that during the VP debate because there's a lot of question over, where do they differ and where are they the same. Is Joe Biden going to be the one who's going to be dictating policy or is she. So I think we're going to hear more about that next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Lee, great to get your insights, as always. Lee Carter.</p><p>We are looking at markets next when we come back, down 200 points almost on the Dow Industrials, 183.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Markets are lower this morning, but pulling off of the lows after a contentious debate between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden last night.</p><p>Take a look. Dow futures down 184, Nasdaq down 73. It is the last trading day of the quarter and of the month. Markets are on pace to snap a five- month winning streak, meanwhile.</p><p>One sector that has been real volatile this last month, technology.</p><p>Joining me right now is RBC Capital Markets managing director and lead Internet analyst, Mark Mahaney.</p><p>Mark, it's great to have you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>How do you believe the election impacts tech stocks?</p><p>MARK MAHANEY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: We did a report on this about three weeks ago with all of our tech analysts. And we looked at the series of issues that I think the tech industry cares most about. Things like gig economy regulation, big tech, anti-trust issues, China, China trade and technology issues. And on most of them, the differences between the two candidates seemed to be pretty nuanced. Almost surprisingly so. You wouldn't have said that about anti-trust measures historically. But the differences between the two candidates are pretty nuanced. The one big difference that affects all companies is, of course, is the corporate tax rate. That's bearish for big tech, but -- as it would be for -- for all companies. So at the margin, I think what the -- what tech investors would like would be just some sort of certainty about the election. And I don't think they're going to get it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. And, you know, it doesn't seem like we're going to get it so far.</p><p>Mark, let me ask you where the growth is in technology today. You know, we talk about tech as this -- as if it's this one sector.</p><p>MAHANEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it's really not. There are so many subsectors. Where's the growth, Mark?</p><p>MAHANEY: Well, there's been some sectors that have been fundamentally -- fortunately or unfortunately, benefit -- that have benefited from the Covid crisis. There's no question about it. Online retail, names like Amazon, we've seen a surge, an acceleration, a material acceleration in online retail growth rates. Anything that has to do with at home entertainment, streaming has benefited. And then digital presence, web presence companies have also benefitted. Those have been winners. Losers side have been anything related to travel, anything related to ride sharing. So there are both winners and losers from this crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark, it's great to have you. Please come back. Sorry about the abbreviated time.</p><p>We'll be right back with Congressman Devin Nunes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Internet Association members Twitter, Google and Amazon; and Apple, which is a member of BSA-The Software Alliance.</p><p>\"If you are asking how to regulate about privacy, then it's one-sided to only hear from the industry, which has a monetary interest,\" Allie Bohm, policy counsel for the digital rights advocacy group Public Knowledge told Inside Cybersecurity Wednesday. \"I don't want to belittle that interest, it's legitimate to want to have light-touch regulation, but certainly an effort to protect consumers should involve entities that don't have a financial stake at play.\"</p><p>Bohm didn't entirely dismiss the possibility of coming to a consensus, having read the various industry principles.</p><p>\"I'm very nervous about legislation becoming obsolete if there isn't one place that has that [rulemaking] ability,\" she said, noting the need to adapt to rapid changes in technology.</p><p>She added, \"there are places where I see common ground, but the devil's in the details.\"</p><p>One of those areas may include increasing resources for the FTC.</p><p>BSA's privacy framework notes that organizations should employ \"reasonable and appropriate security measures\" and that the FTC \"should have the tools and resources necessary to carry out its mission effectively. -- Mariam Baksh (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mbaksh@iwpnews.com\">mbaksh@iwpnews.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICSRTY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICSRTY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T99-3T41-JBHM-S21H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">412529</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Cyber Security</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 18, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00027JF</classCode><className>CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Almost instantly, all was forgiven and forgotten.</p><p>Now the tech industry - which, among other impressive innovations, provides the world's knowledge on demand, lets people freely broadcast their diverse opinions and has made shopping as easy as pushing a button - has made some mistakes of its own. It has abused privacy, squeezed the competition and casually spread hate. And that's just the beginning of the list.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple might not get away as cleanly as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, released proposals this month that would force tech breakups and impose severe restrictions on what remained. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, covered more briefly some of the same ground, saying, \"We have a major monopoly problem.\"</p><p>At a moment when nearly everything in America seems wildly contentious, antitrust action against tech is getting a sober look. Antitrust is the nuclear bomb of regulatory policy, but the reaction to Warren's and Klobuchar's ideas was surprisingly receptive.</p><p>\"We've got to break these guys apart,\" Warren said in an interview on \"Face the Nation.\" The show could name only one critic of her proposal: Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul, who is flirting with an independent run for president to the deep disregard of voters.</p><p>\"A billionaire, right?\" Warren noted.</p><p>For decades, a politician who mentioned \"antitrust\" was essentially arguing for more government oversight, which has been dangerous territory at least since the Ronald Reagan administration. \"Antitrust\" was relegated to the shelf with \"socialism\" and \"wealth inequality\" and \"higher taxes for higher incomes.\"</p><p>It didn't help that what could be called \"maximum antitrust\" - when the Justice Department decides a company is abusing its monopoly power and should be broken up - has a mixed history. The government dropped such a case against IBM in 1982 after more than a decade. It settled its case against Microsoft in 2001. Only AT&amp;T, which agreed in 1982 to dissolve itself into a long-distance company and the seven Baby Bells, could be considered an unqualified success from the government's point of view.</p><p>The political landscape is shifting, however, at a speed that dumbfounds even antitrust experts. President Barack Obama thought of the tech companies in the way they think of themselves: as progressive, smart entrepreneurs who want what's best for America. His administration declined to pursue Google on antitrust charges and hired from the tech industry for top posts. Top staff members later went to work for the tech industry in top posts, too. It was a cozy relationship.</p><p>\"Something has definitely changed,\" said Geoffrey A. Manne, founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, a think tank in Portland, Ore. \"Most voters are very fond of Amazon, Apple, Google and even Facebook. But I think there's also a growing sense of skepticism about all these companies. The shine has come off.\"</p><p>Manne, who has been a critic of the antitrust arguments against Google and has received funding from the search giant as well as from some of its competitors, including Comcast and AT&amp;T, eviscerated Warren's proposal with his colleague Alec Stapp in a recent blog post. </p><p>They wrote that the senator's plan to turn the top companies into heavily regulated \"platform utilities\" would make them as resistant to improvement as sewer systems or Amtrak.</p><p>And yet, Manne conceded in an interview, increased regulation is an idea whose time may have come.</p><p>\"There is a long history in America - just not a recent one - of using the power of the state to counteract the economic power of private enterprise,\" he said. \"We may be at that moment again.\"</p><p>The financial firms were predatory last decade, exploiting weak spots in the mortgage markets in a way that undermined their viability. Google and Facebook, by contrast, offer their services for free, while Amazon built its reputation on selling as cheaply as possible. </p><p>That makes it hard to regulate them by the antitrust consensus, which for a couple of decades has held that there is no injury unless consumers suffer by paying higher prices.</p><p>Nothing is ever really free, of course, and there has been a dawning realization among some consumers that they are paying for these services with information about themselves. How most users feel about this seems up in the air, as evidenced by a SurveyMonkey poll done for the news site Axios.</p><p>The headline finding was that \"a growing majority now views our online privacy as a crisis.\" But deeper in the survey was the revelation that more than half the respondents said they were unwilling to pay to keep from being tracked by a service they were using. Twenty-one percent said they would pay less than $1 a month, and no more, for the right.</p><p>Users, it seems, want it both ways: privacy and free services. This is the contradiction at the heart of the internet.</p><p>Daniel Crane, an antitrust expert at the University of Michigan, said Warren's proposal might be a hard sell to voters. \"The median consumer probably feels that she gets lots of free goodies from Big Tech and will worry about what it would mean to go after them,\" he said.</p><p>But Crane noted that being broken up was the least of the companies' worries. \"A likelier consequence is that the next acquisition they want to make will be rejected,\" he said. </p><p>That is already happening. One of the anti-competitive complaints about Amazon is that it prohibited its merchants from selling more cheaply elsewhere. That prevented a new platform from underselling Amazon and gaining a competitive edge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-630489</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNW-52S1-DY37-D29H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"978\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Mark Warner, D-Virginia, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) will introduce the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act, bipartisan legislation that will encourage market-based competition to dominant social media platforms by requiring the largest companies to make user data portable - and their services interoperable - with other platforms, and to allow users to designate a trusted third-party service to manage their privacy and account settings, if they so choose.</p><p>\"Social media has enormous benefits. But, as we've seen, the tremendous dominance of a handful of large platforms also has major downsides - including few options for consumers who want to use social media to connect with friends, store their photos or just watch cat videos, but who face a marketplace with just a few major players and little in the way of real competition,\" said Sen. Warner, a former technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist. \"As a former cell phone guy, I saw what a game-changer number portability was for that industry. By making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies. And empowering trusted custodial companies to step in on behalf of users to better manage their accounts across different platforms will help balance the playing field between consumers and companies. In other words - by enabling portability, interoperability, and delegatability, this bill will help put consumers in the driver's seat when it comes to how and where they use social media.\"</p><p>\"Your data is your property. Period. Consumers should have the flexibility to choose new online platforms without artificial barriers to entry. This bill creates long-overdue requirements that will boost competition and give consumers the power to move their data from one service to another,\" said Sen. Hawley.</p><p>\"The exclusive dominance of Facebook and Google have crowded out the meaningful competition that is needed to protect online privacy and promote technological innovation. As we learned in the Microsoft antitrust case, interoperability and portability are powerful tools to restrain anti-competitive behaviors and promote innovative new companies. The bipartisan ACCESS Act would empower consumers to finally stand up to Big Tech and move their data to services that respect their rights,\" said Sen. Blumenthal.</p><p>Online communications platforms have become vital to the economic and social fabric of the nation, but network effects and consumer lock-in have entrenched a select number of companies' dominance in the digital market and enhanced their control over consumer data. The Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act would increase market competition, encourage innovation, and increase consumer choice by requiring large communications platforms (products or services with over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.) to:</p><p>Make their services interoperable with competing communications platforms.</p><p>Permit users to easily port their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.</p><p>Allow users to delegate trusted custodial services, which are required to act in a user's best interests through a strong duty of care, with the task of managing their account settings, content, and online interactions.</p><p>\"One very real nightmare scenario for the future of the internet is users facing a meaningless choice among a few fully-integrated silos of technology, and the end of independent innovation and creativity. We all need to prevent that from happening. This legislation could help us take a huge step forward towards a better internet future,\" said Chris Riley, Director of Public Policy at the Mozilla Corporation.</p><p>\"Markets work when consumers have a choice and know what's going on. The ACCESS Act is an important step toward reestablishing this dynamic in the market for tech services. We must get back to the conditions that make markets work: when consumers know what they give a firm and what they get in return; and if they don't like the deal, they can take their business elsewhere. By giving consumers the ability to delegate decisions to organizations working on their behalf, the ACCESS Act gives consumers some hope that they can understand what they are giving up and getting in the opaque world that the tech firms have created. By mandating portability, it also gives them a realistic option of switching to another provider,\" said Paul Romer, New York University Professor of Economics and Nobel Prize winner in Economics.</p><p>\"We're thrilled to see a concrete legislative proposal to provide interoperability for consumers. Built on a solid foundation of privacy and security protections, interoperability enables users to communicate across networks promoting competition among social media platforms. Interoperability ensures that users benefit from increased competition, and it helps new competitors grow by reaching users that are locked-in to their current provider. Senator Warner's interoperability bill lays out an excellent, practical framework for making interoperability a reality while preserving a role for states to go even further,\" said Charlotte Slaiman, Senior Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge.</p><p>\"All of us at USV believe in decentralized, emergent, market driven innovation. The shared communications infrastructure of the open Internet and a vibrant competitive market triggered the Cambrian explosion of new Web services we all now enjoy. But today, a small number of companies capitalize on their exclusive control over our data - the data we contribute as we interact with their services - to dominate markets, stifling competition and limiting consumer choice. While this is widely understood, most policy makers propose prescriptive regulation that would only further entrench the dominant platforms. The ACCESS Act targets the specific market failure - exclusive control over consumer data - that has led to the consolidation of market power on the Web. Ensuring that consumers have access to their data is an elegant way to restore competition without burdensome regulation,\" said Brad Burnham, Partner and Co-Founder at Union Square Ventures.</p><p>Previously, Sens. Warner and Hawley have partnered on the DASHBOARD Act, legislation to require data harvesting companies such as social media platforms to disclose how they are monetizing consumer data, as well as the Do Not Track Act, which would allow users to opt out of non-essential data collection, modeled after the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) \"Do Not Call\" list.</p><p>A section-by-section summary of the bill is available here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/431507476/ACCESS-Act-Section-by-Section-FINAL\">https://www.scribd.com/document/431507476/ACCESS-Act-Section-by-Section-FINAL</url>).

Elizabeth Warren is right to call for more aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws in our new digital era. Google and Facebook particularly deserve greater scrutiny from U.S. regulators. Washington voters should follow closely, however, because the tech giants Warren called out \u2014 Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook \u2014 are responsible for a large share of the state's recent job growth and increased tax revenue.Warren, a consumer advocate and former law professor, is well qualified to start this conversation. But she may be squandering the opportunity. Her antitrust treatise, posted last week[1], seems designed to stoke resentment of big companies as much as protect consumers. It sets an arbitrary threshold on revenues of big tech companies, above which they are prohibited from selling products that use their platform. This could raise prices and stifle innovation, because services help cover the cost of investing in cloud services. Do you have something to say?

This would be particularly painful for Warren's Democratic working-class constituents who earn less and are more sensitive to price increases, he noted.Most Read Opinion StoriesWhile it may play well with her activist labor base, demonizing popular companies like Amazon won't always fly with voters. This was demonstrated last year in deep blue Seattle, where City Hall killed its 'Amazon tax' on jobs only after labor polling found widespread public opposition to the measure. The timing of Warren's attack on mergers is significant. She's part of a last-ditch, labor-affiliated effort to scuttle the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile US, a deal expected to bring enormous benefits to Washington[3]. Disappointingly, U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, has joined with Warren and other left-leaning members of Congress in opposing the deal, even though it's expected to preserve jobs held by many of Jayapal's constituents, create thousands of new jobs and prevent the loss of the Seattle area's last major telecom company.Jayapal was unavailable to comment. But she recently co-signed a letter, leaning on research by the Communications Workers of America, opposing a 'deal designed to destroy jobs and drive down wages, hurting American workers and consumers and threatening our economy.' T-Mobile's merger would combine the third- and fourth-place wireless companies to create a stronger competitor for the giants, Verizon and AT...T-Mobile also plans to use Sprint's spectrum to push into home broadband, creating new competition for Comcast and other broadband providers. Although T-Mobile isn't unionized, the company has benefited working people by driving down wireless prices. It's forcing larger carriers to offer more affordable wireless options to compete with its aggressive pricing.Some sort of merger is all but inevitable.T-Mobile's Bellevue headquarters is in the congressional district of another progressive, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith. He said the merger 'holds great promise for our region's workers and local economy.'If approved by regulators, I expect this merger to promote greater competition within the wireless industry; benefiting the Puget Sound area through the preservation and growth of jobs as well as our country's wireless customers through innovation and competition,' Smith said in a statement.Also supporting the merger is U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Medina Democrat whose district includes many T-Mobile employees. 'Even combined, T-Mobile and Sprint will still be number three in terms of market,' she noted. Politicians calling for antitrust enforcement and stronger regulation of the internet's dominant gatekeepers are more than welcome. Especially if they avoid grandstanding and focus on truly protecting consumers and increasing competition.

Elizabeth Warren is right to call for more aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws in our new digital era. Google and Facebook particularly deserve greater scrutiny from U.S. regulators. Washington voters should follow closely, however, because the tech giants Warren called out -- Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook -- are responsible for a large share of the state's recent job growth and increased tax revenue. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren, a consumer advocate and former law professor, is well qualified to start this conversation. But she may be squandering the opportunity. Her antitrust treatise, posted last week, seems designed to stoke resentment of big companies as much as protect consumers. It sets an arbitrary threshold on revenues of big tech companies, above which they are prohibited from selling products that use their platform. This could raise prices and stifle innovation, because services help cover the cost of investing in cloud services. </p><p>Breaking these companies up is likely to cause massive price increases or losses in quality, said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania. This would be particularly painful for Warren's Democratic working-class constituents who earn less and are more sensitive to price increases, he noted.</p><p>While it may play well with her activist labor base, demonizing popular companies like Amazon won't always fly with voters. This was demonstrated last year in deep blue Seattle, where City Hall killed its \"Amazon tax\" on jobs only after labor polling found widespread public opposition to the measure. </p><p>The timing of Warren's attack on mergers is significant. She's part of a last-ditch, labor-affiliated effort to scuttle the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile US, a deal expected to bring enormous benefits to Washington.</p><p>Disappointingly, U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, has joined with Warren and other left-leaning members of Congress in opposing the deal, even though it's expected to preserve jobs held by many of Jayapal's constituents, create thousands of new jobs and prevent the loss of the Seattle area's last major telecom company. </p><p>Jayapal was unavailable to comment. But she recently co-signed a letter, leaning on research by the Communications Workers of America, opposing a \"deal designed to destroy jobs and drive down wages, hurting American workers and consumers and threatening our economy.\" </p><p>T-Mobile's merger would combine the third- and fourth-place wireless companies to create a stronger competitor for the giants, Verizon and AT&amp;T. T-Mobile also plans to use Sprint's spectrum to push into home broadband, creating new competition for Comcast and other broadband providers. </p><p>Although T-Mobile isn't unionized, the company has benefited working people by driving down wireless prices. It's forcing larger carriers to offer more affordable wireless options to compete with its aggressive pricing. Some sort of merger is all but inevitable. </p><p>T-Mobile's Bellevue headquarters is in the congressional district of another progressive, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith. He said the merger \"holds great promise for our region's workers and local economy. </p><p> \"If approved by regulators, I expect this merger to promote greater competition within the wireless industry; benefiting the Puget Sound area through the preservation and growth of jobs as well as our country's wireless customers through innovation and competition,\" Smith said in a statement. </p><p>Also supporting the merger is U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Medina Democrat whose district includes many T-Mobile employees. \"Even combined, T-Mobile and Sprint will still be number three in terms of market,\" she noted. </p><p>Politicians calling for antitrust enforcement and stronger regulation of the internet's dominant gatekeepers are more than welcome. Especially if they avoid grandstanding and focus on truly protecting consumers and increasing competition. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWSTRB-99d1b1a5fcda45f7aef977cfde415dd9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSTRB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMM-X491-JC3J-X08M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">262920</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001XSU</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE TELEKOM AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Warren Shakes Off EU Official's Cautioning Against Breaking Up Big Tech</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., shrugged off EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's suggestion that Warren's proposal to break up big tech is \"far-reaching\" (see 1903180058). \"It would give competition a better chance to flourish, and that's what competition law should be all about,\" Warren told us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The senator's proposal to unwind acquisitions of Google, Facebook and Amazon has been a talking point this election cycle. Asked about the wisdom of Warren's plan, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., cited her own proposal to tax platforms on data collection (see 1903190037). In a SXSW interview with Recode, Klobuchar likened online data collection to use of public infrastructure by trucks and trains. Use of highways and railways is subject to taxation, she said, and the tech industry's use of large data sets could also be taxed. \"Because otherwise, we're just being used, right?\" she said, noting it should be done in a way to that doesn't limit innovation. Ex-Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, warned, according to CNN, against using antitrust enforcement to address issues of online privacy, saying regulation is the better approach.</p><p>There's \"no question\" the next administration's DOJ should examine Google, Amazon, Facebook and other large companies from an antitrust perspective, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg told Axios, saying the issue extends beyond the tech industry: \"The U.S. has frankly let down its guard when it comes to monopoly policy, and too often the concentration of wealth has been allowed to turn into the concentration of power.\" He said tech companies are extending tech dominance into alternative markets. Tech monopoly issues \"are almost old-fashioned in their nature, and it requires a greater attention to the controls on monopoly power to keep our economy competitive and our democracy democratic,\" he said.</p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is an outspoken critic of Amazon business practices. He drove much of the discussion that led to the company's raising its minimum wage (see 1810020032). He also signed a letter with 15 Democrats in January, asking the FCC and the FTC to investigate wireless carrier practices of sharing user location tracking data with third parties (see 1901180034). \"The wireless industry has repeatedly demonstrated a blatant disregard for its customers' privacy. It is therefore vital that regulators take swift action to ensure that consumers are protected,\" they wrote. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also signed the letter. She has been at the forefront of FCC and FTC scrutiny on the issue (see 1901090066).</p><p>Racial disparity issues seem to be the focus for Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. In April, he joined Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., on a bill authorizing FTC regulations to \"study and fix flawed computer algorithms\" involving racial discrimination (see 1904100045). The legislation, Booker said, is a \"key step toward ensuring more accountability from the entities using software to make decisions that can change lives.\" In questions for the record for a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on privacy (see 1903120072), Booker cited housing discrimination, employment discrimination, discriminatory police surveillance and voter suppression targeting African Americans.</p><p>The U.S. needs to break up big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, tweeted. \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely,\" she wrote, noting she will be introducing related legislation in the House.</p><p>Warren's plan is \"worth considering,\" said ex-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro at a recent campaign event, according to The Washington Post. U.S. antitrust enforcement needs to be \"much stronger,\" and the most powerful individuals and corporations need more scrutiny, he said: \"I don't understand how Amazon made $11 billion in profit last year, paid no federal taxes, and at the same time, New York was about to offer them a $3 billion package to locate their second headquarters.\"</p><p>Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was also critical of Amazon's plan to pursue a new headquarters in New York City. \"One of the wealthiest companies in history should not be receiving financial assistance from the taxpayers while too many New York families struggle to make ends meet,\" she tweeted. She and former Vice President Joe Biden haven't been vocal on many tech issues.</p><p>Ex-Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., pressed the FCC to deal with robocalls: \"While it may not seem like the biggest policy issue in the world, my Administration will end all these ridiculous robocalls. How incredibly annoying are they. We need an FCC that does its job!\" he tweeted. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang stated his support for restoring the Obama administration's net neutrality rules. \"It is imperative that we protect this technology so that all Americans can continue to enjoy unfettered and affordable access to the internet,\" his campaign said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VX4-DDN1-DYRJ-00KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"822\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

To be sure, business consolidation and concentrated market power are real concerns. But as PPI economist Michael Mandel has demonstrated[1], such worries apply less to the dynamic and fiercely competitive digital ecosystem than to America's older and more static physical industries. Perhaps Sen. Warren is jockeying to enter a very crowded populist 'lane' in the 2020 presidential nomination contest. But if she believes that anti-tech populism is broadly popular with U.S. voters, she's mistaken. In fact, as a recent PPI poll[2]makes clear, most Americans have a favorable view of the big tech companies, and oppose breaking them up. Our poll found that 67 percent of likely voters view the tech companies positively, as shown in Figure 1, and 55 percent oppose breaking them up. While 60 percent of voters acknowledge they are concerned about tech companies' handling of privacy and data protection, 71 percent of voters view tech companies as 'a sign that the American economy is working.' In contrast, just 32 percent view Big Tech as 'too powerful.' Sen. Warren's call to break up America's tech leaders may go down well with her party's 'democratic socialist' faction. It will no doubt be applauded by European regulators, who have also drawn a bead on U.S. tech companies. But to most voters, they symbolize American ingenuity and entrepreneurial prowess. Are those qualities progressives really should oppose?

Can old antitrust laws be fairly applied to the New Economy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Tam Harbert</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ILLUSTRATION BY DICK KREPEL</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">photo omitted</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mention high technology and antitrust today, and most CEOs might think of the Microsoft Corp.case, or perhaps the America Online Inc.-Time Warner deal. But these cases may be just the tip of an antitrust iceberg, which the high-tech industry is steaming toward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The top 50 electronics mergers and acquisitions last year more than doubled in dollar volume, compared to the top 50 of the previous year (see table and sidebar, page 74). As these high-tech mergers and acquisitions become huge, multi-billion-dollar transactions, they are likely to draw more antitrust scrutiny. Is the government, and, for that matter, the industry, ready for it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Microsoftcase was just the beginning of what could be a wave of antitrust investigations into high-tech companies, according to Alan Murray, a reporter for the Wall Street journal who participated in a panel at the Journal's High-Tech Summit 2000 in Washington, DC, last summer. \"The antitrust authorities are going to have to figure out how to apply antitrust laws--written about 100 years ago--to this New Economy,\" he said on that occasion.</p><p>Under the magnifying glass</p><p>Scrutiny of high-tech deals is increasing for several reasons, say antitrust experts.</p><p>The antitrust trial of Redmond, WA-based Microsoft, as well as the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) recently closed investigation into Santa Clara, CA-based Intel Corp.'s business practices, have shown the government's willingness to turn a critical eye toward the tech sector. And that attention is not likely to diminish, says William Kovacic, professor of law at George Washington University's (GWU) School of Law, Washington, DC, and a former antitrust specialist at the FTC. Antitrust officials now have \"an assembly line of knowledge\" that they are predisposed to use. Like any assembly line, these agencies \"tend not to produce just one item,\" he says.</p><p>Secondly, more tech companies are becoming pre-eminent in the market. It's the nature of antitrust law that, as these companies acquire each other, regulators become more concerned about maintaining a competitive market, he says. Remember the Japanese proverb: The nail that sticks up gets hammered.</p><p>Thirdly, regulators are watching as these fast-growing companies broaden their product lines through sky-high-priced acquisitions, adds Mit Spears, a partner at Shook Hardy &amp; Bacon LLP, Washington, DC, and former general counsel of the FTC under the Bush Administration.</p><p>Finally, there are areas of competitor collaboration emerging on the Internet, such as business-to-business (B2B) relationships and trading exchanges, that have heightened regulators' concern, notes Kovacic. In one of the first antitrust investigations of a B2B exchange, the FTC recently cleared Covisint LLC (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.covisint.com\">www.covisint.com</url>) an online supply-chain exchange among automakers.</p><p>But that's not necessarily the final word, says Kovacic. Although some analysts interpreted the decision as a green light for such exchanges, it's really more of \"a flashing yellow light,\" says Kovacic. Specifically, the FTC will be watching to make sure competitors are not sharing information on current or future pricing, marketing plans or product development plans, he says.</p><p>An FTC official agrees with the \"flashing yellow light\" assessment. Such exchanges will continue to draw the regulators' attention, particularly \"when the operating rules have hardly been formed at all,\" says Molly Boast, senior deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.</p><p>New economy, old laws</p><p>Can antitrust laws be fairly applied to the New Economy, in which companies can rise to dominance quickly, but just as quickly lose that dominance when an innovative competitor leapfrogs them with a new technology? It's an increasing challenge for antitrust enforcers.</p><p>\"It's not just guessing where the companies are right now, but where they might be with emerging technologies,\" says Spears. Regulators have to consider that a company might lock up a technology that seems insignificant today, but that may allow it to corner the market in the future. That's at the heart of the FTC's concern over the AOL-Time Warner merger, he says. \"It's not where Time-Warner and AOL are now, but where they might be in the future in terms of wielding market power.\"</p><p>Scrutiny of high-tech mergers is definitely more complicated now, agrees Thomas Kauper, a professor of law at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and an antitrust expert. Kauper was an assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Antitrust Division in the mid-'70s. \"You can't rely just on market share\" because emerging technologies can cause that to shift quickly, he says. But Kauper believes that acknowledgement of that fact will restrain antitrust authorities, causing them to be more cautious about bringing actions. If regulators \"really believe things are changing that fast, then [they] must question whether to even bring a case in the first place,\" he says.</p><p>What's more, the number of HartScott-Rodino (HSR) filings, which are required by law for large mergers, has skyrocketed over the last several years threatening to overwhelm the government's capacity to keep up. In 1991, there were 1,529 HSR filings. That number reached 4,600 in the government's fiscal year 1999, and 4,900--the highest total ever--in 2000, according to Boast. However, of that 4,900, fewer than 100 got \"second requests\" from regulators, which is the signal of serious antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>To date, there have been few antitrust investigations of high-tech mergers. In fact, I2 Technologies Inc., of Dallas, expected more scrutiny of its $7.8-billion purchase of Aspect Development Inc., which closed in June, because of the sheer size of the deal, says Bob Donohoo, I2's corporate counsel. But its case was reviewed \"and it went through without a hitch,\" he says. The reason, he believes, is that I2 was acquiring complementary technology rather than increasing its dominance in one technology. However, regulators are taking a close look at JDS Uniphase Corp.'s proposed $41-billion acquisition of SDL Inc., which would give JDS a large share of the market for fiber-optic pump lasers.</p><p>While some have called for changes in the antitrust laws, everyone interviewed for this story believes antitrust laws are up to the challenge, although some fine-tuning may be needed. The laws have proven adaptable over the years, and impart to the agencies a great deal of flexibility to customize them to particular industries, says Professor Kovacic.</p><p>\"The problem today is the institutions applying the laws,\" he says. For example, some question whether litigation through the courts is the most expedient way to resolve antitrust disputes, he notes. While the DOJ goes exclusively through the U.S. courts, the FTC has the option of using its own internal judicial process, but even that may not be fast enough. \"Concepts can change, but the rate of change [in technology] is overwhelming the process,\" he says.</p><p>Industry, government and lawyers all understand the current law, and changing it now would create mass confusion, says Attorney Spears. In addition, the agencies are adept at putting out guidelines for various industries, he notes. \"The agencies have almost an unlimited ability to fine-tune the standards for particular industries,\" he adds.</p><p>Watch your back</p><p>The greatest threat may come not from government regulators, but from competitors, warns Spears. \"There are people out there other than the federales that you should watch out for,\" he says. \"Your potential competitors and their lawyers are the best reason to keep your antitrust skirts clean.\"</p><p>The FTC's Boast agrees. \"One thing you can completely count on is, if a competitor doesn't like the merger, they will surely call [us],\" she notes.</p><p>Most vulnerable are new companies going public or existing companies trying to sell off businesses that aren't relevant to their core competency, Spears says. He cites one flagrant example of a company selling off an operating division. In his enthusiasm, a young investment banker wrote up a prospectus trying to maximize the value of the division to possible buyers. The prospectus bragged that the division had first-mover advantage, had a lock on the market and that there were substantial barriers to entry. That kind of promotion makes regulators eyes \"light up like a Christmas tree.\" If an offer was made, \"the language in the offering statement pretty much guaranteed that they'd get a second look\" by regulators, he adds.</p><p>In addition, if the stock market is bearish, antitrust suits among competitors go up, says Spears. Consider that company A sells a process to make widgets and claims it has the market cornered. It is bought by company B that makes widgets and wants the process. If company C, which also is in the widget-making business, stumbles, it will start looking for someone to blame, says Spears. Company C could easily say that companies A and B conspired to corner the market and decide to \"sue their eyeballs out,\" he says.</p><p>Global antitrust proliferation</p><p>Further complicating the antitrust picture is the increasingly global economy. Even if technology mergers pass muster in the United States, the global nature of today's industry means that companies making acquisitions must submit also to oversight by the European Union (EU). And the EU's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, has begun asserting EU law aggressively.</p><p>Under Monti, the EU is expanding a concept called \"collective dominance,\" which refers to groups of separate companies that together dominate a particular market. Until two years ago, when a European court upheld that concept, the EU did not strictly apply it, even when two distinct companies dominated the market, says Kauper. But Monti has been applying it not only when two companies have collective dominance, but also to situations in which three or four independent companies collectively dominate a market, he explains. This broadens the scope of EU antitrust authority.</p><p>\"The problems of dealing with the EU are just going to get more complicated,\" notes Kauper.</p><p>But at least one company involved in a recent global transaction says passing muster with the EU was no big deal. Distributors Avnet Inc., Phoenix, AZ, and Arrow Electronics Inc., Melville, NY, teamed with a venture capital company, forming a consortium that bought VEBA's electronics distribution business for $2.35 billion, says David Birk, Avnet's senior vice president, general counsel and secretary.</p><p>photo omitted</p><p>Avnet's piece of the deal was VEBA's European business, so it had to file with the EU. The company used outside counsel based in London to help steer it through the European process, which was completed in October, and it didn't run into any hurdles, says Birk. He believes the deal cleared because \"Arrow and Avnet were very careful to focus only on the businesses that we were going to buy.\" Arrow's part of the deal was strictly in the United States, while Avnet's was in Europe, so there was no threat of a single company dominating a geographic market, he explains.</p><p>However, the more global the deal, the more complicated it gets. Today, more than 90 countries have antitrust laws, says Kovacic. \"There are a growing number of jurisdictions in the world that take these antitrust concerns seriously,\" he notes. That could mean that a global company might have to file reports and pass muster with 20 or more different governments, he adds.</p><p>Regulators recognize the problem. In the United States, the DOJ formed a group called the International Competition Policy Advisory Committee to study the issue. One of its recommendations was to launch a global competition initiative that would involve governments worldwide.</p><p>Fixing the system</p><p>But in the United States, antitrust experts say, several actions could improve the system. Kovacic's recommendations: massive investment to acquire adequate technical expertise in the agencies, more reliance by the courts on outside experts and an upgrading of the FTC's internal administrative process to make it speedier.</p><p>The first recommendation will be particularly difficult to achieve, Kovacic says. The wide disparity between private and public service salaries for lawyers means that the government often is not able to attract those who have more lucrative career options. A 2001 GWU Law School graduate can typically choose from a job at the FTC or DOJ at a starting salary of around $40,000, he says. Compare that to the $120,000 to $130,000 offered by elite Washington, DC, firms. \"It's becoming harder and harder for the enforcement agencies to [attract] and keep the intellectual capital they need,\" he adds.</p><p>FTC's Boast acknowledges that recruiting has been a problem, \"but it's not insurmountable.\" She herself left a New York City law firm, taking \"a big cut in pay\" to work for the FTC. \"The people who want to do this will do it,\" she claims. \"We work hard to create rewards for our staff here,\" she says, but most of them stay because \"they love their work.\" In fact, the agency is recruiting lawyers with intellectual property and/or high-tech backgrounds. \"A tour of duty in government is a really good idea,\" she adds. \"We don't expect them to stay forever, necessarily.\"</p><p>Perhaps the high-tech industry should put forth some money to help government agencies get the expertise they need? That could help, says Kovacic. That way regulators would at least have a better understanding of how high-tech companies operate.</p><p>After all, it would be in the industry's best interest, adds Spears. \"If these antitrust regulators are going to put on their prognostication caps, just how good are those prognostications going to be?\"</p><p>Navigating the antitrust seas</p><p>So what can high-tech companies do to prepare for this ever-more-complex antitrust scrutiny? Kovacic recommends keeping a close eye on the antitrust activities of the FTC and DOJ. When high-tech companies reach a certain size, they should hire outside antitrust counsel or hire a specialist in-house, he says.</p><p>He's seen companies that handle antitrust issues well and some that haven't handled them so well, and it doesn't depend on the size of the company. For example, \"I wonder how Microsoftformulated its strategies in the last five years,\" he notes. \"In particular, I wonder, after the 1992 FTC deadlock on filing a complaint and after the 1995 DOJ consent decree, whether the company took those as caution signs of a real danger.\" With the confidence of the crew of the Titanic, the company refused to \"post more [people] to look for icebergs,\" he adds.</p><p>Kauper offers this advice to companies considering acquiring or merging with a competitor. Be prepared to make two plausible arguments: First, the technology is changing so fast that the new entity isn't assured a lasting monopoly. Second, there are no strong market barriers that would prevent other companies from entering the same market.</p><p>FTC or DOJ: Who covers what?</p><p>BOTH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have jurisdiction over antitrust cases. How they decide which agency handles which cases is clear cut for many industries. But in high tech, it's a huge gray area and often a political tug-of-war.</p><p>The two agencies have a \"clearance process\" when they suspect a company may be violating antitrust regulations, says William Kovacic, a professor of law at George Washington University's School of Law in Washington, D.C. The rule of thumb is that the agency with the most recent and superior expertise in a given market takes the case. In general, the FTC typically handles the pharmaceutical industry and retail grocery chains. DOJ typically handles the airline industry and most pure telecommunications deals.</p><p>However,\" each agency has an interest in maintaining a presence in hot areas,\" he says, adding that each wants to \"play in the big [high-profile] games.\" In high-tech cases, they tend to trade off. \"The agency that got the last one has to give up the next one.\" But this sometimes leads to conflict, he says. \"The most bitter disputes arise when each agency has walked over similar ground recently.\"</p><p>\"We fight over [the] cable [industry],\" admits Molly Boast, senior deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition. \"As industries converge, it's more and more difficult to decide who has jurisdiction.\"</p><p>--T.H.</p><p>Rules of engagement</p><p>ANTITRUST REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES is rooted in three basic laws: the Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Act. The Sherman Act has been interpreted by the courts as a mandate to outlaw attempts by a company to maintain or acquire a monopoly through \"unreasonable methods,\" according to the FTC's antitrust primer.</p><p>The FTC Act outlaws \"unfair methods of competition,\" but leaves it up to the courts to define \"unfair.\"</p><p>The Clayton Act prohibits mergers and acquisitions whose effect \"may be [to] substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly.\" Section 7A of the act, called the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act, requires prior notification of large mergers to both the FTC and the Justice Department.</p><p>The threshold for triggering an HSR filing is so complex that lawyers devote entire careers to it. According to Molly Boast, senior deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, an HSR filing is required \"if one of the companies has at least $100 million in total worldwide assets or annual net sales and the other party has at least $10 million and if, following the transaction, the firm will own voting securities or assets of the acquired company valued at more than $15 million or representing 50% or more of the voting securities of an issuer with total assets or annual net sales of $25 million or more.\"</p><p>\"That's the test that's applied as of today,\" says Boast, adding that it's a general rule that does not apply in every case. In addition, pending legislation in Congress would raise those thresholds to reflect the increasingly high valuations of companies today, she notes. but the fate of that bill is uncertain, given the new Congress.</p><p>Boast adds that the FTC has authority to investigate a company even if it does not have to file an HSR. \"This is not a safe harbor,\" she says. The FTC can use its subpoena powers to \"investigate any transaction. [The HSR] is just a pre-merger requirement\" for larger deals.</p><p>--T.H.</p><p>Tam Harbert is ELECTRONIC BUSINESS' national editor in Washington, DC.

But these cases may be just the tip of an antitrust iceberg, which the high-tech industry is steaming toward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The top 50 electronics mergers and acquisitions last year more than doubled in dollar volume, compared to the top 50 of the previous year (see table and sidebar, page 74). As these high-tech mergers and acquisitions become huge, multi-billion-dollar transactions, they are likely to draw more antitrust scrutiny. Is the government, and, for that matter, the industry, ready for it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Microsoft case was just the beginning of what could be a wave of antitrust investigations into high-tech companies, according to Alan Murray, a reporter for the Wall Street journal who participated in a panel at the Journal's High-Tech Summit 2000 in Washington, DC, last summer. \"The antitrust authorities are going to have to figure out how to apply antitrust laws--written about 100 years ago--to this New Economy,\" he said on that occasion.</p><p>Under the magnifying glass</p><p>Scrutiny of high-tech deals is increasing for several reasons, say antitrust experts.</p><p>The antitrust trial of Redmond, WA-based Microsoft, as well as the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) recently closed investigation into Santa Clara, CA-based Intel Corp.'s business practices, have shown the government's willingness to turn a critical eye toward the tech sector. And that attention is not likely to diminish, says William Kovacic, professor of law at George Washington University's (GWU) School of Law, Washington, DC, and a former antitrust specialist at the FTC. Antitrust officials now have \"an assembly line of knowledge\" that they are predisposed to use. Like any assembly line, these agencies \"tend not to produce just one item,\" he says.</p><p>Secondly, more tech companies are becoming pre-eminent in the market. It's the nature of antitrust law that, as these companies acquire each other, regulators become more concerned about maintaining a competitive market, he says. Remember the Japanese proverb: The nail that sticks up gets hammered.</p><p>Thirdly, regulators are watching as these fast-growing companies broaden their product lines through sky-high-priced acquisitions, adds Mit Spears, a partner at Shook Hardy &amp; Bacon LLP, Washington, DC, and former general counsel of the FTC under the Bush Administration.</p><p>Finally, there are areas of competitor collaboration emerging on the Internet, such as business-to-business (B2B) relationships and trading exchanges, that have heightened regulators' concern, notes Kovacic. In one of the first antitrust investigations of a B2B exchange, the FTC recently cleared Covisint LLC (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.covisint.com\">www.covisint.com</url>) an online supply-chain exchange among automakers.</p><p>But that's not necessarily the final word, says Kovacic. Although some analysts interpreted the decision as a green light for such exchanges, it's really more of \"a flashing yellow light,\" says Kovacic. Specifically, the FTC will be watching to make sure competitors are not sharing information on current or future pricing, marketing plans or product development plans, he says.</p><p>An FTC official agrees with the \"flashing yellow light\" assessment. Such exchanges will continue to draw the regulators' attention, particularly \"when the operating rules have hardly been formed at all,\" says Molly Boast, senior deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.</p><p>New economy, old laws</p><p>Can antitrust laws be fairly applied to the New Economy, in which companies can rise to dominance quickly, but just as quickly lose that dominance when an innovative competitor leapfrogs them with a new technology? It's an increasing challenge for antitrust enforcers.</p><p>\"It's not just guessing where the companies are right now, but where they might be with emerging technologies,\" says Spears. Regulators have to consider that a company might lock up a technology that seems insignificant today, but that may allow it to corner the market in the future. That's at the heart of the FTC's concern over the AOL-Time Warner merger, he says. \"It's not where Time-Warner and AOL are now, but where they might be in the future in terms of wielding market power.\"</p><p>Scrutiny of high-tech mergers is definitely more complicated now, agrees Thomas Kauper, a professor of law at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and an antitrust expert. Kauper was an assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Antitrust Division in the mid-'70s. \"You can't rely just on market share\" because emerging technologies can cause that to shift quickly, he says. But Kauper believes that acknowledgement of that fact will restrain antitrust authorities, causing them to be more cautious about bringing actions. If regulators \"really believe things are changing that fast, then [they] must question whether to even bring a case in the first place,\" he says.</p><p>What's more, the number of HartScott-Rodino (HSR) filings, which are required by law for large mergers, has skyrocketed over the last several years threatening to overwhelm the government's capacity to keep up. In 1991, there were 1,529 HSR filings. That number reached 4,600 in the government's fiscal year 1999, and 4,900--the highest total ever--in 2000, according to Boast. However, of that 4,900, fewer than 100 got \"second requests\" from regulators, which is the signal of serious antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>To date, there have been few antitrust investigations of high-tech mergers. In fact, I2 Technologies Inc., of Dallas, expected more scrutiny of its $7.8-billion purchase of Aspect Development Inc., which closed in June, because of the sheer size of the deal, says Bob Donohoo, I2's corporate counsel. But its case was reviewed \"and it went through without a hitch,\" he says. The reason, he believes, is that I2 was acquiring complementary technology rather than increasing its dominance in one technology. However, regulators are taking a close look at JDS Uniphase Corp.'s proposed $41-billion acquisition of SDL Inc., which would give JDS a large share of the market for fiber-optic pump lasers.</p><p>While some have called for changes in the antitrust laws, everyone interviewed for this story believes antitrust laws are up to the challenge, although some fine-tuning may be needed. The laws have proven adaptable over the years, and impart to the agencies a great deal of flexibility to customize them to particular industries, says Professor Kovacic.</p><p>\"The problem today is the institutions applying the laws,\" he says. For example, some question whether litigation through the courts is the most expedient way to resolve antitrust disputes, he notes. While the DOJ goes exclusively through the U.S. courts, the FTC has the option of using its own internal judicial process, but even that may not be fast enough. \"Concepts can change, but the rate of change [in technology] is overwhelming the process,\" he says.</p><p>Industry, government and lawyers all understand the current law, and changing it now would create mass confusion, says Attorney Spears. In addition, the agencies are adept at putting out guidelines for various industries, he notes. \"The agencies have almost an unlimited ability to fine-tune the standards for particular industries,\" he adds.</p><p>Watch your back</p><p>The greatest threat may come not from government regulators, but from competitors, warns Spears. \"There are people out there other than the federales that you should watch out for,\" he says. \"Your potential competitors and their lawyers are the best reason to keep your antitrust skirts clean.\"</p><p>The FTC's Boast agrees. \"One thing you can completely count on is, if a competitor doesn't like the merger, they will surely call [us],\" she notes.</p><p>Most vulnerable are new companies going public or existing companies trying to sell off businesses that aren't relevant to their core competency, Spears says. He cites one flagrant example of a company selling off an operating division. In his enthusiasm, a young investment banker wrote up a prospectus trying to maximize the value of the division to possible buyers. The prospectus bragged that the division had first-mover advantage, had a lock on the market and that there were substantial barriers to entry. That kind of promotion makes regulators eyes \"light up like a Christmas tree.\" If an offer was made, \"the language in the offering statement pretty much guaranteed that they'd get a second look\" by regulators, he adds.</p><p>In addition, if the stock market is bearish, antitrust suits among competitors go up, says Spears. Consider that company A sells a process to make widgets and claims it has the market cornered. It is bought by company B that makes widgets and wants the process. If company C, which also is in the widget-making business, stumbles, it will start looking for someone to blame, says Spears. Company C could easily say that companies A and B conspired to corner the market and decide to \"sue their eyeballs out,\" he says.</p><p>Global antitrust proliferation</p><p>Further complicating the antitrust picture is the increasingly global economy. Even if technology mergers pass muster in the United States, the global nature of today's industry means that companies making acquisitions must submit also to oversight by the European Union (EU). And the EU's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, has begun asserting EU law aggressively.</p><p>Under Monti, the EU is expanding a concept called \"collective dominance,\" which refers to groups of separate companies that together dominate a particular market. Until two years ago, when a European court upheld that concept, the EU did not strictly apply it, even when two distinct companies dominated the market, says Kauper. But Monti has been applying it not only when two companies have collective dominance, but also to situations in which three or four independent companies collectively dominate a market, he explains. This broadens the scope of EU antitrust authority.</p><p>\"The problems of dealing with the EU are just going to get more complicated,\" notes Kauper.</p><p>But at least one company involved in a recent global transaction says passing muster with the EU was no big deal. Distributors Avnet Inc., Phoenix, AZ, and Arrow Electronics Inc., Melville, NY, teamed with a venture capital company, forming a consortium that bought VEBA's electronics distribution business for $2.35 billion, says David Birk, Avnet's senior vice president, general counsel and secretary.</p><p>photo omitted</p><p>Avnet's piece of the deal was VEBA's European business, so it had to file with the EU. The company used outside counsel based in London to help steer it through the European process, which was completed in October, and it didn't run into any hurdles, says Birk. He believes the deal cleared because \"Arrow and Avnet were very careful to focus only on the businesses that we were going to buy.\" Arrow's part of the deal was strictly in the United States, while Avnet's was in Europe, so there was no threat of a single company dominating a geographic market, he explains.</p><p>However, the more global the deal, the more complicated it gets. Today, more than 90 countries have antitrust laws, says Kovacic. \"There are a growing number of jurisdictions in the world that take these antitrust concerns seriously,\" he notes. That could mean that a global company might have to file reports and pass muster with 20 or more different governments, he adds.</p><p>Regulators recognize the problem. In the United States, the DOJ formed a group called the International Competition Policy Advisory Committee to study the issue. One of its recommendations was to launch a global competition initiative that would involve governments worldwide.</p><p>Fixing the system</p><p>But in the United States, antitrust experts say, several actions could improve the system. Kovacic's recommendations: massive investment to acquire adequate technical expertise in the agencies, more reliance by the courts on outside experts and an upgrading of the FTC's internal administrative process to make it speedier.</p><p>The first recommendation will be particularly difficult to achieve, Kovacic says. The wide disparity between private and public service salaries for lawyers means that the government often is not able to attract those who have more lucrative career options. A 2001 GWU Law School graduate can typically choose from a job at the FTC or DOJ at a starting salary of around $40,000, he says. Compare that to the $120,000 to $130,000 offered by elite Washington, DC, firms. \"It's becoming harder and harder for the enforcement agencies to [attract] and keep the intellectual capital they need,\" he adds.</p><p>FTC's Boast acknowledges that recruiting has been a problem, \"but it's not insurmountable.\" She herself left a New York City law firm, taking \"a big cut in pay\" to work for the FTC. \"The people who want to do this will do it,\" she claims. \"We work hard to create rewards for our staff here,\" she says, but most of them stay because \"they love their work.\" In fact, the agency is recruiting lawyers with intellectual property and/or high-tech backgrounds. \"A tour of duty in government is a really good idea,\" she adds. \"We don't expect them to stay forever, necessarily.\"</p><p>Perhaps the high-tech industry should put forth some money to help government agencies get the expertise they need? That could help, says Kovacic. That way regulators would at least have a better understanding of how high-tech companies operate.</p><p>After all, it would be in the industry's best interest, adds Spears. \"If these antitrust regulators are going to put on their prognostication caps, just how good are those prognostications going to be?\"</p><p>Navigating the antitrust seas</p><p>So what can high-tech companies do to prepare for this ever-more-complex antitrust scrutiny? Kovacic recommends keeping a close eye on the antitrust activities of the FTC and DOJ. When high-tech companies reach a certain size, they should hire outside antitrust counsel or hire a specialist in-house, he says.</p><p>He's seen companies that handle antitrust issues well and some that haven't handled them so well, and it doesn't depend on the size of the company. For example, \"I wonder how Microsoft formulated its strategies in the last five years,\" he notes. \"In particular, I wonder, after the 1992 FTC deadlock on filing a complaint and after the 1995 DOJ consent decree, whether the company took those as caution signs of a real danger.\" With the confidence of the crew of the Titanic, the company refused to \"post more [people] to look for icebergs,\" he adds.</p><p>Kauper offers this advice to companies considering acquiring or merging with a competitor. Be prepared to make two plausible arguments: First, the technology is changing so fast that the new entity isn't assured a lasting monopoly. Second, there are no strong market barriers that would prevent other companies from entering the same market.</p><p>FTC or DOJ: Who covers what?</p><p>BOTH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have jurisdiction over antitrust cases. How they decide which agency handles which cases is clear cut for many industries. But in high tech, it's a huge gray area and often a political tug-of-war.</p><p>The two agencies have a \"clearance process\" when they suspect a company may be violating antitrust regulations, says William Kovacic, a professor of law at George Washington University's School of Law in Washington, D.C. The rule of thumb is that the agency with the most recent and superior expertise in a given market takes the case. In general, the FTC typically handles the pharmaceutical industry and retail grocery chains. DOJ typically handles the airline industry and most pure telecommunications deals.</p><p>However,\" each agency has an interest in maintaining a presence in hot areas,\" he says, adding that each wants to \"play in the big [high-profile] games.\" In high-tech cases, they tend to trade off. \"The agency that got the last one has to give up the next one.\" But this sometimes leads to conflict, he says. \"The most bitter disputes arise when each agency has walked over similar ground recently.\"</p><p>\"We fight over [the] cable [industry],\" admits Molly Boast, senior deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition. \"As industries converge, it's more and more difficult to decide who has jurisdiction.\"</p><p>--T.H.</p><p>Rules of engagement</p><p>ANTITRUST REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES is rooted in three basic laws: the Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the ClaytonAct. The Sherman Act has been interpreted by the courts as a mandate to outlaw attempts by a company to maintain or acquire a monopoly through \"unreasonable methods,\" according to the FTC's antitrust primer.</p><p>The FTC Act outlaws \"unfair methods of competition,\" but leaves it up to the courts to define \"unfair.\"</p><p>The Clayton Act prohibits mergers and acquisitions whose effect \"may be [to] substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly.\" Section 7A of the act, called the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act, requires prior notification of large mergers to both the FTC and the Justice Department.</p><p>The threshold for triggering an HSR filing is so complex that lawyers devote entire careers to it. According to Molly Boast, senior deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, an HSR filing is required \"if one of the companies has at least $100 million in total worldwide assets or annual net sales and the other party has at least $10 million and if, following the transaction, the firm will own voting securities or assets of the acquired company valued at more than $15 million or representing 50% or more of the voting securities of an issuer with total assets or annual net sales of $25 million or more.\"</p><p>\"That's the test that's applied as of today,\" says Boast, adding that it's a general rule that does not apply in every case. In addition, pending legislation in Congress would raise those thresholds to reflect the increasingly high valuations of companies today, she notes. but the fate of that bill is uncertain, given the new Congress.</p><p>Boast adds that the FTC has authority to investigate a company even if it does not have to file an HSR. \"This is not a safe harbor,\" she says. The FTC can use its subpoena powers to \"investigate any transaction. [The HSR] is just a pre-merger requirement\" for larger deals.</p><p>--T.H.</p><p>Tam Harbert is ELECTRONIC BUSINESS' national editor in Washington, DC.

US senator Elizabeth Warren has said that one reason to require 'large tech platforms to be designated as 'Platform Utilities' and broken apart from any participant on that platform' is to prevent them from using data they obtain from third parties on the platform to benefit their own participation on the platform.Amazon tweeted in response to Warren: 'We don't use individual sellers' data to launch private label products.' However, an Amazon spokeswoman would not answer questions about whether it uses aggregated non-public data about sellers, or data from buyers; and whether any formal firewall prevents Amazon's retail operation from accessing Marketplace data.If the problem is solely that Amazon's own retail operation can access data from the Marketplace, structurally breaking up the company and forbidding it and other platforms from participating on those platforms may be a far more extensive intervention than is needed. </p><p>A targeted response such as a firewall could remedy the specific competitive harm.Germany's Federal Cartel Office implicitly recognised this with its Facebook decision, which did not demand the divestiture of every business beyond the core social network - the 'Mark Zuckerberg Production' that began in 2004. Instead, the competition authority prohibited Facebook from conditioning the use of that social network on consent to the collection and combination of data from WhatsApp, Oculus, Masquerade, Instagram and any other sites or apps where Facebook might track them.The decision does not limit data collection on Facebook itself. 'It is taken into account that an advertising-funded social network generally needs to process a large amount of personal data,' the authority said[4]. 'However, the Bundeskartellamt holds that the efficiencies in a business model based on personalised advertising do not outweigh the interests of the users when it comes to processing data from sources outside of the social network.'The Federal Cartel Office thus aims to wall off the data collected on Facebook from data that can be collected anywhere else. It ordered Facebook to present a road map for how it would implement these changes within four months of the February 2019 decision, but the time limit was suspended by the company's emergency appeal to the D\u00fcsseldorf Higher Regional Court.Federal Cartel Office president Andreas Mundt has described[5] the kind of remedy he had ordered for Facebook as not exactly structural, but going in a 'structural direction' that might work for other cases as well. Keeping the data apart is a way to 'break up this market power' without literally breaking up the corporation, and the first step to an 'internal divestiture', he said.Mundt claimed that this kind of remedy gets to 'the core of the problem': big internet companies being able to out-compete new entrants, because the former can obtain and process data even beyond what they collected on a single service that has attracted a large number of users.He used terms like 'silo' rather than 'firewall', but the essential idea is to protect competition by preventing the dissemination of certain information. Antitrust authorities worldwide have considered firewalls, particularly in vertical merger remedies, as a way to prevent the anticompetitive movement of data while still allowing for some efficiencies of business units being under the same corporate umbrella.Notwithstanding Mundt's reference to a 'structural direction', competition authorities including his own have traditionally classified firewalls as a behavioural or conduct remedy. They purport to solve a specific problem: the movement of information.Other aspects of big companies that can give them an advantage - such as the use of profits from one part of a company to invest in another part, perhaps to undercut rivals on prices - would not be addressed by firewalls. They would more likely would require dividing up a company at the corporate level.But if data are the central concern, then the way forward might be found in firewalls. What do the enforcers say?Germany The Federal Cartel Office's May 2017 guidance[6] on merger remedies disfavours firewalls, stating that such obligations are 'not suitable to remedy competitive harm' because they require continuous oversight. Employees of a corporation in almost any sector will commonly exchange information on a daily basis in almost every industry, making it 'extremely difficult to identify, stop and prevent non-compliance with the firewall obligations', the guidance states. In a footnote, it acknowledges that other, unspecified jurisdictions have regarded firewalls 'as an effective remedy to remove competition concerns'. UK The UK's Competition and Markets Authority takes a more optimistic view[7] of the ability to keep a firewall in place, at least in the context of a vertical integration to prevent the use of 'privileged information generated by competitors' use of the merged company's facilities or products'. In addition to setting up the company to restrict information flows, staff interactions and the sharing of services, physical premises and management, the CMA also requires the commitment of 'significant resources to educating staff about the requirements of the measures and supporting the measures with disciplinary procedures and independent monitoring'. EU The European Commission's merger remedies notice[8] is quite short. It does not mention firewalls or Chinese walls by name, simply noting that any non-structural remedy is problematic 'due to the absence of effective monitoring of its implementation' by the commission or even other market participants. A 2011 European Commission submission[9] to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was gloomier: 'We have also found that firewalls are virtually impossible to monitor.' US DOJ The US antitrust agencies have been inconsistent in their views, and not on a consistent partisan basis. Under George W Bush, the Department of Justice's antitrust division's 2004 merger guidance[10] said 'a properly designed and enforced firewall' could prevent certain competition harms. But it also would require the DOJ and courts to expend 'considerable time and effort' on monitoring, and 'may frequently destroy the very efficiency that the merger was designed to generate. For these reasons, the use of firewalls in division decrees is the exception and not the rule.'Under Barack Obama, the Antitrust Division revised[11] its guidance in 2011 to omit the most sceptical language about firewalls, replacing it with a single sentence about the need for effective monitoring. Under Donald Trump, the Antitrust Division has withdrawn[12] the 2011 guidance, and the 2004 guidance is operative. US FTC At the Federal Trade Commission, on the other hand, firewalls had long been relatively uncontroversial among both Republicans and Democrats. For example, the commissioners unanimously agreed to a firewall remedy for PepsiCo's and Coca-Cola's separate 2010 acquisitions of bottlers and distributors that also dealt with rival a rival beverage maker, the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. (The FTC later emphasised[13] the importance in those cases of obtaining industry expert monitors, who 'have provided commission staff with invaluable insight and evaluation regarding each company's compliance with the commission's orders'.)In 2017, the two commissioners who remained from the Obama administration both signed[14] off on the Broadcom/Brocade merger based on a firewall - as did[15] the European Commission, which also mandated interoperability commitments. And the Democratic commissioners appointed by President Trump voted[16] with their Republican colleagues in 2018 to clear the Northrop Grumman/Orbital ATK deal subject to a behavioural remedy that included supply commitments and firewalls.Several months later, however, those Democrats dissented from the FTC's approval of Staples/Essendant, which the agency conditioned solely on a firewall between Essendant's wholesale business and the Staples unit that handles corporate sales. While a firewall to prevent Staples from exploiting Essendant's commercially-sensitive data about Staples' rivals 'will reduce the chance of misuse of data, it does not eliminate it,' Commissioner Rohit Chopra said[17]. He emphasised the difficulty of policing oral communications, and said the FTC instead could have required Essendant to return its customers' data. Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said she shared Chopra's 'concerns about the efficacy of the firewall to remedy the information sharing harm'.The majority[18] defended firewalls' effectiveness, noting that it had used them solve competition concerns in past vertical mergers, 'and the integrity of those firewalls was robust.' The Republican commissioners cited the FTC's review of the merger remedies it had imposed from 2006 to 2012, which concluded: 'All vertical merger orders were judged successful.'Republican commissioner Christine Wilson wrote separately about the importance of choosing 'a remedy that is narrowly tailored to address the likely competitive harms without doing collateral damage.' Certain behavioural remedies for past vertical mergers had gone too far and even resulted in less competition, she said. 'I have substantially fewer qualms about long-standing and less invasive tools, such as the 'firewalls, fair dealing, and transparency provisions' the Antitrust Division endorsed in the 2004 edition of its Policy Guide.' Why firewalls don't work, especially for big tech Firewalls are designed to prevent the anticompetitive harm of information exchange, but whether they work depends on whether the companies and their employees behave themselves - and if they do not, on whether antitrust enforcers can know it and prove it. Deputy assistant attorney general Barry Nigro at the Antitrust Division has questioned[19] the effectiveness of firewalls as a remedy for deals where the relevant business units are operationally close. The same problem may arise outside the merger context.For example, Amazon's investment fund for products to complement its Alexa virtual assistant could be seen as having the kind of firewall that is undercut by the practicalities of how a business operates. CNBC reported in September 2017 that 'Alexa Fund representatives called a handful of its portfolio companies to say a clear 'firewall' exists between the Alexa Fund and Amazon's product development teams.' The chief executive from Nucleus, one of those portfolio companies, had complained that Amazon's Echo Show was a copycat of Nucleus's product. While Amazon claimed that the Alexa Fund has 'measures' to ensure 'appropriate treatment' of confidential information, the companies said the process of obtaining the fund's investment required them to work closely with Amazon's product teams.CNBC contrasted with Intel Capital - a division of the technology company that manages venture capital and investment - where a former managing director said he and his colleagues 'tried to be extra careful not to let trade secrets flow across the firewall into its parent company'.Firewalls are commonplace to corporate lawyers, who instill temporary blocks to prevent transmission of information in a variety of situations, such as during due diligence on a deal. This experience may lead such attorneys to put more faith in firewalls than enforcement advocates do.Diana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, says that like other behavioral remedies, firewalls 'don't change any incentive to exercise market power'. In contrast, structural remedies eliminate that incentive by removing the part of the business that would make the exercise of market power profitable.No internal monitoring or compliance ensures the firewall is respected, Moss says, unless a government consent order installs a monitor in a company to make sure the business units aren't sharing information. This would be unlikely to occur, she says.Moss's 2011 white paper[20] on behavioural merger remedies, co-authored with John Kwoka, reviews how well such remedies have worked. It notes that 'information firewalls in Google-ITA and Comcast-NBCU clearly impede the joint operation and coordination of business divisions that would otherwise naturally occur.'Lina Khan's 2019 Columbia Law Review article[21], 'The Separation of Platforms and Commerce,' repeatedly cites Moss and Kwoka in the course of arguing that non-separation solutions such as firewalls do not work.Khan concedes that information firewalls 'in theory could help prevent information appropriation by dominant integrated firms.' But regulating the dissemination of information is especially difficult 'in multibillion dollar markets built around the intricate collection, combination, and sale of data', as companies in those markets 'will have an even greater incentive to combine different sets of information'. Why firewalls might work, especially for big tech Yet neither Khan nor Moss points to an example of a firewall that clearly did not work. Khan writes: 'Whether the [Google-ITA] information firewall was successful in preventing Google from accessing rivals' business information is not publicly known. A year after the remedy expired, Google shut down' the application programming interface, through which ITA had provided its customisable flight search engine.Even as enforcement advocates throw doubt on firewalls, enforcers keep requiring them. China's Ministry of Commerce even used them to remedy a horizontal merger, in two stages of its conditions on Western Digital's acquisition of Hitachi's hard disk drive.If German courts allow Andreas Mundt's remedy for Facebook to go into effect, it will provide an example of just how effective a firewall can be on a platform. The decision requires Facebook to detail its technical plan to implement the obligation not to share data on users from its subsidiaries and its tracking on independent websites and apps.A section of the 'frequently asked questions[22]' about the Federal Cartel Office's Facebook case includes: 'How can the Bundeskartellamt enforce the implementation of its decision?' The authority can impose fines for known non-compliance, but that assume it could detect violations of its order. Somewhat tentatively, the agency says it could carry out random monitoring, which is 'possible in principle as the actual flow of data eg from websites to Facebook can be monitored by analysing websites and their components or by recording signals.'As perhaps befits the digital difference between Staples and Facebook, the German authority posits monitoring that would not be able to catch the kind of 'oral communications' that Commissioner Chopra worried about when the US FTC cleared Staples' acquisition of Essendant. But the use of such high-monitors could make firewalls even more appropriate as a remedy for platforms - which look to large data flows for a competitive advantage - than for old economy sales teams that could harm competition with just a few minutes of conversation.Rather than a human monitor installed in a company to guard against firewall breaches, which Moss said was unlikely, software installed on employee computers and email systems might detect data flows between business units that should be walled off from each other. Breakups and firewalls are both longstanding remedies, but the latter may be more amenable to the kind of solutions that 'big tech' itself has provided.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure.

Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies.

We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions. Instead of implementing a nationwide lockdown, the government approved large-scale social restrictions. Several large cities implemented their own lockdown. Most cities began lifting restrictions in June.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC. FINANCIALS</p><p>SECTION 2 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

Through applications of AI, companies of different backgrounds in various industries are finding evermore effective solutions, meeting their demands at a faster pace, and tackling larger and more impactful challenges every day. Together with increased connectivity and automation, AI is a fundamental component of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Up until now, the AEC industry has had a slow response to these developments, but now, we are standing at the brink of disruption and we predict significant changes will happen to our industry in the near future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate change, population growth, urbanization and globalization are megatrends which are creating different societal needs related to housing, infrastructure, transportation, and construction. Furthermore, 2020 - with the pandemic, economic turmoil, and societal unrest - has increased the demand for more effective and faster solutions societal challenges. A paradigm shift is required to successfully face the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite the significant potential to boost services within the AEC industry using existing technology within data analytics and artificial intelligence, the adaptation rate in the industry has been rather low. This could be partly due to fragmentation of our industry, which makes large collaborative research and development projects difficult, which further slows down innovation.</p><p>We successfully started to explore AI capabilities in the AEC industry, and we have delivered numerous projects that focus on data analytics to our clients, with cutting-edge analytics solutions. Arcadis would like to share its AI expertise with the industry, with the hope that this will be a step in the direction towards a more collaborative, digitized, and innovative industry. We believe that by adapting to the digital transformation, we all can deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to our clients - and consequently, improve the quality of life for people all over the globe.</p><p>We came together and worked collaboratively on a joint document: \"Artificial Intelligence in the AEC Industry - a Code of Practice\", which is a comprehensive report about the current state of AI in our industry, the future opportunities and trends it brings, and examples of work we have conducted together with our clients. The main areas of AI in the AEC industry include: (1) Sensory, (2) Language Processing, (3) Perceive, (4) Knowledge Representation, (5) Learning, (6) Decision-making, (7) Augmented Creativity, and (8) Motion. These branches of AI can be applied to a variety of client challenges, and in our Code of Practice we illustrate how AI can be used in all our solutions and market sectors.</p><p>The Artificial Intelligence in the AEC Industry - A Code of Practice is the result of global collaboration between regions and sectors, and we are proud to utilize the knowledge of several of our industry experts, and to share this with the industry. We hope that this report can inspire other companies in the industry to also take the step towards a more digitized future. We are excited to face the challenges of the future, and further investigate how we, as an industry, can revolutionize the nature of architecture, engineering, and construction.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 EC HARRIS LLP PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2019</p><p>SECTION 5 OTHER NEWS: 2019</p><p>SECTION 6 EC HARRIS LLP TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 EC HARRIS LLP PROFILE</p><p>1.1 SUMMARY</p><p>PermID: 4297202436</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.echarris.com\">http://www.echarris.com</url></p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>January 21: EC Harris LLP: Arcadis Acquires Over Morgen, a Dutch Consultancy</p><p>Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, today announces that it acquired Over Morgen, a fast-growing Dutch consultancy company with 80 employees focusing on solving various societal challenges by creating sustainable societies through an integrated approach that combines area development and energy transition.

In case we are mandated to close offices in specific virus-affected countries or regions, our ability to work from home, allows our business to remain operational.</p><p>We have set up a global COVID-19 task force focusing on safeguarding our people during this crisis, ensuring business continuity, and protecting our clients' businesses. Additionally, the task force works closely with regional CEOs, leaders, and groups that have been formed to handle this crisis on local levels. Arcadis has a Business Continuity Management approach to be able to continue operations and serve our clients under all circumstances.</p><p>Arcadis is committed to continue to assist our clients successfully during this unsettling time. Our global and regional account leaders and project managers will work closely with clients to better understand their business priorities and continuity plans, while we determine the best way of working together moving forward.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be one of the most unexpected devastating events in recent history, and navigating its business impact is a challenge for everyone.</p><p>March 02: EC Harris LLP: Ten new startups selected for the Arcadis City of 2030 Accelerator, powered by Techstars</p><p>Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, today announced the ten startups selected for the second wave of its City of 2030 accelerator, powered by Techstars.

Having worked with the Environment Agency for over 17 years now, we have a long- standing relationship and, through this latest framework, will be able to step-up our partnership to the next level. A priority will be to ensure that program delivery is in alignment with relevant Government codes and careful consideration is given to how investment is best spent. Ultimately, the framework and the Environment Agency's strategy echoes our vision to always be improving quality of life, the safety of citizens and ensuring the environment is a top priority.\"</p><p>Brian Francis, Client Support Framework Manager at the Environment Agency, added:</p><p>\"We welcome all our new Delivery Partners and the specialist knowledge, skills and technology they bring.</p><p>June 26: EC Harris LLP: Arcadis Awarded Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest Design Services Contract</p><p>Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, today announced that a A$26 million contract has been awarded to Metron T2M, a joint venture between Arcadis Australia Pacific Pty Ltd and Mott MacDonald Australia Pty Ltd, to help deliver the metro upgrade of the T3 Bankstown Line between Sydenham and Bankstown.</p><p>Metron T2M will deliver design services for the stations and the railway corridor between Marrickville and Punchbowl.</p><p>Sydney Metro is Australia's biggest public transport project, delivering 31 stations and 66 kilometers of new metro rail, revolutionizing travel in Australia's biggest city.</p><p>Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest extends the metro rail 30 kilometers from the end of Sydney Metro Northwest at Chatswood under Sydney, through new Central Business District (CBD) stations and Southwest to Bankstown.</p><p>Phil Kajewski, Managing Director Transportation Australia Pacific, Arcadis stated: \"This is an incredibly important piece of the Sydney Metro project and we are very excited to help bring this to life.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

Amazon is betting the answer to that question is \"pretty much all of it.\" Amazon has already invaded your home with Alexa and Amazon Prime. It knows your grocery list, your preferred interior temperature, and your child's favorite television show. Now, with its upcoming wearable tech, Halo, it wants to know everything about your body and health. That even includes whether your tone of voice is possibly lacking some positivity. Seriously.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Halo is a wristband with sensors that collect data about your activity, sleep, temperature, and heart activity. Users are expected to wear the band at all times in order to constantly feed data to an application on your phone. Through the app and a paid service, users will receive all sorts of feedback and input on how to achieve better health outcomes. Amazon has partnered with a wide variety of companies such as Lifesum, Sweat, or 8fit who can tailor a regime to have you looking and feeling your best.</p><p>But Halo goes far beyond the typical features consumers have come to expect from fitness trackers. Surely you wouldn't upload an almost nude picture of yourself to a company's servers to let them analyze it for body fat? With Halo, that is exactly what you will do. It requires users to upload pictures of themselves so it can measure body mass index and nudge people towards a healthier body composition. That may sound like some rather intimate technology, but at least Amazon won't also be evaluating your dinner conversation with your husband for irregularities, right? Well, the Halo band will also measure the tone of your voice to \"analyze qualities of your voice like energy and positivity to help strengthen communication.\" An algorithm will warn that your low-energy voice is the result of a stressful day and recommend steps to achieve more \"voice positivity.\" There has been no confirmation on whether Halo recordings can be used in divorce proceedings.</p><p>I have written previously in this space about how connected devices are changing the home insurance industry. They have the potential to reshape the health insurance industry as well. As with home technology, the Halo offering revolves around partnerships. Amazon is offering up a number of wellness-related partnerships such as WeightWatchers, Headspace, and Orangetheory fitness. On top of those, the band will also be a fully subsidized option for the John Hancock Vitality wellness program. Users will be able to link their band to the program and earn Vitality points that save them money on insurance thanks to healthier habits. Given the costs of health insurance in the United States, any chance to reduce expenditures is surely attractive. With over 100+ partners, Amazon will have something to fill every health-related niche in your life.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 EFMA SARL PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 1 EFMA SARL PROFILE</p><p>1.1 SUMMARY</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.efma.com\">http://www.efma.com</url></p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>September 01: EFMA SARL : DBS launches new solutions to bolster Singaporeans' retirement plans and financial resilience</p><p>DBS is ramping up its suite of digital financial planning solutions and tools to empower Singaporeans so they can get a head start in retirement planning and strengthen their financial resilience.

The real evolution has taken in place in how these services are delivered. Digital services and methods of delivery are now firmly front and center.

Consumers are choosing banks with the expectation that they will receive more than mere money management tools. Along with the digital banking essentials, banks must align with the lifestyle of their customers.

This partnership is an important step for Lunar in becoming the primary banking interface for its more than 170,000 users. 25 August 2020 Nordic challenger bank Lunar partners with Nordic API Gateway to take full advantage of PSD2</p><p>In the coming months, Lunar is set to activate multi-banking features and enable payments across Denmark, Sweden and Norway with Nordic API Gateway. As a result, Lunar becomes one of the first Danish banks with a fully functional combination of both account aggregation and payment initiation.</p><p>The open banking partnership with Nordic API Gateway supports Lunar's ambitions of creating a 'financial super app' for its rapidly growing customer base across the Nordics.

A few months ago, I wrote about three possible scenarios to consider as people were assessing and planning for the upcoming months. The first scenario, the optimistic hope of a V-shaped rebound of economic activity, is now off the table. As we see people re-confined to their households from Australia to Japan to Catalonia, one thing is clear: this virus, this pandemic, is the big one. It continues to spread all around the globe, with ever-changing geographic hot spots, overwhelming governments and people while causing massive disruptions to daily life.</p><p>Now, six months on from the discovery of the virus in Wuhan, China, Europe is slowly staggering back to life. While there is a long way to go yet, some figures from the Old Continent are encouraging. Retail is rebounding. Industrial production, while still far lower than the previous year, has begun to tick back up. People are planning their holidays for August. The numbers, and daily life, paint a picture of a slow but steady resumption of normal life.</p><p>It is, however, a very different story across the Atlantic. The United States has failed to meaningfully suppress the virus. Its rampant spread in various parts of the country has led governors of many states to reimpose business closings, mandate their citizens wear masks, and urge people to stay home. While the early outbreak in the U.S. was limited to certain hot spot regions like the northeast, and New York City in particular, now cases are growing rapidly in western and southern states. The country has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the world.</p><p>The surge of the virus throughout the country and the accompanying restrictive measures were clearly reflected in the earnings reports of top financial institutions last week.</p><p>July 23: EFMA SARL: UnionBank and its partners launch an app for the distribution of government bonds enabled by blockchain</p><p>The Philippine Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), together with Union Bank of the Philippines (UnionBank) and the Philippine Digital Asset Exchange (PDAX) - a Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) licensed entity, is the first in Asia to launch an app for the distribution of government bonds enabled by Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 22: EFMA SARL: Barclays helps close the advice gap with launch of Plan &amp; Invest</p><p>Barclays has launched a new digital advice service to tackle the UK's advice gap and give more people the confidence and support to invest their savings.

The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets.

Her first stint in sustainability was in the non-profit sector, where she spent several years managing large programs in areas like global health and microfinance. When she decided to make the leap to the private sector because of her \"firm belief that private capital can make a significant difference in accelerating the shift to a sustainable economy\", she first completed a Finance degree before joining Sustainalytics, an ESG rating agency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As global head of green and sustainable bonds, Taneja was responsible for growing the issuer side of the business, new product development and commercializing ESG products for issuers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then Deutsche Bank came calling</p><p>\"I'm quite entrepreneurial, and ESG is a fast-moving market, so the opportunity to grow the bank's Sustainable Finance business further really appealed to me. It's an exciting new venture,\" said Taneja, whose experience helping more than 200 issuers with their green and sustainable bonds directly translates to her new role at Deutsche Bank. As the Green, Social, Sustainable bonds (GSS) market is only about five or six years old, it can be a challenge to find someone with experience working with different types of issuers, whether that's corporates, banks or sovereigns, in different countries and regions.</p><p>\"Our mandate is two-fold: first, we want to act as ESG advisors to the bank's clients, helping position Deutsche Bank as an expert on ESG,\" she explained. \"This means increasing the frequency of client interactions and dialogue on ESG in collaboration with the relationship teams, coverage bankers, and ESG champions whether in Debt Capital Markets, Origination, Capital Markets product teams, or Corporate Finance. Collectively, as an institution, we should be able to have a highly engaged level of dialogue on ESG.\"</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 SUMMARY</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD\">http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD</url></p><p>Industry: Capital Markets</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>August 18: Deutsche Bank appoints Vietnam Country Chief</p><p>Deutsche Bank today announced the appointment of respected Vietnamese banker, Huynh Buu Quang, as Acting Chief Country Officer (CCO) Vietnam, pending State Bank of Vietnam final approval.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer Alexander von zur Muehlen, said: \"With Vietnam a key growth market for our bank in ASEAN, we are delighted to have an individual of Quang's calibre and experience leading the next phase in the expansion of the local franchise.\"</p><p>An experienced CEO, Quang has led significant transformation and growth strategies for both international and local banks. To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

By doing so, we pledge to align our credit and investment portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\"Banks play a crucial role in the fight against climate change. Because it is up to us to provide the funds for the transformation of the global economy through financing and investment products. We accept this challenge,\" said Christian Sewing explaining the decision.</p><p>This initiative, launched by several banks, aims to contribute to climate protection and to support the sustainable, future-oriented development of the economy. This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets. The participants intend to support each other in collecting the necessary emissions data. In addition, they want to jointly develop measurement methods and appropriate approaches to manage banking business in line with the goals. All signatories will report on their progress annually.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 25: Deutsche Bank announces changes to the Italian franchise and to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank S.p.A.</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) After a 20-year career with Deutsche Bank, including 12 years of consecutive service as Chief Country Officer Italy and Chief Executive Officer at Deutsche Bank S.p.A., Flavio Valeri has decided to leave Deutsche Bank to pursue new challenges.</p><p>\"Flavio Valeri has been instrumental in developing the bank's Italian business and positioning it for growth in the years ahead,\" said Werner Steinmueller, Chairman of the Deutsche Bank S.p.A.

Altogether, Germany's anti-crisis measures - consisting of extra spending, guarantees and loan/participation programs - sum up to an astronomic value of around EUR 1.9 tr (well above 50% of GDP in 2019). This gives the government huge scope to fight the pandemic and economic crisis.

More than 90 percent of all students were not allowed to attend school, according to the UNESCO World Education Report 2020. And even now, many students still have to study online. These restrictions have impacted equal opportunities and high-quality education, especially for children from financially weaker and disadvantaged backgrounds. This year's International Literacy Day 2020 on September 8 therefore focuses on \"Literacy teaching and learning in the COVID-19 crisis and beyond\", especially on the role of educators and changing pedagogies.</p><p>\"The pandemic further increases inequalities in the education system. We embrace the current dynamics and have developed digital enhancements to our programmes that will reach students, even if studying at home\", says Lareena Hilton, Global Head of Brand &amp; Corporate Social Responsibility, Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Baut Eure Zukunft</p><p>Together with our partner organisations, we have adapted many of our Born to Be youth engagement programmes to meet the current restrictions.

During the pandemic, good governance has allowed firms not only to maintain basic functions, such as cash flow and fulfilling contractual obligations, but has also helped them to keep their workforce and customers safe. The scope of governance will widen further in future. The socio-economic effects of this crisis, including the growing involvement of governments in many areas, will put new demands on corporate governance. Environmental aspects are also likely to stay prominent. Future governance changes will require a sense of balance. In a constantly changing environment, new approaches will need to evolve to address a range of concerns in a financially sustainable way that balances the needs of individuals, governments, corporates and investors.</p><p>The report provides an overview of governance components and studies their impact on firms' performance. It also includes a brief history of corporate governance and a guest contribution on governance in German family-owned firms.</p><p>August 26: Deutsche Bank acts as joint marketing coordinator for educating investors on the Federal Republic of Germany's inaugural Green Bond</p><p>Germany has just published its Green Bond Framework and is now marketing its inaugural Green German Federal Security Deutsche Bank is acting as joint marketing coordinator to ensure a smooth investor education process The inaugural Green German Federal Security is to be issued within the next few weeks</p><p>Over the last six months Germany has developed its first Green Bond Framework, joining several other countries such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands in the Green Bond market.

What if Deutsche Bank had an app that could track clients' carbon footprints and help them save money by challenging their behaviour? And what if this app could also help those clients reinvest those extra savings in a more responsible way?</p><p>This idea became GreenR, a prototype developed as part of the Intrapreneur Initiative. GreenR will allow users to clearly see their personal environmental footprint. It will link directly to your Deutsche Bank accounts and translate your last six months of bank transactions- from where and what you eat, to how you move around - into how much C02 you produce.</p><p>Once a pattern emerges, GreenR will present a set of challenges designed to reduce your C02 footprint by, for example, helping you buy more local products, eat less meat or cycle more. For things you cannot change, like needing to fly, you can offset your carbon footprint by investing in environmental projects.</p><p>GreenR Logo \"Typically you have the option to donate to specific environmental projects to offset your C02 output. This is money you won't see again,\" said Saenz de Alba, a mathematician originally from Mexico. \"Our idea is to instead have a range of investments focused on environmental projects that, for example, help to reduce C02 or to reforest, so you're getting both an economic and an environmental return.</p><p>August 19: Deutsche Bank named Best Corporate Trust Bank in APAC and Best Domestic Custodian in four regional markets</p><p>The Asset Magazine has named Deutsche Bank \"Best Corporate Trust Bank\" in Asia Pacific and \"Best Domestic Custodian\" in four markets at their 2020 Sustainable Investing Institutional Investor, ETF and Asset Servicing Awards.

Shopify has benefited from the rush of businesses looking to set up online during the global pandemic, and new stores on the platform grew 71% in the second quarter. This growth has seen Shopify surpass eBay in online spending but the company now has its sights set on Amazon's market share. The company is currently investing $1B in warehouse space and robotics to build a fulfillment network that can compete with Jeff Bezos' e-commerce giant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">App store commission dispute: Apple puts pressure on Airbnb. After several weeks of public disputes over commission fees for revenue generated from the App Store, Airbnb is now under fire for withholding commission on their virtual experience classes. Apple currently demands 30% of all fees, a rate that many think is extortionate.

By partnering with Enterprise Nation, a business support network, Amazon can now offer free online training in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The program features an \"online diagnostics test\", which directs users towards different \"Start\", \"Grow\", or \"Turbo\" materials, and users will also be eligible for discounts on business supplies and protective equipment.

As product teams are usually separated at Google, and Raghavan will be retaining control of Google Ads, this is seen by many as a worrying departure from normal procedure.

Search Optimization, on the other hand, can provide this visibility for free. Google Ads' interest in gaining more dominance over search results, and providing more space for advertisers, is also seen as contradictory to Google Search's aim of providing the best user experience possible.</p><p>Google has released its newer, easier developer tools.

The company hopes that the pilot program will help it vet and connect one-on-one with prospective sellers by using Amazon Chime videoconferencing. Additionally, through the use of a propriety machine learning system, Amazon will be able to identify hundreds of different data points of risk, including verifying whether an account is related to another account that was previously removed.

But one of the things I'm proud of at Hamilton Place Strategies is that from the very beginning, we were focused on building a durable business - focused more on the unique quality of our work than on any individual or any political moment in time.</p><p>Ten years ago, the landscape for all firms was changing. Big issues facing firms were becoming increasingly complex, public, and global. At the same time, news organizations covering these very complex issues were devoting more resources to sophisticated reporting and presentation of news. The ability to share this news was growing as well. The kinds of deep, wonky analysis usually reserved for think tanks was now showing up on popular news sites.</p><p>Working in that news environment requires a much greater depth of knowledge about the issues and challenges facing firms. We felt that analytical, evidence-based messaging, strategies, and tactics would be most effective.</p><p>We also felt that for HPS to be a credible participant on these issues - and a partner to our clients - it was also important to show our analysis and express our views, regardless of ideology, party, or politics.</p><p>July 16: HPS Announces Claire Bischoff as Director: HPS Announces Claire Bischoff as Director</p><p>Today, Hamilton Place Strategies (HPS) is pleased to announce Claire Bischoff's promotion to director at the firm.</p><p>Since joining HPS in 2016, Claire has performed invaluable work as an associate and senior associate, helping to develop and implement strategic communications, crisis management, and brand development strategies for clients in finance, mergers and acquisitions, and tech, among other industries.

GOOGL, -3.64% GOOG, -3.68%, the parent company of Google and YouTube, multiple sources told the New York Times on Thursday. MarketWatch was able to independently confirm the timing of the antitrust action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the Times report. A company spokesman said Google would \"continue to engage with ongoing investigations\" and that its business practices enabled \"increased choice and competition.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google shares were flat in after-hours trading on Thursday.</p><p>The reasoning behind a rush to action underscores a belief among some antitrust experts that the Trump administration is seeking punitive measures against Big Tech for its influence over consumers and multiple markets to curry favor with voters. Anger toward the largest tech companies has resonated across political parties, from liberals to conservatives.</p><p>But some questioned the swift timetable, which could ultimately wreak havoc on a stock market driven by tech companies. On Thursday, tech shares were battered badly in a massive selloff.</p><p>\"I'm a little puzzled by the strategy here. Rush out a half-baked case to protect Google? Rush out any case to appease public sentiment?\" antitrust lawyer Paul Swanson told MarketWatch.</p><p>Google has been the most likely of the four tech companies under federal investigation - the others are Apple Inc. AAPL, -6.72%, Facebook Inc. FB, -4.09%, and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -4.39% - to face punitive action, according to at least two recent reports.</p><p>The Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general may file antitrust lawsuits focusing broadly on how Google leverages its dominant search business to stifle competition, according to a Wall Street Journal report.</p><p>At the same time, the Justice Department and state attorneys general are investigating the pricing and operations of Google's Network division, a business that sells services that handle almost every step a digital ad takes, said a Bloomberg report.

Google might also be motivated to create a new mapping property that would directly compete with Maps.\"</p><p>Of course, the political calculus of such moves during a presidential election year brings deep economic implications, Anurag Chandra, a partner at venture-capital firm Fort Ross Ventures, told MarketWatch.</p><p>\"I'm growing skeptical that we will see anything definitive regarding an anitrust action before the election,\" he said. \"The administration, despite its feelings about monopolization, needs a strong economy. A concrete action against Big Tech could drive down their stock and blunt market momentum that has been aided by tech companies.\"</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 HOLLAND &amp; HART PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 HOLLAND &amp; HART TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 HOLLAND &amp; HART PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Holland &amp; Hart helps clients with integrated legal solutions.

GOOGL, -3.64% GOOG, -3.68%, the parent company of Google and YouTube, multiple sources told the New York Times on Thursday. MarketWatch was able to independently confirm the timing of the antitrust action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the Times report. A company spokesman said Google would \"continue to engage with ongoing investigations\" and that its business practices enabled \"increased choice and competition.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google shares were flat in after-hours trading on Thursday.</p><p>The reasoning behind a rush to action underscores a belief among some antitrust experts that the Trump administration is seeking punitive measures against Big Tech for its influence over consumers and multiple markets to curry favor with voters. Anger toward the largest tech companies has resonated across political parties, from liberals to conservatives.</p><p>But some questioned the swift timetable, which could ultimately wreak havoc on a stock market driven by tech companies. On Thursday, tech shares were battered badly in a massive selloff.</p><p>\"I'm a little puzzled by the strategy here. Rush out a half-baked case to protect Google? Rush out any case to appease public sentiment?\" antitrust lawyer Paul Swanson told MarketWatch.</p><p>Google has been the most likely of the four tech companies under federal investigation - the others are Apple Inc. AAPL, -6.72%, Facebook Inc. FB, -4.09%, and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -4.39% - to face punitive action, according to at least two recent reports.</p><p>The Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general may file antitrust lawsuits focusing broadly on how Google leverages its dominant search business to stifle competition, according to a Wall Street Journal report.</p><p>At the same time, the Justice Department and state attorneys general are investigating the pricing and operations of Google's Network division, a business that sells services that handle almost every step a digital ad takes, said a Bloomberg report.

Learn More MarketWatch on Multiple devices</p><p>Should the government act, it could have far-reaching implications for search and location marketers, says Greg Sterling, vice president of insights at software company Uberall.</p><p>\"One of the potential remedies in any antitrust case would be to break Google up into separate companies: Google (Search Ads), Maps, YouTube, Android and Chrome potentially,\" Sterling said in a statement. \"Separating Google Maps (and potentially Waze) from Google would have a potentially significant impact on local search.</p><p>\"That could create new openings for other mapping and local search competitors. Google might also be motivated to create a new mapping property that would directly compete with Maps.\"</p><p>Of course, the political calculus of such moves during a presidential election year brings deep economic implications, Anurag Chandra, a partner at venture-capital firm Fort Ross Ventures, told MarketWatch.</p><p>\"I'm growing skeptical that we will see anything definitive regarding an anitrust action before the election,\" he said. \"The administration, despite its feelings about monopolization, needs a strong economy. A concrete action against Big Tech could drive down their stock and blunt market momentum that has been aided by tech companies.\"</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 HOLLAND &amp; HART PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 HOLLAND &amp; HART TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 HOLLAND &amp; HART PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Holland &amp; Hart helps clients with integrated legal solutions.

The governors insist they are \"co-sovereigns with the federal government\" and need an equal role in the decision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Trump administration is seeking to restrict what land and waterways can be protected as habitat for wildlife facing extinction, one of the latest ways it's sought to roll back environmental safeguards.</p><p>The government is trying to redefine what habitat means for the purposes of enforcing the Endangered Species Act, the landmark law that has dictated wildlife protections in the U.S. since 1973. It released a proposed rule in early August.</p><p>Governors said they're having to express their views through a public comment process on the proposed rule, saying that isn't enough input and they want the federal government to consult with states.</p><p>\"It is important for federal agencies and state wildlife managers to maintain a close working relationship to ensure that any new interpretation or application of the term does not result in unintended consequences for state management of species,\" according to the letter signed by Democratic Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, chairwoman of Western Governors Association, and Republican Idaho Gov. Brad Little, who's vice chairman.</p><p>Once an imperiled species is listed under the act, federal officials designate critical habitat that it needs to survive. That can include where a species lives and areas where they don't live but are deemed essential for survival. Such designations can come into conflict with private landowners and those using public lands for recreation, grazing or energy development.</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court called into question the definition of \"critical habitat\" in a 2018 ruling. The Trump administration this year put forward a definition it says will \"balance effective, science-based conservation with common-sense policy designed to bring the ESA into the 21st century.\"</p><p>Critics say the administration's definition appears to rule out land or water that needs restoration work or sites that could become suitable for imperiled wildfire in the future, particularly when climate change is considered.</p><p>Since taking office, President Donald Trump has sought to scale back environmental protections in favor of industry, ranging from shrinking national monuments to opening up areas for oil and gas drilling. He's also lifted or suspended environmental regulations intended to prevent pollution during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>On Friday, the administration released a proposal that would change the Endangered Species Act to allow the government to deny protections for critical habitat to benefit development.</p><p>Trump has also sought to scale back or alter endangered species rules, including lifting blanket protections for animals newly listed as threatened and setting cost estimates for saving species.</p><p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, designated critical habitat earlier this year for slickspot peppergrass, a rare desert flower in southwestern Idaho, that protected about 65 square miles (170 square kilometers). But that's about 30 square miles (80 square kilometers) less than the agency proposed in 2014.</p><p>Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group, blasted the decision as reducing critical habitat to only places where the plant already grows rather than including enough uninhabited areas where the plant could expand to and recover.</p><p>A final decision on the definition for habitat is expected by year's end.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 KEYSTONE COMMODITIES CO.

His opponent, Rafal Trzaskowski, trailed with 48.79% of the vote.</p><p>Final results, expected later Monday, could vary slightly, but Duda's lead appeared unassailable.</p><p>The very close race reflected the deep cultural divisions in this European Union nation.</p><p>It followed a bitter campaign dominated by issues of culture in which the government, state media and the influential Roman Catholic Church all mobilized in support of Duda, a social conservative, and sought to stoke fears of Jews, LGBT people and Germans.</p><p>Duda also got an apparent endorsement from U.S.</p><p>July 06: Keystone Commodities Co.: Israel Launches New Spy Satellite</p><p>Israel's Defense Ministry announced the successful launch of a new spy satellite early on Monday that would help the country monitor Iran's nuclear activity as its foreign minister hinted that Israel may have been behind a fire that damaged an Iranian nuclear site last week.</p><p>JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Defense Ministry announced the successful launch of a new spy satellite early on Monday that would help the country monitor Iran's nuclear activity as its foreign minister hinted that Israel may have been behind a fire that damaged an Iranian nuclear site last week.</p><p>The \"Ofek 16\" satellite gives Israel what officials described as an additional tool in keeping tabs on many threats from across the region, joining a fleet of Israeli spy satellites that have been launched over the past two decades. While officials did not identify specific threats, arch-enemy Iran, which Israel accuses of trying to develop nuclear weapons, is first among them.</p><p>The launch came a day after Iran finally acknowledged that a mysterious fire last week damaged a new centrifuge assembly center in Iran's underground Natanz nuclear site, with suspicion immediately falling on Israel.</p><p>Iranian officials had initially sought to downplay Thursday's fire, calling it an \"incident\" that affected an \"industrial shed.\" But on Sunday they confirmed that centrifuges had been damaged and their development and production delayed. It comes amid a spate of other mysterious explosions at Iranian industrial complexes in recent months that have also been attributed to Israel.</p><p>Israel has previously proven its ability to penetrate sensitive Iranian facilities, including with the 2018 raid in Tehran when Israeli officials said Mossad agents broke into a warehouse and stole thousands of documents connected to Iran's nuclear program.</p><p>June 17: Keystone Commodities Co.: Trump Signs Order on Police Reform</p><p>Following weeks of national protests since the death of George Floyd, President Donald Trump has signed an executive order he said would encourage better police practices. But he made no mention of the roiling national debate over racism spawned by police killings of black people.</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following weeks of national protests since the death of George Floyd, President Donald Trump has signed an executive order he said would encourage better police practices. But he made no mention of the roiling national debate over racism spawned by police killings of black people.</p><p>Trump met privately with the families of several black Americans killed in interactions with police before his Rose Garden signing ceremony and said he grieved for the lives lost and families devastated. But he quickly shifted his tone and devoted most of his public remarks to a need to respect and support \"the brave men and women in blue who police our streets and keep us safe.\"</p><p>He characterized the officers who've used excessive force as a \"tiny\" number of outliers among \"trustworthy\" police ranks.</p><p>\"Reducing crime and raising standards are not opposite goals,\" he said before signing the order Tuesday, flanked by police officials.</p><p>Trump and Republicans in Congress have been rushing to respond to the mass demonstrations against police brutality and racial prejudice that have raged for weeks across the country in response to the deaths of Floyd and other black Americans. It's a sudden shift that underscores how quickly the protests have changed the political conversation and pressured Washington to act.</p><p>But Trump, who has faced criticism for failing to acknowledge systemic racial bias and has advocated for rougher police treatment of suspects, has continued to hold his \"law and order\" line. At the signing event, he railed against those who committed violence during the largely peaceful protests while hailing the vast majority of officers as selfless public servants.</p><p>Trump's executive order would establish a database that tracks police officers with excessive use-of-force complaints in their records.</p><p>June 13: Keystone Commodities Co.: Cuomo Signs Accountability Legislation</p><p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law on Friday a sweeping package of police accountability measures that received new backing following protests over George Floyd's killing, including one allowing the release of officers' long-withheld disciplinary records.</p><p>The measures were approved earlier this week by the state's Democratic-led Legislature. Some of the bills had been proposed in years past and failed to win approval, but lawmakers moved with new urgency in the wake of massive, nationwide demonstrations over Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis.</p><p>\"Police reform is long overdue, and Mr. Floyd's murder is only the most recent murder,\" Cuomo, a Democrat, said.</p><p>Cuomo was joined at the signing ceremony by the Rev. Al Sharpton, Valerie Bell, the mother of Sean Bell, who was killed by an officer in 2006, and Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who was killed by police in New York in 2014.</p><p>\"It was a long time coming, but it came,\" Carr said.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins thanks Carr and Bell \"for being brave and strong.\"</p><p>\"We are at a moment of reckoning. There is no doubt about it,\" she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, members of the New York City Council said they would work to cut $1 billion in New York Police Department spending for the next fiscal year. The cuts would include overtime, headcount through attrition and shifting the department's responsibilities, according to a joint council statement.</p><p>The proposed cut to the NYPD is about 15% of the $6 billion annual budget for department.</p><p>\"Our budget must reflect the reality that policing needs fundamental reform. Over the last few weeks, we have seen an outpouring of New Yorkers demanding change from their leaders,\" the statement said. \"It is our job to listen -- and to act. We will not let this moment pass, and we will fight for the budget they deserve.\"</p><p>The laws will ban police chokeholds, make it easier to sue people who call police on others without good reason, and set up a special prosecutor's office to investigate the deaths of people during and following encounters with police officers.</p><p>\"These bills mean some substantive change, so that we won't be sitting here going over this after the next funeral and after the next situation,\" Sharpton said.</p><p>Some bills, including body camera legislation, drew support from Republicans, who opposed legislation that repealed a state law long used to block the release of police disciplinary records over concerns about officers' privacy.</p><p>Eliminating the law, known as Section 50-a, would make complaints against officers, as well as transcripts and final dispositions of disciplinary proceedings, public for the first time in decades.</p><p>NYPD spokesperson Sgt.</p><p>SECTION 4 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 05: Keystone Commodities Co.: Inclusion Is Key for Virus Vaccine</p><p>The president of the U.N. General Assembly is warning that a vaccine for COVID-19 must be made available to everyone who needs it because if just one country is left out the world will still face a crisis from the coronavirus.</p><p>UNITED NATIONS (AP) --The president of the U.N. General Assembly is warning that a vaccine for COVID-19 must be made available to everyone who needs it because if just one country is left out the world will still face a crisis from the coronavirus.</p><p>As the world looks to a vaccine and a post-COVID-19 world, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also says that \"inclusion is key, because without inclusion the suffering of those who are already left behind, will continue -- and we cannot guarantee peace in that kind of a context.\"</p><p>He said in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press that statements from those developing vaccines have said they intend to make them widely available, which he stressed is important.</p><p>\"I believe that there will be protocols and agreements to guarantee affordability and accessibility to the product when it is available,\" he said.</p><p>Muhammad-Bande said the pandemic, perhaps ironically, has defied initial predictions that developing countries would be hardest hit because many of their health systems are poorer.</p><p>September 05: Keystone Commodities Co.: Powerful Typhoon Approaches Japan</p><p>A powerful typhoon, the second in a week, was barreling toward the Okinawa islands in southern Japan on Saturday, prompting warnings about torrential rainfall and fierce wind gusts.</p><p>Weather officials have cautioned about Typhoon Haishen for the last several days, urging people to brace for what could be a record storm and be ready to take shelter and stock up on food and water.</p><p>The Japan Meteorological Agency said Haishen, packing sustained winds of up to 180 kilometers (112 miles) per hour early Saturday, was on course to hit Okinawa by Sunday, and later the main southern island of Kyushu.</p><p>But the pouring rain, high tides and winds will hit before the typhoon, the agency said.</p><p>Haishen, or \"sea god\" in Chinese, was moving northward at 15 kph (9 mph) from out at sea, south of Minami Daito, an island to the south of Japan. The projected course has Haishen hitting the Korean Peninsula on Tuesday.</p><p>Meteorological agency official Yoshihisa Nakamoto said he was concerned about people staying home, instead of fleeing, because of fears about the coronavirus.</p><p>\"You should not avoid getting out because of such fears,\" he told reporters, stressing that local communities will have social distancing measures in place at evacuation locales.</p><p>Earlier in the week, Typhoon Maysak battered southern Japan, injuring dozens of people and cutting power to thousands of homes.</p><p>September 05: Keystone Commodities Co.: Racial Tensions are Target for Meddling</p><p>The tensions coursing through the United States over racism and policing are likely targets for adversaries seeking to influence the November election, lawmakers and experts warn -- and there are signs that Russia is again seeking to exploit the divide.</p><p>Earlier this year, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pulled down dozens of accounts with names like \"Blacks Facts Untold\" that had been followed or liked by hundreds of thousands of people. The accounts were fake, created by an organization in Africa with links to Russia's Internet Research Agency.</p><p>Similarly, this past week Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts linked to that \"troll factory\" that had pushed out stories about race and other issues. The network had tricked unwitting American writers to post content to the pages.</p><p>It's a troubling but familiar pattern from Russia, as the Internet Research Agency overwhelmingly focused on race and the Black Lives Matter Movement when targeting the U.S. in 2016. The goal, part of the Russian playbook for decades, was to sow chaos by posting content on both sides of the racial divide. Indeed, \"no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans,\" concluded a report from the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p>With the election just two months away, some lawmakers are worried that the Russian efforts, now evolved and more sophisticated than four years ago, could again take hold.</p><p>September 05: Keystone Commodities Co.: India Coronavirus Caseload Crosses</p><p>India's coronavirus caseload surpassed 4 million on Saturday, deepening misery in the country's vast hinterlands, where surges have crippled the underfunded health care system.</p><p>Initially, the virus ravaged India's sprawling and densely populated cities. It has since stretched to almost every state, spreading through villages and small towns.</p><p>With a population of nearly 1.4 billion, India's massive caseload isn't surprising experts. The country's delayed response to the virus forced the government to implement a strict lockdown in late March. For more than two months, the economy remained shuttered, buying time for health workers to prepare for the worst.</p><p>But with the cost of the restrictions also rising, authorities saw no choice but to reopen businesses and everyday activities.</p><p>Most of India's cases are in western Maharashtra state and the four southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. But new surges are popping up elsewhere.</p><p>The 86,432 cases added in the past 24 hours pushed India's total to 4,023,179. Brazil has confirmed 4,091,801 infections, while the U.S. has had 6,200,186 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>India's Health Ministry on Saturday also reported 1,089 deaths for a total of 69,561.</p><p>Even as testing in India has increased to over a million a day, a growing reliance on screening for antigens or viral proteins is creating more problems.</p><p>September 03: Keystone Commodities Co.: Global Markets Mostly Higher</p><p>Most major stock markets and U.S. futures rose Thursday after Wall Street surged to its biggest daily gain since July despite uncertainty about the global outlook.</p><p>London, Frankfurt and Tokyo advanced while Shanghai declined.</p><p>Investors have been encouraged by central bank infusions of credit into struggling economies and hopes for a vaccine to end the coronavirus pandemic that has plunged the world into its deepest slump since the 1930s. Forecasters warn the stock market recovery might be running too far ahead of economic activity as the United States and some other countries reimpose anti-virus controls that hamper business.</p><p>\"The irony of market exuberance is rich,\" said Mizuho Bank in a report. \"Record highs on Wall St. make a mockery of policymakers grasping for recourse to the worst downturn in decades.\"</p><p>In early trading, the FTSE 100 in London gained 0.7% to 5,981.93 and the DAX in Frankfurt added 1.4% to 13,428.33. The CAC 40 in France added 1.6% to 5,112.38.</p><p>On Wall Street, the future for the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was up less than 0.1% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%.</p><p>On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.5%. The index is up 10.8% this year following a five-month streak of gains.</p><p>September 03: Keystone Commodities Co.: Intra-Afghan Peace Talks</p><p>Officials on both sides of Afghanistan's protracted conflict say efforts are ramping up for a start to intra-Afghan negotiations, a critical next step to a U.S.-negotiated peace deal with the Taliban.</p><p>The talks, which will begin in Qatar where the Taliban maintain a political office, are intended to lay out a road map to a future Afghanistan, with the first item on the agenda expected to be a cease-fire agreement.</p><p>The peace deal, which calls for the intra-Afghan negotiations, was signed by the U.S. and the Taliban in February and was seen at the time as Afghanistan's best hope at peace after four decades of war.</p><p>The deal was brokered to provide for America's exit from Afghanistan after nearly 20 years of war and calls on the Taliban to fight against militant groups.</p><p>Although Washington has pushed the warring sides to the negotiating table, America's exit is not dependent on the success of talks, but on the Taliban fulfilling their commitment to not support terrorist groups and fight against them and ensure Afghanistan cannot be used as a staging arena for attacks against the U.S. and its allies.</p><p>Washington has already begun reducing its troop levels and by November will have less than 5,000 soldiers still in Afghanistan, down from around 13,000 when the deal was signed in February.</p><p>This week, the government and the Taliban have quietly moved to reduce the last hurdle to the start of talks -- the mutual release of remaining prisoners.</p><p>September 03: Keystone Commodities Co.: Facebook Targets Misinfo</p><p>With just two months left until the U.S. presidential election, Facebook says it is taking more steps to encourage voting, minimize misinformation and reduce the likelihood of post-election \"civil unrest.\"</p><p>The company said Thursday it will restrict new political ads in the week before the election and remove posts that convey misinformation about COVID-19 and voting. It will also attach links to official results to posts from candidates and campaigns that declare premature victories.</p><p>\"This election is not going to be business as usual.

The administration is willing to extend the $600 jobless benefit, at least in the short term, but is balking at other demands of Democratic negotiators like aid for state and local governments, food stamp increases, and assistance to renters and homeowners.</p><p>Unemployment insurance is a principal element as the COVID-19 relief bill is expected to grow considerably from a $1 trillion-plus GOP draft released this week.</p><p>The $600 per week jobless benefit officially lapsed on Friday and Democrats have made it clear that they will not extend it without securing other relief priorities.</p><p>August 01: Keystone Commodities Co.: Foreign Threats Loom Ahead of Election</p><p>As the Nov. 3 presidential vote nears, there are fresh signs that the nation's electoral system is again under attack from foreign adversaries.</p><p>Intelligence officials confirmed in recent days that foreign actors are actively seeking to compromise the private communications of \"U.S. political campaigns, candidates and other political targets\" while working to compromise the nation's election infrastructure. Foreign entities are also aggressively spreading disinformation intended to sow voter confusion heading into the fall.</p><p>There is no evidence that America's enemies have yet succeeded in penetrating campaigns or state election systems, but Democrat Joe Biden's presidential campaign confirmed this week that it has faced multiple related threats.</p><p>The former vice president's team was reluctant to reveal specifics for fear of giving adversaries useful intelligence.</p><p>Because of such secrecy, at least in part, foreign interference largely remains an afterthought in the 2020 contest, even as Republicans and Democrats alike concede it poses a serious threat that could fundamentally reshape the election at any moment. Biden's campaign is increasingly concerned that pro-Russian sources have already shared disinformation about Biden's family with President Donald Trump's campaign and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill designed to hurt the Democratic candidate in the days leading up to the election.</p><p>When asked directly, the Trump campaign refused to say whether it had accepted materials related to Biden from any foreign nationals.</p><p>August 01: Keystone Commodities Co.: Biden Eyes Major Foreign Policy Shifts</p><p>Should former Vice President Joe Biden win the White House in November, America will likely be in for a foreign policy about-face as Biden reverses, dismantles or severely curtails many of President Donald Trump's most significant and boldest actions.</p><p>From the Middle East to Asia, Latin America to Africa and, particularly, Europe, and on issues including trade, terrorism, arms control and immigration, the presumptive Democratic nominee and his advisers have vowed to unleash a tsunami of change in how the U.S. handles itself in the international arena.</p><p>With few exceptions, Americans could expect Biden to re-engage with traditional allies. Where the iconoclastic Trump has used blunt threats and insults to press his case, Biden, a former senator, would be more inclined to seek common ground.</p><p>Historically, U.S. foreign policy hasn't changed drastically as the presidency shifted between Democratic and Republican administrations. Allies and adversaries stayed the same and a non-partisan diplomatic corps pursued American interests.</p><p>That changed with Trump. Under his \"America First\" policy, he viewed both allies and the foreign policy establishment with suspicion, while speaking warmly of adversaries like North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin.</p><p>But Trump found it hard to make swift changes.</p><p>August 01: Keystone Commodities Co.: Thousands Protest Russia Gov's Arrest</p><p>Thousands of demonstrators rallied Saturday in the Russian Far East city of Khabarovsk to protest the arrest of their governor, keeping up a three-week wave of opposition that has challenged the Kremlin.</p><p>Smaller demonstrations took place in at least 10 other cities and 55 people were detained in those protests, according to the OVD-Info organization that monitors political arrests. No detentions were reported at the Khabarovsk rally.</p><p>Khabarovsk Krai Gov. Sergei Furgal has been in a Moscow jail since his July 9 arrest on charges of involvement in murders that occurred before his political career started. He has denied the charges.</p><p>Protesters in Khabarovsk see the charges against Furgal as unsubstantiated and are demanding that his trial take place in his home city, 6,100 kilometers (3,800 miles) east of the Russian capital.</p><p>His supporters have held daily protests, with the largest turnouts on weekends. The latest demonstration attracted about 10,000 people, according to some news reports. Police claimed the crowd was about 3,500.</p><p>Unlike in Moscow, where police usually move quickly to disperse unsanctioned opposition protests, authorities haven't interfered with the unauthorized demonstrations in Khabarovsk, apparently expecting them to fizzle out.</p><p>Authorities suspect Furgal of involvement in the slayings of several businessmen in 2004 and 2005, when he was a businessman with interests focusing on timber and metals.</p><p>A lawmaker on the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party ticket, Furgal won the 2018 regional gubernatorial election even though he had refrained from campaigning and publicly supported his Kremlin-backed rival.</p><p>His victory was a humiliating setback to the main Kremlin party, United Russia, which also lost its control over the regional legislature.</p><p>August 01: Keystone Commodities Co.: Biden Nears Decision on Running Mate</p><p>As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.</p><p>The campaign hasn't finalized a date for naming a running mate, but three people who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans said a public announcement likely wouldn't happen before the week of Aug. 10. That's one week before Democrats will hold their convention to officially nominate Biden as their presidential nominee.</p><p>Biden said in May that he hoped to name his pick around Aug. 1 and told reporters this week that he would \"have a choice in the first week of August.\" He notably stopped short of saying when he would announce that choice.</p><p>Running mates are often announced on the eve of a convention. As he prepares to make his choice, a committee established to vet possible running mates has provided Biden with briefing materials. Biden will likely soon begin one-on-one conversations with those under consideration, which could be the most consequential part of the process for a presidential candidate who values personal connections.</p><p>The leading contenders include California Sen. Kamala Harris, California Rep. Karen Bass and Obama national security adviser Susan Rice.</p><p>July 31: Keystone Commodities Co.: Hong Kong Postpones Election for a Year</p><p>Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced Friday that the government will postpone highly anticipated legislative elections by one year, citing a worsening coronavirus outbreak in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.</p><p>The Hong Kong government is invoking an emergency ordinance in delaying the elections. Lam said the government has the support of the Chinese government in making the decision.</p><p>\"The announcement I have to make today is the most difficult decision I've had to make in the past seven months,\" Lam said at a news conference.</p><p>\"We want to ensure fairness and public safety and health, and need to make sure the election is held in an open, fair and impartial manner. This decision is therefore essential,\" she said.</p><p>The postponement is a setback for the pro-democracy opposition, which was hoping to capitalize on disenchantment with the current pro-Beijing majority to make gains. A group of 22 lawmakers issued a statement ahead of the announcement accusing the government of using the outbreak as an excuse to delay the vote.</p><p>\"Incumbent pro-democracy legislators, who represent 60% of the public's opinion, collectively oppose the postponement and emphasize the responsibility of the SAR government to make every effort to arrange adequate anti-epidemic measures to hold elections in September as scheduled,\" the statement said, referring to the territory's official name, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p><p>\"Otherwise, it is tantamount to uprooting the foundation of the establishment of the SAR.\"</p><p>The city of 7.5 million people has had a surge in coronavirus infections since the beginning of July.</p><p>July 31: Keystone Commodities Co.: Big Tech Leads Stocks Higher</p><p>Big Tech continues to steamroll through the pandemic, and strong gains for some of the market's most influential companies on Friday helped Wall Street close out its fourth straight winning month.</p><p>NEW YORK (AP) -- Big Tech continues to steamroll through the pandemic, and strong gains for some of the market's most influential companies on Friday helped Wall Street close out its fourth straight winning month.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 24.90 points, or 0.8%, to 3,271.12 following blowout profit reports from Apple and several other tech titans. The gains didn't come easily, though, and the stock market flipped up and down through the day amid worries about the economy and whether Congress can find agreement on more aid for it.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down as many as 300 points before finishing the day up 114.67, or 0.4%, at 26,428.32. The Nasdaq composite jumped 157.64, or 1.5%, to 10,745.27 on the strength for tech stocks, which also accelerated in the last hour of trading.</p><p>Despite the gains, caution was clearly present across markets as the coronavirus pandemic continues to cloud the economy's prospects. The 10-year Treasury yield touched its lowest level since it dropped to a record low in March.</p><p>July 31: Keystone Commodities Co.: Eurozone Economy Suffers Record Drop</p><p>The economy of the 19-country eurozone shrank by a devastating 12.1% percent in the April-June period from the quarter before - the largest drop on record - as coronavirus lockdowns shut businesses and hampered consumer spending.</p><p>PARIS (AP) -- The economy of the 19-country eurozone shrank by a devastating 12.1% percent in the April-June period from the quarter before - the largest drop on record - as coronavirus lockdowns shut businesses and hampered consumer spending.</p><p>Economists say the worst of the downturn is past as many restrictions have eased, but that the recovery will be drawn out and vulnerable to renewed virus outbreaks.</p><p>Spain, which along with Italy was among the first to get hit hard by the spread of the virus, suffered the region's heaviest drop at 18.5%. France, Italy and Portugal also endured steep declines, but no country escaped the impact of the pandemic.</p><p>For the currency union as a whole it was the biggest decline since the records started in 1995. The broader 27-country European Union, not all of whose members use the euro, saw output sag 11.9%.</p><p>The decline in Europe compares with a 9.5% quarter-on-quarter drop in the United States, which unlike Europe has not yet been able to get its contagion numbers firmly down yet and whose economic recovery is in doubt.</p><p>European governments are countering the recession with massive stimulus measures.</p><p>July 31: Keystone Commodities Co.: German Min: US Withdrawal Regrettable</p><p>Germany's defense minister on Friday described the planned withdrawal of some 12,000 U.S. troops from her country as \"regrettable,\" while suggesting it underlines the need for Europe to do more for its own security.</p><p>American defense leaders said Wednesday that the U.S. will bring about 6,400 troops home and shift about 5,600 to other countries in Europe. The decision fulfills President Donald Trump's announced desire to withdraw troops from Germany, largely because of what he considers its failure to spend enough on defense.</p><p>The plan, whose future is uncertain as it requires support and funding from Congress, would leave about 24,000 U.S. troops in Germany.</p><p>German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer emphasized the need for more European integration in her response early Friday, and said she hopes to use Germany's current tenure of the European Union's rotating presidency to help make progress on security and defense policy.</p><p>\"We are keeping German and European interests in view,\" she said in a statement. \"The truth is that a good life in Germany and Europe depends more and more on how we ensure our security ourselves.\"</p><p>She added that, \"as far as the regrettable plans to withdraw U.S.</p><p>July 27: Keystone Commodities Co.: Virus Vaccine Put to Final Test</p><p>The world's biggest COVID-19 vaccine study got underway Monday with the first of 30,000 planned volunteers helping to test shots created by the U.S. government -- one of several candidates in the final stretch of the global vaccine race.</p><p>There's still no guarantee that the experimental vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., will really protect.</p><p>The needed proof: Volunteers won't know if they're getting the real shot or a dummy version. After two doses, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus still is spreading unchecked.</p><p>\"Unfortunately for the United States of America, we have plenty of infections right now\" to get that answer, NIH's Dr. Anthony Fauci recently told The Associated Press.</p><p>Several other vaccines made by China and by Britain's Oxford University earlier this month began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries.</p><p>But the U.S. requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country and has set a high bar: Every month through fall, the government-funded COVID-19 Prevention Network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate -- each one with 30,000 newly recruited volunteers.</p><p>The massive studies aren't just to test if the shots work --- they're needed to check each potential vaccine's safety.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-0609201247103789000185014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SB-8SH1-JB4F-Y2FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

So it's ironic the animated version that debuted more than two decades ago still shows more vim, vigor and character growth than the live-action, big-budget take streaming on Disney Plus now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To be clear, I'm not a standard-bearer for the 1998 animated classic. But that version of Mulan took the time to get into the main character's head, bringing us along on her journey as she worked to become a worthy soldier while struggling to balance her dual identities. The new Mulan, played by Yifei Liu, hits many of the same beats, but without the emotional resonance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That, unfortunately, seems to be par for the course with blockbusters these days.

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker had us rushing from one planet to another, but did we really learn much about Finn? (Clearly, John Boyega, who played the Stormtrooper-turned-hero, doesn't think so.) Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were too busy juggling dozens of characters to actually develop any of them.</p><p>Who cares though, right? Those were bombastic, fun movies that offered plenty of fan service and the best special effects money can buy.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 MEDIA CONVERGENCE GROUP INC.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday. It's Beijing's answer to the US government-owned GPS and will help the country reduce its reliance on American technology.</p><p>The satellite launch took place shortly before 10 a.m. local time from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the country's southwestern Sichuan province. The launch, which was broadcast live, was deemed a success after about 20 minutes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: Media Convergence Group Inc: EU targets Apple Pay, App Store with antitrust investigations</p><p>Within the course of a single day, Apple has found itself the subject of two new EU antitrust probes. Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases. The investigation will focus on the restrictions Apple places on developers to inform consumers of payment options that may be cheaper outside of the app.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: Tech firms face growing resentment of parent employees during COVID-19</p><p>Silicon Valley had to change the way its employees work when the coronavirus pandemic forced schools to close, businesses to abandon their offices and millions of people to quarantine in their homes across the US starting in March. Among the changes, companies offered flexible schedules and increased time off to help caregivers and employees in their ranks take care of their families.</p><p>But though the companies said they'd support parents at home with their children, not all managers and co-workers agreed. Over time, an undercurrent of resentment has bubbled up across the tech industry against those splitting time between work and family, and it's spilled out in public on employee message boards, company chat software and on social networks. At Facebook, the pushback has forced COO Sheryl Sandberg, a parent herself, to defend the company's policies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: How eICUs are helping hospitals deal with coronavirus overload</p><p>Blink and you'd think nurse Clark Wurth is an air traffic controller.

Some have gone virtual, some have been canceled, but IFA, Europe's annual tech show in Berlin, found a middle ground.</p><p>This week the tech industry has gathered, either in Berlin or via the show's online portal, to see new products launched and hear executives from some of the world's biggest tech companies speak about what comes next.

The film's messages of female empowerment, bravery and devotion to family are particularly moving as we navigate a changing, uncertain world.</p><p>As in the beloved 1998 animated film, Mulan (Yifei Liu) struggles to strike a balance between embracing her abilities and honoring her family in China. As a woman centuries ago, she's told it's her duty to bring honor through marriage. But from a young age, Mulan's father sees she's blessed with a special energy, or \"chi.\" As she gets older, it's not only Mulan who must face the struggle of hiding her abilities; her father also experiences the heartrending pain of having to overlook his daughter's skills just because she's a girl. See Disney Plus subscription options</p><p>\"Chi is for warriors, not daughters,\" her father tells her as a child. \"Soon, you'll be a young woman, and it is time for you to hide your gift away.\"</p><p>This oft-repeated narrative leads Mulan to feel like she belongs in neither a man's world nor a woman's world. She's told by her family to \"learn your place,\" but that proves to be quite challenging when that place seemingly doesn't exist.</p><p>September 03: Media Convergence Group Inc: Blackouts that cut cell service aren't just annoying, they're dangerous</p><p>It's wildfire season again in California as the second and third largest blazes in the state's history continue to burn. More than a thousand structures across 10 counties have been destroyed and (so far) five people have died as hazardous smoke blanketed the more populous parts of the Bay Area for weeks. But so far at least, Northern California utility PG&amp;E hasn't had to institute Public Safety Power Shutoff programs. I hope that lasts.</p><p>The programs, which are about as dystopian as they sound, were a fact of life across the state during fire season last year. To prevent its power lines from sparking wildfires during windy conditions -- PG&amp;E equipment caused the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in the state's history -- the public company purposefully plunged entire cities into darkness, sometimes for as long as a week. (The state's other giant utility, Southern California Edison, conducted similar shutoff programs.) For more like this Subscribe to the Mobile newsletter and see related stories on CNET.

The sort of noise that comes from steel-on-steel impact. An unfamiliar sound in an office used to the peaceful clatter of mechanical keyboards. Still, no one batted an eyelid.</p><p>Then came the second bang. A third. A fourth.</p><p>People began to take notice. One ear at a time, the headphones peeled off. Hordes of men and women, peering over office dividers like confused meerkats. What was that noise? Where was it coming from?</p><p>Slowly, it became clear. A full-grown game designer, enraged. He'd picked up the nearest blunt instrument, an umbrella, and began rhythmically battering it on a filing cabinet.</p><p>For Charles Henden, who witnessed the incident, this wasn't out of the ordinary. This was game development.</p><p>\"You know, we've all been there,\" says Henden. \"We've all beaten up a filing cabinet with an umbrella at some point in our careers.\"</p><p>Henden, like everyone else watching, was a game developer, working at the now defunct THQ Studio Australia in Brisbane. In high-pressure environments like this, with incredibly tight deadlines and huge financial stakes, meltdowns were almost common.</p><p>\"I could probably, from each of the projects that I worked on, give you a story that would just blow your mind,\" says Rex Dickson, who also worked at the studio around that time.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Uber may now require passengers to take a mask selfie before rides</p><p>Uber has been requiring all passengers to wear a mask during rides since early May, but now they may need to prove it. The ride-hailing company announced Tuesday that it's rolling out in-app technology that will have riders sometimes take a selfie with their face coverings on.</p><p>The goal of the new feature is to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has now infected more than 25 million people and killed nearly 850,000 worldwide. Uber first introduced the mask selfie technology in May when it began requiring drivers and delivery people to take a photo with their mask on before starting work each day.</p><p>Uber's new technology has riders take a selfie with their face mask. Uber</p><p>\"We firmly believe that accountability is a two-way street,\" Sachin Kansal, Uber's global head of safety product, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \"That's why we're expanding the same technology to riders, too.\"</p><p>Passengers won't have to take a selfie before each ride, however. The way it works is if a driver reports a rider for not wearing a mask, that rider will be required to take a selfie with their face covered before their next ride with Uber. If they're not wearing a mask then, they won't be able to take the ride.</p><p>Uber drivers say they've experienced a difficult time during the pandemic.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Microsoft's new tech spots deepfakes to fight disinformation ahead of 2020 US election</p><p>Microsoft on Tuesday showed off two new computer programs to combat deepfakes.

They are her lifeline to stay connected to friends, family and health care providers during the coronavirus pandemic. But for Softky, connection is extra essential. In March, she was evacuated from a homeless shelter to a motel, an experience shared with several thousand other people in California facing homelessness when the pandemic began.</p><p>Now in her own room in a small motel on the coast of Northern California, Softky is continuing to get back on her feet after losing her home and livelihood while she fought cancer last year. Her tech devices are a big help. tbwdesktp</p><p>In an extreme version of the lockdown faced by others in the state, about 14,000 formerly unhoused Californians have been living in motel and hotel rooms for months, mostly alone. They're riding out the coronavirus pandemic in a program the state hopes will keep huge numbers of vulnerable people from getting COVID-19. It's only a small fraction of the estimated 150,000 people experiencing homelessness in the state. Still, states around the country are looking to California as a model for how to protect people who may have been living in tents, cars or crowded homeless shelters while dealing with severe illnesses, addiction, and advanced age, all of which put them at high risk of complications from the novel coronavirus.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Why Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G's $2,000 price tag isn't actually that bad</p><p>What a world we live in when the announcement of a $2,000 price tag for a phone seems. not that bad. Samsung on Tuesday provided more details about its new Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G, which it first showed off at a virtual Unpacked event on Aug. 5. The biggest tidbit shared during \"Unpacked Part 2\" was the device's price: $2,000 in the US -- $20 more than last year's model -- which converts to about Pound1,490 or AU$2,700.</p><p>While $2,000 is prohibitively expensive for many people, especially in the middle of a pandemic, the pricing could have been worse. Samsung packed features into the Z Fold 2 that address most complaints with the older model, and it refined the foldable into even more of a sleek, luxury device. It even expanded its Galaxy Z Premier Service -- which provides dedicated tech support to foldable buyers -- to include perks like a free membership to FoundersCard and delivery of a meal from a Michelin starred restaurant. And Samsung added improvements like 5G to the US model.

Now with the new Motorola One 5G though, the Chicago-based company finally figured out a way to combine its budget know-how with 5G connectivity -- without the use of an additional accessory or Motorola Mod a la Moto Z4 and Z3.</p><p>In the US, the majority of 5G phones are expensive. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra costs $1,300, the OnePlus 8 Pro starts at $900 and Motorola's own Edge Plus is $1,000. Even the more affordable midtier 5G phones like the LG Velvet, Galaxy A71, Motorola Edge and OnePlus 8 cost about $700. So it's really impressive that the Motorola One 5G will likely cost less than $500. At this time Motorola hasn't locked in an actual price, but the company said that its new phone should come in well under that figure.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>PermID: 4298053386</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-0709201717303789000184918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SK-3531-JB4F-Y2P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday. It's Beijing's answer to the US government-owned GPS and will help the country reduce its reliance on American technology.</p><p>The satellite launch took place shortly before 10 a.m. local time from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the country's southwestern Sichuan province. The launch, which was broadcast live, was deemed a success after about 20 minutes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: Media Convergence Group Inc: EU targets Apple Pay, App Store with antitrust investigations</p><p>Within the course of a single day, Apple has found itself the subject of two new EU antitrust probes. Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases. The investigation will focus on the restrictions Apple places on developers to inform consumers of payment options that may be cheaper outside of the app.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: Tech firms face growing resentment of parent employees during COVID-19</p><p>Silicon Valley had to change the way its employees work when the coronavirus pandemic forced schools to close, businesses to abandon their offices and millions of people to quarantine in their homes across the US starting in March. Among the changes, companies offered flexible schedules and increased time off to help caregivers and employees in their ranks take care of their families.</p><p>But though the companies said they'd support parents at home with their children, not all managers and co-workers agreed. Over time, an undercurrent of resentment has bubbled up across the tech industry against those splitting time between work and family, and it's spilled out in public on employee message boards, company chat software and on social networks. At Facebook, the pushback has forced COO Sheryl Sandberg, a parent herself, to defend the company's policies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: Trump sics Twitter followers on Lauren Powell Jobs over Atlantic story</p><p>President Donald Trump took to Twitter Sunday morning to criticize Laurene Powell Jobs, head of the influential Emerson Collective, tying her to a story in The Atlantic that described his indifference to fallen soldiers and his disdain for soldiers taken as prisoners of war or wounded in battle.</p><p>In Trump's tweet, sent at 6:48 a.m. ET, he highlighted a tweet that said Powell Jobs donated to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's campaign and had a majority stake in The Atlantic magazine, though it's actually the Emerson Collective that owns the stake.

Some have gone virtual, some have been canceled, but IFA, Europe's annual tech show in Berlin, found a middle ground.</p><p>This week the tech industry has gathered, either in Berlin or via the show's online portal, to see new products launched and hear executives from some of the world's biggest tech companies speak about what comes next.

Kicking off the show on Thursday morning, IFA Executive Director Jens Heithecker addressed the events of 2020 head-on.</p><p>\"So much has happened since IFA 2019, it feels more than one year ago,\" he said.</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: Disney's Mulan copies Star Wars and Marvel, in the worst possible way</p><p>With its new take on Mulan, Disney got a chance to breathe life into the legendary female warrior -- a fixture of centuries-old Chinese storytelling -- with a gritty retelling and a picture perfect cast. So it's ironic the animated version that debuted more than two decades ago still shows more vim, vigor and character growth than the live-action, big-budget take streaming on Disney Plus now.</p><p>To be clear, I'm not a standard-bearer for the 1998 animated classic. But that version of Mulan took the time to get into the main character's head, bringing us along on her journey as she worked to become a worthy soldier while struggling to balance her dual identities. The new Mulan, played by Yifei Liu, hits many of the same beats, but without the emotional resonance.</p><p>That, unfortunately, seems to be par for the course with blockbusters these days.

The first 5G phones released last year cost over $1,000 -- the Galaxy S10 5G retailed for $1,300 -- but pricing has been falling quickly. For more like this Subscribe to the Mobile newsletter.

The film's messages of female empowerment, bravery and devotion to family are particularly moving as we navigate a changing, uncertain world.</p><p>As in the beloved 1998 animated film, Mulan (Yifei Liu) struggles to strike a balance between embracing her abilities and honoring her family in China. As a woman centuries ago, she's told it's her duty to bring honor through marriage. But from a young age, Mulan's father sees she's blessed with a special energy, or \"chi.\" As she gets older, it's not only Mulan who must face the struggle of hiding her abilities; her father also experiences the heartrending pain of having to overlook his daughter's skills just because she's a girl. See Disney Plus subscription options</p><p>\"Chi is for warriors, not daughters,\" her father tells her as a child. \"Soon, you'll be a young woman, and it is time for you to hide your gift away.\"</p><p>This oft-repeated narrative leads Mulan to feel like she belongs in neither a man's world nor a woman's world. She's told by her family to \"learn your place,\" but that proves to be quite challenging when that place seemingly doesn't exist.</p><p>September 03: Media Convergence Group Inc: Blackouts that cut cell service aren't just annoying, they're dangerous</p><p>It's wildfire season again in California as the second and third largest blazes in the state's history continue to burn. More than a thousand structures across 10 counties have been destroyed and (so far) five people have died as hazardous smoke blanketed the more populous parts of the Bay Area for weeks. But so far at least, Northern California utility PG&amp;E hasn't had to institute Public Safety Power Shutoff programs. I hope that lasts.</p><p>The programs, which are about as dystopian as they sound, were a fact of life across the state during fire season last year. To prevent its power lines from sparking wildfires during windy conditions -- PG&amp;E equipment caused the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in the state's history -- the public company purposefully plunged entire cities into darkness, sometimes for as long as a week. (The state's other giant utility, Southern California Edison, conducted similar shutoff programs.) For more like this Subscribe to the Mobile newsletter and see related stories on CNET.

The sort of noise that comes from steel-on-steel impact. An unfamiliar sound in an office used to the peaceful clatter of mechanical keyboards. Still, no one batted an eyelid.</p><p>Then came the second bang. A third. A fourth.</p><p>People began to take notice. One ear at a time, the headphones peeled off. Hordes of men and women, peering over office dividers like confused meerkats. What was that noise? Where was it coming from?</p><p>Slowly, it became clear. A full-grown game designer, enraged. He'd picked up the nearest blunt instrument, an umbrella, and began rhythmically battering it on a filing cabinet.</p><p>For Charles Henden, who witnessed the incident, this wasn't out of the ordinary. This was game development.</p><p>\"You know, we've all been there,\" says Henden. \"We've all beaten up a filing cabinet with an umbrella at some point in our careers.\"</p><p>Henden, like everyone else watching, was a game developer, working at the now defunct THQ Studio Australia in Brisbane. In high-pressure environments like this, with incredibly tight deadlines and huge financial stakes, meltdowns were almost common.</p><p>\"I could probably, from each of the projects that I worked on, give you a story that would just blow your mind,\" says Rex Dickson, who also worked at the studio around that time.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Uber may now require passengers to take a mask selfie before rides</p><p>Uber has been requiring all passengers to wear a mask during rides since early May, but now they may need to prove it. The ride-hailing company announced Tuesday that it's rolling out in-app technology that will have riders sometimes take a selfie with their face coverings on.</p><p>The goal of the new feature is to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has now infected more than 25 million people and killed nearly 850,000 worldwide. Uber first introduced the mask selfie technology in May when it began requiring drivers and delivery people to take a photo with their mask on before starting work each day.</p><p>Uber's new technology has riders take a selfie with their face mask. Uber</p><p>\"We firmly believe that accountability is a two-way street,\" Sachin Kansal, Uber's global head of safety product, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \"That's why we're expanding the same technology to riders, too.\"</p><p>Passengers won't have to take a selfie before each ride, however. The way it works is if a driver reports a rider for not wearing a mask, that rider will be required to take a selfie with their face covered before their next ride with Uber. If they're not wearing a mask then, they won't be able to take the ride.</p><p>Uber drivers say they've experienced a difficult time during the pandemic.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Microsoft's new tech spots deepfakes to fight disinformation ahead of 2020 US election</p><p>Microsoft on Tuesday showed off two new computer programs to combat deepfakes.

They are her lifeline to stay connected to friends, family and health care providers during the coronavirus pandemic. But for Softky, connection is extra essential. In March, she was evacuated from a homeless shelter to a motel, an experience shared with several thousand other people in California facing homelessness when the pandemic began.</p><p>Now in her own room in a small motel on the coast of Northern California, Softky is continuing to get back on her feet after losing her home and livelihood while she fought cancer last year. Her tech devices are a big help. tbwdesktp</p><p>In an extreme version of the lockdown faced by others in the state, about 14,000 formerly unhoused Californians have been living in motel and hotel rooms for months, mostly alone. They're riding out the coronavirus pandemic in a program the state hopes will keep huge numbers of vulnerable people from getting COVID-19. It's only a small fraction of the estimated 150,000 people experiencing homelessness in the state. Still, states around the country are looking to California as a model for how to protect people who may have been living in tents, cars or crowded homeless shelters while dealing with severe illnesses, addiction, and advanced age, all of which put them at high risk of complications from the novel coronavirus.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Why Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G's $2,000 price tag isn't actually that bad</p><p>What a world we live in when the announcement of a $2,000 price tag for a phone seems. not that bad. Samsung on Tuesday provided more details about its new Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G, which it first showed off at a virtual Unpacked event on Aug. 5. The biggest tidbit shared during \"Unpacked Part 2\" was the device's price: $2,000 in the US -- $20 more than last year's model -- which converts to about Pound1,490 or AU$2,700.</p><p>While $2,000 is prohibitively expensive for many people, especially in the middle of a pandemic, the pricing could have been worse. Samsung packed features into the Z Fold 2 that address most complaints with the older model, and it refined the foldable into even more of a sleek, luxury device. It even expanded its Galaxy Z Premier Service -- which provides dedicated tech support to foldable buyers -- to include perks like a free membership to FoundersCard and delivery of a meal from a Michelin starred restaurant. And Samsung added improvements like 5G to the US model.

Now with the new Motorola One 5G though, the Chicago-based company finally figured out a way to combine its budget know-how with 5G connectivity -- without the use of an additional accessory or Motorola Mod a la Moto Z4 and Z3.</p><p>In the US, the majority of 5G phones are expensive. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra costs $1,300, the OnePlus 8 Pro starts at $900 and Motorola's own Edge Plus is $1,000. Even the more affordable midtier 5G phones like the LG Velvet, Galaxy A71, Motorola Edge and OnePlus 8 cost about $700. So it's really impressive that the Motorola One 5G will likely cost less than $500. At this time Motorola hasn't locked in an actual price, but the company said that its new phone should come in well under that figure.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>PermID: 4298053386</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-0709201716513789000184918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SK-3531-JB4F-Y2NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4519\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

Among the changes, companies offered flexible schedules and increased time off to help caregivers and employees in their ranks take care of their families.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But though the companies said they'd support parents at home with their children, not all managers and co-workers agreed. Over time, an undercurrent of resentment has bubbled up across the tech industry against those splitting time between work and family, and it's spilled out in public on employee message boards, company chat software and on social networks. At Facebook, the pushback has forced COO Sheryl Sandberg, a parent herself, to defend the company's policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 MEDIA CONVERGENCE GROUP INC.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday. It's Beijing's answer to the US government-owned GPS and will help the country reduce its reliance on American technology.</p><p>The satellite launch took place shortly before 10 a.m. local time from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the country's southwestern Sichuan province. The launch, which was broadcast live, was deemed a success after about 20 minutes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: Media Convergence Group Inc: EU targets Apple Pay, App Store with antitrust investigations</p><p>Within the course of a single day, Apple has found itself the subject of two new EU antitrust probes. Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases. The investigation will focus on the restrictions Apple places on developers to inform consumers of payment options that may be cheaper outside of the app.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: How eICUs are helping hospitals deal with coronavirus overload</p><p>Blink and you'd think nurse Clark Wurth is an air traffic controller. He dons a headset as he sits in front of six huge monitors flashing with alerts and colorful moving charts.</p><p>Blink again -- as Wurth zooms in on a COVID-19 patient on a respirator -- and you're transported to a hospital ICU bed. You can make out the smallest details, like the texture of the patient's blanket and the pads placed on her pressure points for when she's turned into the prone position to help increase the amount of oxygen getting to her lungs.

The telemonitoring installation includes interactive video and remote diagnostic tools that can access any critical changes in a patient's condition -- and alert Wurth instantly.</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: Trump sics Twitter followers on Lauren Powell Jobs over Atlantic story</p><p>President Donald Trump took to Twitter Sunday morning to criticize Laurene Powell Jobs, head of the influential Emerson Collective, tying her to a story in The Atlantic that described his indifference to fallen soldiers and his disdain for soldiers taken as prisoners of war or wounded in battle.</p><p>In Trump's tweet, sent at 6:48 a.m. ET, he highlighted a tweet that said Powell Jobs donated to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's campaign and had a majority stake in The Atlantic magazine, though it's actually the Emerson Collective that owns the stake.

Some have gone virtual, some have been canceled, but IFA, Europe's annual tech show in Berlin, found a middle ground.</p><p>This week the tech industry has gathered, either in Berlin or via the show's online portal, to see new products launched and hear executives from some of the world's biggest tech companies speak about what comes next.

Kicking off the show on Thursday morning, IFA Executive Director Jens Heithecker addressed the events of 2020 head-on.</p><p>\"So much has happened since IFA 2019, it feels more than one year ago,\" he said.</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: Disney's Mulan copies Star Wars and Marvel, in the worst possible way</p><p>With its new take on Mulan, Disney got a chance to breathe life into the legendary female warrior -- a fixture of centuries-old Chinese storytelling -- with a gritty retelling and a picture perfect cast. So it's ironic the animated version that debuted more than two decades ago still shows more vim, vigor and character growth than the live-action, big-budget take streaming on Disney Plus now.</p><p>To be clear, I'm not a standard-bearer for the 1998 animated classic. But that version of Mulan took the time to get into the main character's head, bringing us along on her journey as she worked to become a worthy soldier while struggling to balance her dual identities. The new Mulan, played by Yifei Liu, hits many of the same beats, but without the emotional resonance.</p><p>That, unfortunately, seems to be par for the course with blockbusters these days.

The first 5G phones released last year cost over $1,000 -- the Galaxy S10 5G retailed for $1,300 -- but pricing has been falling quickly. For more like this Subscribe to the Mobile newsletter.

The film's messages of female empowerment, bravery and devotion to family are particularly moving as we navigate a changing, uncertain world.</p><p>As in the beloved 1998 animated film, Mulan (Yifei Liu) struggles to strike a balance between embracing her abilities and honoring her family in China. As a woman centuries ago, she's told it's her duty to bring honor through marriage. But from a young age, Mulan's father sees she's blessed with a special energy, or \"chi.\" As she gets older, it's not only Mulan who must face the struggle of hiding her abilities; her father also experiences the heartrending pain of having to overlook his daughter's skills just because she's a girl. See Disney Plus subscription options</p><p>\"Chi is for warriors, not daughters,\" her father tells her as a child. \"Soon, you'll be a young woman, and it is time for you to hide your gift away.\"</p><p>This oft-repeated narrative leads Mulan to feel like she belongs in neither a man's world nor a woman's world. She's told by her family to \"learn your place,\" but that proves to be quite challenging when that place seemingly doesn't exist.</p><p>September 03: Media Convergence Group Inc: Blackouts that cut cell service aren't just annoying, they're dangerous</p><p>It's wildfire season again in California as the second and third largest blazes in the state's history continue to burn. More than a thousand structures across 10 counties have been destroyed and (so far) five people have died as hazardous smoke blanketed the more populous parts of the Bay Area for weeks. But so far at least, Northern California utility PG&amp;E hasn't had to institute Public Safety Power Shutoff programs. I hope that lasts.</p><p>The programs, which are about as dystopian as they sound, were a fact of life across the state during fire season last year. To prevent its power lines from sparking wildfires during windy conditions -- PG&amp;E equipment caused the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in the state's history -- the public company purposefully plunged entire cities into darkness, sometimes for as long as a week. (The state's other giant utility, Southern California Edison, conducted similar shutoff programs.) For more like this Subscribe to the Mobile newsletter and see related stories on CNET.

Still, no one batted an eyelid.</p><p>Then came the second bang. A third. A fourth.</p><p>People began to take notice. One ear at a time, the headphones peeled off. Hordes of men and women, peering over office dividers like confused meerkats. What was that noise? Where was it coming from?</p><p>Slowly, it became clear. A full-grown game designer, enraged. He'd picked up the nearest blunt instrument, an umbrella, and began rhythmically battering it on a filing cabinet.</p><p>For Charles Henden, who witnessed the incident, this wasn't out of the ordinary. This was game development.</p><p>\"You know, we've all been there,\" says Henden. \"We've all beaten up a filing cabinet with an umbrella at some point in our careers.\"</p><p>Henden, like everyone else watching, was a game developer, working at the now defunct THQ Studio Australia in Brisbane. In high-pressure environments like this, with incredibly tight deadlines and huge financial stakes, meltdowns were almost common.</p><p>\"I could probably, from each of the projects that I worked on, give you a story that would just blow your mind,\" says Rex Dickson, who also worked at the studio around that time.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Uber may now require passengers to take a mask selfie before rides</p><p>Uber has been requiring all passengers to wear a mask during rides since early May, but now they may need to prove it. The ride-hailing company announced Tuesday that it's rolling out in-app technology that will have riders sometimes take a selfie with their face coverings on.</p><p>The goal of the new feature is to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has now infected more than 25 million people and killed nearly 850,000 worldwide. Uber first introduced the mask selfie technology in May when it began requiring drivers and delivery people to take a photo with their mask on before starting work each day.</p><p>Uber's new technology has riders take a selfie with their face mask. Uber</p><p>\"We firmly believe that accountability is a two-way street,\" Sachin Kansal, Uber's global head of safety product, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \"That's why we're expanding the same technology to riders, too.\"</p><p>Passengers won't have to take a selfie before each ride, however. The way it works is if a driver reports a rider for not wearing a mask, that rider will be required to take a selfie with their face covered before their next ride with Uber. If they're not wearing a mask then, they won't be able to take the ride.</p><p>Uber drivers say they've experienced a difficult time during the pandemic.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Microsoft's new tech spots deepfakes to fight disinformation ahead of 2020 US election</p><p>Microsoft on Tuesday showed off two new computer programs to combat deepfakes.

They are her lifeline to stay connected to friends, family and health care providers during the coronavirus pandemic. But for Softky, connection is extra essential. In March, she was evacuated from a homeless shelter to a motel, an experience shared with several thousand other people in California facing homelessness when the pandemic began.</p><p>Now in her own room in a small motel on the coast of Northern California, Softky is continuing to get back on her feet after losing her home and livelihood while she fought cancer last year. Her tech devices are a big help. tbwdesktp</p><p>In an extreme version of the lockdown faced by others in the state, about 14,000 formerly unhoused Californians have been living in motel and hotel rooms for months, mostly alone. They're riding out the coronavirus pandemic in a program the state hopes will keep huge numbers of vulnerable people from getting COVID-19. It's only a small fraction of the estimated 150,000 people experiencing homelessness in the state. Still, states around the country are looking to California as a model for how to protect people who may have been living in tents, cars or crowded homeless shelters while dealing with severe illnesses, addiction, and advanced age, all of which put them at high risk of complications from the novel coronavirus.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Why Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G's $2,000 price tag isn't actually that bad</p><p>What a world we live in when the announcement of a $2,000 price tag for a phone seems. not that bad. Samsung on Tuesday provided more details about its new Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G, which it first showed off at a virtual Unpacked event on Aug. 5. The biggest tidbit shared during \"Unpacked Part 2\" was the device's price: $2,000 in the US -- $20 more than last year's model -- which converts to about Pound1,490 or AU$2,700.</p><p>While $2,000 is prohibitively expensive for many people, especially in the middle of a pandemic, the pricing could have been worse. Samsung packed features into the Z Fold 2 that address most complaints with the older model, and it refined the foldable into even more of a sleek, luxury device. It even expanded its Galaxy Z Premier Service -- which provides dedicated tech support to foldable buyers -- to include perks like a free membership to FoundersCard and delivery of a meal from a Michelin starred restaurant. And Samsung added improvements like 5G to the US model.

Now with the new Motorola One 5G though, the Chicago-based company finally figured out a way to combine its budget know-how with 5G connectivity -- without the use of an additional accessory or Motorola Mod a la Moto Z4 and Z3.</p><p>In the US, the majority of 5G phones are expensive. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra costs $1,300, the OnePlus 8 Pro starts at $900 and Motorola's own Edge Plus is $1,000. Even the more affordable midtier 5G phones like the LG Velvet, Galaxy A71, Motorola Edge and OnePlus 8 cost about $700. So it's really impressive that the Motorola One 5G will likely cost less than $500. At this time Motorola hasn't locked in an actual price, but the company said that its new phone should come in well under that figure.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>PermID: 4298053386</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-0709201716253789000184918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SK-3531-JB4F-Y2NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4462\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday. It's Beijing's answer to the US government-owned GPS and will help the country reduce its reliance on American technology.</p><p>The satellite launch took place shortly before 10 a.m. local time from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the country's southwestern Sichuan province. The launch, which was broadcast live, was deemed a success after about 20 minutes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: Media Convergence Group Inc: EU targets Apple Pay, App Store with antitrust investigations</p><p>Within the course of a single day, Apple has found itself the subject of two new EU antitrust probes. Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases. The investigation will focus on the restrictions Apple places on developers to inform consumers of payment options that may be cheaper outside of the app.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: Tech firms face growing resentment of parent employees during COVID-19</p><p>Silicon Valley had to change the way its employees work when the coronavirus pandemic forced schools to close, businesses to abandon their offices and millions of people to quarantine in their homes across the US starting in March. Among the changes, companies offered flexible schedules and increased time off to help caregivers and employees in their ranks take care of their families.</p><p>But though the companies said they'd support parents at home with their children, not all managers and co-workers agreed. Over time, an undercurrent of resentment has bubbled up across the tech industry against those splitting time between work and family, and it's spilled out in public on employee message boards, company chat software and on social networks. At Facebook, the pushback has forced COO Sheryl Sandberg, a parent herself, to defend the company's policies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: How eICUs are helping hospitals deal with coronavirus overload</p><p>Blink and you'd think nurse Clark Wurth is an air traffic controller. He dons a headset as he sits in front of six huge monitors flashing with alerts and colorful moving charts.</p><p>Blink again -- as Wurth zooms in on a COVID-19 patient on a respirator -- and you're transported to a hospital ICU bed. You can make out the smallest details, like the texture of the patient's blanket and the pads placed on her pressure points for when she's turned into the prone position to help increase the amount of oxygen getting to her lungs.

The telemonitoring installation includes interactive video and remote diagnostic tools that can access any critical changes in a patient's condition -- and alert Wurth instantly.</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: What tech execs were (and weren't) saying about COVID-19 at IFA 2020</p><p>With the coronavirus pandemic dramatically shaking up our 2020 calendars, big tech events that typically cluster thousands of attendees together in exhibition halls and meeting rooms have had to adapt. Some have gone virtual, some have been canceled, but IFA, Europe's annual tech show in Berlin, found a middle ground.</p><p>This week the tech industry has gathered, either in Berlin or via the show's online portal, to see new products launched and hear executives from some of the world's biggest tech companies speak about what comes next.

Kicking off the show on Thursday morning, IFA Executive Director Jens Heithecker addressed the events of 2020 head-on.</p><p>\"So much has happened since IFA 2019, it feels more than one year ago,\" he said.</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: Disney's Mulan copies Star Wars and Marvel, in the worst possible way</p><p>With its new take on Mulan, Disney got a chance to breathe life into the legendary female warrior -- a fixture of centuries-old Chinese storytelling -- with a gritty retelling and a picture perfect cast. So it's ironic the animated version that debuted more than two decades ago still shows more vim, vigor and character growth than the live-action, big-budget take streaming on Disney Plus now.</p><p>To be clear, I'm not a standard-bearer for the 1998 animated classic. But that version of Mulan took the time to get into the main character's head, bringing us along on her journey as she worked to become a worthy soldier while struggling to balance her dual identities. The new Mulan, played by Yifei Liu, hits many of the same beats, but without the emotional resonance.</p><p>That, unfortunately, seems to be par for the course with blockbusters these days.

The first 5G phones released last year cost over $1,000 -- the Galaxy S10 5G retailed for $1,300 -- but pricing has been falling quickly. For more like this Subscribe to the Mobile newsletter.

The film's messages of female empowerment, bravery and devotion to family are particularly moving as we navigate a changing, uncertain world.</p><p>As in the beloved 1998 animated film, Mulan (Yifei Liu) struggles to strike a balance between embracing her abilities and honoring her family in China. As a woman centuries ago, she's told it's her duty to bring honor through marriage. But from a young age, Mulan's father sees she's blessed with a special energy, or \"chi.\" As she gets older, it's not only Mulan who must face the struggle of hiding her abilities; her father also experiences the heartrending pain of having to overlook his daughter's skills just because she's a girl. See Disney Plus subscription options</p><p>\"Chi is for warriors, not daughters,\" her father tells her as a child. \"Soon, you'll be a young woman, and it is time for you to hide your gift away.\"</p><p>This oft-repeated narrative leads Mulan to feel like she belongs in neither a man's world nor a woman's world. She's told by her family to \"learn your place,\" but that proves to be quite challenging when that place seemingly doesn't exist.</p><p>September 03: Media Convergence Group Inc: Blackouts that cut cell service aren't just annoying, they're dangerous</p><p>It's wildfire season again in California as the second and third largest blazes in the state's history continue to burn. More than a thousand structures across 10 counties have been destroyed and (so far) five people have died as hazardous smoke blanketed the more populous parts of the Bay Area for weeks. But so far at least, Northern California utility PG&amp;E hasn't had to institute Public Safety Power Shutoff programs. I hope that lasts.</p><p>The programs, which are about as dystopian as they sound, were a fact of life across the state during fire season last year. To prevent its power lines from sparking wildfires during windy conditions -- PG&amp;E equipment caused the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in the state's history -- the public company purposefully plunged entire cities into darkness, sometimes for as long as a week. (The state's other giant utility, Southern California Edison, conducted similar shutoff programs.) For more like this Subscribe to the Mobile newsletter and see related stories on CNET.

The sort of noise that comes from steel-on-steel impact. An unfamiliar sound in an office used to the peaceful clatter of mechanical keyboards. Still, no one batted an eyelid.</p><p>Then came the second bang. A third. A fourth.</p><p>People began to take notice. One ear at a time, the headphones peeled off. Hordes of men and women, peering over office dividers like confused meerkats. What was that noise? Where was it coming from?</p><p>Slowly, it became clear. A full-grown game designer, enraged. He'd picked up the nearest blunt instrument, an umbrella, and began rhythmically battering it on a filing cabinet.</p><p>For Charles Henden, who witnessed the incident, this wasn't out of the ordinary. This was game development.</p><p>\"You know, we've all been there,\" says Henden. \"We've all beaten up a filing cabinet with an umbrella at some point in our careers.\"</p><p>Henden, like everyone else watching, was a game developer, working at the now defunct THQ Studio Australia in Brisbane. In high-pressure environments like this, with incredibly tight deadlines and huge financial stakes, meltdowns were almost common.</p><p>\"I could probably, from each of the projects that I worked on, give you a story that would just blow your mind,\" says Rex Dickson, who also worked at the studio around that time.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Uber may now require passengers to take a mask selfie before rides</p><p>Uber has been requiring all passengers to wear a mask during rides since early May, but now they may need to prove it. The ride-hailing company announced Tuesday that it's rolling out in-app technology that will have riders sometimes take a selfie with their face coverings on.</p><p>The goal of the new feature is to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has now infected more than 25 million people and killed nearly 850,000 worldwide. Uber first introduced the mask selfie technology in May when it began requiring drivers and delivery people to take a photo with their mask on before starting work each day.</p><p>Uber's new technology has riders take a selfie with their face mask. Uber</p><p>\"We firmly believe that accountability is a two-way street,\" Sachin Kansal, Uber's global head of safety product, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \"That's why we're expanding the same technology to riders, too.\"</p><p>Passengers won't have to take a selfie before each ride, however. The way it works is if a driver reports a rider for not wearing a mask, that rider will be required to take a selfie with their face covered before their next ride with Uber. If they're not wearing a mask then, they won't be able to take the ride.</p><p>Uber drivers say they've experienced a difficult time during the pandemic.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Microsoft's new tech spots deepfakes to fight disinformation ahead of 2020 US election</p><p>Microsoft on Tuesday showed off two new computer programs to combat deepfakes.

They are her lifeline to stay connected to friends, family and health care providers during the coronavirus pandemic. But for Softky, connection is extra essential. In March, she was evacuated from a homeless shelter to a motel, an experience shared with several thousand other people in California facing homelessness when the pandemic began.</p><p>Now in her own room in a small motel on the coast of Northern California, Softky is continuing to get back on her feet after losing her home and livelihood while she fought cancer last year. Her tech devices are a big help. tbwdesktp</p><p>In an extreme version of the lockdown faced by others in the state, about 14,000 formerly unhoused Californians have been living in motel and hotel rooms for months, mostly alone. They're riding out the coronavirus pandemic in a program the state hopes will keep huge numbers of vulnerable people from getting COVID-19. It's only a small fraction of the estimated 150,000 people experiencing homelessness in the state. Still, states around the country are looking to California as a model for how to protect people who may have been living in tents, cars or crowded homeless shelters while dealing with severe illnesses, addiction, and advanced age, all of which put them at high risk of complications from the novel coronavirus.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Why Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G's $2,000 price tag isn't actually that bad</p><p>What a world we live in when the announcement of a $2,000 price tag for a phone seems. not that bad. Samsung on Tuesday provided more details about its new Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G, which it first showed off at a virtual Unpacked event on Aug. 5. The biggest tidbit shared during \"Unpacked Part 2\" was the device's price: $2,000 in the US -- $20 more than last year's model -- which converts to about Pound1,490 or AU$2,700.</p><p>While $2,000 is prohibitively expensive for many people, especially in the middle of a pandemic, the pricing could have been worse. Samsung packed features into the Z Fold 2 that address most complaints with the older model, and it refined the foldable into even more of a sleek, luxury device. It even expanded its Galaxy Z Premier Service -- which provides dedicated tech support to foldable buyers -- to include perks like a free membership to FoundersCard and delivery of a meal from a Michelin starred restaurant. And Samsung added improvements like 5G to the US model.

Now with the new Motorola One 5G though, the Chicago-based company finally figured out a way to combine its budget know-how with 5G connectivity -- without the use of an additional accessory or Motorola Mod a la Moto Z4 and Z3.</p><p>In the US, the majority of 5G phones are expensive. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra costs $1,300, the OnePlus 8 Pro starts at $900 and Motorola's own Edge Plus is $1,000. Even the more affordable midtier 5G phones like the LG Velvet, Galaxy A71, Motorola Edge and OnePlus 8 cost about $700. So it's really impressive that the Motorola One 5G will likely cost less than $500. At this time Motorola hasn't locked in an actual price, but the company said that its new phone should come in well under that figure.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>PermID: 4298053386</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-0709201718223789000184918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SK-3531-JB4F-Y2P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4466\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

Some have gone virtual, some have been canceled, but IFA, Europe's annual tech show in Berlin, found a middle ground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week the tech industry has gathered, either in Berlin or via the show's online portal, to see new products launched and hear executives from some of the world's biggest tech companies speak about what comes next.

Kicking off the show on Thursday morning, IFA Executive Director Jens Heithecker addressed the events of 2020 head-on.</p><p>\"So much has happened since IFA 2019, it feels more than one year ago,\" he said. \"Our world has been uprooted in so many ways, whether it is the pandemic, political tensions, trade wars, natural disasters, the continued battle for equality, Black Lives Matter. I think you will agree, this year has been a tough one.\" The elephant in the room</p><p>While Heithecker was sober and forthright in his assessment of the impact of COVID-19, other speakers seemed less keen to give too much time over to discussing the issue. The words \"coronavirus\" and \"COVID\" were notably absent from the press conferences and keynote events that took place across the show. Instead, execs referred only to the \"pandemic\" and \"the new normal.\"</p><p>Huawei VP Victor Zhang didn't discuss the pandemic at all in his own keynote speech, instead diving straight into the company's continued commitment to operating in and out of Europe. Other execs made cursory references to the pandemic at the start of their keynote talks before swiftly moving on.</p><p>\"Although 2020 has been a very challenging year, Honor insists on bringing unrivaled products at unbeatable value to consumers,\" said Honor CEO George Zhao. Like many executives from outside Europe, Zhang and Zhao were unable to travel to attend the show, meaning instead that their presentations were virtual.</p><p>\"We want to give our blessings to the people who are fighting the pandemic,\" said TCL Sales and Marketing Director Frederic Langin at the start of the company's press conference. \"Despite those difficult times, our communities and industries have never been more connected, which is why the theme of today is switched-on possibilities.\"</p><p>Langin's reference was a direct segue into discussing TCL's product lineup, but several speakers used their opportunities to explore the ways in which COVID-19 had shown the world the importance of reliable connectivity.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 MEDIA CONVERGENCE GROUP INC.

But one aspect of a typical tech event doesn't translate to a computer or phones screen: the demo room. Samsung thinks it's found a possible solution.</p><p>The company on Wednesday hosted a virtual Life Unstoppable event that coincided with the IFA electronics show in Berlin. It wasn't a typical press conference like the company's two Unpacked events held over the past month. Instead, Samsung used Epic's Unreal Engine for games to build a virtual, 3D tour experience -- a sort of choose-your-own adventure digital demo -- for the media and its partners.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: Media Convergence Group Inc: Apple wins appeal against $14.9B EU tax bill</p><p>Apple was a handed a victory on Wednesday as it won the appeal against the tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14.9 billion) handed down by the European Commission in 2016. The decision came from the EU's second highest court, which heard the case last September.</p><p>Apple's mammoth tax bill was the result of a two-year antitrust investigation by Europe's Competition Commission, which was investigating whether the company had paid enough tax in Ireland where it has its European headquarters. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the company had paid such little tax in the country, which draws many US tech companies due to its favorable tax laws, that it amounted to \"illegal state aid.\"</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 23: Media Convergence Group Inc: China launches final Beidou satellite to complete its own version of GPS</p><p>China successfully launched the final satellite of its Beidou navigation system into space on Tuesday. It's Beijing's answer to the US government-owned GPS and will help the country reduce its reliance on American technology.</p><p>The satellite launch took place shortly before 10 a.m. local time from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the country's southwestern Sichuan province. The launch, which was broadcast live, was deemed a success after about 20 minutes.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: Media Convergence Group Inc: EU targets Apple Pay, App Store with antitrust investigations</p><p>Within the course of a single day, Apple has found itself the subject of two new EU antitrust probes. Europe's Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it is opening dual investigations into Apple Pay and the App Store.</p><p>The App Store investigation was triggered by a complaint from Spotify over a year ago tied to the high fees Apple charges companies when consumers make in-app purchases. The investigation will focus on the restrictions Apple places on developers to inform consumers of payment options that may be cheaper outside of the app.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: Tech firms face growing resentment of parent employees during COVID-19</p><p>Silicon Valley had to change the way its employees work when the coronavirus pandemic forced schools to close, businesses to abandon their offices and millions of people to quarantine in their homes across the US starting in March. Among the changes, companies offered flexible schedules and increased time off to help caregivers and employees in their ranks take care of their families.</p><p>But though the companies said they'd support parents at home with their children, not all managers and co-workers agreed. Over time, an undercurrent of resentment has bubbled up across the tech industry against those splitting time between work and family, and it's spilled out in public on employee message boards, company chat software and on social networks. At Facebook, the pushback has forced COO Sheryl Sandberg, a parent herself, to defend the company's policies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: How eICUs are helping hospitals deal with coronavirus overload</p><p>Blink and you'd think nurse Clark Wurth is an air traffic controller. He dons a headset as he sits in front of six huge monitors flashing with alerts and colorful moving charts.</p><p>Blink again -- as Wurth zooms in on a COVID-19 patient on a respirator -- and you're transported to a hospital ICU bed. You can make out the smallest details, like the texture of the patient's blanket and the pads placed on her pressure points for when she's turned into the prone position to help increase the amount of oxygen getting to her lungs.

The telemonitoring installation includes interactive video and remote diagnostic tools that can access any critical changes in a patient's condition -- and alert Wurth instantly.</p><p>September 06: Media Convergence Group Inc: Trump sics Twitter followers on Lauren Powell Jobs over Atlantic story</p><p>President Donald Trump took to Twitter Sunday morning to criticize Laurene Powell Jobs, head of the influential Emerson Collective, tying her to a story in The Atlantic that described his indifference to fallen soldiers and his disdain for soldiers taken as prisoners of war or wounded in battle.</p><p>In Trump's tweet, sent at 6:48 a.m. ET, he highlighted a tweet that said Powell Jobs donated to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's campaign and had a majority stake in The Atlantic magazine, though it's actually the Emerson Collective that owns the stake.

So it's ironic the animated version that debuted more than two decades ago still shows more vim, vigor and character growth than the live-action, big-budget take streaming on Disney Plus now.</p><p>To be clear, I'm not a standard-bearer for the 1998 animated classic. But that version of Mulan took the time to get into the main character's head, bringing us along on her journey as she worked to become a worthy soldier while struggling to balance her dual identities. The new Mulan, played by Yifei Liu, hits many of the same beats, but without the emotional resonance.</p><p>That, unfortunately, seems to be par for the course with blockbusters these days.

The first 5G phones released last year cost over $1,000 -- the Galaxy S10 5G retailed for $1,300 -- but pricing has been falling quickly. For more like this Subscribe to the Mobile newsletter.

The film's messages of female empowerment, bravery and devotion to family are particularly moving as we navigate a changing, uncertain world.</p><p>As in the beloved 1998 animated film, Mulan (Yifei Liu) struggles to strike a balance between embracing her abilities and honoring her family in China. As a woman centuries ago, she's told it's her duty to bring honor through marriage. But from a young age, Mulan's father sees she's blessed with a special energy, or \"chi.\" As she gets older, it's not only Mulan who must face the struggle of hiding her abilities; her father also experiences the heartrending pain of having to overlook his daughter's skills just because she's a girl. See Disney Plus subscription options</p><p>\"Chi is for warriors, not daughters,\" her father tells her as a child. \"Soon, you'll be a young woman, and it is time for you to hide your gift away.\"</p><p>This oft-repeated narrative leads Mulan to feel like she belongs in neither a man's world nor a woman's world. She's told by her family to \"learn your place,\" but that proves to be quite challenging when that place seemingly doesn't exist.</p><p>September 03: Media Convergence Group Inc: Blackouts that cut cell service aren't just annoying, they're dangerous</p><p>It's wildfire season again in California as the second and third largest blazes in the state's history continue to burn. More than a thousand structures across 10 counties have been destroyed and (so far) five people have died as hazardous smoke blanketed the more populous parts of the Bay Area for weeks. But so far at least, Northern California utility PG&amp;E hasn't had to institute Public Safety Power Shutoff programs. I hope that lasts.</p><p>The programs, which are about as dystopian as they sound, were a fact of life across the state during fire season last year. To prevent its power lines from sparking wildfires during windy conditions -- PG&amp;E equipment caused the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in the state's history -- the public company purposefully plunged entire cities into darkness, sometimes for as long as a week. (The state's other giant utility, Southern California Edison, conducted similar shutoff programs.) For more like this Subscribe to the Mobile newsletter and see related stories on CNET.

Our goal is to prevent people from sharing advice about voting twice, which may be illegal,\" Twitter said in a tweet.

Still, no one batted an eyelid.</p><p>Then came the second bang. A third. A fourth.</p><p>People began to take notice. One ear at a time, the headphones peeled off. Hordes of men and women, peering over office dividers like confused meerkats. What was that noise? Where was it coming from?</p><p>Slowly, it became clear. A full-grown game designer, enraged. He'd picked up the nearest blunt instrument, an umbrella, and began rhythmically battering it on a filing cabinet.</p><p>For Charles Henden, who witnessed the incident, this wasn't out of the ordinary. This was game development.</p><p>\"You know, we've all been there,\" says Henden. \"We've all beaten up a filing cabinet with an umbrella at some point in our careers.\"</p><p>Henden, like everyone else watching, was a game developer, working at the now defunct THQ Studio Australia in Brisbane. In high-pressure environments like this, with incredibly tight deadlines and huge financial stakes, meltdowns were almost common.</p><p>\"I could probably, from each of the projects that I worked on, give you a story that would just blow your mind,\" says Rex Dickson, who also worked at the studio around that time.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Uber may now require passengers to take a mask selfie before rides</p><p>Uber has been requiring all passengers to wear a mask during rides since early May, but now they may need to prove it. The ride-hailing company announced Tuesday that it's rolling out in-app technology that will have riders sometimes take a selfie with their face coverings on.</p><p>The goal of the new feature is to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has now infected more than 25 million people and killed nearly 850,000 worldwide. Uber first introduced the mask selfie technology in May when it began requiring drivers and delivery people to take a photo with their mask on before starting work each day.</p><p>Uber's new technology has riders take a selfie with their face mask. Uber</p><p>\"We firmly believe that accountability is a two-way street,\" Sachin Kansal, Uber's global head of safety product, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \"That's why we're expanding the same technology to riders, too.\"</p><p>Passengers won't have to take a selfie before each ride, however. The way it works is if a driver reports a rider for not wearing a mask, that rider will be required to take a selfie with their face covered before their next ride with Uber. If they're not wearing a mask then, they won't be able to take the ride.</p><p>Uber drivers say they've experienced a difficult time during the pandemic.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Microsoft's new tech spots deepfakes to fight disinformation ahead of 2020 US election</p><p>Microsoft on Tuesday showed off two new computer programs to combat deepfakes.

They are her lifeline to stay connected to friends, family and health care providers during the coronavirus pandemic. But for Softky, connection is extra essential. In March, she was evacuated from a homeless shelter to a motel, an experience shared with several thousand other people in California facing homelessness when the pandemic began.</p><p>Now in her own room in a small motel on the coast of Northern California, Softky is continuing to get back on her feet after losing her home and livelihood while she fought cancer last year.

They're riding out the coronavirus pandemic in a program the state hopes will keep huge numbers of vulnerable people from getting COVID-19. It's only a small fraction of the estimated 150,000 people experiencing homelessness in the state. Still, states around the country are looking to California as a model for how to protect people who may have been living in tents, cars or crowded homeless shelters while dealing with severe illnesses, addiction, and advanced age, all of which put them at high risk of complications from the novel coronavirus.</p><p>September 01: Media Convergence Group Inc: Why Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G's $2,000 price tag isn't actually that bad</p><p>What a world we live in when the announcement of a $2,000 price tag for a phone seems. not that bad. Samsung on Tuesday provided more details about its new Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G, which it first showed off at a virtual Unpacked event on Aug. 5. The biggest tidbit shared during \"Unpacked Part 2\" was the device's price: $2,000 in the US -- $20 more than last year's model -- which converts to about Pound1,490 or AU$2,700.</p><p>While $2,000 is prohibitively expensive for many people, especially in the middle of a pandemic, the pricing could have been worse. Samsung packed features into the Z Fold 2 that address most complaints with the older model, and it refined the foldable into even more of a sleek, luxury device. It even expanded its Galaxy Z Premier Service -- which provides dedicated tech support to foldable buyers -- to include perks like a free membership to FoundersCard and delivery of a meal from a Michelin starred restaurant. And Samsung added improvements like 5G to the US model.

Now with the new Motorola One 5G though, the Chicago-based company finally figured out a way to combine its budget know-how with 5G connectivity -- without the use of an additional accessory or Motorola Mod a la Moto Z4 and Z3.</p><p>In the US, the majority of 5G phones are expensive. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra costs $1,300, the OnePlus 8 Pro starts at $900 and Motorola's own Edge Plus is $1,000. Even the more affordable midtier 5G phones like the LG Velvet, Galaxy A71, Motorola Edge and OnePlus 8 cost about $700. So it's really impressive that the Motorola One 5G will likely cost less than $500. At this time Motorola hasn't locked in an actual price, but the company said that its new phone should come in well under that figure.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>PermID: 4298053386</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-0709201718483789000184918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SK-3531-JB4F-Y2P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

While this sector has struggled during the Covid-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, we believe that this will be a short term dampening to this trend, as the underlying fundamentals remain in place.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.
