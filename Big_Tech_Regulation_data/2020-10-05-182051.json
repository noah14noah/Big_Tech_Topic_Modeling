These companies are not licensed as banks but are handling banking data.</p><p>\"We are seeing the boundary of regulation - which has been focused on particular entities which we are familiar with - being increasingly challenged, as aspects of financial services are being outsourced,\" Mr Alder, chairman of the board of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), told the event on Thursday.</p><p>Traditionally, regulators have tried to keep control by telling licensed players it is their responsibility to guarantee nothing goes wrong with outsourcing, but this approach was limited due to the tech firm's growing influence, he said.</p><p>\"So you have to start thinking very hard about the question of expanding the regulatory remit to those firms providing services to the incumbents,\" said Mr Alder, also chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong.</p><p>The rise of fintech in China, which is being led by Ant Financial and Tencent, also raised questions for global banking regulators, he said. \"It gives rise to a set of questions around the data available to those firms.\"</p><p>The extent to which regulators are grappling with the emergence of the new players in financial services was highlighted by Elisabeth Roegele, deputy president of Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).</p><p>\"We have new players on stage - Google and Amazon - who are completely different,\" she said. \"They have no licence, but they are now in the product chain and we have to find solutions [to] limit risks and protect data privacy. That is a challenge for us as regulators.\"</p><p>Maureen Jensen, chief executive officer of the Ontario Securities Commission in Canada, said the traditional approach of regulating products or firms must be reconsidered as traditional sectors merge.</p><p>\"We have been set up to regulate insurance, or regulate banking, or securities - but the issue we see is everyone starting as new players they don't see boundaries, they are doing everything. And the incumbents are also doing everything. So it becomes very difficult to regulate, and it makes no sense to continue to regulate in the silos we are doing today.\"</p><p>On the sidelines of the event, ASIC chairman James Shipton said the growing influence of big tech players was an issue all regulators, including ASIC, were grappling with and it was not yet clear what the answer was.</p><p>Government policies including open banking, which is being introduced in Australia and Britain, could increase the access global technology firms have to banking data, accelerating their influence.</p><p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority in the past week has granted new \"virtual\" banking licences to Chinese companies including Ant Financial, Tencent and PingAn unit OneConnect.</p><p>Mr Alder said this \"raises a heap of questions around the interaction between richer sources of data available to big tech companies, the provision of financial services and data ownership and the fairness that goes around that\".</p><p>\"And that will not be confined to big tech companies - it will be relevant to incumbents. They will all have to deal with this because the regulatory context will change rapidly. All of this will combine into a single conversation, particularly in financial services, in the coming months and years, and it is hard to know how it is going to turn out.\"</p><p>Mr Alder also told the event that Europe's data privacy regulation, known as GDPR2, was creating challenges for regulators in Asia, who rely on information sharing for enforcement actions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc75dg6gdtbt51n9txxl2m</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W48-50P1-JD34-V35B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Facebook shares closed 2.7% lower, reflecting fears the potential regulatory move could be a first step toward forcing the company to sell apps WhatsApp and Instagram, its fast-growing acquisitions. </p><p>Facebook has plans to allow users of its units Messenger, WhatsApp and the direct messaging system within Instagram to communicate with each other, and end-to-end encryption will be extended across the three services. A source familiar with the matter said the FTC has not asked Facebook to halt the integration, a step that would normally precede a legal challenge. The Wall Street Journal said the FTC could file for an injunction to halt the integration as early as January. Apart from antitrust concerns, Facebook and other tech giants are facing criticism over privacy lapses, how they handle vast quantities of consumer data, and accusations of bias in the polarized U.S. political environment. Facebook and the FTC declined to comment. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced plans in March to integrate Facebook's messaging services as part of a proposed shift toward more private forms of social networking. Zuckerberg's integration strategy reflects the importance of Instagram and WhatsApp as Facebook's flagship app struggles to attract new young users in the company's most lucrative markets. Instagram ads drive much of Facebook's revenue growth, while the company is slowly moving toward making money from WhatsApp, which has surged to a user base of 1.5 billion people since its $22 billion acquisition in 2014. The properties are already integrated to some degree, with users able to link their accounts and advertisers able to use one system to place ads across different platforms. Encrypting messaging systems will restrict Facebook's ability to see the content of users' messages, but the company has not divulged whether the integration plan may deepen other types of data sharing between the units. Facebook, Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc all face antitrust investigations[2] by the Justice Department and House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. The FTC was also known to be investigating Facebook while groups of state attorneys general are looking at Facebook and Google. U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Tuesday he hoped to have Justice Department investigations of the big tech platforms completed next year. Barr said the Justice Department review was not limited to antitrust, but that looking for anti-competitive behavior was 'front and center.'

Our Regulatory Action Center proudly updates you with our favorite tidbits from the swamp. We want to smash barriers between bureaucracy and the American people by delivering regulatory news straight to FreedomWorks activists. Check back in two weeks for the next edition.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1) Video of the Week:</emphasis> Leftist would have you believe that President Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda has caused any number of horrible calamities to befall the United States. Yet, as a direct result of cutting the red tape, business in America is booming like never before. In this week\u2019s video, John Stossel sits down with Grover Norquist from Americans for Tax Reform to discuss how deregulation has helped the environment, the economy, and all American citizens.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2) Trump's Record as a Regulator:</emphasis> \u201cRepublicans often talk deregulation but then add rules. People called President George W. Bush an \"anti-regulator.\" But once he was president, he hired 90,000 new regulators! Trump has been different. When he took office, he hired regulation skeptics. He told government agencies: Get rid of two regulations for every new one you add.\u201d<url normalizedValue=\"https://reason.com/2019/08/21/trumps-record-as-a-regulator/\">https://reason.com/2019/08/21/trumps-record-as-a-regulator/</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3) DHS cyber agency to prioritize election security, Chinese threats:</emphasis> \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) plans to prioritize election security, cybersecurity at federal agencies, and the \u201cpersistent threat\u201d posed by China, among its many goals.The agency laid out its key priorities in a new \u201cstrategic intent\u201d document released on Thursday, which CISA Director Christopher Krebs described in the introduction as the \u201ckeystone\u201d for the agency.\u201d      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/458487-dhs-cyber-agency-to-prioritize-election-security-chinese-threats\">https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/458487-dhs-cyber-agency-to-prioritize-election-security-chinese-threats</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4) New FDA cigarette labels include realistic images of smoking-related health problems:</emphasis> \u201cThe Food and Drug Administration on Thursday proposed long-delayed graphic health warnings for cigarette packages, taking a step toward fulfilling a requirement of a decade-old smoking prevention law. The new warning label proposal will now be subject to a public comment period, and is under a court-ordered deadline to be finalized by March 15, 2020.\u201d      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/fda-readies-graphic-cigarette-package-labels\">https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/fda-readies-graphic-cigarette-package-labels</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5)  Trump admin aims to finally END catch-and-release in game-changing regulation:</emphasis> \u201cThe entire mass migration to our border and all its cascading ill effects can be traced to one thing: the Flores settlement\u2019s expansion from children to family units by a single district judge. Flores is not a constitutional provision, a statute, or even a court ruling. It is a court settlement, designed as a temporary arrangement, that actually runs contrary to statute and has been used as a catalyst to undermine every bedrock law of sovereignty. After a full year of dithering, the Trump administration is finally using its unquestionable power to modify the settlement to finally end catch-and-release.\u201d       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/trump-admin-aims-finally-end-catch-release-game-changing-regulation/\">https://www.conservativereview.com/news/trump-admin-aims-finally-end-catch-release-game-changing-regulation/</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6) Americans divided on regulation for big tech firms: Gallup:</emphasis> \u201cAmericans are divided over government regulation of big tech firms, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday, as concerns grow over users\u2019 privacy and whether tech giants have formed monopolies. Forty-eight percent of survey respondents said the government should boost its regulation of technology companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google, while 40 percent said regulation of these firms shouldn't change. Ten percent said the companies should face less oversight.\u201d      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/458299-americans-divided-on-regulation-for-big-tech-firms-gallup\">https://thehill.com/policy/technology/458299-americans-divided-on-regulation-for-big-tech-firms-gallup</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7) On deregulation, Walker's Wisconsin showed the way:</emphasis> \u201cThe Institute for Reforming Government recently issued its second policy paper, highlighting many of the regulatory reforms that Walker and legislators implemented, including the Wisconsin version of the federal REINS Act.

RAC proudly keeps you up to date on what we\u2019re up to and what we\u2019re keeping our eyes on here in the swamp. We offer resources for you to get involved in the rulemaking process to hold unelected bureaucrats accountable and occasionally offer praise in the event they have a good impulse. We will also highlight the incredible work our activists have done to advance the principles of smaller government, lower taxes, free markets, personal liberty, and the rule of law.

These comments accounted for over 55 percent of the total number of comments submitted to that docket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://fw-d7-freedomworks-org.s3.amazonaws.com/4-RACReview-20200730.png\">https://fw-d7-freedomworks-org.s3.amazonaws.com/4-RACReview-20200730.png</url>\" alt=\"RAC_Graphic_IPI\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RACtivist Content of the Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment submitted by RACtivist Martha G from Texas to the FCC regarding their proposed rule on rural broadband:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural America needs access to fast Broadband Internet Access, especially elderly [sic] like myself and my husband. </p><p>We need to be able to get food &amp;supplies; shipped to us when we can't get out to go to stores to buy what we need. The wifi we have now only allows us up to 10 mbps, even though they charge a lot for it and though others in urban areas get much faster speeds at cheaper rates. Thank You. We would appreciate any help you can give us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Things to Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Trump Unveils Four Drug Pricing Executive Orders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, President Trump issued four executive orders aimed at lowering the prices of prescription drugs in the United States. The first would make grants to federally qualified health centers (FQHC) contingent upon lower prices for insulin. The second would institute rebate reform for pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) and require savings be passed along to consumers. The third would allow the personal and wholesale importation of prescription drugs from other nations, namely Canada. The last would create an international price index (IPI), tying drug prices in the U.S. to those in foreign nations, many of them socialist. The President said this last one would not be signed until August 24th, contingent upon reaching a deal with manufacturers in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More resources on these orders:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreedomWorks blog post explainer: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreedomWorks Fact Check: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Op-ed by FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coalition Letter opposing the fourth EO: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House transcript: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Sen. Jim Inhofe Threatens FCC Commissioner O\u2019Rielly\u2019s Nomination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) has placed a hold on the re-nomination of Commissioner Michael O\u2019Rielly to the FCC. O\u2019Rielly has been a stalwart conservative on the Commission since 2013. Sen. Inhofe\u2019s opposition is rooted in faulty assumptions regarding a recent spectrum allocation order. He falsely believes it will harm the military\u2019s ability to track aircraft. In fact, the FCC has created a variety of hoops to jump through to ensure this is never the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More resources on this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreedomWorks blog on the spectrum situation: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreedomWorks blog on Inhofe\u2019s falsehoods: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joel Thayer Fact Check: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC Order in question: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Big Tech Takes Capitol Hill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google testified before a House subcommittee this week. The purpose of the hearing was to determine whether or not these companies possess \u201ctoo much\u201d market power. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle lobbed logically fallacious arguments at the businessmen, arguing that the regulatory state should bring antitrust action against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More info on this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative Letter opposing antitrust misuse: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreedomWorks blog defending CDA Section 230: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatism is Lost Without the Free Market: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) EPA Proposes Emissions Standards for Aircrafts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA recently proposed the first ever greenhouse gas emissions standards for aircrafts last week. People on both sides of this argument note that aircraft in the U.S. already meet the standards set forth and these regulations are either ineffective or needlessly duplicative. The EPA tried to justify the regulations by saying they better harmonize the U.S. with the rest of the world, saving time and money for international flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More info on this proposal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPA Release: &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAC Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can always find all RAC content (blogs, updates, press releases, and comment campaigns) &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can always sign up to become an elite RACtivist, if you haven\u2019t already, &lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;Files:\u00a0&lt;img class=\"file-icon\" alt=\"Image icon\" title=\"image/png\" src=\"/modules/file/icons/image-x-generic.png\" /&gt;

Our Regulatory Action Center proudly updates you with our favorite tidbits from the swamp. We want to smash barriers between bureaucracy and the American people by delivering regulatory news straight to FreedomWorks activists. Check back in two weeks for the next edition.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1) Video of the Week:</emphasis> A giant of conservative economic circles, President Trump presented Arthur Laffer with the Presidential Medal of Freedom earlier this week. Sometimes referred to as the \"Father of Supply-Side Economics,\" Laffer's work has spanned decades and helped drive U.S. economic policy since the Reagan era. In this video, Laffer explains the theory that bears his name, the Laffer Curve.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2) Mike Lee's New Bill Would Enforce 'No Regulation Without Representation':</emphasis> \"'If the Founders' rallying cry was 'No taxation without representation,' ours must be, or must at least involve, 'No regulation without representation,'' Lee said at [The Heritage Foundation's] Capitol Hill headquarters. Lee said he introduced the Take Care Act as the third part to a conservative legislative program that seeks to reduce the size and impact of administrative agencies, what he called the \"headless fourth branch of the federal government.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/06/19/mike-lees-new-bill-would-enforce-no-regulation-without-representation/\">https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/06/19/mike-lees-new-bill-would-enforce-no-regulation-without-representation/</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3) It's a Terrible Time to Regulate Big Tech:</emphasis> \"Had Benjamin Franklin lived today, he might have modified his iconic aphorism to read: There are only three things inevitable in life: death, taxes, and regulations. But the unintended consequence of Big Regulation is that regulatory lock-in preserves the monopoly status of the big players of the moment. Historically, corporate titans initially equivocate, but end up acquiescing to, if not encouraging, federal oversight. Big players can afford the lawyers, compliance teams, and lobbyists needed to take advantage of a regulatory regime that conveniently suppresses smaller competitors. \"        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/03/30/its_a_terrible_time_to_regulate_big_tech_136663.html\">https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/03/30/its_a_terrible_time_to_regulate_big_tech_136663.html</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4) Trump admin submits final rule to kill Obama Clean Power Plan:</emphasis> \"The Trump administration Wednesday finalized a rule to repeal and replace a capstone Obama-era carbon pollution regulation that they argue exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) authority. The new replacement rule to the Clean Power Plan (CPP), deemed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, aims to give states more time and authority to decide how to implement the best new technology to ease net emissions from coal-fired plants.\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449303-trump-admin-submits-final-rule-to-kill-obama-clean-power-plan\">https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449303-trump-admin-submits-final-rule-to-kill-obama-clean-power-plan</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5) Let's Move More Federal Agencies Out of Washington:</emphasis> \"There isn't much reason to keep a lot of government agencies in or near Washington. It makes sense to keep groups involved with \"day-to-day politics\" or policymaking, like the diplomatic corps, close to the capital. But many agencies are research organizations, and there's no clear purpose in keeping them near the seat of power. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and there aren't many concerns that this distance from Washington impedes the agency's mission.\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://reason.com/2019/06/17/lets-move-more-federal-agencies-out-of-washington/\">https://reason.com/2019/06/17/lets-move-more-federal-agencies-out-of-washington/</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6) The VA is improving because it's using more private healthcare:</emphasis> \"Even as someone who has been highly critical of the agency for years, I have to admit the VA has made some improvement since the deadly 2014 waitlist scandal. Between 2014 and 2017, according to a study by the JAMA network, wait times across the VA have generally gone down. However, this decrease occurred while the VA increased the number of private sector appointments by over 50%, demonstrating better use of non-VA providers and the introduction of the albeit imperfect Veterans Choice Program helped improve wait times for veterans.\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare\">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7) New York's Progressive-Backed Rental Regulations Are a Huge Gift to Wealthy Tenants:</emphasis> \"By abolishing high-rent and high-income deregulation, New York's legislature is ensuring that the discount for high-income renters will continue to grow. Limiting the ability of property owners to claw back the costs of capital improvements with higher rents will also decrease their incentive to keep buildings in a state of good repair, warns the Manhattan Institute's Howard Husock.\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://reason.com/2019/06/17/new-yorks-progressive-backed-rental-regulations-are-a-huge-gift-to-wealthy-tenants/\">https://reason.com/2019/06/17/new-yorks-progressive-backed-rental-regulations-are-a-huge-gift-to-wealthy-tenants/</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-66492</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG2-55B1-JCMP-53CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"799\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 FreedomWorks, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Freedom Works Foundation</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 21, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FREEDOMWORKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUMwRjNCRUQ4NUI2NEIwMkI1RTcyRUEzRDgxMEZCMDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REJGNjMzRTJDMDRGNDM0Mjg3QjAxNTE2MDU2RjlDMDY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000037</classCode><className>AGENCY RULEMAKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkRFNDkwODkxNDVGNDI1NDg0RUU3RjREMTgwNEJEQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM</classCode><className>Agency Rulemaking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N924110GJ</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY REGULATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUVDODc1M0EwM0ZFNEJGMzk0MDM1NzMxNjQ4NjMyODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM</classCode><className>Air Quality</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001462</classCode><className>REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000639</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Environmental &amp;

Our Regulatory Action Center proudly updates you with our favorite tidbits from the swamp. We want to smash barriers between bureaucracy and the American people by delivering regulatory news straight to FreedomWorks activists. Check back in two weeks for the next edition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1) Video of the Week: A giant of conservative economic circles, President Trump presented Arthur Laffer with the Presidential Medal of Freedom earlier this week. Sometimes referred to as the \"Father of Supply-Side Economics,\" Laffer's work has spanned decades and helped drive U.S. economic policy since the Reagan era. In this video, Laffer explains the theory that bears his name, the Laffer Curve.</p><p>2) Mike Lee's New Bill Would Enforce 'No Regulation Without Representation': \"'If the Founders' rallying cry was 'No taxation without representation,' ours must be, or must at least involve, 'No regulation without representation,'' Lee said at [The Heritage Foundation's] Capitol Hill headquarters. Lee said he introduced the Take Care Act as the third part to a conservative legislative program that seeks to reduce the size and impact of administrative agencies, what he called the \"headless fourth branch of the federal government.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/06/19/mike-lees-new-bill-would-enforce-no-regulation-without-representation/\">https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/06/19/mike-lees-new-bill-would-enforce-no-regulation-without-representation/</url></p><p>3) It's a Terrible Time to Regulate Big Tech: \"Had Benjamin Franklin lived today, he might have modified his iconic aphorism to read: There are only three things inevitable in life: death, taxes, and regulations. But the unintended consequence of Big Regulation is that regulatory lock-in preserves the monopoly status of the big players of the moment. Historically, corporate titans initially equivocate, but end up acquiescing to, if not encouraging, federal oversight. Big players can afford the lawyers, compliance teams, and lobbyists needed to take advantage of a regulatory regime that conveniently suppresses smaller competitors. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/03/30/its_a_terrible_time_to_regulate_big_tech_136663.html\">https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/03/30/its_a_terrible_time_to_regulate_big_tech_136663.html</url></p><p>4) Trump admin submits final rule to kill Obama Clean Power Plan: \"The Trump administration Wednesday finalized a rule to repeal and replace a capstone Obama-era carbon pollution regulation that they argue exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) authority. The new replacement rule to the Clean Power Plan (CPP), deemed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, aims to give states more time and authority to decide how to implement the best new technology to ease net emissions from coal-fired plants.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449303-trump-admin-submits-final-rule-to-kill-obama-clean-power-plan\">https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449303-trump-admin-submits-final-rule-to-kill-obama-clean-power-plan</url></p><p>5) Let's Move More Federal Agencies Out of Washington: \"There isn't much reason to keep a lot of government agencies in or near Washington. It makes sense to keep groups involved with \"day-to-day politics\" or policymaking, like the diplomatic corps, close to the capital. But many agencies are research organizations, and there's no clear purpose in keeping them near the seat of power. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and there aren't many concerns that this distance from Washington impedes the agency's mission.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://reason.com/2019/06/17/lets-move-more-federal-agencies-out-of-washington/\">https://reason.com/2019/06/17/lets-move-more-federal-agencies-out-of-washington/</url></p><p>6) The VA is improving because it's using more private healthcare: \"Even as someone who has been highly critical of the agency for years, I have to admit the VA has made some improvement since the deadly 2014 waitlist scandal. Between 2014 and 2017, according to a study by the JAMA network, wait times across the VA have generally gone down. However, this decrease occurred while the VA increased the number of private sector appointments by over 50%, demonstrating better use of non-VA providers and the introduction of the albeit imperfect Veterans Choice Program helped improve wait times for veterans.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare\">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare</url></p><p>7) New York's Progressive-Backed Rental Regulations Are a Huge Gift to Wealthy Tenants: \"By abolishing high-rent and high-income deregulation, New York's legislature is ensuring that the discount for high-income renters will continue to grow. Limiting the ability of property owners to claw back the costs of capital improvements with higher rents will also decrease their incentive to keep buildings in a state of good repair, warns the Manhattan Institute's Howard Husock.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://reason.com/2019/06/17/new-yorks-progressive-backed-rental-regulations-are-a-huge-gift-to-wealthy-tenants/\">https://reason.com/2019/06/17/new-yorks-progressive-backed-rental-regulations-are-a-huge-gift-to-wealthy-tenants/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123020565</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WD5-NF81-DYTH-G1M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"799\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 21, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Check back in two weeks for the next edition.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1) Video of the Week:</emphasis> The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has proposed a rule to enact rebate reform to help lower drug prices for patients and caregivers. This video is a good explainer on the role pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) play in the healthcare space, and how the rebates they get from drug companies cost you money at the pharmacy counter.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2) FDA Chief Scott Gottlieb Resigns:</emphasis> \"'The FDA is a stand out agency, across the administration, that's moving in the completely wrong direction,' said Paul Blair of Americans for Tax Reform, which led a coalition of conservative groups seeking to block the changes. Blair, in an interview before Gottlieb's resignation, said the commissioner's approach to regulation is inconsistent with the president's agenda.\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/432708-fda-chief-scott-gottlieb-resigns-reports\">https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/432708-fda-chief-scott-gottlieb-resigns-reports</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3) Andrew Wheeler, Who Continued Environmental Rollbacks, Is Confirmed to Lead EPA:</emphasis> \"Republicans said they have been delighted to discover Mr. Wheeler is as enthusiastic about repealing environmental regulations and promoting coal as Mr. Pruitt was, and are looking to him to cement Mr. Trump's legacy as a warrior against what they see as regulatory overreach.\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/climate/andrew-wheeler-epa-confirmation.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/climate/andrew-wheeler-epa-confirmation.html</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4) Nationalizing 5G Is Not the Way to Beat China:</emphasis> \"Reports surfaced last week that advisers to the administration are calling for the U.S. to embrace China-style nationalization as our path to 5G. That's like looking to Cuba as inspiration for reforming the U.S. health-care system. The U.S. won the race to 4G and secured billions of dollars in growth for the U.S. economy by relying on America's exceptional free-market values. We must double down on that winning playbook instead of copying China's, and that is what we at the Federal Communications Commission have been doing for the past two years.\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/03/nationalizing-5g-is-not-the-way-to-beat-china/\">https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/03/nationalizing-5g-is-not-the-way-to-beat-china/</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5) Trump Speaks Against Socialism - His Drug Price Control Plan Says Otherwise:</emphasis> \"Many seniors, numerous patient advocacy groups, and most free market economists and health policy experts strongly oppose the proposal, which would deprive American patients of lifesaving medications and stifle medical innovation. President Trump should tell his officials to stand down. HHS's plan affects Medicare Part B, which covers medications that doctors typically administer in their offices or hospitals. Part B currently pays more for those drugs than other developed countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and Canada. Those nations use price controls to cap the cost of prescription drugs. If a pharmaceutical company refuses to accept the government-imposed prices, those countries' socialized health systems simply refuse to cover the company's product.\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2019/03/08/trump_speaks_against_socialism_his_drug_price_control_plan_says_otherwise_111103.html\">https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2019/03/08/trump_speaks_against_socialism_his_drug_price_control_plan_says_otherwise_111103.html</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6) Court Rejects Antitrust Lawsuit Against AT&amp;T/Time Warner Deal:</emphasis> \"Consumers already have myriad choices for viewing content, a fact overlooked by the government's myopic view of the DIRECTV market. There are competitors to satellite television, like Internet service that supports streaming services Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube and portable devices like smart phones and tablets. This rapid innovation is a perfect example of market forces moving too quickly for antitrust regulators. Hopefully, this merger decision sends a signal to Washington regulators to exercise restraint and let businesses innovate, serve consumers, and generate wealth.\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/content/court-rejects-antitrust-lawsuit-against-atttimewarner-deal-cei-comment\">https://cei.org/content/court-rejects-antitrust-lawsuit-against-atttimewarner-deal-cei-comment</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7) Elizabeth Warren's Proposes Breaking Up Big Tech Giants, Including Amazon and Facebook:</emphasis> \"'The Warren campaign's call to breakup big tech companies reflects a 'big is bad, small is beautiful' ideology run amok,' Rob Atkinson [ITIF President] said in a statement obtained by Fox News.

Our Regulatory Action Center proudly updates you with our favorite tidbits from the swamp. We want to smash barriers between bureaucracy and the American people by delivering regulatory news straight to FreedomWorks activists. Check back in two weeks for the next edition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1) Video of the Week: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has proposed a rule to enact rebate reform to help lower drug prices for patients and caregivers. This video is a good explainer on the role pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) play in the healthcare space, and how the rebates they get from drug companies cost you money at the pharmacy counter.</p><p>2) FDA Chief Scott Gottlieb Resigns: \"'The FDA is a stand out agency, across the administration, that's moving in the completely wrong direction,' said Paul Blair of Americans for Tax Reform, which led a coalition of conservative groups seeking to block the changes. Blair, in an interview before Gottlieb's resignation, said the commissioner's approach to regulation is inconsistent with the president's agenda.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/432708-fda-chief-scott-gottlieb-resigns-reports\">https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/432708-fda-chief-scott-gottlieb-resigns-reports</url></p><p>3) Andrew Wheeler, Who Continued Environmental Rollbacks, Is Confirmed to Lead EPA: \"Republicans said they have been delighted to discover Mr. Wheeler is as enthusiastic about repealing environmental regulations and promoting coal as Mr. Pruitt was, and are looking to him to cement Mr. Trump's legacy as a warrior against what they see as regulatory overreach.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/climate/andrew-wheeler-epa-confirmation.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/climate/andrew-wheeler-epa-confirmation.html</url></p><p>4) Nationalizing 5G Is Not the Way to Beat China: \"Reports surfaced last week that advisers to the administration are calling for the U.S. to embrace China-style nationalization as our path to 5G. That's like looking to Cuba as inspiration for reforming the U.S. health-care system. The U.S. won the race to 4G and secured billions of dollars in growth for the U.S. economy by relying on America's exceptional free-market values. We must double down on that winning playbook instead of copying China's, and that is what we at the Federal Communications Commission have been doing for the past two years.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/03/nationalizing-5g-is-not-the-way-to-beat-china/\">https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/03/nationalizing-5g-is-not-the-way-to-beat-china/</url></p><p>5) Trump Speaks Against Socialism - His Drug Price Control Plan Says Otherwise: \"Many seniors, numerous patient advocacy groups, and most free market economists and health policy experts strongly oppose the proposal, which would deprive American patients of lifesaving medications and stifle medical innovation. President Trump should tell his officials to stand down. HHS's plan affects Medicare Part B, which covers medications that doctors typically administer in their offices or hospitals. Part B currently pays more for those drugs than other developed countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and Canada. Those nations use price controls to cap the cost of prescription drugs. If a pharmaceutical company refuses to accept the government-imposed prices, those countries' socialized health systems simply refuse to cover the company's product.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2019/03/08/trump_speaks_against_socialism_his_drug_price_\">https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2019/03/08/trump_speaks_against_socialism_his_drug_price_</url> control_plan_says_otherwise_111103.html</p><p>6) Court Rejects Antitrust Lawsuit Against ATandT/Time Warner Deal: \"Consumers already have myriad choices for viewing content, a fact overlooked by the government's myopic view of the DIRECTV market. There are competitors to satellite television, like Internet service that supports streaming services Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube and portable devices like smart phones and tablets. This rapid innovation is a perfect example of market forces moving too quickly for antitrust regulators.

This entry of BitBlog will cover some of the highlights.1) The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') continues to dole out bits of guidance via their rulings as to when digital assets can be sold and under which circumstances they can or cannot be considered securities. In this case, the SEC issued a no-action relief letter to Pocketful of Quarters, a company developing a video game currency platform that leverages blockchain technology to reduce fragmentation in the in-game currency market. </p><p>This no-action relief follows on the heels of the no-action relief received by TurnKey Jet in April but goes significantly further, allowing greater flexibility in the use of the ERC-20 standard that is built on and exchanged through the public Ethereum blockchain. In both the Pocketful of Quarters and TurnKey letters the SEC identified important factors in its decision making, such as the network being fully developed and operational before the tokens are issued and that the tokens are to be immediately capable of being redeemed for their intended purpose as a currency and not as an asset to be traded. The Pocketful of Quarters no-action letter represents an important step forward for market innovators attempting to develop functional and compliant digital assets in concert with the SEC's efforts to provide clarity regarding the regulation of digital assets. For more information on this subject please see our blog post[1].2) The New York Department of Financial Services ('DFS') announced that it was setting up a Research and Innovation Division[2]. This new division is designed to encourage innovation in the financial services marketplace and maintain New York's status as a competitive financial innovation hub. The DFS will be responsible for licensing and supervising virtual currencies. Given that New York is known for its beleaguered, expensive, cumbersome and generally problematic BitLicensing process, the fact that the state is working to foster innovation is good news. DFS Superintendent Linda Lacewell stated that the establishment of the Division, 'positions DFS as the regulator of the future, allowing the Department to better protect consumers, develop best practices, and analyze market data to strengthen New York's standing as the center of financial innovation.' Time will tell if this new division lives up to its promise.3) Before going into its summer recess, the U.S. Congress continued its slate of hearings related to the FinTech space. These hearings received extensive public attention, particularly those held on July 16th and July 17th related to the announcement by Facebook of its intention to launch a digital currency called Libra. During the hearing legislators expressed a large degree of skepticism and Facebook representatives appeared surprised and somewhat unprepared for the level of opposition Libra received. These hearings continued on a somewhat more optimistic note with the Senate Banking Committee testimony on July 30 in a hearing entitled, 'Examining Regulatory Frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain[3].' At the July hearing the many senators appear open to innovation in this space as long as it was regulated and they expressed particular concern about potential abuses on the part of 'big tech companies.' Although Congress is on break for the remainder of August, more hearings are expected in the fall, notably the House Financial Services Committee will hold hearings on securities law exemptions including regulation A+, which is a limited form of public offerings that is increasingly being eyed for use in the digital assets space, particularly by Blockstack. The Bitblog will be publishing a more detailed analysis of these Congressional hearings in coming entries.4) On July 31, 2019, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published its final guidance regarding crypto-asset activities and the scope of its regulation. This guidance has been in progress for a long time and is the product of much consultation with regulators and market participants. Unlike in the SEC where crypto-asset regulation is divided among many regulators, both state and federal, in the UK the FCA is responsible for the implementation of the vast majority of financial regulations. A core purpose of these guidelines is to help the FCA and market participants determine whether the activities they are conducting are regulated.The FCA divides digital tokens into three groups; 1) Exchange Tokens, 2) Utility Tokens and 3) Security Tokens. However, even after considerable feedback the distinction between these types of tokens is not altogether clear. Bitcoin and Ethereum are classified as Exchange tokens and are, at least for now, outside of FCA regulations. This is in contrast with Security Tokens which covers shares, debentures and units in a collective scheme under FCA regulation. Utility Tokens exist in the gray area between Security Tokens and Exchange Tokens. These tokens do not meet the definition of a security but may still be subject to e-money rules. With Facebook's Libra looking to be only the first of many private currencies we will see if these guidelines become the basis for some sort of global regulation.Separate from this guidance, and somewhat more controversially, the FCA also just proposed to ban retail investors from investing in all types of crypto derivatives.6) Back in the United States the litigation related to Mt. Gox looks to continue for the foreseeable future. The Japanese exchange at one point handled over 70 percent of all bitcoin transactions, but collapsed in 2014 amid allegations of hacks, fraud and theft. On July 30 Philadelphia District Judge Robert Kelly ruled that a class action lawsuit against Mt. Gox CEO Mark Kapeles can proceed after denying a request to dismiss for lack of jusidisction. Discovery might prove very interesting in this one.

While many high-profile companies have abandoned proposed deals, various other companies have expressed or maintained interest in pursuing strategic acquisitions during this time. This article discusses the regulatory changes that parties should consider when contemplating M&amp;#38;A events in the Indian and the US markets in the wake of COVID-19.Antitrust USA: Federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) have not implemented any substantive changes for merger review during the COVID-19 era. However, the risk of antitrust infringement tends to increase during periods of economic disruption. </p><p>Congressional rhetoric has also raised concerns regarding changes to the merger approval process. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have spoken in favour of introducing the Pandemic Anti-Monopoly Act, which may temporarily prevent certain corporate acquisitions. Regardless of whether the proposed legislation comes to fruition (which at the present time seems highly unlikely), during this period of vast economic disruption, federal agencies are likely to take a closer look at merger filings, particularly for companies in the public health and biotechnology industries. Big Tech businesses are increasingly facing antitrust scrutiny, as their businesses continue to thrive in spite of the pandemic. As such, the House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee recently interviewed the CEOs of prominent Big Tech companies regarding alleged anti-competitive behavior and will produce a report with antitrust recommendations in August.The FTC and DOJ released a joint statement, providing guidance for competitors cooperating in the interest of public health. The guidance specified certain joint activities that do not typically violate antitrust laws, including, but not limited to research collaboration, certain joint purchasing arrangements, and certain lobbying practices. The agencies also noted they will provide expedited antitrust review for businesses collaborating on projects in the interest of public health and related to combating the spread of COVID-19.The FTC and DOJ have also issued a joint statement regarding the measures taken by the agencies to protect essential workers from certain labor market conduct during COVID-19. The statement made it clear that anticompetitive activities that may lead to wage suppression will be closely monitored and not tolerated. Although antitrust review continues, perhaps even with increased scrutiny, the government wants to encourage cooperation among businesses for the benefit of public health.While the FTC has recently experienced a reduction in HSR filings, it is likely that once the dust settles, following this period of economic disruption, there may be an uptick in mergers, relying on the 'failing firm' defense due to the economic conditions resulting from COVID-19. The 'failing firm' defense has three requirements: (i) The competitor will be unable to meet its financial obligations in the near future, (ii) The competitor will not be able to reorganize successfully under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii) The competitor has made unsuccessful, good-faith efforts to find another buyer that would keep its assets in the market and would pose less of a danger to competition than the proposed merger. However, the burden of proof for the 'failing firm' defense is high and the FTC has advised that the agency will continue to apply the test as done in the past and will require the same burden of substantiation as prior to COVID-19. Thus, parties should be wary when providing this defense.While there have not been significant substantive changes to merger review in light of COVID-19, federal agencies have implemented various procedural changes. Further, in terms of merger review, the DOJ has requested parties to add an additional 30-day period to their deal timing. The DOJ moved to a telework model, under which meetings are primarily conducted through telephone or videoconferencing and the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) filing process was moved to a new e-filing system. While review of HSR filings have continued, parties have experienced delays due to the COVID-19 disruption.India: The Indian government has not implemented any changes to statutory timelines prescribed under the Indian anti-trust regulations on account of COVID-19 disruptions. However, the Indian anti-trust regulator (Competition Commission of India or 'CCI') has introduced a new e-filing system for merger control filings. The CCI has also made pre-filing consultations mandatory in most merger control filings to ensure minimization of delays in considering and approving combinations due to mandatory 'work from home requirements' and reduced staff capacities. However, hearings for anti-trust investigations on cartelizations / abuse of dominant positions have been adjourned until in person hearings are possible.In response to the COVID-19 disruptions, however, the CCI has stated that arrangements between competitors that are 'necessary and proportionate to address concerns arising from Covid-19' may not be seen as anti-competitive arrangements. For co-operation with competitors, the guidelines include assessing the scope of collaborations, detailed documentation and ex ante review by legal counsel. Dominant companies should avoid abusive / exploitative conduct by refraining from (i) limiting production, services or technical development, (ii) excessive pricing, and (iii) bundling non-essential products / services with essential services.Foreign Investments CFIUS Issues (USA): COVID-19 has also presented concerns that certain foreign investments may pose a risk to national security and the national economy. Department of Defense officials have emphasized on the need for Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) reviews to protect against 'adversarial capital coming into our markets for nefarious means.' While CFIUS has not implemented any specific legislation or policies to specifically address COVID-19, there have been other changes in the CFIUS regulatory climate. For one, there has been congressional activity in this realm, including a proposed bill intended to protect US companies from predatory Chinese governmental investment during the pandemic. Further, popular social media app TikTok is under CFIUS review due to national security concerns, given its Chinese ownership.CFIUS, earlier this year, also finalized regulations implementing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) from 2018. FIRRMA expanded CFIUS's review to include non-controlling and non-passive investments in specific types of businesses, including businesses involving 'critical technologies,' such as biotechnology companies, companies handling 'critical infrastructure' and companies handling 'sensitive personal data,' like those with financial or medical information. Before FIRRMA, CFIUS filings were largely voluntary, however, they are now mandatory in certain instances. As such, the percentage of M&amp;#38;A transactions that require CFIUS review has increased in the past couple of years. In May 2020, the US Department of the Treasury issued a proposed rule, modifying the scope of the mandatory declaration provision for certain transactions involving critical technologies.CFIUS has historically been concerned with protecting national security in a number of different contexts, including the defense and IT sectors. The current public health crisis is however likely to expand the agency's focus. In light of COVID-19, the definition of what may be considered 'national security' is likely to be expanded to encompass a broader range of supply chains, including those affecting food supply chain, medical device manufacturing, pharmaceutical companies, and protective equipment. Further, certain FIRMMA regulations from February 2020 include provisions that expand CFIUS and FIRMMA, based on the invocation of the Defense Production Act (DPA). One of President Donald Trump's recent Executive Orders placed certain US medical and food production under the DPA, which potentially enables CFIUS' application to certain medical supplies and food production that currently fall under the DPA due to the said Executive Order.The economic disruption and volatility caused by COVID-19 has also created potential CFIUS concerns. Many businesses have obtained government-backed loans provided by the CARES Act and other government relief programs, creating concern that a potential acquisition would make debt repayment less likely. There has also been an increased review in circumstances where the assets acquired in an acquisition are distressed or in bankruptcy, for fear of adversarial foreign investors. While CFIUS regulations carve out most lending transactions, CFIUS can assert jurisdiction when a borrower enters into default or a similar condition occurs, resulting in a potential foreign investor obtaining rights that mirror an equity investment.Procedurally, there have also been several changes in the CFIUS review process. CFIUS is still subject to regulatory deadlines in the processing of cases. Notwithstanding these deadlines, the COVID-19 environment has resulted in practical delays. For example, the agency implemented a teleworking model and this can make coordination of a Committee with numerous agencies represented difficult. Parties with new CFIUS submissions should account for sufficient time for delays in their deal documents and understand how their deal is likely to be viewed by CFIUS. In certain instances, additional disclosures or discussions with CFIUS up front can help mitigate delays.Press Note 3 (India): The Indian government sought to firewall Indian companies from Chinese capital by curbing 'opportunistic takeovers / acquisitions' of Indian companies. Pursuant to Press Note 3 (2020), direct / indirect acquisitions by entities whose ultimate beneficiaries are located in countries that share land borders with India are now subject to prior approvals from the Indian government. Implicitly, this amendment seeks to regulate inbound Chinese investments into Indian companies.As the provisions of Press Note 3 (2020) do not grant any exemptions basis the extent of beneficial Chinese holding, it will also extend to LPs and GPs of private equity funds housed in China. Additional spill-over effects of Press Note 3 (2020) include its scope extending to foreign portfolio investors (beneficially held in China) undertaking transactions on the capital markets (market intelligence suggests that the government is seeking to regulate on market activity as well), and a lack of clarity on the status of investments from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Additionally, indirect foreign investments made by Chinese investors into Indian companies may also trigger approval requirements. As such, clarifications on these aspects are required and may vary from case to case.Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and instances of conflagrations at the Indo-Sino border, India has also banned a whole host of Chinese applications including Tiktok, PubG and WeChat on the grounds that they are prejudicial to India's national security and privacy concerns. Recent press reports suggest that India is also considering imposing trade controls on certain goods from China. This evolving India-China situation has resulted in difficulties in deal-making.In some cases, parties are taking commercial deal positions on the basis of factors such as the extent of Chinese participation, nature of deal and rights acquired, etc., to close transactions without seeking approvals. The requirement of government approvals will significantly affect transaction timelines, with approval timelines being linked to industry sensitivity, investment nature and size, etc. Investee companies are also expending time and resources in undertaking diligences on the investing entities (including reviewing their constitution and holding structures) to assess Chinese participation. However, recent press reports cite government sources and provide that a 25% threshold for seeking approvals is being considered, but regulations / notifications in this regard are awaited. Cross-border financing transactions under the 'external commercial borrowing' route, however, have not been affected as they fall outside the purview of these regulations.Changing M&amp;#38;A deal-making contours: M&amp;#38;A deal-making has changed course due to COVID-19, induced disruptions with deal activity being disrupted due to value erosion and acquirers choosing to invoke 'Material Adverse Change' provisions to walk away from transactions (although a case-by-case assessment is required to identify whether a 'Material Adverse Change' has in fact been triggered). Parties that have proceeded to consummate deals have been met with delays in completion of pre-completion conditions (and a consequent re-prioritization of 'good to haves' vs 'must haves'), dilution of standstill obligations to enable target companies to firefight better and requirements of more robust information rights, given the inability of audits.From a due-diligence and deal-making perspective, labor and financing aspects of target companies have taken centre stage. To insulate Indian borrowers from the aftershocks of the COVID-19 induced lockdowns, the Reserve Bank of India (India's central bank) allowed financial institutions to offer moratoriums on loan repayments (over two block periods till August 31, 2020). It is critical to understand the status of moratoriums actually granted by lenders to target entities and read the moratorium paperwork in consonance with the financing documentation. This is critical, especially since any delays in repayment after the permitted moratorium period will result in an immediate default by the target entity. Acquirers should also open channels of communication with the target entity's lenders to ensure that it is not exposed to the risk of the target company being pulled into bankruptcy proceedings mid-deal or post-deal.Acquirers are also likely to focus on employment terms, appraisal cycles, contract commitments and hiring policies of the employees of target entities to assess instances of redundancies in the workforce. Legal due-diligence exercises are also focusing on the status of statutory pension payments of target companies (termed as 'gratuity' and 'provident fund') by assessing (i) non-payment/delayed payment of monthly provident fund contributions by the target entity, (ii) delays in making gratuity payments by the target entity (which may consequently trip insurance policies maintained to cover payment liabilities), and (iii) law suits brought by employees owing to delays in pension payments. Acquirers should carefully assess pension liability and labor compliances of target companies, especially in light of various relaxations that the Indian government has offered vis-a-vis pension payments due to COVID-19.From a risk transfer / mitigation perspective, acquirers are also increasingly considering insurance policies to cover for transaction liabilities, especially on the back of COVID-19 induced business disruptions reducing costs of products, like warranty and indemnity insurance policies. While direct negative effects of COVID-19 are generally excluded form insurance coverage, general supply chain risks, financial stability and business continuity are fresh areas of focus for underwriting new policies. Tax liability and litigation insurances are also becoming risk mitigation products that acquirers are finding favorable for deal-making.

The Bank of England said it will approach Libra \"with an open mind but not an open door,\" while the Bank for International Settlements cautioned that \"big tech\" companies active in financial services should be governed by the same regulations as banks. The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority said June 25 that the plans raised \"very big issues for the public policy world.\"</p><p>\"If Libra takes off, it will be subject to a substantial regulatory approval process. ... Although the founding members are targeting a first-half 2020 launch, this level of scrutiny could imply either delays or limited scope in the initial roll-out,\" a June 25 note said.</p><p>Several aspects of Libra are likely to heighten regulator concern, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. Among them are consumer protection and data privacy issues, the risk of money laundering and financial crime, and the potentially systemic nature of Libra.</p><p>S&amp;P Global Ratings said the absence of banks among Libra's 28 founding members is \"either an indication of skepticism regarding its potential success and concerns about the risks associated with it or a sign of the potential negative effect Libra could have on banking business and revenue.\"</p><p>Libra's founding members include Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Stripe Inc., and PayPal Holdings Inc.   but no banks.</p><p>Libra potentially solves two problems that other cryptocurrencies have failed to crack, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. These are volatility and a lack of widespread acceptance as a payment method.</p><p>Being pegged to a basket of currencies gives Libra some guarantee of price stability   in contrast to the extreme rises and falls in the value of other cryptocurrencies   while the presence of major global consumer brands such as Uber Technologies Inc. and eBay Inc. among Libra's founder members will help create an ecosystem that could result in \"wider acceptance than we have seen for other cryptocurrencies,\" the note said.</p><p>While these two qualities boost Libra's credibility, it is \"unlikely\" that Libra would ever become a reserve currency, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p><p>\"Users will pay for the privilege of using it by not receiving any interest. This seems acceptable in a low interest rate environment, but may be questioned if [interest] rates start to rise,\" the note said.</p><p>Descriptions in this news article were not prepared by S&amp;P Global Ratings.

As social distancing and border closures force commerce, retail and socialising online, their market dominance and ubiquity has become further entrenched despite increasing regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Their second-quarter results on Thursday gave Big Tech something to smile about, as revenues for all four firms exceeded analysts' expectations. The results followed a marathon grilling of their CEOs - Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook - by the US Congress on Wednesday about whether their companies are guilty of anticompetitive behaviour and of compromising democracy through cannibalising media content, promoting online hate and election rigging. Explosive testimony emerged at the hearing focused predominantly on Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>Facebook's acquisition of competitors was evidently ruthless, while Amazon was shown to be willing to lose hundreds of millions of dollars to undercut competitors, to the point that they leave the market.</p><p>The outstanding earnings results will reinforce the emerging \"techlash\", in which US and EU regulators and consumers are becoming outraged at the stranglehold that Big Tech has over economies, and the privacy and security problems this dominance perpetuates.</p><p>Even US President Donald Trump was moved to say at the weekend that Bezos has too much money and contributes to income inequality.</p><p>Bezos is estimated to make $2,500 a second, or $150,000 a minute. After this quarter's revenue of $88.9bn, up from $63.4bn at the same time in 2019, Amazon's $1-trillion valuation looks set to increase - as will Bezos's wealth. I imagine him like Scrooge McDuck, swimming in his vault of gold coins, just for fun.</p><p>Facebook's results are the most surprising, as analysts expected the advertising boycott of the past few weeks to hit the company badly given that 98% of its revenue comes from advertising.</p><p>Big advertisers including Disney and Starbucks, pulled their custom from Facebook as part of a campaign to combat the company's perceived contribution to online hate by not removing racist and sexist comments swiftly enough, and to misinformation about coronavirus by allowing fake news to spread. But Facebook's revenue increased 11% over the review period.</p><p>The boycott has not been as effective as the organisers had hoped, giving Zuckerberg leverage against his detractors.</p><p>With no sign of the tech titans slowing down, what is to be done? Some commentators are asking if indeed anything could, or should, be done, and if these companies have now become too big to break up.</p><p>Yet it seems unlikely they will escape regulatory scrutiny as it becomes clear that their dominance can be bad for innovation and bad for society.</p><p>Even though the US is politically divided and bipartisan antics punctuated Wednesday's hearing, the message was clear: legislators intend to hold these companies to account even though they are gigantic, and the issue of online harm is complex.</p><p>But legislators also have to take a look at how they have contributed to the situation. The federal trade committee approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram without much scrutiny, for example.</p><p>Elsewhere, EU antitrust investigations have recently been vigorous under Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, who has been pushing for digital sales tax in the face of staunch lobbying by US companies and business chambers.</p><p>A digital sales tax has been mooted in the UK too, but fear of offending Trump has slowed this initiative.</p><p>Perhaps now that Trump himself has spoken out about tech earnings, and given the ballooning of the UK budget deficit in the pandemic, it might be emboldened to take action to increase revenues.</p><p>The US hearing may yet prove to have teeth when the report comes out in September. Tech CEOs should be worried. In 2001 Microsoft lost its antitrust case despite a vigorous defence.</p><p>Masie, a former senior editor of the Financial Mail, is chief strategist at IC Publications in London and a fellow of the Wits School of Governance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLBD-BDsp030820OPletter2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLBD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H4-5CH1-DYT4-K1BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

After this quarter's revenue of $88.9bn, up from $63.4bn at the same time in 2019, Amazon's $1-trillion valuation looks set to increase - as will Bezos's wealth.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler didn't come to the event, citing another commitment (see 1701050066). A former FCC senior official told us if Commissioner Ajit Pai is named interim rather than permanent chairman that's a bad sign and means it's unlikely he will get the job permanently.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President-elect Donald Trump loomed over the conference, attendees said. Las Vegas' golden Trump Tower was even visible in the distance from the road leading up to the Las Vegas Convention Center. The transition team didn't comment.</p><p>All three FCC commissioners who will be at the agency after Trump takes office Jan. 20 were on a regulatory panel Thursday, as were FTC Commissioners Maureen Ohlhausen and Terrell McSweeny (see 1701060044). Attendees of the main regulatory panel told us there won't be much certainty until Trump names the leaders of both agencies. Few FCC staffers were at CES this year, with most top agency officials set to depart the regulator in coming weeks. A wireless industry official said some big tech companies got much of what they wanted from the Obama FCC, but many support the more deregulatory agenda expected under Trump.</p><p>\"Among consumer advocates, there is some apprehension around whether the trend toward more open and shared spectrum access will continue,\" said Michael Calabrese, director of the Wireless Future Program at New America. \"Spectrum has never been a partisan issue. For example, former Chairman Michael Powell initiated the proposal for unlicensed use of TV white space channels and his successor Kevin Martin led the item to a unanimous final order.\" An action on the 3.5 GHz shared spectrum band, with its dynamic sharing between unlicensed and licensed users, was approved 5-0, Calabrese added. \"Nonetheless, with big carriers constantly agitating for nothing but exclusive, long-term licenses, we do worry about maintaining a robust and competitive balance in spectrum policy.\"</p><p>There's reason for anxiety, said Matt Wood, Free Press policy director. \"Besides the threat that net neutrality and a host of other competition policies will come under attack, tech companies should be concerned about Trump's Luddite pronouncements and his anti-encryption stance when it came to Apple vs. the FBI,\" Wood said. There \"is certainly room for cautious optimism,\" countered Doug Brake, telecom policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. \"There was friction during the election, and the small guys who actually supported Title II, the Tumblrs of the world, are probably worried. But there is real opportunity around addressing innovation mercantilism by foreign governments, around corporate tax reform, around a real focus on smart infrastructure. President-elect Trump's inviting tech leaders was a good sign.\" The incoming president met last month with tech executives (see 1612140060). Under Wheeler, the FCC in 2015 reclassified broadband under Title II of the Communications Act, a decision expected to be undone by the Trump FCC (see 1611090034).</p><p>Net neutrality is more about symbolism than reality, said Richard Bennett, free-market blogger and network architect. \"It will continue to be U.S. policy, but Title II will fade away.\" CES companies \"are more concerned about the spectrum problem, which is best solved by putting government spectrum up for sale,\" he said. \"The next FCC chairman is likely to be an excellent advocate for the entire tech sector.\" Many top executives at edge providers supported Trump's presidential opponent Hillary Clinton, \"and her strong pro-net neutrality stance,\" over Trump, said Randolph May, president of the Free State Foundation. \"I assume they still are anxious about Trump for different reasons, including what he may push to implement in the way of telecom policy. But I think their overwrought support of net neutrality was short-sighted, because it's likely that if the regulations remain on the books, they would ultimately ensnare in their web the Googles, Facebooks, Amazons, too. The tech companies like Google might have Trump to thank for saving themselves from their own short-term thinking.\" The three edge providers didn't comment.</p><p>\"The president-elect has shown an uncanny ability to pivot, so he is likely to be open to ideas coming from the all-star tech council he promises to meet with regularly,\" said Adonis Hoffman, chairman of the for-profit Business in the Public Interest group. \"Tech companies should settle on ... key priorities under Trump and be prepared to compromise. ... If Trump can persuade a major tech company to bring some jobs back to the U.S., that will seal the deal.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MK0-WM51-JC8G-83DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 09, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

A former FCC senior official told us if Commissioner Ajit Pai is named interim rather than permanent chairman that's a bad sign and means it's unlikely he will get the job permanently.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President-elect Donald Trump loomed over the conference, attendees said. Las Vegas' golden Trump Tower was even visible in the distance from the road leading up to the Las Vegas Convention Center. The transition team didn't comment.</p><p>All three FCC commissioners who will be at the agency after Trump takes office Jan. 20 were on a regulatory panel Thursday, as were FTC Commissioners Maureen Ohlhausen and Terrell McSweeny (see 1701060044). Attendees of the main regulatory panel told us there won't be much certainty until Trump names the leaders of both agencies. Few FCC staffers were at CES this year, with most top agency officials set to depart the regulator in coming weeks. A wireless industry official said some big tech companies got much of what they wanted from the Obama FCC, but many support the more deregulatory agenda expected under Trump.</p><p>\"Among consumer advocates, there is some apprehension around whether the trend toward more open and shared spectrum access will continue,\" said Michael Calabrese, director of the Wireless Future Program at New America. \"Spectrum has never been a partisan issue. For example, former Chairman Michael Powell initiated the proposal for unlicensed use of TV white space channels and his successor Kevin Martin led the item to a unanimous final order.\" An action on the 3.5 GHz shared spectrum band, with its dynamic sharing between unlicensed and licensed users, was approved 5-0, Calabrese added. \"Nonetheless, with big carriers constantly agitating for nothing but exclusive, long-term licenses, we do worry about maintaining a robust and competitive balance in spectrum policy.\"</p><p>There's reason for anxiety, said Matt Wood, Free Press policy director. \"Besides the threat that net neutrality and a host of other competition policies will come under attack, tech companies should be concerned about Trump's Luddite pronouncements and his anti-encryption stance when it came to Apple vs. the FBI,\" Wood said. There \"is certainly room for cautious optimism,\" countered Doug Brake, telecom policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. \"There was friction during the election, and the small guys who actually supported Title II, the Tumblrs of the world, are probably worried. But there is real opportunity around addressing innovation mercantilism by foreign governments, around corporate tax reform, around a real focus on smart infrastructure. President-elect Trump's inviting tech leaders was a good sign.\" The incoming president met last month with tech executives (see 1612140060). Under Wheeler, the FCC in 2015 reclassified broadband under Title II of the Communications Act, a decision expected to be undone by the Trump FCC (see 1611090034).</p><p>Net neutrality is more about symbolism than reality, said Richard Bennett, free-market blogger and network architect. \"It will continue to be U.S. policy, but Title II will fade away.\" CES companies \"are more concerned about the spectrum problem, which is best solved by putting government spectrum up for sale,\" he said. \"The next FCC chairman is likely to be an excellent advocate for the entire tech sector.\" Many top executives at edge providers supported Trump's presidential opponent Hillary Clinton, \"and her strong pro-net neutrality stance,\" over Trump, said Randolph May, president of the Free State Foundation. \"I assume they still are anxious about Trump for different reasons, including what he may push to implement in the way of telecom policy. But I think their overwrought support of net neutrality was short-sighted, because it's likely that if the regulations remain on the books, they would ultimately ensnare in their web the Googles, Facebooks, Amazons, too. The tech companies like Google might have Trump to thank for saving themselves from their own short-term thinking.\" The three edge providers didn't comment.</p><p>\"The president-elect has shown an uncanny ability to pivot, so he is likely to be open to ideas coming from the all-star tech council he promises to meet with regularly,\" said Adonis Hoffman, chairman of the for-profit Business in the Public Interest group. \"Tech companies should settle on ... key priorities under Trump and be prepared to compromise. ... If Trump can persuade a major tech company to bring some jobs back to the U.S., that will seal the deal.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONSED-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONSED2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MK0-WP41-DYRJ-142X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Consumer Electronics Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 09, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CC</classCode><className>COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000106</classCode><className>APPOINTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N926110GJ</classCode><className>CONSUMER PROTECTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001031</classCode><className>LICENSING AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000477</classCode><className>DEREGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001685</classCode><className>TAX REFORM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009G3S</classCode><className>COMMUNICATIONS REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001881</classCode><className>WIRELESS INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>PE0009WPW</classCode><className>KEVIN MARTIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

That's the point. Why is it a very small percentage? Because IPL is ensuring that percentage is small and stays small, by its actions and inactions: a) IPL is not informing its customers of the downsides and risks of its AMI installation, which have been extensively documented (no cost benefit shown, privacy issues, major cyber security issues) b) IPL is not informing its customers of an opt out availability unless it is made to, and when it does, it does not explain benefits of opting out of why one might wish to. c) The Des Moines Register, and about half the other larger newspapers in Iowa, have so far not published any information at all on IPL's AMI installation, including nothing on the IUB hearing Filed with the Iowa Utilities Board on March 13, 2019, SPU-2018-0007 3/14/2019 State of Iowa Mail - Re: Objection to IPL Response # 1841338       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mail.google.com\">https://mail.google.com</url> /mail/u/1?ik=ac1035eb59&amp;view=pt&amp;amp;search=all&amp;amp;permthid=thread-f%3A1627858432944781928%7Cmsg-f%3A1627860230727... 2/4 and the OCA's opposition. Only three papers have printed articles (Cedar Rapids Gazette, Fairfield Ledger, and Marshalltown Times-Republican, the rest of coverage has been 1-2 letters to editor). d) IPL's materials have many false and misleading statements about AMI meters (which have been detailed abundantly by many complaints of mine and others) In other words, IPL is saying, in effect, 'Most of our customers do not want to opt out because we have not told them they can, or why they might consider it.' So the fact that only a small percentage of PL customers have not expressed a desire to opt out is evidence not that IPL should not inform their customers, but evidence that they should be required to inform their customers! 2. \"Industry-standard technology\" Again, this is the problem, not the solution. This is why we ask that you (the Iowa Utility Board) protect us against 'Big Tech' 'industry-wide' standards, which are ultimately and basically profitdriven. Whereas state regulators are supposed to be 'protection-driven.' 3. \"The procedural and legal basis for the OCA Request is unclear.\" What is unclear is a) why IPL set out to spend millions of dollars installing a new system of no proven benefit to any customers anywhere in the world, and b) why they were allowed to do this. All IPL's claims for AMI such as 'modernization,' 'up-to-date systems,' ' industry standard,' etc all hide the fact that the actual benefit of the AMI system is wholly for the IOU, not for its customers. No utility in the world has reduced its rates after installing AMI, although they may claim they will. IPL also says it will. Has it committed to this in writing? With remedies if rates go up instead of down? Nowhere does IPL provide any evidence for any customer benefit from AMI meters - only its own projections. 4. \"Customer confusion\" (p. 3) It is not a matter of customer confusion. It is a matter of customer ignorance (of the risks of AMI in the areas of cost, privacy, and cyber security, and possibly in the area of health for certain population sub-groups (residents of densely populated buildings and developments, those with electromagnetic sensitivity (EMS), those in industrial settings, and those with gas meters signaling more than seven signals/day)). The fact that most IPL customers are not opting out is the evidence that they are ignorant of the risks and downsides of AMI installation (particularly higher utility rates with no customer benefit). And it has been shown that when a population is well-informed (Cedar Rapids, Decorah, Fairfield), then the percentage of customers opting out is much higher. 5. \"Extraordinary\" (pp 3ff) as applied to OCA's request What is extraordinary is a) IPL's expenditure of millions of dollars installing a system without any evidence of customer benefit, and b) their being allowed to do so. So an extraordinary remedy is appropriate to address an extraordinary fault.

What is relevant is what is the right and appropriate action to take now. I began calling for a moratorium in late 2017, and specifically and directly to the Board on June 21 in its Fairfield meeting. Others did also. The Board has been facilitating an extremely expensive system of no evidenced customer benefit, and I ask that it cease doing so. AMI systems only hurt customers - by costing far more, and providing no additional benefit or service. All AMI means is we send much more money to IPL and receive nothing in significance in return. ALL IPL's claims of customer benefit are either a) vague, or b) unevidenced, or c) both vague and unevidenced. 7. \"A. All residential customers have received notice of the Board's proceeding in this docket. (p. 5) This notice was profoundly insufficient in its information and scope, because it did not inform customers of any potential risks (in cost, privacy, cyber security, or health), or any reason why anyone might wish to opt out. In fact, IPL's materials supplied misleading materials to prevent customers from finding out the risks and downsides of the AMI system (\"Faster outage reporting\" being the most prominent misleading claim (cf. my objection following this objection). A main point I am making is that just informing residential customers of 'NSMA options' is quite insufficient information. It is customary and expected in business and professional circles to be aware of potential risks, and additional expenditure. Did IPL inform its customers that their utility rates will be expected to skyrocket for years, which has happened commonly in most or all locations where AMI has been installed? Did IPL inform its customers how much this new AMI system will cost it, and cost them in rate hikes? 8. \"IPL has consistently worked to reduce costs and ensure that AMI roll-out is completed in a manner that is cost-effective.\" (p. 7) Cost effective for whom? Is a 25% rate hike, on top of prior rate hikes, cost effective for us customers? NO. It is cost effective only for IPL - not for its customers. The strategy that IPL has used is to spend as much money as quickly as possible, and proceed with installation as quickly as possible, and get as much installation done as possible, telling customers and the media and government as little as possible about any potential risks (cost, privacy, cyber security, health) so that when opposition has time to catch up, IPL can say, 'installation is now so far advanced, and it will cost too much to pause or cease.' I would ask the Board to see through this strategy and disregard it, oppose it. It is not in the long term best interest of customers. The cost to IPL customers of temporary disruption of IPL's AMI deployment would be less than the heavy long-term cost of installing AMI, born in ever higher rates.

That's the point. Why is it a very small percentage? Because IPL is ensuring that percentage is small and stays small, by its actions and inactions: a) IPL is not informing its customers of the downsides and risks of its AMI installation, which have been extensively documented (no cost benefit shown, privacy issues, major cyber security issues) b) IPL is not informing its customers of an opt out availability unless it is made to, and when it does, it does not explain benefits of opting out of why one might wish to. c) The Des Moines Register, and about half the other larger newspapers in Iowa, have so far not published any information at all on IPL's AMI installation, including nothing on the IUB hearing and the OCA's opposition. Only three papers have printed articles (Cedar Rapids Gazette, Fairfield Ledger, and Marshalltown Times-Republican, the rest of coverage has been 1-2 letters to editor). d) IPL's materials have many false and misleading statements about AMI meters (which have been detailed abundantly by many complaints of mine and others) In other words, IPL is saying, in effect, 'Most of our customers do not want to opt out because we have not told them they can, or why they might consider it.' So the fact that only a small percentage of PL customers have not expressed a desire to opt out is evidence not that IPL should not inform their customers, but evidence that they should be required to Filed with the Iowa Utilities Board on March 13, 2019, SPU-2018-0007 3/14/2019 State of Iowa Mail - Objection to IPL Response # 1841338       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mail.google.com\">https://mail.google.com</url> /mail/u/1?ik=ac1035eb59 &amp;view=pt&amp;amp;search=all&amp;amp;permthid=thread-f%3A1627858432944781928%7Cmsg-f%3A1627858432944... 2/3 inform their customers! 2. \"Industry-standard technology\" Again, this is the problem, not the solution. This is why we ask that you (the Iowa Utility Board) protect us against 'Big Tech' 'industry-wide' standards, which are ultimately and basically profitdriven. Whereas state regulators are supposed to be 'protection-driven.' 3. \"The procedural and legal basis for the OCA Request is unclear.\" What is unclear is a) why IPL set out to spend millions of dollars installing a new system of no proven benefit to any customers anywhere in the world, and b) why they were allowed to do this. All IPL's claims for AMI such as 'modernization,' 'up-to-date systems,' ' industry standard,' etc all hide the fact that the actual benefit of the AMI system is wholly for the IOU, not for its customers. No utility in the world has reduced its rates after installing AMI, although they may claim they will. IPL also says it will. Has it committed to this in writing? With remedies if rates go up instead of down? Nowhere does IPL provide any evidence for any customer benefit from AMI meters - only its own projections. 4. \"Customer confusion\" (p. 3) It is not a matter of customer confusion. It is a matter of customer ignorance (of the risks of AMI in the areas of cost, privacy, and cyber security, and possibly in the area of health for certain population sub-groups (residents of densely populated buildings and developments, those with electromagnetic sensitivity (EMS), those in industrial settings, and those with gas meters signaling more than seven signals/day)). The fact that most IPL customers are not opting out is the evidence that they are ignorant of the risks and downsides of AMI installation (particularly higher utility rates with no customer benefit). And it has been shown that when a population is well-informed (Cedar Rapids, Decorah, Fairfield), then the percentage of customers opting out is much higher. 5. \"Extraordinary\" (pp 3ff) as applied to OCA's request What is extraordinary is a) IPL's expenditure of millions of dollars installing a system without any evidence of customer benefit, and b) their being allowed to do so. So an extraordinary remedy is appropriate to address an extraordinary fault. 6. \"1. ...the Board previously considered and rejected other parties' request for a moratorium on AMI deployment. \" (p. 4) The fact that the Board made a prior decision is not relevant. What is relevant is what is the right and appropriate action to take now. I began calling for a moratorium in late 2017, and specifically and directly to the Board on June 21 in its Fairfield meeting. Others did also. The Board has been facilitating an extremely expensive system of no evidenced customer benefit, and I ask that it cease doing so. AMI systems only hurt customers - by costing far more, and providing no additional benefit or service. All AMI means is we send much more money to IPL and receive nothing in significance in return. Filed with the Iowa Utilities Board on March 13, 2019, SPU-2018-0007 3/14/2019 State of Iowa Mail - Objection to IPL Response # 1841338       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mail.google.com\">https://mail.google.com</url> /mail/u/1?ik=ac1035eb59&amp;view=pt&amp;amp;search=all&amp;amp;permthid=thread-f%3A1627858432944781928%7Cmsg-f%3A1627858432944... 3/3 ALL IPL's claims of customer benefit are either a) vague, or b) unevidenced, or c) both vague and unevidenced. 7. \"A. All residential customers have received notice of the Board's proceeding in this docket. (p. 5) This notice was profoundly insufficient in its information and scope, because it did not inform customers of any potential risks (in cost, privacy, cyber security, or health), or any reason why anyone might wish to opt out. In fact, IPL's materials supplied misleading materials to prevent customers from finding out the risks and downsides of the AMI system (\u201cFaster outage reporting\" being the most prominent misleading claim (cf. my objection following this objection). A main point I am making is that just informing residential customers of 'NSMA options' is quite insufficient information. It is customary and expected in business and professional circles to be aware of potential risks, and additional expenditure. Did IPL inform its customers that their utility rates will be expected to skyrocket for years, which has happened commonly in most or all locations where AMI has been installed? Did IPL inform its customers how much this new AMI system will cost it, and cost them in rate hikes? 8. \"IPL has consistently worked to reduce costs and ensure that AMI roll-out is completed in a manner that is cost-effective.\" (p. 7) Cost effective for whom? Is a 25% rate hike, on top of prior rate hikes, cost effective for us customers? NO. It is cost effective only for IPL - not for its customers. The strategy that IPL has used is to spend as much money as quickly as possible, and proceed with installation as quickly as possible, and get as much installation done as possible, telling customers and the media and government as little as possible about any potential risks (cost, privacy, cyber security, health) so that when opposition has time to catch up, IPL can say, 'installation is now so far advanced, and it will cost too much to pause or cease.' I would ask the Board to see through this strategy and disregard it, oppose it. It is not in the long term best interest of customers. The cost to IPL customers of temporary disruption of IPL's AMI deployment would be less than the heavy long-term cost of installing AMI, born in ever higher rates.

The state of California is suing the Trump administration for the details behind the decision it made to lower standards on tailpipe emissions for cars and trucks.</p><p>The suit filed by the Golden State demands the Trump administration release the underlying data and analysis it used to determine that it was lawful to weaken the existing emissions standards without threatening increased pollution.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed by the California Air and Resources Board (CARB) against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Both agencies were responsible for jointly establishing the rule change, announced officially in August and called the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicle Rule.</p><p>California officials argue the Trump administration failed to previously provide the details under a Freedom of Information Act request filed in September.</p><p>\"In a stark departure from prior rulemakings, critical information underlying EPA's and NHTSA's analyses was not disclosed,\" CARB's suit read.</p><p>California has long fought against the Trump administration's proposal to weaken the national car emissions standards that were first established under the Obama administration. California has the authority to set its own greenhouse gas rules for cars under the Clean Air Act and a waiver granted by the Obama administration. Thirteen states follow California's standards for cars sold within their borders, representing about 40 percent of the nation's vehicle market.</p><p>California is aligned with the current federal rules, thanks to regulators' previous negotiations.</p><p>Representatives of the state argued that any weakening would threaten California's right to maintain stringent air quality standards under the Clean Air Act. The state has some of the worst air quality in the nation.</p><p>The Trump administration's new rule announced last August proposes to freeze emissions standards at their 2020 levels without further increasing their stringency. The standards determined under the Obama administration would continue to raise emissions standards in steps. The new rule has not yet been finalized or implemented.</p><p>The Trump administration has largely faced criticism that the rules appeared to benefit the fossil fuel industry. Legally the EPA cannot erase a rule without replacing it and it must prove the new regulations still provide public health protections.</p><p>An EPA spokesperson said the agency can't comment on pending litigation but is \"committed to delivering a finalized SAFE rule that both improves vehicle safety, enhances consumer choice, and continues environmental progress.\"</p><p>\u00af Harper Neidig, Owen Daugherty and Miranda Green</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-40HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

As more than 50 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance, billionaires became $637 billion richer. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's wealth has ballooned by 59 percent. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' wealth has increased by 39 percent. Walmart's Walton family has added $25 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big drug company CEOs and their major investors are doing nicely, too. Since the start of the pandemic, Big Pharma has raised prices on 245 prescription drugs, 61 of which are being used to treat COVID-19.</p><p> Apologists say this is the \"free market\" responding to supply and demand \u2014 the barons of Big Tech, online retail and Big Pharma merely providing what consumers desperately need during the pandemic.</p><p> But the market also operates under laws that ban profiteering, price gouging and monopolizing, and that tax excess profits in wartime. Where did these laws go? The Trump administration hasn't enforced them.</p><p> Donald Trump is also ignoring laws that ban trades on insider information. The White House is distributing billions in subsidies and loans to select corporations \u2014 enabling CEOs and boards to load up on stocks and stock options just before deals are announced, then rake in fat profits after stock prices surge.</p><p> Insiders from at least 11 companies have sold shares worth more than $1 billion after such announcements, according to an analysis by the New York Times.</p><p> In late June, a San Francisco company called Vaxart announced that the Trump administration had selected it to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Presto. The value of stock options distributed to company insiders just weeks before increased sixfold, according to the Times. Stock options held by Vaxart's CEO went from $4.3 million to more than $28 million.</p><p> Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., has never brought a vaccine to market, but company insiders have sold some $248 million of shares \u2014 most of them after the company was selected in April to receive federal funding. (Moderna plans to sell its vaccine for profit even though taxpayers have footed its research and development.)</p><p> The most blatant instance involves the venerable old camera and film maker, Kodak. On July 28, Trump announced a $765 million loan to the firm to bring drug production back to the United States. He called it \"one of the most important deals in the history of the U.S. pharmaceutical industries,\" even though Kodak isn't even a pharmaceutical company.</p><p> Before the announcement, Kodak had handed its board of directors 240,000 stock options, and just the day before had given its CEO 1.75 million stock options. After Trump's announcement, Kodak shares shot up more than 2,757 percent. Suddenly, the board's stock options were worth about $4 million, and the CEO's about $50 million.</p><p> Is this sort of insider trading against the law? You bet. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the deal, which is now temporarily on hold.</p><p> But the SEC's co-director of enforcement, Steven Peikin, who had been investigating several of the deals involving the White House and corporate insiders, including Kodak, resigned last week without explanation. Another in the lengthening list of independent regulators and inspectors general forced out by Trump?</p><p> This much is clear: Trump and his Republican enablers won't provide $600 per week to tens of millions of Americans who need the money to survive the pandemic, because Trump and the GOP believe the money undermines incentives to work. Yet Trump has no problem letting billionaires illegally profit off the pandemic. He thinks that as long as they buoy the stock market, they're helping the American economy.</p><p> That's pure rubbish. The stock market is not America. The richest 1 percent of Americans own half the value of all shares of stock held by American households. The richest 10 percent own 92 percent. For years now, stock prices have risen largely because profits have been siphoned from the wages of ordinary workers.</p><p> In the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, stock prices are almost back to where they were before the pandemic began. Big corporations and major investors are doing fine. Billionaires are doing better than ever. But most Americans are sinking fast.</p><p> This isn't just unfair. Much of it is illegal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKUT-375d73f5f9524846d1981f9b614bbf44852a830</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C87D78E2008 NWBKUT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K7-G7W1-DXVP-V1TY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"717\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Daily Herald.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Reich</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the start of the pandemic, American billionaires have been cleaning up. As more than 50 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance, billionaires became $637 billion richer. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's wealth has ballooned by 59 percent. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' wealth has increased by 39 percent. Walmart's Walton family has added $25 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big drug company CEOs and their major investors are doing nicely, too. Since the start of the pandemic, Big Pharma has raised prices on 245 prescription drugs, 61 of which are being used to treat COVID-19.</p><p> Apologists say this is the \"free market\" responding to supply and demand \u2014 the barons of Big Tech, online retail and Big Pharma merely providing what consumers desperately need during the pandemic.</p><p> But the market also operates under laws that ban profiteering, price gouging and monopolizing, and that tax excess profits in wartime. Where did these laws go? The Trump administration hasn't enforced them.</p><p> Donald Trump is also ignoring laws that ban trades on insider information. The White House is distributing billions in subsidies and loans to select corporations \u2014 enabling CEOs and boards to load up on stocks and stock options just before deals are announced, then rake in fat profits after stock prices surge.</p><p> Insiders from at least 11 companies have sold shares worth more than $1 billion after such announcements, according to an analysis by the New York Times.</p><p> In late June, a San Francisco company called Vaxart announced that the Trump administration had selected it to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Presto. The value of stock options distributed to company insiders just weeks before increased sixfold, according to the Times. Stock options held by Vaxart's CEO went from $4.3 million to more than $28 million.</p><p> Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., has never brought a vaccine to market, but company insiders have sold some $248 million of shares \u2014 most of them after the company was selected in April to receive federal funding. (Moderna plans to sell its vaccine for profit even though taxpayers have footed its research and development.)</p><p> The most blatant instance involves the venerable old camera and film maker, Kodak. On July 28, Trump announced a $765 million loan to the firm to bring drug production back to the United States. He called it \"one of the most important deals in the history of the U.S. pharmaceutical industries,\" even though Kodak isn't even a pharmaceutical company.</p><p> Before the announcement, Kodak had handed its board of directors 240,000 stock options, and just the day before had given its CEO 1.75 million stock options. After Trump's announcement, Kodak shares shot up more than 2,757%. Suddenly, the board's stock options were worth about $4 million, and the CEO's about $50 million.</p><p> Is this sort of insider trading against the law? You bet. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the deal, which is now temporarily on hold.</p><p> But the SEC's co-director of enforcement, Steven Peikin, who had been investigating several of the deals involving the White House and corporate insiders, including Kodak, resigned last week without explanation. Another in the lengthening list of independent regulators and inspectors general forced out by Trump?</p><p> This much is clear: Trump and his Republican enablers won't provide $600 per week to tens of millions of Americans who need the money to survive the pandemic, because Trump and the GOP believe the money undermines incentives to work. Yet Trump has no problem letting billionaires illegally profit off the pandemic. He thinks that as long as they buoy the stock market, they're helping the American economy.</p><p> That's pure rubbish. The stock market is not America. The richest 1 percent of Americans own half the value of all shares of stock held by American households. The richest 10 percent own 92 percent. For years now, stock prices have risen largely because profits have been siphoned from the wages of ordinary workers.</p><p> In the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, stock prices are almost back to where they were before the pandemic began. Big corporations and major investors are doing fine. Billionaires are doing better than ever. But most Americans are sinking fast.</p><p> This isn't just unfair. Much of it is illegal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTN-feb8bc2d95f542d25bf736af2dfa9ebd9c8dadc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899B5B304F628 NWBKTN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KH-S891-JBCN-414H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401981</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"716\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Greeneville Sun<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Elizabeth Warren, a presidential hopeful, announced last week she wants to bust up giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America's first Gilded Age began in the late 19th century with a raft of innovations \u2014 railroads, steel production, oil extraction \u2014 but culminated in mammoth trusts run by \"robber barons\" such as J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller and William H. (\"The public be damned!\") Vanderbilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The answer then was to bust up the railroad, oil and steel monopolies.</p><p> We're now in a second Gilded Age \u2014 ushered in by semiconductors, software and the internet \u2014 that has spawned a handful of high-tech behemoths and a new set of barons such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page.</p><p> The answer now is the same: Bust up the monopolies.</p><p> The current effort is bipartisan. At a Senate hearing I testified at last week, arch-conservative Missouri Republican Josh Hawley asked me, rhetorically, \"Is there really any wonder that there is increased pressure for antitrust enforcement activity, for privacy activity when these companies behave in the way that they do?\"</p><p> Hawley added, \"Every day brings some creepy new revelation about these companies' behaviors. Of course the public is going to want there to be action to defend their rights. It's only natural.\"</p><p> Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches now go through Google. Facebook and Google together account for 58 percent of all digital ads (where most ad money goes these days).</p><p> They're also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 percent of Americans receive news online). Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything.</p><p> With such size comes the power to stifle innovation. Amazon won't let any business that sells through it sell any item at a lower price anywhere else. It's even using its control over book sales to give books published by Amazon priority over rival publishers.</p><p>Google uses the world's most widely used search engine to promote its own services and content over those of competitors. Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram killed off two potential rivals.</p><p> Contrary to the conventional view of America as a hotbed of entrepreneurship, the rate at which new job-creating businesses have formed in the United States has been halved since 2004, according to the Census Bureau.</p><p> Such size also confers political power to get whatever these companies and their top executives want.</p><p>Amazon, the richest corporation in America, paid nothing in federal taxes last year. Meanwhile, it's holding an auction to extort billions from states and cities eager to have its second headquarters.</p><p> It also forced Seattle, its home headquarters, to back down on a plan to tax big corporations like itself to pay for homeless shelters for a growing population that can't afford the sky-high rents caused in part by Amazon.</p><p>Facebook withheld evidence of Russian activity on its platform far longer than previously disclosed. When the news came to light, the company employed a political opposition research firm to discredit critics.</p><p> Zuckerberg, who holds the world speed record for falling from one of the most admired figures on the planet to one of the most reviled, just unveiled a plan to \"encrypt\" personal information from all his platforms. The new plan is likely to give Facebook even more comprehensive data about everyone. If you believe it will better guard privacy, you don't remember Zuckerberg's last seven promises to protect privacy.</p><p> The New America Foundation, an influential think tank Google helped fund, fired researchers who were urging antitrust officials to take on the company. And Google has been quietly financing hundreds of professors to write research papers justifying Google's mAarket dominance.</p><p> What to do? Some argue that the tech mammoths should be regulated like utilities or common carriers, but this would put government in the impossible position of policing content and overseeing new products and services.</p><p> A better alternative is to break them up. That way, information would be distributed through a large number of independent channels without a centralized platform giving all content apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach. And more startups could flourish.</p><p> Like the robber barons of the first Gilded Age, those of the second have amassed fortunes that gave them unparalleled influence over politicians and the economy.</p><p> The combined wealth of Zuckerberg ($62.3 billion), Bezos ($131 billion), Brin ($49.8 billion) and Page ($50.8 billion) is larger than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the American population.</p><p> A wealth tax (also proposed by Warren) would help.</p><p> Some of the robber barons of the first Gilded Age were generous philanthropists, as are today's. That didn't excuse the damage they did to America.</p><p> Monopolies aren't good for anyone except for the monopolists. In this new Gilded Age, we need to respond to them as forcefully as we did the first time around. Warren's ideas are a good start.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTN-8992b061fdcafbe25492f81f6962cf37896e9ac0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899B5B304F628 NWBKTN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNG-T9R1-DXVP-V02F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401981</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Greeneville Sun<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

nitf:lede=\"true\">                     TECH giants such as Google and Facebook need to be reined to curb their \"bullying tactics\" and give consumers more choice, an independent inquiry has found.                   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The review was set up in response to concerns raised in recent years about a range of issues ranging from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/5843838/facebook-data-scandal-cambridge-analytica-safe/\">Facebook losing track of users' data</url> to how Google ranks the results of searches.</p><p>Harvard professor Jason Furman, who chaired the UK government review, said the digital sector had created substantial benefits,</p><p>But that had come at the cost of the increasing dominance of a few companies, the former economic adviser to Barack Obama argued.</p><p>\"A few companies are dominating lots of markets and when you don't have a lot of competition you don't have much consumer choice, you don't have as much quality you don't have as much innovation,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/5843838/facebook-data-scandal-cambridge-analytica-safe/\">he told Sky News.</url></p><p>The report said there needed to be quicker and simpler enforcement when a company used \"bullying tactics\".</p><p>Examples of this including abusing its dominant position in the market, by for example giving preferential treatment to companies it owns, or driving out competitors with predatory pricing.</p><p>The review calls for the government to increase competition in the digital sector by setting up a new competition unit and strengthening outdated laws.</p><p>It would have expertise in technology, economics and behavioural science and the legal powers to back it up</p><p>                     How consumers could benefit                   </p><p>The report outlines how consumers could benefit from greater competition.</p><p>It found these proposals could boost the economy by encouraging the development of new platforms to compete with established players.</p><p>Opening markets up would also lead to new services that revolutionise how we use digital apps and programmes.</p><p>For example, an aggregator service could bring together a person's content and data from several social media platforms .</p><p>That would make it easier to browse and message friends and family who use different apps.</p><p>Personal data such as social media contacts would be portable, like a mobile phone number.</p><p>Customers will be able to switch services more easily, taking their custom elsewhere and with greater control over their data.</p><p>The new unit should give people more control over their data by enabling people to switch between platforms more easily.</p><p>It should also develop a code of conduct so the largest digital companies know the competitive rules of the game.</p><p>TechUK, which represents more than 900 tech companies that collectively employ 700,000 people, said the report contained some positive suggestions.</p><p>But it needed further detail on what any proposed code of conduct for big tech might look like.</p><p>It also said there had to be a full assessment of the risks and benefits of opening up data sets.</p><p>\"Bad regulation can be as big a barrier to competition and innovation as monopolistic activities,\" TechUK CEO Julian David said.</p><p>\"The UK must remain a welcoming place for digital business from around the world, and ensure that the UK competition and wider regulatory framework is not in conflict with the other leading digital economies with which we must compete.\"</p><p>We pay for your stories!

Many were able to quickly adapt to their new reality, from transitioning to remote-working arrangements to embracing digital technologies for customer engagement. Such sweeping change-for example, several years of digital acceleration accomplished in a matter of months-has the benefit of freeing organizations to embrace new ways of working. Leaders should not miss their chance to push even further for innovation and pursue bold strategies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Podcast transcript</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">McKinsey senior partners Stephan Binder, Brad Mendelson, and Kurt Strovink have had discussions with hundreds of insurance leaders since the pandemic began. In this virtual roundtable, they weigh in on five strategic factors that could have an outsized impact on innovation in the industry during the recovery and share insights from the Asian, European, and North American markets.</p><h>How the pandemic has forced CEOs to evolve</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kurt Strovink:</emphasis> Broadly, there have been four shifts. I would describe the first one as \"aspire ten times higher.\" It's the idea that CEOs are pushing, appropriately, for broader change in their companies in terms of extent and speed. They are rethinking business models, distribution, and cost innovation.</p><p>Second, the CEO role is focusing more on \"to be\" versus \"to do.\" Executives are focusing on what it means to be an emotional leader in an organization where people need different things than they might have before. One CEO said, \"I feel like my role is more ministerial right now, that I actually have an obligation to my people in a different way than I might have had before.\"</p><p>Third, CEOs are much more open to a broader notion of stakeholder capitalism that includes multiple groups: employees, government, suppliers, boards, shareholders, customers, and communities. That is changing the way they think about their obligations to customers and to society.</p><p>Fourth, it seems CEOs are spending more time with one another across industry boundaries-up to a threefold increase. They're looking for CEOs who are making changes in response to COVID-19 across industries, and they're comparing notes much more. Examples include insurance CEOs learning from the pharmaceuticals sector on analytics and distribution, and from high tech regarding distribution and agility.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephan Binder:</emphasis> The pandemic has forced CEOs to be much more engaged, and to reemphasize top-down leadership. While that's true for every crisis, the characteristics of the current crisis make this shift even more imperative. But this crisis is not just an economic crisis; it's bringing new operating models, changing consumer behaviors, and the acceleration of existing trends.</p><p>Every crisis calls for great leadership. CEOs see things they thought would take five or ten years happening in two years, and that presents an enormously difficult challenge for these large organizations. CEOs who provide strong, engaged leadership can help their organizations get through these situations and be successful in a rapidly changing environment.</p><p>CEOs are also focusing much more on the role of technology in their organizations. This can't be done in a decentralized way; it will require more leadership from the top in terms of defining what the technology journey looks like. The investments are very costly, and the time periods needed to make them can be quite long. There's no margin for error, so very strong leadership is a must. That's difficult because many of these technologies are new, and many CEOs have to figure them out for themselves.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brad Mendelson:</emphasis> As we've talked to CEOs, a number have said they actually feel better connected to their organizations today than they did prior to the pandemic. That has a lot to do with the ease with which they are able to communicate with employees. One CEO mentioned that previously he would have to travel to a location, and it would be a big production when he arrived. Now he can just schedule video calls with various locations and do it more informally, more quickly, and with greater frequency.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>We've heard from employees and management teams that this flexibility is hugely helpful for employees as they look to manage their lives.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Another CEO mentioned that she's able to skip levels much more easily. This ability to connect with multiple levels of the organization, understand what's going on, and feel the pulse of the organization has been surprisingly good, if not better, in this environment, she said.</p><p>Numerous CEOs have said they are going to rethink their travel schedules coming out of the pandemic. They've been amazed at how much time has been freed up in their diary from not living on a plane and in airports. You're never going to fully replace the need to be face to face and the personal connection that's created, but I think you're going to see many CEOs opt for less travel and more remote interactions with their employees.</p><h>Rethinking the operating model</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brad Mendelson:</emphasis> Insurance has historically been a very relationship-oriented business and relationships among employees have been quite important. Think about the interactions between underwriters, product folks, executives, brokers, agents, and bank partners. Insurers are finding they are able to maintain and build those relationships remotely.</p><p>We're also going to see some element of remote work infused into the operating models of almost all insurers. I don't think all employees are going to go completely remote, but we do think there's a real opportunity for many employees to spend part of their week working from home. We've heard from employees and management teams that this flexibility is hugely helpful for employees as they look to manage their lives. It has a neutral, if not positive, impact on productivity, so insurance companies are going to be willing to embrace this model going forward.</p><p>We also see insurers embracing agile practices across the enterprise. Companies have been forced to adopt flatter organizations and faster decision making during this pandemic. Many executives have told us they have been impressed by how quickly their organizations have been able to gather the relevant facts, get the right people together from across the organization, and make decisions. This is what enterprise agile is all about. We've seen increasing interest among insurance carriers around how they make these benefits stick, and how they expand them across their organizations. Agile is the way to do that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephan Binder:</emphasis> Insurance is a little less intense than many industries in terms of constant interactions with customers, so companies have looked to create a different way of interacting with customers that flows all the way through the organization. If you have more digital interaction at the front end that requires simpler products and processes, then it's also much easier to automate tasks on the back end to improve performance.</p><p>The bancassurance model in most places has relied on customers physically visiting a branch and being addressed by a bank employee. This model can't work anymore: in Europe, around 50 percent of branches closed at some point during lockdowns. It's very unclear how many are going to reopen as customers are quite comfortable using digital channels, and banks are under major cost pressure. Similarly, having an insurance agent in your living room is not really a high priority for most people, so we will be in an environment where face-to-face channels will be continuously disrupted because people want to interact remotely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kurt Strovink:</emphasis> To pick up on Stephan's insights, one of the main things insurers can do is to think about digital acceleration in multiple forms. This is playing out with a number of firms leaning into core tech. They're pulling forward many of their investments on the technology side. Things that were happening in a four-year road map are happening in year one now.</p><p>There has also been a lot more focus around agile development in different forms. New ways of working and formal programs are being introduced that are not just in the IT area, but for the whole workforce, and they are digitally infused for the first time.</p><h>Reimagining distribution and new product development</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephan Binder:</emphasis> Some of the polls we conducted on recent webinars asked, \"In which area of the value chain and in which part of the business do you expect the biggest impact?\" The consistent answer has always been, \"In distribution.\" And when we asked, \"Are more people switching channels to direct or do customers want to interact more digitally in a hybrid way within current channels?\" the answer was always \"All of that.\" So there's massive change there. Everyone was expecting to see a strengthening of direct channels, but there will also be a change within channels-through agents, through banks, and how customers interact with insurance.</p><p>In this crisis, people also realize the importance of reliable information. So we see the value of brands is increasing again. Insurance is a business of trust: it's about long-term savings and protection when a crisis hits. Therefore, advice will become even more important, and the way it's delivered is changing quite rapidly. And in distribution, agents and brokers are facing massive change in how they acquire customers, advise them, and support these interactions with the right technology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kurt Strovink:</emphasis> One of the areas of greatest innovation is distribution-around remote wholesaling, remote advisory, opening up new channels, and digitally enabling sales forces. In North America, a lot of firms are looking at their core distribution strategies and how they're going to evolve. A number of companies have a remote model today that's probably 10 or 15 percent of what they do, and they are exploring what it could look like if they take it to 50 percent or more.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>Similarly, having an insurance agent in your living room is not really a high priority for most people, so we will be in an environment where face-to-face channels will be continuously disrupted because people want to interact remotely.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>On the product-development side, there's also a lot of innovation, especially on the life and annuity side and the retirement side. That's particularly true in product categories where the low interest rate environment makes many current products unprofitable. Insurers are thinking about the different ways in which they can construct these product portfolios to account for lower rates. The market dynamics and shaping factors differ by region, putting pressure on distribution.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brad Mendelson:</emphasis> Coming out of the pandemic, product innovation is going to be a big priority. Product development and innovation have not historically been strengths of the industry. It's really been driven more from a financial and actuarial standpoint and influenced by the needs of distribution. Many carriers are now starting to think about how to flip that a bit to make product development driven by the emerging needs of customers and how to get much more systematic about embedding customer insight into product innovation.</p><p>We're encouraging carriers to look at how digital companies manage their products. They have a very sophisticated approach which leverages a product manager, who's really a mini CEO for that product. They use agile product development squads-cross-functional teams to own and develop a product. They use fast iteration cycles and rapid improvement to move the needle on addressing customer needs, and to roll out those products much more quickly than the competition.</p><h>Talent, diversity, and inclusion and making progress during this pandemic</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kurt Strovink:</emphasis> This is an environment where if companies are ambitious, they can be even more aspirational than they might have been before the pandemic in four ways.</p><p>First, companies are beginning to broaden how they think about diversity. I like to say they are putting diversity in their diversity programs. They are including gender, ethnicity, and other kinds of diversity.</p><p>Second, they are identifying the core qualities they want to see exemplified in the cultures of their organizations around openness, equality, fairness, and what it means to belong.</p><p>Third, there's been an explosion of interest in, and strategies around, recruiting. If companies aren't as physically rooted as they once were, they can really think about broadening the addressable market of talent.</p><p>The fourth piece is that this is an opportune time to acquire digital talent. Insurers have less digital talent than other companies, and fintechs are laying people off. There's a  golden opportunity for insurers to attract some talent that may have been living in the fintech world or even in the big tech world-if they are aggressive about acquiring talent and promoting diversity in this environment.</p><p>I also want to reinforce that diversity matters for economics and performance. It's the moral and right thing to do in our societies and companies, and it's also very valuable economically. We've seen a substantial profitability advantage for top-quartile companies on gender diversity versus those in the bottom quartile.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephan Binder:</emphasis> The pandemic has reinforced the importance of digital talent and innovation. Some insurance companies that have younger brokers, agents, and financial advisers who are used to technology were able to switch very quickly. One CEO noted that new business in life insurance was up 80 percent. Another CEO, who said business was down the same amount, was working with a much older personnel pool that had a much harder time getting used to technology.</p><p>Evolving workplaces and work environments use technology a lot more, and that's what the younger generation is looking for. With a much more technology-driven model and more professional lead generation, insurers could attract a very different type of talent.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>I also want to reinforce that diversity matters for economics and performance. It's the moral and right thing to do in our societies and companies, and it's also very valuable economically.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Even before COVID-19, we were talking about how to attract talent with digital experience. In this remote environment, insurers can suddenly tap into talent pools that are not at their doorstep. If a company is in a small town in Germany and all the digital talent is in Berlin, there's no reason they wouldn't be able to work with those people now. If half of your people are joining meetings remotely because they work from home, but they work from home in Berlin or even in different countries, it makes no difference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brad Mendelson:</emphasis> To echo Stephan, insurers that embrace remote work will have greater access to much more diverse talent pools. That should help with being able to attract really deep technical and engineering talent, for example. Every carrier I've talked to says it doesn't have enough technical and software engineers and really wants to figure out how to attract this talent. Flexible working arrangements and remote working will enable carriers to tap into a broader talent set.</p><p>The ability to work remotely can also help with diversity and inclusion. Surveys have shown that a company's ability to attract and retain women, for example, is much higher if it offers flexible working arrangements. This approach could enable insurers to retain employees throughout different life stages, allowing workers to stay engaged with the company and continue to contribute in whatever way fits with their personal lives.</p><h>The rising importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and purpose</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kurt Strovink:</emphasis> Clearly, the importance of climate change is making the \"E\" in ESG move considerably. A number of people are taking the position that climate risk is investment risk. The role of insurance companies within society is about creating the ability for people to take risks, for companies to take risks. That's going to be heavily affected by the risks associated with climate change, valuations, and how quickly those valuations move across different industries and different parts of sectors.</p><p>There's also a big push on \"S\" right now. Companies that have thoughtful sustainability strategies will benefit in multiple other ways. We have evidence that more sustainable companies will achieve higher top-line growth and have a lower cost position. Employees, especially next-generation talent and millennials, care a lot about sustainability strategies. Regulatory relationships and the way those actually progress with governments will also be very important.</p><p>A number of CEOs and management teams are actively improving ESG initiatives for their organizations. This renewed focus stems partly from a desire to deepen the fundamental role of insurance in society and the relevance of the industry in our communities. In the past six months alone, a number of CEOs have stepped forward to push this topic in North America. This is an exciting development for the insurance sector as a whole.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brad Mendelson:</emphasis> ESG is clearly an important issue for the industry, and we're seeing a large increase in the amount of energy, excitement, and impetus around this idea of purpose in the company. This interest is being driven by the top, bottom, and middle of the organization. Employees are demanding, \"What's our purpose? What are we here for, and how can we connect with that on an emotional level to really excite us about our work?\"</p><p>Particularly during crises, insurance is meant to be a stabilizing force or a cushion for segments of society, and that's a quite noble purpose. In the immediate term, we're seeing companies questioning how they deliver on that purpose, asking \"How do we make sure that we are the right cushion for society during the pandemic?\" Now to be honest, insurance wasn't designed for a pandemic, but the industry has responded in various ways to support people in times of need.</p><p>Longer term, carriers are rethinking their purpose across multiple dimensions. How does it deliver on the environment? How does it deliver on the social dimension? Many carriers are making investments in the difference they want to make, and committing to their employees and the outside world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephan Binder:</emphasis> Insurance is an industry that's hundreds of years old. Most insurance companies emerged out of a sense of community and people taking care of each other. People buy insurance because the individual can't always bear the risk and needs a broader community to carry on. That's always been the core function of insurance. You create safety for people, safety for long-term savings, safety that when the house burns down or assets get damaged there is someone there to help put people's lives together again.</p><p>In the current crisis, there is a feeling that somehow the promise of insurance has been eroded. We've seen this whole discussion about business interruption and the pandemic being excluded. There are some very good reasons to exclude pandemics, but not every customer was fully aware of that. That erosion of confidence and trust in the industry's purpose has to be addressed.</p><p>Many insurance companies are now stepping back and rethinking how they can deliver on this promise. It's not easy to rethink how products are designed. It will probably require partnerships with governments to be able to manage some of these risks, similar to what we've seen in areas like natural catastrophes, earthquakes, and terrorism. So there's a much broader theme beyond ESG on purpose and the value of the industry in society. I think that's a very important debate for the industry to have.</p><h>About the authors</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=1074F85320CF4747AE7F9E0B5205BFD1&amp;_z=z\">Stephan Binder</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in McKinsey's Zurich office, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=CD60245C48C6446A91BF3F48522F74B8&amp;_z=z\">Brad Mendelson</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in the Hong Kong office, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=21A13B13386B435CA81BC917FE04CEC7&amp;_z=z\">Kurt Strovink</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in the New York office.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCKNSY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCKNSY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VG-2XW1-JB24-R00G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470364</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3297\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 McKinsey &amp;

Many were able to quickly adapt to their new reality, from transitioning to remote-working arrangements to embracing digital technologies for customer engagement. Such sweeping change-for example, several years of digital acceleration accomplished in a matter of months-has the benefit of freeing organizations to embrace new ways of working. Leaders should not miss their chance to push even further for innovation and pursue bold strategies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Podcast transcript</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">McKinsey senior partners Stephan Binder, Brad Mendelson, and Kurt Strovink have had discussions with hundreds of insurance leaders since the pandemic began. In this virtual roundtable, they weigh in on five strategic factors that could have an outsized impact on innovation in the industry during the recovery and share insights from the Asian, European, and North American markets.</p><h>How the pandemic has forced CEOs to evolve</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kurt Strovink:</emphasis> Broadly, there have been four shifts. I would describe the first one as \"aspire ten times higher.\" It's the idea that CEOs are pushing, appropriately, for broader change in their companies in terms of extent and speed. They are rethinking business models, distribution, and cost innovation.</p><p>Second, the CEO role is focusing more on \"to be\" versus \"to do.\" Executives are focusing on what it means to be an emotional leader in an organization where people need different things than they might have before. One CEO said, \"I feel like my role is more ministerial right now, that I actually have an obligation to my people in a different way than I might have had before.\"</p><p>Third, CEOs are much more open to a broader notion of stakeholder capitalism that includes multiple groups: employees, government, suppliers, boards, shareholders, customers, and communities. That is changing the way they think about their obligations to customers and to society.</p><p>Fourth, it seems CEOs are spending more time with one another across industry boundaries-up to a threefold increase. They're looking for CEOs who are making changes in response to COVID-19 across industries, and they're comparing notes much more. Examples include insurance CEOs learning from the pharmaceuticals sector on analytics and distribution, and from high tech regarding distribution and agility.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephan Binder:</emphasis> The pandemic has forced CEOs to be much more engaged, and to reemphasize top-down leadership. While that's true for every crisis, the characteristics of the current crisis make this shift even more imperative. But this crisis is not just an economic crisis; it's bringing new operating models, changing consumer behaviors, and the acceleration of existing trends.</p><p>Every crisis calls for great leadership. CEOs see things they thought would take five or ten years happening in two years, and that presents an enormously difficult challenge for these large organizations. CEOs who provide strong, engaged leadership can help their organizations get through these situations and be successful in a rapidly changing environment.</p><p>CEOs are also focusing much more on the role of technology in their organizations. This can't be done in a decentralized way; it will require more leadership from the top in terms of defining what the technology journey looks like. The investments are very costly, and the time periods needed to make them can be quite long. There's no margin for error, so very strong leadership is a must. That's difficult because many of these technologies are new, and many CEOs have to figure them out for themselves.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brad Mendelson:</emphasis> As we've talked to CEOs, a number have said they actually feel better connected to their organizations today than they did prior to the pandemic. That has a lot to do with the ease with which they are able to communicate with employees. One CEO mentioned that previously he would have to travel to a location, and it would be a big production when he arrived. Now he can just schedule video calls with various locations and do it more informally, more quickly, and with greater frequency.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>We've heard from employees and management teams that this flexibility is hugely helpful for employees as they look to manage their lives.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Another CEO mentioned that she's able to skip levels much more easily. This ability to connect with multiple levels of the organization, understand what's going on, and feel the pulse of the organization has been surprisingly good, if not better, in this environment, she said.</p><p>Numerous CEOs have said they are going to rethink their travel schedules coming out of the pandemic. They've been amazed at how much time has been freed up in their diary from not living on a plane and in airports. You're never going to fully replace the need to be face to face and the personal connection that's created, but I think you're going to see many CEOs opt for less travel and more remote interactions with their employees.</p><h>Rethinking the operating model</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brad Mendelson:</emphasis> Insurance has historically been a very relationship-oriented business and relationships among employees have been quite important. Think about the interactions between underwriters, product folks, executives, brokers, agents, and bank partners. Insurers are finding they are able to maintain and build those relationships remotely.</p><p>We're also going to see some element of remote work infused into the operating models of almost all insurers. I don't think all employees are going to go completely remote, but we do think there's a real opportunity for many employees to spend part of their week working from home. We've heard from employees and management teams that this flexibility is hugely helpful for employees as they look to manage their lives. It has a neutral, if not positive, impact on productivity, so insurance companies are going to be willing to embrace this model going forward.</p><p>We also see insurers embracing agile practices across the enterprise. Companies have been forced to adopt flatter organizations and faster decision making during this pandemic. Many executives have told us they have been impressed by how quickly their organizations have been able to gather the relevant facts, get the right people together from across the organization, and make decisions. This is what enterprise agile is all about. We've seen increasing interest among insurance carriers around how they make these benefits stick, and how they expand them across their organizations. Agile is the way to do that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephan Binder:</emphasis> Insurance is a little less intense than many industries in terms of constant interactions with customers, so companies have looked to create a different way of interacting with customers that flows all the way through the organization. If you have more digital interaction at the front end that requires simpler products and processes, then it's also much easier to automate tasks on the back end to improve performance.</p><p>The bancassurance model in most places has relied on customers physically visiting a branch and being addressed by a bank employee. This model can't work anymore: in Europe, around 50 percent of branches closed at some point during lockdowns. It's very unclear how many are going to reopen as customers are quite comfortable using digital channels, and banks are under major cost pressure. Similarly, having an insurance agent in your living room is not really a high priority for most people, so we will be in an environment where face-to-face channels will be continuously disrupted because people want to interact remotely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kurt Strovink:</emphasis> To pick up on Stephan's insights, one of the main things insurers can do is to think about digital acceleration in multiple forms. This is playing out with a number of firms leaning into core tech. They're pulling forward many of their investments on the technology side. Things that were happening in a four-year road map are happening in year one now.</p><p>There has also been a lot more focus around agile development in different forms. New ways of working and formal programs are being introduced that are not just in the IT area, but for the whole workforce, and they are digitally infused for the first time.</p><h>Reimagining distribution and new product development</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephan Binder:</emphasis> Some of the polls we conducted on recent webinars asked, \"In which area of the value chain and in which part of the business do you expect the biggest impact?\" The consistent answer has always been, \"In distribution.\" And when we asked, \"Are more people switching channels to direct or do customers want to interact more digitally in a hybrid way within current channels?\" the answer was always \"All of that.\" So there's massive change there. Everyone was expecting to see a strengthening of direct channels, but there will also be a change within channels-through agents, through banks, and how customers interact with insurance.</p><p>In this crisis, people also realize the importance of reliable information. So we see the value of brands is increasing again. Insurance is a business of trust: it's about long-term savings and protection when a crisis hits. Therefore, advice will become even more important, and the way it's delivered is changing quite rapidly. And in distribution, agents and brokers are facing massive change in how they acquire customers, advise them, and support these interactions with the right technology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kurt Strovink:</emphasis> One of the areas of greatest innovation is distribution-around remote wholesaling, remote advisory, opening up new channels, and digitally enabling sales forces. In North America, a lot of firms are looking at their core distribution strategies and how they're going to evolve. A number of companies have a remote model today that's probably 10 or 15 percent of what they do, and they are exploring what it could look like if they take it to 50 percent or more.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>Similarly, having an insurance agent in your living room is not really a high priority for most people, so we will be in an environment where face-to-face channels will be continuously disrupted because people want to interact remotely.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>On the product-development side, there's also a lot of innovation, especially on the life and annuity side and the retirement side. That's particularly true in product categories where the low interest rate environment makes many current products unprofitable. Insurers are thinking about the different ways in which they can construct these product portfolios to account for lower rates. The market dynamics and shaping factors differ by region, putting pressure on distribution.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brad Mendelson:</emphasis> Coming out of the pandemic, product innovation is going to be a big priority. Product development and innovation have not historically been strengths of the industry. It's really been driven more from a financial and actuarial standpoint and influenced by the needs of distribution. Many carriers are now starting to think about how to flip that a bit to make product development driven by the emerging needs of customers and how to get much more systematic about embedding customer insight into product innovation.</p><p>We're encouraging carriers to look at how digital companies manage their products. They have a very sophisticated approach which leverages a product manager, who's really a mini CEO for that product. They use agile product development squads-cross-functional teams to own and develop a product. They use fast iteration cycles and rapid improvement to move the needle on addressing customer needs, and to roll out those products much more quickly than the competition.</p><h>Talent, diversity, and inclusion and making progress during this pandemic</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kurt Strovink:</emphasis> This is an environment where if companies are ambitious, they can be even more aspirational than they might have been before the pandemic in four ways.</p><p>First, companies are beginning to broaden how they think about diversity. I like to say they are putting diversity in their diversity programs. They are including gender, ethnicity, and other kinds of diversity.</p><p>Second, they are identifying the core qualities they want to see exemplified in the cultures of their organizations around openness, equality, fairness, and what it means to belong.</p><p>Third, there's been an explosion of interest in, and strategies around, recruiting. If companies aren't as physically rooted as they once were, they can really think about broadening the addressable market of talent.</p><p>The fourth piece is that this is an opportune time to acquire digital talent. Insurers have less digital talent than other companies, and fintechs are laying people off. There's a  golden opportunity for insurers to attract some talent that may have been living in the fintech world or even in the big tech world-if they are aggressive about acquiring talent and promoting diversity in this environment.</p><p>I also want to reinforce that diversity matters for economics and performance. It's the moral and right thing to do in our societies and companies, and it's also very valuable economically. We've seen a substantial profitability advantage for top-quartile companies on gender diversity versus those in the bottom quartile.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephan Binder:</emphasis> The pandemic has reinforced the importance of digital talent and innovation. Some insurance companies that have younger brokers, agents, and financial advisers who are used to technology were able to switch very quickly. One CEO noted that new business in life insurance was up 80 percent. Another CEO, who said business was down the same amount, was working with a much older personnel pool that had a much harder time getting used to technology.</p><p>Evolving workplaces and work environments use technology a lot more, and that's what the younger generation is looking for. With a much more technology-driven model and more professional lead generation, insurers could attract a very different type of talent.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>I also want to reinforce that diversity matters for economics and performance. It's the moral and right thing to do in our societies and companies, and it's also very valuable economically.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Even before COVID-19, we were talking about how to attract talent with digital experience. In this remote environment, insurers can suddenly tap into talent pools that are not at their doorstep. If a company is in a small town in Germany and all the digital talent is in Berlin, there's no reason they wouldn't be able to work with those people now. If half of your people are joining meetings remotely because they work from home, but they work from home in Berlin or even in different countries, it makes no difference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brad Mendelson:</emphasis> To echo Stephan, insurers that embrace remote work will have greater access to much more diverse talent pools. That should help with being able to attract really deep technical and engineering talent, for example. Every carrier I've talked to says it doesn't have enough technical and software engineers and really wants to figure out how to attract this talent. Flexible working arrangements and remote working will enable carriers to tap into a broader talent set.</p><p>The ability to work remotely can also help with diversity and inclusion. Surveys have shown that a company's ability to attract and retain women, for example, is much higher if it offers flexible working arrangements. This approach could enable insurers to retain employees throughout different life stages, allowing workers to stay engaged with the company and continue to contribute in whatever way fits with their personal lives.</p><h>The rising importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and purpose</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kurt Strovink:</emphasis> Clearly, the importance of climate change is making the \"E\" in ESG move considerably. A number of people are taking the position that climate risk is investment risk. The role of insurance companies within society is about creating the ability for people to take risks, for companies to take risks. That's going to be heavily affected by the risks associated with climate change, valuations, and how quickly those valuations move across different industries and different parts of sectors.</p><p>There's also a big push on \"S\" right now. Companies that have thoughtful sustainability strategies will benefit in multiple other ways. We have evidence that more sustainable companies will achieve higher top-line growth and have a lower cost position. Employees, especially next-generation talent and millennials, care a lot about sustainability strategies. Regulatory relationships and the way those actually progress with governments will also be very important.</p><p>A number of CEOs and management teams are actively improving ESG initiatives for their organizations. This renewed focus stems partly from a desire to deepen the fundamental role of insurance in society and the relevance of the industry in our communities. In the past six months alone, a number of CEOs have stepped forward to push this topic in North America. This is an exciting development for the insurance sector as a whole.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brad Mendelson:</emphasis> ESG is clearly an important issue for the industry, and we're seeing a large increase in the amount of energy, excitement, and impetus around this idea of purpose in the company. This interest is being driven by the top, bottom, and middle of the organization. Employees are demanding, \"What's our purpose? What are we here for, and how can we connect with that on an emotional level to really excite us about our work?\"</p><p>Particularly during crises, insurance is meant to be a stabilizing force or a cushion for segments of society, and that's a quite noble purpose. In the immediate term, we're seeing companies questioning how they deliver on that purpose, asking \"How do we make sure that we are the right cushion for society during the pandemic?\" Now to be honest, insurance wasn't designed for a pandemic, but the industry has responded in various ways to support people in times of need.</p><p>Longer term, carriers are rethinking their purpose across multiple dimensions. How does it deliver on the environment? How does it deliver on the social dimension? Many carriers are making investments in the difference they want to make, and committing to their employees and the outside world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephan Binder:</emphasis> Insurance is an industry that's hundreds of years old. Most insurance companies emerged out of a sense of community and people taking care of each other. People buy insurance because the individual can't always bear the risk and needs a broader community to carry on. That's always been the core function of insurance. You create safety for people, safety for long-term savings, safety that when the house burns down or assets get damaged there is someone there to help put people's lives together again.</p><p>In the current crisis, there is a feeling that somehow the promise of insurance has been eroded. We've seen this whole discussion about business interruption and the pandemic being excluded. There are some very good reasons to exclude pandemics, but not every customer was fully aware of that. That erosion of confidence and trust in the industry's purpose has to be addressed.</p><p>Many insurance companies are now stepping back and rethinking how they can deliver on this promise. It's not easy to rethink how products are designed. It will probably require partnerships with governments to be able to manage some of these risks, similar to what we've seen in areas like natural catastrophes, earthquakes, and terrorism. So there's a much broader theme beyond ESG on purpose and the value of the industry in society. I think that's a very important debate for the industry to have.</p><h>About the authors</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=1074F85320CF4747AE7F9E0B5205BFD1&amp;_z=z\">Stephan Binder</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in McKinsey's Zurich office, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=CD60245C48C6446A91BF3F48522F74B8&amp;_z=z\">Brad Mendelson</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in the Hong Kong office, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=21A13B13386B435CA81BC917FE04CEC7&amp;_z=z\">Kurt Strovink</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in the New York office.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCKNSY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCKNSY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VF-W461-DXH6-F00G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470364</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3297\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 McKinsey &amp;

He travels to Kenya this July for a \"summit\" on entrepreneurship and hopes to show what the United States can do for the continent.</p><p>When he gets there, however, Mr. Obama may be surprised to discover what Africa is already doing for itself. In recent years, its young inventors and entrepreneurs - two-thirds of Africans are under age 35 - have begun to reverse the narrative that the continent is mainly a recipient of foreign technology and a backwater for ideas.</p><p>Kenya, for example, which is the birthplace of Obama's father, has become\u00a0a\u00a0world leader\u00a0in\u00a0mobile\u00a0money\u00a0systems - far ahead of Apple Pay. Across Africa, software such as M-PESA is revolutionizing daily financial life for people with little access to banks or credit. About 1 in 7 Africans now uses a phone for banking, a ratio higher than anywhere in the world.

One Ghanaian start-up, for example, has done well in California with an online tool, Dropifi, that helps businesses manage customer feedback.</p><p>Last year, the African\u00a0Union\u00a0drew up a 10-year strategy to drive technological innovation as a way for the continent to move beyond exports of raw materials. And since 2011, the African\u00a0Innovation\u00a0Foundation has handed out a $100,000 prize each year for the most creative technological idea. Hundreds of young Africans apply from dozens of countries.</p><p>The foundation looks for applicants with a \"deep-seated belief that solutions to\u00a0the continent's challenges do\u00a0not need to be outsourced\" and that Africans can be leaders in a \"new African story.\"</p><p>An innovation expert in South Africa, Mammo Muchie of the Tshwane University of Technology, says Africans must destroy the \"false narrative\" that other races are better at innovation. Africa can build on its special strengths - its large population of young people, its ancient cultural traditions, and its large market for inexpensive solutions to poverty. Innovation, after all, first requires imagination. Reimagining Africa seems to have already begun.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CSM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CSM2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G0D-J5N1-JC8H-M49P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"435\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Christian Science Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>May 14, 2015 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Held on December 14-15 at Sheraton Doha, under the theme 'Reimagining Governance in a Multipolar World', the two-day policy forum featured over 300 speakers and experts from a range of sectors, through plenary sessions, parallel sessions, and roundtables.</p><p><br/>The 19th edition of the forum opened with a welcome address by HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Amir of Qatar, who stressed the importance of building dialogue between nations, forging consensus and creating solutions for collective global issues, especially as the world moves towards multipolarity.<br/>This year's guests included Mahathir Mohammed, prime minister of Malaysia; Paul Kagame, president of Rwanda; Armen Sarkissian, president of Armenia; Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador; Sahle-Work Zewde, president of Ethiopia; Otto Sonnenholzner, vice president of Ecuador; Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda; Hassan Ali Khayre, prime minister of the Federal Republic of Somalia; Fayez El Sarraj, prime minister of the Government of National Accord of Libya; US treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin; Ivanka Trump, advisor to the US President; Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, president of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly; HE Moussa FakiMahamat, chairperson of the African Union Commission and Ban Ki-moon, deputy chair of The Elders, among others.<br/>Call for inclusivity, mutual respect The opening plenary session under the theme 'Reimagining Governance in a Multipolar World' focussed on the need to rethink existing systems of multilateral governance, with a focus on inclusivity and a respect for human rights and the rule of law. Panelists explored the viability of the current order, particularly the limitations of the UN's Security Council, and the need to include more countries in decision-making, especially when they are directly affected. Panelists stressed the importance of sovereignty and collaboration, as well as mutual respect in promulgating international norms and overseeing the global order.<br/>Speakers touched upon the necessity of addressing root causes of conflict, particularly terrorism, which they found was ultimately, due to a lack of inclusivity. Borge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, stated, \"We moved from a Cold War to a hot peace. Trade is not a weapon, it is a key to prosperity if you get it right.\"<br/>The parallel session on the 'Challenges to the International Legal Order and Possibilities for the Future' reviewed how an established global legal order has become an important prerequisite for trade, diplomacy, respect for human rights, and all matter of international relations. Globalisation has brought about fundamental changes in the economy, society and in politics. Panelists spoke of how we are now witnessing the undermining of long-established international laws and practices, with a pivot towards unilateralism, political tension and widespread unrest.<br/>Moderated by Surya P Subedi QC, DCL, OBE, professor of international law, University of Leeds, the roundtable discussed proposals to reform the United Nations. Martin Chungong, secretary-general, Inter-Parliamentary Union, said, \"The international legal order needs to become more inclusive by integrating new stakeholders, and become more effective by taking legally binding resolutions, in addition to becoming more democratic.\"<br/>Karin Landgren, executive director, Security Council Report, added \"The UN Security Council should discuss topics such as cyberthreats, the nuclear arms race and climate change. The General Assembly has the power to make recommendations to the Security Council and it should use that power. Further, Security Council members must abandon the 'Adopt &amp; Forget' approach to the issues and spend time on implementation of the decisions that are taken.\"<br/>The parallel session on US-China Relations and the Future of the Rules Based International System looked at how the current international system was established based on a combination of rules, derived from international law and balance of power. With China's rise, the relative decline of the US, and the increasing rivalry and confrontation between the two, the international balance of power is becoming more fluid and unstable. Prof Stephen Chan OBE, professor of World Politics, SOAS University of London, further expressed Africa's vulnerability as it is caught between the US and China, quoting a proverb 'When the elephants fight, it's the grass that gets flattened'. \"To this end, Africa is a collection of vulnerable states. If Africa has to choose to trade rare metals (that power the WIFI) with the US or China \u2013 where does that leave Africa?\" However as Dr Lu Miao, cofounder and secretary general, Center for China and Globalisation, stated, \"The completion of Phase 1 of the US-China trade deal has stabilised the global market expectation.\"<br/>Prof Danny Quah, dean and Li Ka Shing professor in economics, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said, \"Middle powers and small states should do everything they can to preserve multilateralism and rules-based order, instead of handing over control to the US or any other country. If we are suspicious of big tech monopolies, then we should be suspicious of super power countries too.\"<br/>Conflicts, proxy wars and migration Speaking at a parallel session on Africa's proxy wars, HE Ahmed Isse Awad, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Federal Republic of Somalia, stated, \"Africa is headed towards integration and cooperation, which will result in conflict resolution and economic benefits for the region.\u00bb The session laid great emphasis on the political situation in Somalia and Libya. The panelists highlighted Somalia's progress towards bringing about stability through dialogue. However, they also spoke of how external involvement remains a matter of concern, as it can be an obstacle towards achieving stability as evidenced by Libya. Claudia Gazzini, senior Libya analyst at the International Crisis Group explained how Libya has become a hub for proxy wars, and it can take a very long time before the country could be stable. She further explained that external rather than internal stakeholders are becoming increasingly relevant in the conflict resolution process.<br/>The parallel session on Paths to Peace in Syria looked at how the abrupt departure of US forces from the eastern Turkey-Syria border in October sparked a new round of violence and increased the uncertainty around how these wars end. Shifting alliances appear to favour the Assad regime \u2013 and its Russian and Iranian backers \u2013 as well as Islamic State, while the consequences of the Turkish incursion remain unclear. To this end, Randa Slim, senior fellow and director of Conflict Resolution and Track II Dialogues Programme, Middle East Institute, highlighted how Syrians went into the streets due to the lack of security, not to just fight Bashar AlAssad. Meanwhile, violence continues to kill and wound Syrian civilians. This parallel session explored the conditions of the civil war in Syria and possible paths to peace. Dr Jason Fritz, senior research analyst, Brookings, spoke of the cost of rebuilding Syria, and its difficulty while the Assad regime remains in power. \"We are now entering a global economic slowdown if not recession, which means typical donors will not have the funds to allocate to the reconstruction in Syria.\"<br/>The European Council on Foreign Relations hosted the panel on migration, and the manner in which countries respond to it, both at a country level and globally. With speakers representing Europe and Africa, the discussion addressed misconceptions around migration, and the different types of migrants \u2013 from legal to illegal fleeing conflict or economic hardship. Ambassador Nicola Clase, coordinator for migration and refugee issues, Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, talked of how the number of migrants is at an all-time high, and contrary to popular belief, the majority of migrants move within rather than between countries and continents. HE Miroslav Lajcak, minister of foreign and European affairs, Slovak Republic, stated: \"Migration is a global phenomenon. We can't stop it but must learn to manage it. No single country can manage it alone. Migration is a very divisive issue. Europe has traditionally been very generous, but it couldn't cope with the uncontrolled mass migrations of 2015. This led to division within Europe and was a key issue that we are still struggling to solve.\" The panelists focused on education as a way to equip migrants with the skills necessary to succeed in their adoptive homes without being viewed as a burden, ending with an appeal to emphasise the positive aspects of migration.<br/>Investment trends in emerging markets The parallel session on Investment Trends in Emerging Markets addressed the opportunities and challenges for both global investors and the emerging markets they engage with. The discussions were rooted in the context of a competitive global economy in which economic activity occurs, while placing considerable pressure on emerging countries to improve their incentives and capabilities if they are to achieve these objectives.<br/>Murat Emirda\u011f, CEO of Hepsiburada, commented, \"Developing markets can collaborate to create a sustainable ecosystem. They can combine synergies and capabilities to offer an attractive unique value proposition to investors. To create a successful investment environment in emerging countries, we need to find specific areas or problems you need to solve and focus on addressing them.\"<br/>Shifting policies The second day of the forum commenced with a special session on how global and domestic policy is increasingly affected by financial markets, weather events, terrorism and sudden foreign policy shifts. The capacity of governments to respond to these events with agility and resilience is key to effective governance. Professor Zeger van der Waal from the National University of Singapore, articulated how resilience is forged and mastered in times of crisis. During the session, HE Achim Steiner, administrator at United Nations Development Programme, emphasised the legitimacy of public institutions, stating, \"Public institutions should be capable of holding individuals in power accountable for their unlawful actions\".<br/>The plenary session on World Disorder: Meeting Emerging Global Security Challenges with Innovative Solutions explored the security threats facing the world, from the collapse of traditional modes of conflict \u2013 from inter-state to intra-state, the changing nature of traditional alliances, to shifts in political and economic norms, and threats and opportunities arising from the digital age. HE Khalid bin Mohamed Al Attiyah, deputy prime minister and minister of state for defense affairs, Qatar, said, \"The old method of creating external enemies for internal cohesion is over.\" Panelists focused on the need for dialogue and cooperation, as well as an international system of rules to control any military arms race, articulated by HE Dr Hulusi Akar, minister for defense, Turkey \"from a humanitarian point of view, it's important to put into place rules and regulations to control the military arms race, otherwise it'll cause a problem not just for one or two countries, but for the world.\"<br/>The parallel session on 'Business Leadership for Positive Impact' highlighted an upcoming era in finance where profit at any cost is no longer socially acceptable, while social impact and environment protection investment opportunities continue to grow. On a global level, the launch of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement illustrate how investors can act as innovators. However, there are challenges and the world needs a clearer picture of standards and definitions. Commenting on the discussion, Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al Mahmoud, CEO, Qatar Investment Authority, said, \"As many as 44 per cent of our infrastructure projects had zero emissions, showing our commitment to positive impact. This is a serious issue we are trying to solve and have been investing in companies that prioritize this field.\" He continued, \"We signed a MoU with Volkswagen for R&amp;D using autonomies electric cars for public transportation here in Qatar.\"<br/>The session on MENA Workforce Development reviewed political and socioeconomic developments in the MENA region and how they have slowed economic growth, decreased the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI), constrained local investment and led to increased unemployment. According to the World Bank, the youth unemployment rate in the MENA region is among the highest in the world, with women's labor force participation among the lowest. Roya Mahboob, CEO, Digital Citizen Fund in Afghanistan said, \"We need more women role models in different areas like technology and engineering to prove that women are capable of achieving anything, if they get the right opportunity.\" The session introduced The Wilson Center's new report, \"Ready for Work: An Analysis of Workforce Asymmetries in the Middle East and North Africa,\" and addressed questions regarding the skills mismatch, the education system, technical and vocational training, the private sector, the role of entrepreneurship and the problem of endemically low female labour force participation.<br/>Climate change The session on The Adaptation Challenge: New Approaches to Climate Change Resilience highlighted that despite efforts to date, climate change is already a reality. Increasingly, attention is turning to how the world can adapt to a new paradigm of a hotter planet with more extreme weather conditions. HE Fahad Al Attiya, Ambassador and Chairman, Qatar National Food Security Programme posited: \"The knowledge and expertise to tackle climate change exist \u2013 what we need is wisdom. There are incumbent structures and industries that want business to continue as usual, as long as their profit is not impacted. The question becomes \u2013 should we continue to make it profitable for them?\" The panel further explored how the public and private sectors can better collaborate and implement innovative solutions to address current climate challenges.<br/>The parallel session on The Geopolitical Contest for Tech Leadership in the Asian Century addressed how interdependence has shaped the global community. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, supply chains and innovation systems have been exported to developing communities, creating symbiotic economic relationships. In many ways, this guaranteed peace and security. With the ubiquity of technology and a more multilateral approach, the 21st century is being defined entirely differently. Rachel Rizzo, adjunct fellow, Transatlantic Security Programme, Centre for a New American Security, said: \"We are going towards a world where the internet is going to be fragmented and will look different in different places. You want to have rules of the road that people can follow\u2026 We're building the airplane as we're flying in it\". The session's moderator, Samir Saran, president, Observer Research Foundation, concluded by stating, \"The mobile in your hand allows you to join the debate at any time. It\u203as our job as users to continue to defy states that try to censor us.\"<br/>US Global Leadership in 2020 The session on US Global Leadership in 2020 and Beyond examined the global order in the decades following World War II, when the United States enjoyed a period of unprecedented global leadership. Its hegemony was rooted in economic power and military might, and America was a hub of technological innovation, and an imperfect but recognised beacon of freedom for many around the world. Panelists discussed the current position of US in the world order, with all panelists agreeing with Thomas Bossert, chief strategy officer, Trinity Cyber, that \"there needs to be an avenue for redress in international arena\". Amy Pope, associate fellow, Chatham House, focussed on the importance of multipolarity, finding that \"another four years of President Trump [would be] a threat to multipolarity. People are forgetting why we needed those institutions in the first place\". However, she suggested that the current American administration is forcing a re-examining of the existing global order, which has not been adapted to deal with newer geo-political realities.<br/>The final plenary session on The United Nations at 75: A Time for Renewal and Innovation reviewed how the international institutions built since 1945 to help nations manage and resolve their problems peacefully \u2013 and together \u2013 are being weakened to a degree not seen since their founding. Ibrahim Gambari, chairman, Savannah Center for Diplomacy, stated, \"We need to build a coalition of the willing but also the unwilling. We must all fight back against this attack on multilateralism.\" In the face of these global challenges there are numerous divisions and discrepancies within and across societies along racial, gender, socioeconomic, and other lines, with the debate highlighting how to engage and explore novel approaches to improve the architecture of global governance. HE Ban Ki-moon, deputy chair, The Elders, former secretary-general, United Nations, found that with the plethora of issues confronting societies, \"there is not a single country, however powerful or resourceful, that can do it alone\". Rosemary DiCarlo, under secretary-general for political affairs, UN, conceded that the UN does not communicate its successes or efforts well enough, saying \"We need to do a much better job at telling our story. We need to showcase our efforts behind the scenes. We're not just working in Syria, Yemen and Somalia, we are also preventing conflicts.\"<br/>In addition to the many networking opportunities on site and side meetings, the forum hosted more than 30 signings and individual MoUs and an international media presence of more than 200 people from around the globe. A Viewpoint series also interviewed more than 40 attendees and speakers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OER-167545066</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OER2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7G-0BM1-JDJN-61G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399265</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3025\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 United Press &amp; Publishing LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Corporate and institutional clients are changing their business models, inspired by \"heightened levels of enablement\" in other aspects of their business and expecting payments to follow suit, says David Scola, acting chief executive, Americas and UK region for SWIFT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Paul Camp, CEO of treasury services at Bank of New York Mellon agrees. He says all of his bank's clients are digitising, a process that involves a change of business model. \"When clients change their business models, it's a deep engagement that's required with those clients to make them successful. And the payments, the receivables, the liquidity that we provide to our clients is a way to enable them on that digital journey.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COMPETITORS AND PARTNERS Amid this change there are opportunities for non-bank players. James Clancy, head of financial institutions - US, Transfermate Global Payments, says that while the banks and SWIFT are at the forefront of driving change, the payments space is bifurcated and has relatively low barriers to entry. The changing requirements of clients \"do not need only to be met by the banks\", he says. \"Fintech providers, who are operational in niche markets, can lead the transformation, because it's relatively inexpensive.\"</p><p>Such entities create \"a very healthy tension in the business and competition\", says Greg Murray, MD, head of payments and receivables for Santander in the US. \"It puts banks in the position where we do have to recognise how we can better serve our clients.\" Customer needs vary, however. Those used to a mobile or online experience seek simplicity, ease of use and better integration in terms of the end-toend process. This applies to both consumer and B2B payments. \"Fintechs can be competitors and partners. It's better for everyone; because by creating this tension, it ultimately improves the experience for our clients.\"</p><p>Clancy believes that while fintechs and big techs such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, are disrupting the payments space, it is hard to imagine that banks will be dislodged from the sector. \"They own the customer relationship in a unique way that a fintech never will.\" Where they can add value, he says, is enabling banks to get closer to offering a seamless and frictionless payments experience to their customers. \"You don't need to be a Google to provide that added value to the bank space; you can be a fintech partnering with a bank to allow them to offer the product and better user experience.\"</p><p>THE BANK'S ROLE Murray agrees that banks have a unique relationship with clients. While big techs have done \"a very good job\" at creating superior user experiences, banks still hold an edge in financial security and the relationship. \"I do believe that it's up to us as banks to do a better job for our clients, to leverage that relationship and fine-tune how we manage and provide the user experience.\"</p><p>This will differ depending on the client; for retail clients \"less is more\", as they require simple solutions. Clients that are in the corporate or commercial banking space need data to help them manage their flows. Banks can do more here, by improving their collaboration with the fintechs that have been successful in integrating data between marketplaces and payment loads, for example.</p><p>Many of the big tech firms are on the SWIFT network, says Scola, and work with the organisation in a number of capacities. \"The relationship between banking and the big tech firms has been hugely positive and has brought new dynamics to the traditional banking environment, from how our clients expect to work with us.\"</p><p>Camp says banks can learn from the big techs, which have remained very focused on the client experience and \"making the complex simple\". Like Scola, he believes the involvement of big techs will ultimately benefit banks and their clients.</p><p>At Santander, the retail banking experi-ence has driven much of what is now being offered in the commercial and corporate spaces. \"Ultimately every retail customer works for a company and takes those expectations with them as they head off to work. In certain countries, we are already seeing some of our app-based services that were aimed initially at the retail sector being adopted by corporates,\" says Murray. The key will be to ensure that services are architected to support the corporate market, which will involve how much data is provided, he adds.</p><p>Data is also the key to removing friction in payments. Murray argues that the payments rails work well, but friction comes from missing or erroneous data. He says SWIFT gpi, the cooperative's new, fast and trackable crossborder payment service, is the result of banks and SWIFT advocating for better data up front, which provides transparency throughout the payment lifecycle.</p><p>Scola says the \"base line\" of ensuring that gpi delivers transparency of all payments through the SWIFT network has been achieved - more than $300 billion USD is sent everyday over gpi. The next phase of the project will involve pre-validation of information and case resolution when payments are held up in the system. \"The reduction of friction keeps us hyper-focused on the next evolution of gpi.\" SWIFT gpi for Corporates, which allows corporates to directly access gpi has been developed and big tech companies, says Scola, have been keen to embed it in their systems.</p><p>Santander's Murray says the pre-validation aspect of gpi is important. \"If you look at the success that a lot of the other fintechs have achieved it's because they have taken that notion of pre-validation very, very seriously.\" It is something the banking space does not do well, asking clients for their account identifier information, such as BIC and IBAN codes, every time they log on and often in a different form.</p><p>SWIFT's move to gpi is a \"beautiful thing\", says Clancy, but he points out that in the lowvalue payment space, fintechs have been providing the same value \"for several years now\".</p><p>Camp says banks are very much focused on enabling the success of their clients and gpi is a tool to get them there, but it's not the only one. Some solutions will be sourced via SWIFT, but some will be from other innovative technologies.</p><p>SWIFT gpi has enabled the cooperative to create a real-time payments platform for cross-border payments in China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Australia, with payments transacted within about eight seconds. Scola points out that this has been created leveraging existing rails and taking the capabilities that local banks have in their connections to realtime payment schemes in their countries. He believes real-time cross-border payments will be a reality in the next decade.</p><p>EMPOWERING THE CUSTOMER Customers are adopting real-time payments at different rates, says Camp, depending on what type of organisation they are, what segments they serve and where they are based. The same can be said about API technology. This means the bank has to invest in APIs and other innovative technologies while supporting clients that may not yet be at that stage. \"The more innovative clients are driving us much harder and faster, and they are great clients, because they make us a better bank. And we are also supporting our clients who are less advanced in terms of technology adoption.\"</p><p>Santander's Murray says his bank has similar challenges. \"APIs are critical to being able to roll out services quickly. I don't personally believe that APIs are something a customer necessarily knows they are using. It's going to be part of the experience overall, but we see that as a quicker way to get to market.\"</p><p>SWIFT is developing API standards because without them, challenges can arise, says Scola. \"Envision a future where a number of bilateral host-to-host APIs are adopted that don't necessarily interoperate with each other. That leads to more fragmentation in the market and I think that doesn't benefit anybody, either in the banking community or among clients.\"</p><p>SWIFT has taken a threefold approach to the challenge, developing a standard, revealing SWIFT solutions and data to APIs and working with clients to host new API standards. A sandbox is testing a number of proofs of concept. In an ideal world, a virtuous circle will exist whereby the payments industry may \"disappear more into the background\", says Camp. Looking forward, bank customers - retail, corporate or FIs - will have the ability to move and receive money instantaneously on a 24x7 basis in whatever currency they choose with full transparency around FX rates and margins. A much more efficient payment system that is interconnected and allows the frictionless movement of money will help economic growth, he adds. Despite being background players, banks will be able to embed such functionality into their customer journeys, empowering them to be successful in their business models.</p><p>Sponsored by:</p><p>\"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BANKING AND THE BIG TECH FIRMS HAS BEEN HUGELY POSITIVE AND HAS BROUGHT NEW DYNAMICS TO THE TRADITIONAL BANKING ENVIRONMENT\" DAVID SCOLA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>David Scola, acting chief executive, Americas &amp;

By stifling ad competition, the U.K. regulators found, the companies drive up pricing. That leads to higher costs for goods and services, particularly hotels, flights, books and other products advertised heavily online.</p><p>British regulators called for a new agency to regulate competition in digital advertising.</p><p>That's a useful template for U.S. authorities who have been scrutinizing digital giants but have yet to produce a comparable analysis or recommendations.</p><p>The House judiciary antitrust subcommittee is holding important hearings on this issue, including a grilling of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other tech leaders scheduled for July 27. It could release a report and proposals later this summer.</p><p>\"We are trying to reassert our role as Congress because there hasn't been the kind of enforcement there needs to be,\" U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Seattle Democrat on the subcommittee, told this editorial board.</p><p>In parallel, the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an antitrust inquiry into digital platforms last year. It could begin a case against Google this summer, according to the Wall Street Journal. It also reported that state attorneys general could file suit against the company, perhaps in the fall.</p><p>Enforcement is welcome, but broader regulation is still necessary.</p><p>The House committee should offer ways to strengthen and update antitrust laws to rein in digital gatekeepers. It should also address how Google and Facebook control the flow of advertising dollars and access to news content, without compensating news organizations at fair market rates.</p><p>\"In any game you need a referee,\" said Gene Kimmelman, a former DOJ antitrust chief counsel advocating for creation of a new digital market regulator, similar to the U.K. proposal.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission have whistles. But the agencies are politicized and have done little to check mergers and business practices that increased platforms'dominance and weakened consumer choice and privacy.</p><p>Experts at a dedicated, digital regulator could monitor and report on business practices and participate in merger reviews.</p><p>Meanwhile, the triple storm of a pandemic, recession and election vulnerable to misinformation campaigns is highlighting the need for a sustainable diversity of media.</p><p>Americans need more information and local reporting during crises and elections.</p><p>Yet platforms'dominance of the ad market is snuffing out much of the independent journalism in the United States. Newspaper circulation in 2018 fell to the lowest level since 1940, after a decade in which newspaper advertising fell 62 per cent, according to Pew Research.</p><p>During that decade, Facebook and Google evolved from pseudo neutral platforms into dominant information arbiters.</p><p>Social-media sites are now news sources for more than half of Americans. Yet they are failing to live up to this responsibility by not following rules that apply to traditional news organizations, significantly investing in reporting or fairly compensating publishers for content.</p><p>They make billions hoovering news content and advertising as much of the country is now left with little to no local news reporting to inform voters, speak truth to power and build shared community knowledge.</p><p>These giants also allow misinformation to proliferate on their sites and poison public discourse, in part by taking advantage of outdated liability protections written to help early web ventures.</p><p>Their unchecked power and weak curation were exploited by Russia in an information warfare campaign attacking U.S. democracy and sowing division during the 2016 election. It's expected to be happening again this year.</p><p>As documented by the DOJ's Mueller investigation, Russia used social-media accounts and advertising to undermine the U.S. electoral system starting in 2014. In 2016, it shifted to a targeted operation favouring presidential candidate Donald Trump and disparaging Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Battling misinformation and bias will continue to be a challenge. Market pressure to improve, as applied recently by major brands pulling Facebook ads, will help.</p><p>Another remedy is to improve education, particularly civics, so Americans are better prepared to defend themselves against political manipulation.</p><p>Regulators must also bring more oversight, transparency, interoperability and user control of personal information to digital platforms. Promising suggestions are being made by regulators abroad, and by U.S. experts and public-interest organizations.</p><p>More assertive antitrust enforcement, to nurture competition in the digital marketplace, must be the foundation of this work.</p><p>That would give advertisers - mostly small businesses - and news consumers more choices and agency.</p><p>Competition would foster innovation and improvement at the regulated companies. It would also strengthen society and democracy, by helping sustain local news organizations that invest in original reporting and accountability journalism.</p><p>It's past time to curb digital giants'excessive power in the U.S.</p><p>The Seattle Times !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

They are perceived as establishing monopolistic positions and wreaking havoc in various sectors, while dodging rules followed by established brick-and-mortar competitors. Digital communication, hailed for its role in facilitating the protests of the Arab Spring, has since seen use as a tool of control by oppressive regimes, causing citizens to reconsider its risks and hidden costs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even in the business world, there is a growing wariness of companies that have until now been viewed with awe, such as the \"Four Horsemen of Tech\" (Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google). At the World Economic Forum at Davos in January, George Soros lambasted social media giants as \"obstacles to innovation\" that threaten \"totalitarian control.\" \"The internet monopolies have neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions,\" he said. \"That turns them into a menace and it falls to the regulatory authorities to protect society against them.\"</p><p>Worldwide, a growing clamor from citizens is demanding tougher regulation. The EU won praise for fining Google(EURO)2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) in 2017 for abusing its dominance as a search engine by favoring its own shopping service. (Googlehas appealed.) In the US, concerns over Russian ads on Facebook during the presidential race (as well as politically damaging revelations on WikiLeaks) have brought heightened scrutiny from lawmakers to the companies that create and distribute information of all sorts-despite a political climate otherwise favorable to a more laissez-faire approach. The Department of Justice sued to stop the AT&amp;T/Time Warner merger, and has threatened to fight the Disney-Fox deal too. At issue are all sorts of companies involved in creating and distributing content, aggregating consumers in the process.</p><p>\"The issue of regulation is absolutely coming, and it's coming to the US,\" says Geoffrey Parker, director of the Master of Engineering Management program at Dartmouth and research fellow at MIT's Initiative for the Digital Economy. The US Congressional Antitrust Caucus has announced plans to \"modernize\" antitrust law, and there is new antitrust bills have been introduced in the Senate as well-with more being drafted.</p><p>Just this past October, the European Commission adopted an initiative focused on platform-to-business (P2B) interactions. The initiative points to a handful of harmful trade practices that online platforms currently do, or possibly could, engage in. These include changing terms and conditions unilaterally; deleting specific items or entire merchant accounts unilaterally and without warning; promoting platform-owned products and services ahead of others; and lacking transparency in many practices, particularly around search rankings and advertising. The power these platforms have over business everywhere means the \"P2B\" abbreviation, far less common than \"B2C\" (business to consumer) or \"B2B\" (business to business) is likely to gain traction this year.</p><p>On the consumer side, new EU rules on control of personal data will come into effect May 25 this year in the General Data Protection Regulation. European citizens will have new rights to view, limit and delete information collected by companies-regardless of the company's home country. Data, a valuable modern currency that consumers trade for access to digital tools, holds a greater place in competitive discussions than ever before. (See sidebar.)</p><p>China, a digital leader in Asia, occupies an unusual position with respect to antitrust, as it works to enact market-oriented reforms smoothly while racing ahead with technology development. \"It has been incredible. In just a few years they went from cash to primarily electronic payments. It seemingly happened overnight,\" says Parker. \"In many ways they are further ahead than anyone else in the world-much less concerned over privacy, even less than the US. The government is heavily involved, partly through using these systems to observe and collect data on the population. In some ways they are less regulated than the US, and in some ways more, because the government is forcing access to the data.\"</p><p>Yet China, too, has been engaged in a long process of studying antitrust issues, with its major antitrust law, the 10-year-old Anti-Monopoly Law, up for amendment for the first time. From fall 2016 through much of last year, Chinese officials shared plans at antitrust conferences and in private meetings around the globe, with officials such as the senior deputy commissioner for the Canada Competition Bureau as well as business leaders such as Procter &amp; Gamble's chief counsel, to establish a \"fair competition review system\" (FCRS). The FCRS is \"designed to regulate the potential abuse of administrative power by government agencies that could result in anticompetitive effect and will hold local-level government officials accountable for such abuse,\" according to attorneys at Hong Kong-based Mayer Brown JSM.</p><h>NETWORK EFFECTS</h><p>The economy of the last century is characterized by the emergence of large and powerful groups, especially in the US where market power is often seen as a corollary of a better product, service or technology. \"The source of the market power is different. Historically, market power came from scale economy, with lower costs from being larger, driving market power in manufacturing,\" says Joseph Harrington, professor of business economics and public policy at the Wharton School. According to Harrington, whose current research focuses on collusion and cartels, current US laws are adequate to deal with that traditional form of monopolistic power.</p><p>Yet it's a new world. \"They have a very powerful source of market power that is hard to dismantle or is hard to penetrate for competitors,\" Harrington notes, \"and that is the network effect. This means that people are on Facebook because everyone else is on Facebook. If a superior social network came along, it would be very hard for it to compete because it does not have the same base of people.\"</p><p>One counterargument is that competition is larger than the Web; there's always someone, somewhere who can create something better. Facebook made just that point in response to the decision by Germany's independent competition authority, Bundeskartellamt, to investigate whether Facebook has abused its dominant position in social networks. Facebook denied that it is dominant, adding \"We're just one part of how people interact, and we must constantly innovate to ensure we're meeting people's expectations. ... If we fail, people will go elsewhere-as history has shown with other technology services over the years.\"</p><p>Critics of this position say that's unrealistic, given the sheer size these groups have reached. \"Practically speaking, the market is not open,\" says Lina Khan, director of legal policy at the Open Markets Institute in Washington. \"If you think about the self-reinforcing advantages of data, and the amount of data that Googlehas, there is no viable way you could have another search engine compete.\"</p><p>Governments react slowly, but they are reacting. In the meantime, infotech companies may realize that more transparency will ultimately help them thrive. \"The 2016 presidential election was a real wake-up call for Silicon Valley,\" says Eric Goldman, who was an Internet lawyer in the Valley before becoming professor of law and co-director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University. \"Our tools are supposedly used for the common good, but this is not always true; and it is up to us as a community to find out how to fix it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 1, No Caption</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Parker, Dartmouth:</emphasis> The issue of regulation is absolutely coming, and it's coming to the US.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 3, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goldman, High-Tech Law Institute:</emphasis> The 2016 presidential election was a real wake-up call for Silicon Valley.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GFMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GFMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5P-1X11-JC8V-43MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297150</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Global Finance Media, Inc.

Good Thursday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, November 29th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets pulling back this morning after a powerful rally yesterday.  We're  right down 70 points on the Dow Industrials right now, near the lows once  again this morning.  Nasdaq down 46 points.  That's two-thirds of 1  percent, after a major rally in stocks yesterday.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500  are now in positive territory for the month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks rallying 617 points on the Dow, 2.5 percent higher at the close  yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up two and a third percent.  The Nasdaq -- check  that out -- 208 points higher, that's almost 3 percent higher.</p><p>Why the rally?  These comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  We know that moving too fast would  risk shortening the expansion.  We also know that moving too slowly,  keeping interest rates too low for too long, could risk other distortions  in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Follow-through in Europe this morning.  the FT 100 is up a half  a percent, 33 points higher.  The CAC 40 in Paris is up a half of a  percent, 25 points higher.  And the DAX index up 12 points, fractional gain  there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances -- take a look.  Best performer was  in Japan.  Nikkei average up a third of a percent.</p><p>We are watching the price of oil today -- take a look.  Crude oil fighting  to hold a $50 a barrel level.  It briefly fell below that for the first  time in over a year just a few minutes ago.  Oil now at $50.02 a barrel,  down one-half of 1 percent.</p><p>Reining in big technology -- Facebook under fire after a new report says it  was considering charging companies for user data.</p><p>Plus Google faces backlash for its project in China from its own employees.  </p><p>All those stories coming up.</p><p>Facebook shares down another 1 percent his morning.  Alphabet, parent of  Google, down a half of a percent -- worries about regulation to come.</p><p>Ford Motor meanwhile is shifting gears.  The automaker reworking its plans  to ramp-up SUV and pickup truck production.  It will not be cutting jobs.  </p><p>A major change for Dick's Sporting Goods to report.  The retailer  considering removing all hunting gear from its store shelves. </p><p>And replacing Alexa with Big Mouth Billy Bass -- how you can get the  talking fish to handle your usual Alexa request.  Wait until you see this,  coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down -- Fox Business Networks' Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street  Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and Rosecliff CEO  and managing partner Mike Murphy.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning.   Happy to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James -- I want to ask you about your op-ed that you wrote  yesterday.  The title was \"Tax cut working better than advertised\".</p><p>What I liked about this piece you wrote is you go into business spending.   And why we haven't seen -- and we were talking about this yesterday, Dagen  and me -- and why we haven't seen a bigger move in companies putting money  to work.  And I argued they are but it's in technology.  We've moved from  an industrial society to a technological society.  So maybe the numbers  don't tell the whole story.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well they do -- and they do tell part of the story.  Obviously  we've seen that increase in business investment this year.  We've seen  productivity going up which is good, allows for higher wages.</p><p>But, yes, that third quarter report on GDP it showed kind of softer than  expected business investment.  We kind of wondered why.  Larry Lindsey, a  former Bush advisor, says the time will -- hold on, I think maybe the  investment numbers are going to get revised upwards.  And that's just  exactly what happened yesterday.</p><p>So better investment, more business spending on equipment, a lot of it  technology to make employees more productive as we saw in yesterday's  report.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It went from four-tenths of a  percent increase to north of 3 percent, right, yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So again, it's not the blowout of the first and second  quarters but overall this year very strong and right on track with what the  corporate tax rate cut enacted in December 2017 was intended to do --  increase investment in the United States.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And for those people who are saying it hasn't done enough, isn't  it hard to go back and say where we would be without the tax cut or what  the economy would look like without the tax cut?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  We saw it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We might look like Germany.  Germany's economy is contracting,  and so is Japan's.  So we might not be in a recession.  But if we hadn't  had that tax cut, we would be -- well, we saw it during the Obama  administration, is that what you were going to say that we never got 3  percent growth in any one calendar year.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, as soon as the tax cut plan hit earlier this  year when it first went into effect, we did see business spending shoot up.   I mean, people -- businesses were reacting to that and then it slowed down,  maybe the worry over tariffs.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I think that is a concern, certainly.  I think that's why we're  looking -- if they get something resolved this weekend, I think you would  expect some kind of market pop in response.</p><p>But the point is still very strong investment.  Even if it's not quite at  the pace of that initial burst right after the passage of the law,  basically right on target and still in that 3 percent overall economic  growth mode which was the point of the tax reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check out James' op-ed in the \"Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Coming up this morning, joining this conversation, my exclusive interview  with the chairman of UBS.  Axel Weber is here.  We will also speak with  Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis.  We're talking about this market  activity this year with John and Axel has a lot to stay in terms of the  global story.  Rock Group co-founder and Patron Spirits co-found John Paul  Dejoria is here as well.  Plus Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy.  Also  Senate-Elect Marsha Blackburn joining us as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off here with this top story -- turmoil for big tech.  The  \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting Facebook considered charging companies  access for users' data.  This is from internal e-mails viewed by the  \"Journal\".</p><p>Facebook not the only technology company facing trouble and potential  regulation.  Google is facing employee backlash over its project Dragonfly  which would be a censored search engine for China.  Really interesting to  note that Google walked away from doing business with the Pentagon and  instead chose to do business with China where they have to censor their  search engine.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Tennessee Congresswoman and  Senator-Elect Marsha Blackburn.  Senator-Elect -- congratulations to you.   Good to see you.</p><p>SENATOR-ELECT MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Thank you, Maria.  Nice to  see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  You've been  working a lot on this potential, I don't know if you want to call it  regulatory response or what is the response to this in terms of technology?   What do you want to see happen within big tech?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  What I would like to see happen is passage of the Browser Act  which is privacy regulations.  It puts one -- one template in place for the  entire ecosystem, whether it is your Internet service provider, which is  your ISP or it is one of the edge providers which is Facebook, Google,  Twitter, those companies, big tech.</p><p>And Maria -- they have resisted this.  What they wanted was to put all of  the privacy regulation on the ISPs.  That would have been the 2015 rules  that the Obama administration had wanted to put in place.  But it needs to  be one set of rules for the ecosystem.</p><p>And then you get into issues past that and the privacy regulations, you get  into the other issues which have to do with the operating systems, which is  the Google operating system which you can turn the thing off, pull the sim  card, these devices still are tracking you.  And yes, that is an invasion  of your privacy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that the big issue?  Characterize what the problem is  around big tech.  They're tracking us all the time and we don't know it.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there's also an issue that you and your colleagues have  pointed out about censoring conservative conversation.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  That is right.  And those are two separate issues.</p><p>Now when it comes to privacy, here is what we need to do.  We need to make  certain that the consumer, the individual that is looking at that computer  screen and conducting much of their transactional life online, that they  have the ability to say to these different systems, whether it is Google or  Facebook or whomever on the edge, no, you do not have access to my  sensitive data and I have the right to block you from using that.</p><p>And when it comes to non-sensitive data, like your search history that you  can say I am opting out and reserving to myself the individual the right to  protect my virtual self online; and you, big tech, cannot use my search  data and then turn around and sell that to an advertiser or somebody.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Senator-Elect -- James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street  Journal\".</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I hate to raise a discouraging word, because I don't know many  people who are more excited about your election than I am.  I'm not going  to knock your predecessor at this moment, but in this particular issue, do  you worry about creating a new Internet regulator in Washington?  Do you  worry about big companies like Facebook benefiting from heavy regulation  more than their potential competitors will, who may have a tougher time  complying with this kind of regulation?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.  Not at all -- James.  That is why I think it's important  that we do light touch privacy standards and put that in place.</p><p>And we have a privacy regulator in the marketplace now.  It's called the  Federal Trade Commission, the FTC.  And having that light touch regulation  in place where they are able to say, ok, the individual reserves their  privacy.  It is the same thing that has happened in the physical space, if  you will.</p><p>And for decades, different retailers and merchants and individuals you  conduct transactions with have had affinity programs, loyalty programs.   And what you want to do is replicate that in the virtual space and allow  the individual to decide what information they want to share and what they  want to hold private.</p><p>As it is right now, big tech can just run roughshod if you will over your  transactional life online and they are scooping this information.  When you  look at things like the Science Project and you see that these Google  operating systems will track every single base station that you pass, even  with the phone deactivated, if you will.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So you don't know who to trust.  You've got the  technology companies tracking us.  You've got China tracking us.  </p><p>I've got to get your take on this breaking news this morning.  And this  comes from Reuters, Senator-Elect Blackburn.  The Trump administration  reportedly considering checking Chinese students' phone records and social  media accounts for anything that may raise concerns about why they are in  the United States.  Your reaction to this report?</p><p>And it only comes a couple days after we know that there was another report  that showed us that China is judging everybody -- the 1.4 billion people  there -- and coming up with a national score, an individual score, rather,  for each person.  And that's going to dictate whether you can get a  mortgage, whether you can get on a train or a plane.</p><p>So should the U.S. be spying on Chinese citizens to make sure they're here  for the right reasons?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, let me say this about China.  We have been concerned  about the way they interact with U.S. companies for many, many, many years.   And when it comes to dealing with them, I've not seen the report that  you're referencing but I will say this.  I think that Secretary Pompeo is  doing a really quite remarkable job handling and working on the world stage  and making certain that we make wise decisions in our interactions with  other countries.  And so I look forward to seeing what he has to say about  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're going to keep the pressure on big tech.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else are your priorities once you begin your term in the  Senate?</p><p>I mean the President tweeted on the Mueller probe this morning, I'd like to  know what you think about that.  Here's what the President said just a  little while ago.  \"Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a  crime?  At the same time Mueller and the angry Democrats aren't even  looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed  by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.  A total disgrace.\"</p><p>This of course, as Senate Republicans blocked legislation yesterday that  would protect special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.  Was that the  right move?  Tell us where you are on the Mueller investigation and what  you're going to do once you get there in the Senate.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  I'll tell you, Maria -- when I was campaigning across the state  in Tennessee, and something would be said about the Mueller investigation,  Tennesseans would say this thing needs to get wrapped up.  This thing needs  to get finished.  And Tennesseans are really not, you know, they're not  that concerned about the story of the day, if you will.</p><p>What they are concerned about is the story of their lives and they are  absolutely so pleased with what they see as consistent growth.  And I was  listening to the conversation -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- relative to that.  They like the fact that the economy is  growing.  Things are better for their family.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  They are looking forward to having a good Christmas and just  really rocking it in 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, like I said yesterday, it's time.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  It's time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's see what you've got, Robert Mueller.  It's been two years.   We'll see if you and your colleagues will see that report early in the new  year.</p><p>Good to see you.  Marsha Blackburn -- thanks very much for your insights  this morning.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you. </p><p>Coming up, Ford is shifting gears -- the automaker reworking its plants to  ramp-up SUV and pickup truck production.  It will not cutting jobs while  doing so.</p><p>Then a change for Dick's Sporting Goods, the controversial decision by the  athletic retailer to potentially get rid of virtually all of its hunting  gear.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Futures are lower this morning, well off of the lows of the morning though.   Dow Industrials now looking down about 30 points, S&amp;P down 6, down 30  points on the Nasdaq as well.</p><p>Do you think it's good news, Mike Murphy, if we see follow-through to a  600-point rally yesterday or is it bad news?  Sometimes people want to make  sure that you see that the selling is done before coming in.  You want to  see -- </p><p>MURPHY: We had a 10 percent correction.  We had a lot of selling come into  the market.  We had a very positive announcement from the Fed yesterday.   We had a big rally.  I want more of the rally.  And if we get anything out  of the G-20 this weekend, yesterday's rally will be tame in what happens  Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So does that tell you anything about what happens the rest of  the year if in fact we see buying follow-through this morning?  Even though  markets are lower right now.</p><p>MURPHY:  It does.  I mean the way I look at it is that we sold off for one  of the main reasons was the trade war, the tariffs and the effect that  could have.  And if you take that off the table, we go back to where we  were in the markets.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The steel and aluminum tariffs are not going away.  And when  President Trump is tweeting about import tariffs on small cars to match  what we already do on light trucks, I don't think that this tariff issue is  going away any time soon.  </p><p>MURPHY:  But that's part of the China issue, right.  If that gets resolved.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They say, but it's not.  It's to save the steel industry in the  United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets are lower this morning, down as you can see.  We'll  keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile there's this.  Ford Motor moving around some of its U.S. workers  to meet the growing demand for pickups and SUVs.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone on that now and headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p>The change is going to affect more than 1,100 workers but no jobs are going  to be cut in this one.  Ford added it's confident it's going to be able to  find new jobs for 150 other workers at a Michigan plant.</p><p>Now this is just days after General Motors said its' cutting nearly 15,000  jobs and closing five factories in North America. </p><p>Ford shares are down 25 percent this year while GM shares are down 10  percent.  So some pressure on these stocks for the year.</p><p>I want to stay on cars.  Amazon is getting into the toy car business.  This  is Amazon's new self-driving toy car.  It's called the AWS DeepRacer.  You  can program the car to drive itself.  It uses A.I. to learn to drive better  through trial and error.</p><p>It's also launching a racing league of these cars to put customers'  programming skills to the test.  That's $400, by the way, when it comes out  next year if you're willing to spend that on a toy car.  It's available to  preorder now for a special price of $249 -- Maria.  Sending it back to the  group that has kids because I don't know.  It's expensive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>MURPHY:  Do you ride in the car or is it you just control the car?  </p><p>CASONE:  You just control it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Ok.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Does the car record everything going on in the household and then  send that back -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- to Amazon while it's moving around the living room?  Or does  it just drive I think would be one natural question.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It comes like -- I'm betting that they're recording us at all  times.</p><p>Meanwhile President Trump just tweeted on the Mueller probe again.  Here's  what he said.  \"When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style witch hunt,  one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end or will it just go  on forever.  After wasting more than $40 million (is that possible), it has  proven only one thing -- there was no collusion with Russia.  So  ridiculous.\"  The President writes this morning.</p><p>We're looking at real estate realities next, the outlook on housing.  Stay  with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New concerns about the health of the housing market.  October new home  sales sliding to the lowest level in more than two and-a-half years.  It is  the latest sign that rising interest rates are hitting the market.</p><p>Joining us now is Rogers Healy and Associates real estate owner and CEO,  Rogers Healy.  Good to see you Rogers.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>Are we seeing a slowdown -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGERS HEALY, CEO, ROGERS HEALY AND ASSOCIATES:  Good morning.  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in housing and tell us how severe it is.  </p><p>HEALY:  It's not severe.  I mean first of all, what we do is seasonal,  right.  Especially in residential, it is seasonal.  And so this time of  year we do see a slowdown.  But obviously the last two years, really the  last four or five years it's been really, really, really, really, really,  really busy and really, really good.  </p><p>But it has slowed down a little bit.  And for interest rates to get closer  to 5 percent, it's more expensive for the house the person thought they  could afford.  Now they really can't.  So, you know, that has definitely  slowed us down but the market is still fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rogers -- sorry, Mike.  Rogers -- you're in Texas.</p><p>HEALY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you worried about the impact on the major drop in oil prices  on the Texas economy and on your business?  </p><p>HEALY:  You said do I worry about it?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because you would hear -- everybody's in the oil business  or at least they know somebody in the oil business, oil and gas business,  so you would hear from them that they're concerned, that they're getting  ready to cut, you know, cut jobs.  They're not going to pass on a pay  increase.  I just wonder what you're hearing on the ground about the impact  there on real estate.  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, I guess I should start with yes, ma'am, I will tell you.</p><p>Yes.  You know, we saw this happen about seven or eight years ago.  And  people just kind of sit on the sideline.  But I'm in Dallas.  So in Dallas  we don't really see the effect of the oil and gas market like if Houston  would.  But it's still people just cautious, right, and prior they were  cautiously optimistic.  Now they're just a little bit hesitant.</p><p>But just like the real estate market, the oil and gas market is cyclical  and goes in waves.  But we're really not concerned.  I think I saw this  morning that oil is about to be under $50 a barrel for the first time in a  little bit.  But it's going to come back, just like everything always does.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Rogers -- you hear so much about millennials and their desire to  rent versus owning a home.  I see that changing at some point.  Are there  any signs of that yet?  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, I saw a meme the other day that said millennials are walking  around here like they rent the place.  And -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, so we work a lot with millennials.  And you know, obviously  the American dream has been, will always be owning your own piece of real  estate.  But, you know, the shift is going to happen I think with rental  rates -- I think rental rates are going to eventually start to decrease.   And we've seen this with rental rates as real estate rates have increased  as far as owning a home, rental rates have increased too.</p><p>So I think it's going to become a beggar's can't be choosers situation.   And eventually millennials and especially the millennials that are in real  estate -- they're going to go toward leaning towards purchasing a home.</p><p>But right now they're obviously still renting.  But, you know, when they  want to start a family, when they want to go and actually have savings,  they're going to probably go do something more strategic.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Rogers -- James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street Journal\", news  side of our paper had a story about people doing cash-out refinancings even  as rates go up.  So they're taking the equity out of the home, they're  accepting a mortgage with a higher interest rate.</p><p>This doesn't sound like a recipe for healthy financial system when the  downturn comes.  I guess in some ways maybe there is already a downturn in  real estate.  But are you seeing a lot of these cash-out refinancings where  the borrower ends up much more with a higher rate and less equity in the  home?  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, it sounds like they need a better financial advisor, not a  better realtor.  And you know, these people that got in over their heads  back in 2005, 2006, 2007 -- you know, that was the big foreclosure boom  that I experienced with my first group of clients.</p><p>But these guys that are doing cash-out refinances, they didn't manage their  money, you know, strategically probably all across the board.  I mean if  they've got enough equity in their home and you know, you've seen a year  over year 4 percent to 8 percent compounded adjustment, yes -- hello?   Sorry.</p><p>If you see a year over year, you're going to try to find some money  somewhere.  That's going to always happen.  But we're not going to have the  foreclosures that we had back in the days of the big short.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rogers -- good to see you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>HEALY:  You too.  Thank you.  Have a good day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rogers Healy here.</p><p>Coming up, stock market surge - we break down Wall Street's reaction to Fed  chairman Powell's remarks yesterday that he erased November's losses.  It  was a 650-point move on the Dow.</p><p>We're talking with the chairman of UBS, Axel Weber in studio next,  exclusive.</p><p>Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, November  29th.  Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages.  We are well  off of the lows of the morning actually.  Markets have been under pressure  this morning after a powerful rally yesterday that took the market soaring.   Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell gave a positive read of on the economy  yesterday sending markets higher across the board.  Powell gave some  insight on what the Federal Reserve's plans are moving forward.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is no preset policy path.   We'll be paying very close attention to what incoming economic and  financial data are telling us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with that, the markets soared.  The Dow re-raising its  November decline on Powell's speech, finishing higher by more than 600  points, the Dow Industrials on track for the best week since the 2016  election.  </p><p>This morning, European markets are higher as well.  Take a look at the FT- 100 up three quarters of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris up two  thirds of a percent and the DAX Index in Germany up a quarter of a percent.  </p><p>Markets were mixed overnight in Asia.  As you can see here, fractional  moves although the Shanghai Composite in China down 1-1/3 percent.  </p><p>Investing in vaping, tobacco giant Altria is looking to take a stake in the  embattled e-cigarette company Juul.  Details on that deal potentially  coming up.  </p><p>Then the future of the future, the phone of the future, rather, we are  taking a look at the new 3D phone that doesn't need any special glasses.   We'll show it to you.</p><p>Plus, hunting season could be over, why Dick's Sporting season is thinking  about pulling hunting gear from its stores all together.</p><p>But first this, our top story this half an hour, Federal Reserve Chairman  Jay Powell, he said the economy is doing well yesterday.  He addressed the  New York Economic Club yesterday.  Powell said that the Fed is close to  fulfilling its goals of promoting maximum employment and price stability.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent.  A 49-year low and many  other measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests.   Inflation is near our two percent target and the economy is growing at an  annual rate of about three percent, well above most estimates of its longer  run trend.  </p><p>My FOMC colleagues and I as well as many private sector economists are  forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment and inflation  remaining near two percent.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those comments particularly about being close to neutral on  rates, two percent, getting the attention of investors.  The Dow  Industrials shot up as you can see, closing up better than 600 points on  the session.  That was 2-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive, UBS chairman, Axel Weber.   Great to see you Mr. Chairman.  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to Jay Powell yesterday?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think as a former central banker I would say there was nothing  extraordinary he said.  He was just acknowledging that by now after several  rate hikes over two or three years, the Fed is close to neutral.  And I  think the real issue for markets is they have been quite jibbery this year  because three major expectation of what really supported equity markets in  the past are starting to be questioned.  </p><p>The first is will earning growth continue to be as strong as it has?  And  there's some doubt about that.  The second one is really monetary policy  that was a major supporter of equity, markets is starting to be at neutral,  so it's less supportive, it may actually become restrictive.  And the final  point is the economy data, the economic data we're seeing are more mixed.  </p><p>So, there is a mix of head winds that the markets are experiencing that we  haven't seen in that combination for the last couple of years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, you know, there are other things that the Fed is dealing  with.  I mean, you were the chairman of the Bundesbank -- the president of  the Bundesbank.  And you didn't have the kind of issue of winding down a $3  trillion balance sheet, right?  That's one of the issues that the Federal  Reserve faces right now, not just raising rates but winding down the  balance sheet.  Are they going to be able to do that without tightening too  much too fast?  </p><p>WEBER:  But that's exactly what Jay was pointing at.  There are two issues  that they face.  First one is they need to contain inflation because with  the economy doing well, there is a risk that inflation will go up.  It's  been pretty contained.  The Fed was able in this cycle to raise rates,  roughly at half the speed of what they did in the past, and they've  traveled about half the distance.  </p><p>And the real question is, I don't think that normalization of monetary  policy will be completed in the current cycle.  It will take another  economic cycle to really go to neutral.  Because after a very long period  of very low interest rates, raising interest rates has happened very  cautious, but the balance sheets are still very, very expanded.  So they'll  continue to reduce the balance sheet.  </p><p>But my expectation is they won't even go back to where the Fed's balance  sheet was before the crisis.  Central banks have now become a much larger  central counterparty in markets.  And for that, I think structurally  central bank balance sheets will be larger.  </p><p>And I think there's good reasons to be cautious about normalizing monetary  policy because we're coming out of a 10 year low interest rate environment  and therefore you have to be cautious and you should not overshoot.  You  need to look at the economy where central bank support has been taken for  granted for a decade, and weaning that off has to happen with some eyes on  a really cautious normalization.  In can't stay where they are for a long  time because financial markets stability could be threatened.  And that  balance was pointed out by Jay Powell yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But of course, as rates move higher and as we see commodities  prices facing the impact of perhaps tariffs, you're seeing this worry about  margins.  So market has been very volatile.  Are you seeing margin pressure  at UBS?  </p><p>WEBER:  No, I think what we're expecting going forward is there will be  continued to be challenges in the markets and margin pressure will arise  here and there.  But the real challenge that I think the markets will have  is liquidity.  </p><p>As the ECB gets off their purchase program for the first time in the last  10 years, central bank balance sheets globally, the sum of what central  banks are doing will no longer support the economy.  It will no longer  expand balance sheet.  Central bank balance sheets globally will start to  shrink and that is a new phenomenon.  Because so far, the ECB's expansion  and the bank of Japan's expansion has more than made up the shrinking of  the balance sheet by the Fed.  That will change at the end of the year.</p><p>So, there's clearly going to be some headwinds for the next year economy.   There's clearly going to be some headwinds from -- you know, the effects of  the -- of the tax reductions and physical reforms in the U.S. are starting  to ban.  Market growth is going to be more normalized.  But there's no  reason to worry, I don't see an imminent recession on the horizon, maybe a  soft spot in the economy for the next first half of the year.  </p><p>Because one thing that has taken toll now is these trade disputes which  didn't really impact the economy but now with China, U.S. heading ahead in  a sort of more conflicted way, many global firms are re-wiring their global  production chains.  So multinationals are really changing the way where  they produce and how they produce and that has taken a toll for a short- term on the economy.  </p><p>So, I expect the first quarter, the second quarter next year to be quite  weak and that is a soft spot.  It's not a recession.  Most data that we're  seeing are not in the typical pattern of what usually you see before a  recession.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you are expecting a weak first and second quarter in 2019  then?  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and we saw some of that in what you said when you reported  earnings last month, they were 26 percent above the expectations.  But you  set new targets in terms of what you want to achieve.  </p><p>One of those targets is you want to bring more money into your wealth  management business.  Tell us about it.  </p><p>WEBER:  It's true.  So, what we did is basically reaffirmed our strategy.   You know, about seven years ago when we looked at the strategy we changed  the way we ran the bank.  Now, a couple of years later, we've given  different market developments.  We wanted to look at whether that's still  in place and we felt that is the case.  </p><p>But we have some targeted growth initiative.  One is really our ultra  business and we're the only truly global wealth manager with a large amount  of clients in the ultra space that is the richest individual and the  richest people in our economies.  And we want to grow that business by $70  billion over the next three years, largely focused on growing our U.S.  business.  </p><p>And that is something where we feel -- you know, unlike a couple of years  ago we're expanding our global business and in particular with the U.S.  being a strong market, we're expanding our U.S. business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do that, Axel?  How do you that grow a business when  you're seeing such uncertainty and worry in a market where the market will  be down 600 points one day and up 600 the next day?  How do you invest that  money and make the case for these very wealthy individuals that you want  UBS to be handling that allocation?  </p><p>WEBER:  Well, I think what you're seeing in the next few years is  diversification will become much more important than it has been in the  past even for U.S. based investors.  </p><p>So, U.S. based investors typically have a very strong bias in their  portfolio towards U.S. investments.  As the U.S. economy is starting to see  some soft spots, and its emerging markets are coming out of a correction,  you would start see investors looking globally at a different mix between  developed markets and emerging markets.  You will also see them look at a  different balance between fixed income and equity investment.  And as  global investor we can bring that diversification to clients and we can  help them invest.  </p><p>Part of what we're also very good at and what we're expanding is investment  in sustainability.  And that in particular is very attractive for the  richest -- you know, clients that we have because they want to see their  investments also raise sustainability and many of the clients around the  globe look at sustainable investment as a new form which is under- represented in their portfolio.  And we have a targeted initiative in that  area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  And I know these are investors that want  long-term performance.  They're not looking to -- you know, make major  moves overnight.  I want to get back to that because that's an important  point.  </p><p>Let me get your reaction though first to this breaking news overnight and  that is about Deutsche Bank, a competitor of yours, authorities raided  Deutsche Bank's headquarters as part of a probe into money laundering.  Now  there's expectations that this company has gotten so weak it's going to  need some kind of a takeover.  Anybody's guess whether or not the German  government will allow its largest bank to be acquired by another but will  UBS be interested in acquiring Deutsche Bank?  </p><p>WEBER:  No, I think what we've said already in the past is we're looking  for targeted growth in our areas that where we have expertise and we're a  wealth manager.  And wealth management and asset management, that's the  core of what we do and we continue to look at that.  </p><p>We don't rule out inorganic options but it will not be full-fledged  mergers.  It will be more targeted acquisitions in the areas where we  already excel, where we've feel that we have a value proposition and we  want to expand that value proposition.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Any issues to that are still ongoing that you can tell us about  with regard to UBS in terms of any of this regulatory or rulings from -- I  know the French court was ruling on a trial back in February for UBS.  Is  that now in the rear view mirror for the company?  </p><p>WEBER:  It's not yet.  We have a -- we have a verdict that comes out in  February.  So, there will be no new news until then.  We're still in  discussion with authorities.  </p><p>We have not foregone the ability to settle the two remaining issues that we  have and for us really what matters going forward is to not have new issues  emerge.  So, we're very focused on compliance.  We're very focused on  operational risk and dealing with them, cyber resilience.  So, we really  want to avoid problems in the future and we've learned our lessons from the  past.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that was a priority of yours when you first stepped  into the role.  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's get the bad news out of the way and deal with this.  Your  thoughts on the regulatory environment in general.  The president to the  U.S. obviously has rolled back a number of regulations.  How does the  industry change from that standpoint?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think the U.S. is setting the pace here.  What we've seen is  almost a decade of re-regulation.  What is important now is -- you know,  like, with monetary policy normalization, do not overdo it.  </p><p>Of course, you can always rollout additional regulation but I think banks  now need some certainty around the regulatory environment in the future.   So that they can refocused on supporting the economy and that is happening  in the United States.  And I see that happening with some delay in Europe  and in Asia-Pacific.  </p><p>In Switzerland we're discussing some of the final regulations around  (INAUDIBLE) three implementation and too big to fail.  But my expectation  is by summer next year we'll have more regulatory certainty and then we can  refocused on doing business and doing business well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the investor sentiment right now in the face of all of  this, how does it look?  Are you worried about investing in this -- in this  market today?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think we see a lot of our clients are on the sidelines.  There's  a huge amount of cash sitting on the sidelines.  But you know in  (INAUDIBLE) the mood was very good and I was actually one of the few that  wasn't as positive about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WEBER:  We're seeing now a correction that has gone further and was more  pronounced than I expected then.  I think the market is overdoing it in the  other direction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Overdue in the other direction.  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Axel, it's great to see you.  </p><p>WEBER:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  The chairman of UBS, Axel Weber.  Back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The president is tweeting this morning on  tariffs, here's what he just wrote, billions of dollars pouring into the  coffers of the USA because of the tariffs being charged to China.  There's  a long way to go.  If companies do not want to pay tariffs, build in the  USA.  Otherwise, let's just make our country richer than ever before.   Writes the president.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  One, it will never pay down  the debt.  You're running over trillion dollar annual budget deficit right  now.  And number two, its attacks on people who buy stuff from overseas.   So, let's not brag about taxing the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've had a problem with these tariffs from day one and we are  seeing an impact in terms of companies making moves like Volvo this  morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, and that's actually in relation -- Volvo is holding off  on hiring down in South Carolina because of the retaliatory tariff from  China.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's now a 40 percent tariff on car imports from the U.S.  into China.  So that's hurting companies that make cars here and export  them to China and that's a lot of the foreign manufacturers that have plans  here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we've got a deal in the works.  Altria Group  reportedly in talks to acquire juul labs, that's the e-cigarette company.   Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines.  Cheryl, over you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's interesting, Maria.  The  Journal says that Altria, of course the maker of Marlboro and parliament  cigarettes is looking to take in a significant minority stake in Juul.   Right now there's no definitive deal on the table, but Juuls value by  investors this summer about $16 billion.  Shares of Altria are higher in  the premarket right now.  So stock to watch for all of you more than half a  percent.  </p><p>Well, Dick's Sporting Goods is considering dropping hunting supplies from  over 700 stores because of declining sales.  It's already pulled hunting  gear from 10 stores.  Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods are up about 26  percent so far this year.  </p><p>And remember Big Mouth Billy Bass?  He's back and he can talk back too.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Don't worry, be happy.  Don't worry, be happy now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Everyone's favorite wall-mounted singing fish is now programmed to  respond to Amazon's Alexa.  He will lip sync to Alexa's voice and dance to  sounds fom Amazon music when you pair it with a compatible echo device,  Maria.  Fun for the whole family.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  </p><p>CASONE:  I love the singing fish.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is fun.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, it is 3D without the glasses, we're checking out the brand-new  cell phone that's aiming to shake up the business.  My exclusive interview  with ROK Group co-founder John Paul DeJoria is next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  3D content with a click, a mobile brand is  aiming to shake up the cell phone industry with a game-changing new device.   In a Fox Business exclusive right now, ROKiT is revealing its first ever  smartphone that allows users to watch 3D content without any 3D glasses.   Joining us right now is the co-founder of ROK Group, co-founder of Patron  Spirits and co-founder and chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems, he is  John Paul DeJoria and it is good to see you, John Paul.  </p><p>JOHN PAUL DEJORIA, CO-FOUNDER OF ROK GROUP, CO-FOUNDER OF PATRON SPIRITS  AND CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, JOHN PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS:  Always a  pleasure.  You know, we're launching these phones with the same philosophy  we have at all our Paul Mitchell Schools, give back first.  All of our  students participate, you know, in raising funds to help people out.  So,  we thought to start a business, why not change the dynamics.  First thing  we did was before (INAUDIBLE) we gave away free to homeless veterans that  were on the street there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Gave them the phone and at the same time -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then you gave them for also veterans.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO OF ROSECLIFF:  You obviously conquered  the market with shampoo then tequila.  So I'm betting on you not against  you on this, but going after Apple seems like a kind of tough person to go  after.  Can you unseat the iPhone or just take some of their market share?  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Well, what I'm looking at is not unseating anybody.  I want  everybody to prosper.  I'm looking at a brand-new field, it's a whole new  area.  Granted, they'll sell for under $300 each and it's a smartphone that  does unbelievable things.  We have a bundle that goes with it.  </p><p>For example, telemedicine, where seven days a week, 24 hours a day, there's  a doctor on the phone with you.  Other technologies we're working with the  NASA as one of our partners that scan the body to do unbelievable health  things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DEJORIA:  We're going to introduce those in about three months from now.   So, shall we say we're a bit of a disrupter because the price, no one can  believe these smartphones are going to sell for under $300 but they are --  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  When you talked about giving away  some of the phones.  That seems like almost giving it away compared to a  $1,000 or more phone.  What are we giving up if we're the customer and  we're getting this $300 phone with 3D images, what are we not getting that  you would get in a more expensive phone?  </p><p>DEJORIA:  An extra $700 or $800 added on.  No, this is a very advanced  smartphone and it has different things you can bundle on it.  Life  insurance, but this is for dollars.  </p><p>Give you an idea, recently we took the country of India, we're wi-fiing the  entire country of India, to help the lower classes become higher classes  because we're putting them on the internet and some of our technologies  doing that.  And we're looking at right now, doing a city in the United  States so.  People, no matter where you are, could try (INAUDIBLE) and make  phone calls anywhere in the world for less than $5.00 a month.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are a true entrepreneur and innovator.  J.P., good to see  you.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  It's always a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We'll be watching the developments.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Paul DeJoria.  Still ahead, spotlight on America's  Heartland, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good Thursday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, November 29th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets pulling back this morning after a powerful rally yesterday.  We're  right down 70 points on the Dow Industrials right now, near the lows once  again this morning.  Nasdaq down 46 points.  That's two-thirds of 1  percent, after a major rally in stocks yesterday.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500  are now in positive territory for the month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks rallying 617 points on the Dow, 2.5 percent higher at the close  yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up two and a third percent.  The Nasdaq -- check  that out -- 208 points higher, that's almost 3 percent higher.</p><p>Why the rally?  These comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  We know that moving too fast would  risk shortening the expansion.  We also know that moving too slowly,  keeping interest rates too low for too long, could risk other distortions  in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Follow-through in Europe this morning.  the FT 100 is up a half  a percent, 33 points higher.  The CAC 40 in Paris is up a half of a  percent, 25 points higher.  And the DAX index up 12 points, fractional gain  there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances -- take a look.  Best performer was  in Japan.  Nikkei average up a third of a percent.</p><p>We are watching the price of oil today -- take a look.  Crude oil fighting  to hold a $50 a barrel level.  It briefly fell below that for the first  time in over a year just a few minutes ago.  Oil now at $50.02 a barrel,  down one-half of 1 percent.</p><p>Reining in big technology -- Facebook under fire after a new report says it  was considering charging companies for user data.</p><p>Plus Google faces backlash for its project in China from its own employees.  </p><p>All those stories coming up.</p><p>Facebook shares down another 1 percent his morning.  Alphabet, parent of  Google, down a half of a percent -- worries about regulation to come.</p><p>Ford Motor meanwhile is shifting gears.  The automaker reworking its plans  to ramp-up SUV and pickup truck production.  It will not be cutting jobs.  </p><p>A major change for Dick's Sporting Goods to report.  The retailer  considering removing all hunting gear from its store shelves. </p><p>And replacing Alexa with Big Mouth Billy Bass -- how you can get the  talking fish to handle your usual Alexa request.  Wait until you see this,  coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down -- Fox Business Networks' Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street  Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and Rosecliff CEO  and managing partner Mike Murphy.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning.   Happy to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James -- I want to ask you about your op-ed that you wrote  yesterday.  The title was \"Tax cut working better than advertised\".</p><p>What I liked about this piece you wrote is you go into business spending.   And why we haven't seen -- and we were talking about this yesterday, Dagen  and me -- and why we haven't seen a bigger move in companies putting money  to work.  And I argued they are but it's in technology.  We've moved from  an industrial society to a technological society.  So maybe the numbers  don't tell the whole story.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well they do -- and they do tell part of the story.  Obviously  we've seen that increase in business investment this year.  We've seen  productivity going up which is good, allows for higher wages.</p><p>But, yes, that third quarter report on GDP it showed kind of softer than  expected business investment.  We kind of wondered why.  Larry Lindsey, a  former Bush advisor, says the time will -- hold on, I think maybe the  investment numbers are going to get revised upwards.  And that's just  exactly what happened yesterday.</p><p>So better investment, more business spending on equipment, a lot of it  technology to make employees more productive as we saw in yesterday's  report.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It went from four-tenths of a  percent increase to north of 3 percent, right, yesterday?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So again, it's not the blowout of the first and second  quarters but overall this year very strong and right on track with what the  corporate tax rate cut enacted in December 2017 was intended to do --  increase investment in the United States.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And for those people who are saying it hasn't done enough, isn't  it hard to go back and say where we would be without the tax cut or what  the economy would look like without the tax cut?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  We saw it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We might look like Germany.  Germany's economy is contracting,  and so is Japan's.  So we might not be in a recession.  But if we hadn't  had that tax cut, we would be -- well, we saw it during the Obama  administration, is that what you were going to say that we never got 3  percent growth in any one calendar year.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget, as soon as the tax cut plan hit earlier this  year when it first went into effect, we did see business spending shoot up.   I mean, people -- businesses were reacting to that and then it slowed down,  maybe the worry over tariffs.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I think that is a concern, certainly.  I think that's why we're  looking -- if they get something resolved this weekend, I think you would  expect some kind of market pop in response.</p><p>But the point is still very strong investment.  Even if it's not quite at  the pace of that initial burst right after the passage of the law,  basically right on target and still in that 3 percent overall economic  growth mode which was the point of the tax reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check out James' op-ed in the \"Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Coming up this morning, joining this conversation, my exclusive interview  with the chairman of UBS.  Axel Weber is here.  We will also speak with  Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis.  We're talking about this market  activity this year with John and Axel has a lot to stay in terms of the  global story.  Rock Group co-founder and Patron Spirits co-found John Paul  Dejoria is here as well.  Plus Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy.  Also  Senate-Elect Marsha Blackburn joining us as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off here with this top story -- turmoil for big tech.  The  \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting Facebook considered charging companies  access for users' data.  This is from internal e-mails viewed by the  \"Journal\".</p><p>Facebook not the only technology company facing trouble and potential  regulation.  Google is facing employee backlash over its project Dragonfly  which would be a censored search engine for China.  Really interesting to  note that Google walked away from doing business with the Pentagon and  instead chose to do business with China where they have to censor their  search engine.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Tennessee Congresswoman and  Senator-Elect Marsha Blackburn.  Senator-Elect -- congratulations to you.   Good to see you.</p><p>SENATOR-ELECT MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Thank you, Maria.  Nice to  see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  You've been  working a lot on this potential, I don't know if you want to call it  regulatory response or what is the response to this in terms of technology?   What do you want to see happen within big tech?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  What I would like to see happen is passage of the Browser Act  which is privacy regulations.  It puts one -- one template in place for the  entire ecosystem, whether it is your Internet service provider, which is  your ISP or it is one of the edge providers which is Facebook, Google,  Twitter, those companies, big tech.</p><p>And Maria -- they have resisted this.  What they wanted was to put all of  the privacy regulation on the ISPs.  That would have been the 2015 rules  that the Obama administration had wanted to put in place.  But it needs to  be one set of rules for the ecosystem.</p><p>And then you get into issues past that and the privacy regulations, you get  into the other issues which have to do with the operating systems, which is  the Google operating system which you can turn the thing off, pull the sim  card, these devices still are tracking you.  And yes, that is an invasion  of your privacy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is that the big issue?  Characterize what the problem is  around big tech.  They're tracking us all the time and we don't know it.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there's also an issue that you and your colleagues have  pointed out about censoring conservative conversation.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  That is right.  And those are two separate issues.</p><p>Now when it comes to privacy, here is what we need to do.  We need to make  certain that the consumer, the individual that is looking at that computer  screen and conducting much of their transactional life online, that they  have the ability to say to these different systems, whether it is Google or  Facebook or whomever on the edge, no, you do not have access to my  sensitive data and I have the right to block you from using that.</p><p>And when it comes to non-sensitive data, like your search history that you  can say I am opting out and reserving to myself the individual the right to  protect my virtual self online; and you, big tech, cannot use my search  data and then turn around and sell that to an advertiser or somebody.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Senator-Elect -- James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street  Journal\".</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I hate to raise a discouraging word, because I don't know many  people who are more excited about your election than I am.  I'm not going  to knock your predecessor at this moment, but in this particular issue, do  you worry about creating a new Internet regulator in Washington?  Do you  worry about big companies like Facebook benefiting from heavy regulation  more than their potential competitors will, who may have a tougher time  complying with this kind of regulation?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.  Not at all -- James.  That is why I think it's important  that we do light touch privacy standards and put that in place.</p><p>And we have a privacy regulator in the marketplace now.  It's called the  Federal Trade Commission, the FTC.  And having that light touch regulation  in place where they are able to say, ok, the individual reserves their  privacy.  It is the same thing that has happened in the physical space, if  you will.</p><p>And for decades, different retailers and merchants and individuals you  conduct transactions with have had affinity programs, loyalty programs.   And what you want to do is replicate that in the virtual space and allow  the individual to decide what information they want to share and what they  want to hold private.</p><p>As it is right now, big tech can just run roughshod if you will over your  transactional life online and they are scooping this information.  When you  look at things like the Science Project and you see that these Google  operating systems will track every single base station that you pass, even  with the phone deactivated, if you will.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So you don't know who to trust.  You've got the  technology companies tracking us.  You've got China tracking us.  </p><p>I've got to get your take on this breaking news this morning.  And this  comes from Reuters, Senator-Elect Blackburn.  The Trump administration  reportedly considering checking Chinese students' phone records and social  media accounts for anything that may raise concerns about why they are in  the United States.  Your reaction to this report?</p><p>And it only comes a couple days after we know that there was another report  that showed us that China is judging everybody -- the 1.4 billion people  there -- and coming up with a national score, an individual score, rather,  for each person.  And that's going to dictate whether you can get a  mortgage, whether you can get on a train or a plane.</p><p>So should the U.S. be spying on Chinese citizens to make sure they're here  for the right reasons?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, let me say this about China.  We have been concerned  about the way they interact with U.S. companies for many, many, many years.   And when it comes to dealing with them, I've not seen the report that  you're referencing but I will say this.  I think that Secretary Pompeo is  doing a really quite remarkable job handling and working on the world stage  and making certain that we make wise decisions in our interactions with  other countries.  And so I look forward to seeing what he has to say about  this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're going to keep the pressure on big tech.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else are your priorities once you begin your term in the  Senate?</p><p>I mean the President tweeted on the Mueller probe this morning, I'd like to  know what you think about that.  Here's what the President said just a  little while ago.  \"Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a  crime?  At the same time Mueller and the angry Democrats aren't even  looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed  by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.  A total disgrace.\"</p><p>This of course, as Senate Republicans blocked legislation yesterday that  would protect special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.  Was that the  right move?  Tell us where you are on the Mueller investigation and what  you're going to do once you get there in the Senate.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  I'll tell you, Maria -- when I was campaigning across the state  in Tennessee, and something would be said about the Mueller investigation,  Tennesseans would say this thing needs to get wrapped up.  This thing needs  to get finished.  And Tennesseans are really not, you know, they're not  that concerned about the story of the day, if you will.</p><p>What they are concerned about is the story of their lives and they are  absolutely so pleased with what they see as consistent growth.  And I was  listening to the conversation -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- relative to that.  They like the fact that the economy is  growing.  Things are better for their family.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  They are looking forward to having a good Christmas and just  really rocking it in 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, like I said yesterday, it's time.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  It's time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's see what you've got, Robert Mueller.  It's been two years.   We'll see if you and your colleagues will see that report early in the new  year.</p><p>Good to see you.  Marsha Blackburn -- thanks very much for your insights  this morning.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you. </p><p>Coming up, Ford is shifting gears -- the automaker reworking its plants to  ramp-up SUV and pickup truck production.  It will not cutting jobs while  doing so.</p><p>Then a change for Dick's Sporting Goods, the controversial decision by the  athletic retailer to potentially get rid of virtually all of its hunting  gear.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Futures are lower this morning, well off of the lows of the morning though.   Dow Industrials now looking down about 30 points, S&amp;P down 6, down 30  points on the Nasdaq as well.</p><p>Do you think it's good news, Mike Murphy, if we see follow-through to a  600-point rally yesterday or is it bad news?  Sometimes people want to make  sure that you see that the selling is done before coming in.  You want to  see -- </p><p>MURPHY: We had a 10 percent correction.  We had a lot of selling come into  the market.  We had a very positive announcement from the Fed yesterday.   We had a big rally.  I want more of the rally.  And if we get anything out  of the G-20 this weekend, yesterday's rally will be tame in what happens  Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So does that tell you anything about what happens the rest of  the year if in fact we see buying follow-through this morning?  Even though  markets are lower right now.</p><p>MURPHY:  It does.  I mean the way I look at it is that we sold off for one  of the main reasons was the trade war, the tariffs and the effect that  could have.  And if you take that off the table, we go back to where we  were in the markets.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The steel and aluminum tariffs are not going away.  And when  President Trump is tweeting about import tariffs on small cars to match  what we already do on light trucks, I don't think that this tariff issue is  going away any time soon.  </p><p>MURPHY:  But that's part of the China issue, right.  If that gets resolved.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They say, but it's not.  It's to save the steel industry in the  United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets are lower this morning, down as you can see.  We'll  keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile there's this.  Ford Motor moving around some of its U.S. workers  to meet the growing demand for pickups and SUVs.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone on that now and headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p>The change is going to affect more than 1,100 workers but no jobs are going  to be cut in this one.  Ford added it's confident it's going to be able to  find new jobs for 150 other workers at a Michigan plant.</p><p>Now this is just days after General Motors said its' cutting nearly 15,000  jobs and closing five factories in North America. </p><p>Ford shares are down 25 percent this year while GM shares are down 10  percent.  So some pressure on these stocks for the year.</p><p>I want to stay on cars.  Amazon is getting into the toy car business.  This  is Amazon's new self-driving toy car.  It's called the AWS DeepRacer.  You  can program the car to drive itself.  It uses A.I. to learn to drive better  through trial and error.</p><p>It's also launching a racing league of these cars to put customers'  programming skills to the test.  That's $400, by the way, when it comes out  next year if you're willing to spend that on a toy car.  It's available to  preorder now for a special price of $249 -- Maria.  Sending it back to the  group that has kids because I don't know.  It's expensive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>MURPHY:  Do you ride in the car or is it you just control the car?  </p><p>CASONE:  You just control it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Ok.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Does the car record everything going on in the household and then  send that back -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- to Amazon while it's moving around the living room?  Or does  it just drive I think would be one natural question.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It comes like -- I'm betting that they're recording us at all  times.</p><p>Meanwhile President Trump just tweeted on the Mueller probe again.  Here's  what he said.  \"When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style witch hunt,  one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end or will it just go  on forever.  After wasting more than $40 million (is that possible), it has  proven only one thing -- there was no collusion with Russia.  So  ridiculous.\"  The President writes this morning.</p><p>We're looking at real estate realities next, the outlook on housing.  Stay  with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New concerns about the health of the housing market.  October new home  sales sliding to the lowest level in more than two and-a-half years.  It is  the latest sign that rising interest rates are hitting the market.</p><p>Joining us now is Rogers Healy and Associates real estate owner and CEO,  Rogers Healy.  Good to see you Rogers.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>Are we seeing a slowdown -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGERS HEALY, CEO, ROGERS HEALY AND ASSOCIATES:  Good morning.  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in housing and tell us how severe it is.  </p><p>HEALY:  It's not severe.  I mean first of all, what we do is seasonal,  right.  Especially in residential, it is seasonal.  And so this time of  year we do see a slowdown.  But obviously the last two years, really the  last four or five years it's been really, really, really, really, really,  really busy and really, really good.  </p><p>But it has slowed down a little bit.  And for interest rates to get closer  to 5 percent, it's more expensive for the house the person thought they  could afford.  Now they really can't.  So, you know, that has definitely  slowed us down but the market is still fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rogers -- sorry, Mike.  Rogers -- you're in Texas.</p><p>HEALY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you worried about the impact on the major drop in oil prices  on the Texas economy and on your business?  </p><p>HEALY:  You said do I worry about it?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Because you would hear -- everybody's in the oil business  or at least they know somebody in the oil business, oil and gas business,  so you would hear from them that they're concerned, that they're getting  ready to cut, you know, cut jobs.  They're not going to pass on a pay  increase.  I just wonder what you're hearing on the ground about the impact  there on real estate.  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, I guess I should start with yes, ma'am, I will tell you.</p><p>Yes.  You know, we saw this happen about seven or eight years ago.  And  people just kind of sit on the sideline.  But I'm in Dallas.  So in Dallas  we don't really see the effect of the oil and gas market like if Houston  would.  But it's still people just cautious, right, and prior they were  cautiously optimistic.  Now they're just a little bit hesitant.</p><p>But just like the real estate market, the oil and gas market is cyclical  and goes in waves.  But we're really not concerned.  I think I saw this  morning that oil is about to be under $50 a barrel for the first time in a  little bit.  But it's going to come back, just like everything always does.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Rogers -- you hear so much about millennials and their desire to  rent versus owning a home.  I see that changing at some point.  Are there  any signs of that yet?  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, I saw a meme the other day that said millennials are walking  around here like they rent the place.  And -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that.  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, so we work a lot with millennials.  And you know, obviously  the American dream has been, will always be owning your own piece of real  estate.  But, you know, the shift is going to happen I think with rental  rates -- I think rental rates are going to eventually start to decrease.   And we've seen this with rental rates as real estate rates have increased  as far as owning a home, rental rates have increased too.</p><p>So I think it's going to become a beggar's can't be choosers situation.   And eventually millennials and especially the millennials that are in real  estate -- they're going to go toward leaning towards purchasing a home.</p><p>But right now they're obviously still renting.  But, you know, when they  want to start a family, when they want to go and actually have savings,  they're going to probably go do something more strategic.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Rogers -- James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street Journal\", news  side of our paper had a story about people doing cash-out refinancings even  as rates go up.  So they're taking the equity out of the home, they're  accepting a mortgage with a higher interest rate.</p><p>This doesn't sound like a recipe for healthy financial system when the  downturn comes.  I guess in some ways maybe there is already a downturn in  real estate.  But are you seeing a lot of these cash-out refinancings where  the borrower ends up much more with a higher rate and less equity in the  home?  </p><p>HEALY:  Yes, it sounds like they need a better financial advisor, not a  better realtor.  And you know, these people that got in over their heads  back in 2005, 2006, 2007 -- you know, that was the big foreclosure boom  that I experienced with my first group of clients.</p><p>But these guys that are doing cash-out refinances, they didn't manage their  money, you know, strategically probably all across the board.  I mean if  they've got enough equity in their home and you know, you've seen a year  over year 4 percent to 8 percent compounded adjustment, yes -- hello?   Sorry.</p><p>If you see a year over year, you're going to try to find some money  somewhere.  That's going to always happen.  But we're not going to have the  foreclosures that we had back in the days of the big short.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rogers -- good to see you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>HEALY:  You too.  Thank you.  Have a good day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rogers Healy here.</p><p>Coming up, stock market surge - we break down Wall Street's reaction to Fed  chairman Powell's remarks yesterday that he erased November's losses.  It  was a 650-point move on the Dow.</p><p>We're talking with the chairman of UBS, Axel Weber in studio next,  exclusive.</p><p>Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, November  29th.  Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages.  We are well  off of the lows of the morning actually.  Markets have been under pressure  this morning after a powerful rally yesterday that took the market soaring.   Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell gave a positive read of on the economy  yesterday sending markets higher across the board.  Powell gave some  insight on what the Federal Reserve's plans are moving forward.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  There is no preset policy path.   We'll be paying very close attention to what incoming economic and  financial data are telling us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And with that, the markets soared.  The Dow re-raising its  November decline on Powell's speech, finishing higher by more than 600  points, the Dow Industrials on track for the best week since the 2016  election.  </p><p>This morning, European markets are higher as well.  Take a look at the FT- 100 up three quarters of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris up two  thirds of a percent and the DAX Index in Germany up a quarter of a percent.  </p><p>Markets were mixed overnight in Asia.  As you can see here, fractional  moves although the Shanghai Composite in China down 1-1/3 percent.  </p><p>Investing in vaping, tobacco giant Altria is looking to take a stake in the  embattled e-cigarette company Juul.  Details on that deal potentially  coming up.  </p><p>Then the future of the future, the phone of the future, rather, we are  taking a look at the new 3D phone that doesn't need any special glasses.   We'll show it to you.</p><p>Plus, hunting season could be over, why Dick's Sporting season is thinking  about pulling hunting gear from its stores all together.</p><p>But first this, our top story this half an hour, Federal Reserve Chairman  Jay Powell, he said the economy is doing well yesterday.  He addressed the  New York Economic Club yesterday.  Powell said that the Fed is close to  fulfilling its goals of promoting maximum employment and price stability.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent.  A 49-year low and many  other measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests.   Inflation is near our two percent target and the economy is growing at an  annual rate of about three percent, well above most estimates of its longer  run trend.  </p><p>My FOMC colleagues and I as well as many private sector economists are  forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment and inflation  remaining near two percent.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those comments particularly about being close to neutral on  rates, two percent, getting the attention of investors.  The Dow  Industrials shot up as you can see, closing up better than 600 points on  the session.  That was 2-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive, UBS chairman, Axel Weber.   Great to see you Mr. Chairman.  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to Jay Powell yesterday?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think as a former central banker I would say there was nothing  extraordinary he said.  He was just acknowledging that by now after several  rate hikes over two or three years, the Fed is close to neutral.  And I  think the real issue for markets is they have been quite jibbery this year  because three major expectation of what really supported equity markets in  the past are starting to be questioned.  </p><p>The first is will earning growth continue to be as strong as it has?  And  there's some doubt about that.  The second one is really monetary policy  that was a major supporter of equity, markets is starting to be at neutral,  so it's less supportive, it may actually become restrictive.  And the final  point is the economy data, the economic data we're seeing are more mixed.  </p><p>So, there is a mix of head winds that the markets are experiencing that we  haven't seen in that combination for the last couple of years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, you know, there are other things that the Fed is dealing  with.  I mean, you were the chairman of the Bundesbank -- the president of  the Bundesbank.  And you didn't have the kind of issue of winding down a $3  trillion balance sheet, right?  That's one of the issues that the Federal  Reserve faces right now, not just raising rates but winding down the  balance sheet.  Are they going to be able to do that without tightening too  much too fast?  </p><p>WEBER:  But that's exactly what Jay was pointing at.  There are two issues  that they face.  First one is they need to contain inflation because with  the economy doing well, there is a risk that inflation will go up.  It's  been pretty contained.  The Fed was able in this cycle to raise rates,  roughly at half the speed of what they did in the past, and they've  traveled about half the distance.  </p><p>And the real question is, I don't think that normalization of monetary  policy will be completed in the current cycle.  It will take another  economic cycle to really go to neutral.  Because after a very long period  of very low interest rates, raising interest rates has happened very  cautious, but the balance sheets are still very, very expanded.  So they'll  continue to reduce the balance sheet.  </p><p>But my expectation is they won't even go back to where the Fed's balance  sheet was before the crisis.  Central banks have now become a much larger  central counterparty in markets.  And for that, I think structurally  central bank balance sheets will be larger.  </p><p>And I think there's good reasons to be cautious about normalizing monetary  policy because we're coming out of a 10 year low interest rate environment  and therefore you have to be cautious and you should not overshoot.  You  need to look at the economy where central bank support has been taken for  granted for a decade, and weaning that off has to happen with some eyes on  a really cautious normalization.  In can't stay where they are for a long  time because financial markets stability could be threatened.  And that  balance was pointed out by Jay Powell yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But of course, as rates move higher and as we see commodities  prices facing the impact of perhaps tariffs, you're seeing this worry about  margins.  So market has been very volatile.  Are you seeing margin pressure  at UBS?  </p><p>WEBER:  No, I think what we're expecting going forward is there will be  continued to be challenges in the markets and margin pressure will arise  here and there.  But the real challenge that I think the markets will have  is liquidity.  </p><p>As the ECB gets off their purchase program for the first time in the last  10 years, central bank balance sheets globally, the sum of what central  banks are doing will no longer support the economy.  It will no longer  expand balance sheet.  Central bank balance sheets globally will start to  shrink and that is a new phenomenon.  Because so far, the ECB's expansion  and the bank of Japan's expansion has more than made up the shrinking of  the balance sheet by the Fed.  That will change at the end of the year.</p><p>So, there's clearly going to be some headwinds for the next year economy.   There's clearly going to be some headwinds from -- you know, the effects of  the -- of the tax reductions and physical reforms in the U.S. are starting  to ban.  Market growth is going to be more normalized.  But there's no  reason to worry, I don't see an imminent recession on the horizon, maybe a  soft spot in the economy for the next first half of the year.  </p><p>Because one thing that has taken toll now is these trade disputes which  didn't really impact the economy but now with China, U.S. heading ahead in  a sort of more conflicted way, many global firms are re-wiring their global  production chains.  So multinationals are really changing the way where  they produce and how they produce and that has taken a toll for a short- term on the economy.  </p><p>So, I expect the first quarter, the second quarter next year to be quite  weak and that is a soft spot.  It's not a recession.  Most data that we're  seeing are not in the typical pattern of what usually you see before a  recession.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you are expecting a weak first and second quarter in 2019  then?  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and we saw some of that in what you said when you reported  earnings last month, they were 26 percent above the expectations.  But you  set new targets in terms of what you want to achieve.  </p><p>One of those targets is you want to bring more money into your wealth  management business.  Tell us about it.  </p><p>WEBER:  It's true.  So, what we did is basically reaffirmed our strategy.   You know, about seven years ago when we looked at the strategy we changed  the way we ran the bank.  Now, a couple of years later, we've given  different market developments.  We wanted to look at whether that's still  in place and we felt that is the case.  </p><p>But we have some targeted growth initiative.  One is really our ultra  business and we're the only truly global wealth manager with a large amount  of clients in the ultra space that is the richest individual and the  richest people in our economies.  And we want to grow that business by $70  billion over the next three years, largely focused on growing our U.S.  business.  </p><p>And that is something where we feel -- you know, unlike a couple of years  ago we're expanding our global business and in particular with the U.S.  being a strong market, we're expanding our U.S. business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do that, Axel?  How do you that grow a business when  you're seeing such uncertainty and worry in a market where the market will  be down 600 points one day and up 600 the next day?  How do you invest that  money and make the case for these very wealthy individuals that you want  UBS to be handling that allocation?  </p><p>WEBER:  Well, I think what you're seeing in the next few years is  diversification will become much more important than it has been in the  past even for U.S. based investors.  </p><p>So, U.S. based investors typically have a very strong bias in their  portfolio towards U.S. investments.  As the U.S. economy is starting to see  some soft spots, and its emerging markets are coming out of a correction,  you would start see investors looking globally at a different mix between  developed markets and emerging markets.  You will also see them look at a  different balance between fixed income and equity investment.  And as  global investor we can bring that diversification to clients and we can  help them invest.  </p><p>Part of what we're also very good at and what we're expanding is investment  in sustainability.  And that in particular is very attractive for the  richest -- you know, clients that we have because they want to see their  investments also raise sustainability and many of the clients around the  globe look at sustainable investment as a new form which is under- represented in their portfolio.  And we have a targeted initiative in that  area.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  And I know these are investors that want  long-term performance.  They're not looking to -- you know, make major  moves overnight.  I want to get back to that because that's an important  point.  </p><p>Let me get your reaction though first to this breaking news overnight and  that is about Deutsche Bank, a competitor of yours, authorities raided  Deutsche Bank's headquarters as part of a probe into money laundering.  Now  there's expectations that this company has gotten so weak it's going to  need some kind of a takeover.  Anybody's guess whether or not the German  government will allow its largest bank to be acquired by another but will  UBS be interested in acquiring Deutsche Bank?  </p><p>WEBER:  No, I think what we've said already in the past is we're looking  for targeted growth in our areas that where we have expertise and we're a  wealth manager.  And wealth management and asset management, that's the  core of what we do and we continue to look at that.  </p><p>We don't rule out inorganic options but it will not be full-fledged  mergers.  It will be more targeted acquisitions in the areas where we  already excel, where we've feel that we have a value proposition and we  want to expand that value proposition.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Any issues to that are still ongoing that you can tell us about  with regard to UBS in terms of any of this regulatory or rulings from -- I  know the French court was ruling on a trial back in February for UBS.  Is  that now in the rear view mirror for the company?  </p><p>WEBER:  It's not yet.  We have a -- we have a verdict that comes out in  February.  So, there will be no new news until then.  We're still in  discussion with authorities.  </p><p>We have not foregone the ability to settle the two remaining issues that we  have and for us really what matters going forward is to not have new issues  emerge.  So, we're very focused on compliance.  We're very focused on  operational risk and dealing with them, cyber resilience.  So, we really  want to avoid problems in the future and we've learned our lessons from the  past.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that was a priority of yours when you first stepped  into the role.  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's get the bad news out of the way and deal with this.  Your  thoughts on the regulatory environment in general.  The president to the  U.S. obviously has rolled back a number of regulations.  How does the  industry change from that standpoint?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think the U.S. is setting the pace here.  What we've seen is  almost a decade of re-regulation.  What is important now is -- you know,  like, with monetary policy normalization, do not overdo it.  </p><p>Of course, you can always rollout additional regulation but I think banks  now need some certainty around the regulatory environment in the future.   So that they can refocused on supporting the economy and that is happening  in the United States.  And I see that happening with some delay in Europe  and in Asia-Pacific.  </p><p>In Switzerland we're discussing some of the final regulations around  (INAUDIBLE) three implementation and too big to fail.  But my expectation  is by summer next year we'll have more regulatory certainty and then we can  refocused on doing business and doing business well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the investor sentiment right now in the face of all of  this, how does it look?  Are you worried about investing in this -- in this  market today?  </p><p>WEBER:  I think we see a lot of our clients are on the sidelines.  There's  a huge amount of cash sitting on the sidelines.  But you know in  (INAUDIBLE) the mood was very good and I was actually one of the few that  wasn't as positive about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WEBER:  We're seeing now a correction that has gone further and was more  pronounced than I expected then.  I think the market is overdoing it in the  other direction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Overdue in the other direction.  </p><p>WEBER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Axel, it's great to see you.  </p><p>WEBER:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  The chairman of UBS, Axel Weber.  Back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The president is tweeting this morning on  tariffs, here's what he just wrote, billions of dollars pouring into the  coffers of the USA because of the tariffs being charged to China.  There's  a long way to go.  If companies do not want to pay tariffs, build in the  USA.  Otherwise, let's just make our country richer than ever before.   Writes the president.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  One, it will never pay down  the debt.  You're running over trillion dollar annual budget deficit right  now.  And number two, its attacks on people who buy stuff from overseas.   So, let's not brag about taxing the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've had a problem with these tariffs from day one and we are  seeing an impact in terms of companies making moves like Volvo this  morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, and that's actually in relation -- Volvo is holding off  on hiring down in South Carolina because of the retaliatory tariff from  China.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's now a 40 percent tariff on car imports from the U.S.  into China.  So that's hurting companies that make cars here and export  them to China and that's a lot of the foreign manufacturers that have plans  here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, we've got a deal in the works.  Altria Group  reportedly in talks to acquire juul labs, that's the e-cigarette company.   Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines.  Cheryl, over you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's interesting, Maria.  The  Journal says that Altria, of course the maker of Marlboro and parliament  cigarettes is looking to take in a significant minority stake in Juul.   Right now there's no definitive deal on the table, but Juuls value by  investors this summer about $16 billion.  Shares of Altria are higher in  the premarket right now.  So stock to watch for all of you more than half a  percent.  </p><p>Well, Dick's Sporting Goods is considering dropping hunting supplies from  over 700 stores because of declining sales.  It's already pulled hunting  gear from 10 stores.  Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods are up about 26  percent so far this year.  </p><p>And remember Big Mouth Billy Bass?  He's back and he can talk back too.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Don't worry, be happy.  Don't worry, be happy now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Everyone's favorite wall-mounted singing fish is now programmed to  respond to Amazon's Alexa.  He will lip sync to Alexa's voice and dance to  sounds fom Amazon music when you pair it with a compatible echo device,  Maria.  Fun for the whole family.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  </p><p>CASONE:  I love the singing fish.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is fun.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, it is 3D without the glasses, we're checking out the brand-new  cell phone that's aiming to shake up the business.  My exclusive interview  with ROK Group co-founder John Paul DeJoria is next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  3D content with a click, a mobile brand is  aiming to shake up the cell phone industry with a game-changing new device.   In a Fox Business exclusive right now, ROKiT is revealing its first ever  smartphone that allows users to watch 3D content without any 3D glasses.   Joining us right now is the co-founder of ROK Group, co-founder of Patron  Spirits and co-founder and chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems, he is  John Paul DeJoria and it is good to see you, John Paul.  </p><p>JOHN PAUL DEJORIA, CO-FOUNDER OF ROK GROUP, CO-FOUNDER OF PATRON SPIRITS  AND CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, JOHN PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS:  Always a  pleasure.  You know, we're launching these phones with the same philosophy  we have at all our Paul Mitchell Schools, give back first.  All of our  students participate, you know, in raising funds to help people out.  So,  we thought to start a business, why not change the dynamics.  First thing  we did was before (INAUDIBLE) we gave away free to homeless veterans that  were on the street there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How great.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Gave them the phone and at the same time -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then you gave them for also veterans.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO OF ROSECLIFF:  You obviously conquered  the market with shampoo then tequila.  So I'm betting on you not against  you on this, but going after Apple seems like a kind of tough person to go  after.  Can you unseat the iPhone or just take some of their market share?  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Well, what I'm looking at is not unseating anybody.  I want  everybody to prosper.  I'm looking at a brand-new field, it's a whole new  area.  Granted, they'll sell for under $300 each and it's a smartphone that  does unbelievable things.  We have a bundle that goes with it.  </p><p>For example, telemedicine, where seven days a week, 24 hours a day, there's  a doctor on the phone with you.  Other technologies we're working with the  NASA as one of our partners that scan the body to do unbelievable health  things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DEJORIA:  We're going to introduce those in about three months from now.   So, shall we say we're a bit of a disrupter because the price, no one can  believe these smartphones are going to sell for under $300 but they are --  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  When you talked about giving away  some of the phones.  That seems like almost giving it away compared to a  $1,000 or more phone.  What are we giving up if we're the customer and  we're getting this $300 phone with 3D images, what are we not getting that  you would get in a more expensive phone?  </p><p>DEJORIA:  An extra $700 or $800 added on.  No, this is a very advanced  smartphone and it has different things you can bundle on it.  Life  insurance, but this is for dollars.  </p><p>Give you an idea, recently we took the country of India, we're wi-fiing the  entire country of India, to help the lower classes become higher classes  because we're putting them on the internet and some of our technologies  doing that.  And we're looking at right now, doing a city in the United  States so.  People, no matter where you are, could try (INAUDIBLE) and make  phone calls anywhere in the world for less than $5.00 a month.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are a true entrepreneur and innovator.  J.P., good to see  you.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  It's always a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We'll be watching the developments.  </p><p>DEJORIA:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Paul DeJoria.

The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are now in positive territory for the month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks rallying 617 points on the Dow, 2.5 percent higher at the close yesterday. The S&amp;P was up two and a third percent. The Nasdaq -- check that out -- 208 points higher, that's almost 3 percent higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why the rally? These comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: We know that moving too fast would risk shortening the expansion. We also know that moving too slowly, keeping interest rates too low for too long, could risk other distortions in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Follow-through in Europe this morning. the FT 100 is up a half a percent, 33 points higher. The CAC 40 in Paris is up a half of a percent, 25 points higher. And the DAX index up 12 points, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances -- take a look. Best performer was in Japan. Nikkei average up a third of a percent.</p><p>We are watching the price of oil today -- take a look. Crude oil fighting to hold a $50 a barrel level. It briefly fell below that for the first time in over a year just a few minutes ago. Oil now at $50.02 a barrel, down one-half of 1 percent.</p><p>Reining in big technology -- Facebook under fire after a new report says it was considering charging companies for user data.</p><p>Plus Google faces backlash for its project in China from its own employees.</p><p>All those stories coming up.</p><p>Facebook shares down another 1 percent his morning. Alphabet, parent of Google, down a half of a percent -- worries about regulation to come.</p><p>Ford Motor meanwhile is shifting gears. The automaker reworking its plans to ramp-up SUV and pickup truck production. It will not be cutting jobs.</p><p>A major change for Dick's Sporting Goods to report.

Wait until you see this, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Networks' Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and Rosecliff CEO and managing partner Mike Murphy. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES: Good morning. Happy to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: James -- I want to ask you about your op-ed that you wrote yesterday. The title was \"Tax cut working better than advertised\".</p><p>What I liked about this piece you wrote is you go into business spending. And why we haven't seen -- and we were talking about this yesterday, Dagen and me -- and why we haven't seen a bigger move in companies putting money to work. And I argued they are but it's in technology. We've moved from an industrial society to a technological society. So maybe the numbers don't tell the whole story.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well they do -- and they do tell part of the story. Obviously we've seen that increase in business investment this year. We've seen productivity going up which is good, allows for higher wages.</p><p>But, yes, that third quarter report on GDP it showed kind of softer than expected business investment. We kind of wondered why. Larry Lindsey, a former Bush advisor, says the time will -- hold on, I think maybe the investment numbers are going to get revised upwards. And that's just exactly what happened yesterday.</p><p>So better investment, more business spending on equipment, a lot of it technology to make employees more productive as we saw in yesterday's report.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It went from four-tenths of a percent increase to north of 3 percent, right, yesterday?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. So again, it's not the blowout of the first and second quarters but overall this year very strong and right on track with what the corporate tax rate cut enacted in December 2017 was intended to do -- increase investment in the United States.</p><p>MURPHY: And for those people who are saying it hasn't done enough, isn't it hard to go back and say where we would be without the tax cut or what the economy would look like without the tax cut?</p><p>FREEMAN: We saw it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We might look like Germany. Germany's economy is contracting, and so is Japan's. So we might not be in a recession. But if we hadn't had that tax cut, we would be -- well, we saw it during the Obama administration, is that what you were going to say that we never got 3 percent growth in any one calendar year.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And don't forget, as soon as the tax cut plan hit earlier this year when it first went into effect, we did see business spending shoot up. I mean, people -- businesses were reacting to that and then it slowed down, maybe the worry over tariffs.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think that is a concern, certainly. I think that's why we're looking -- if they get something resolved this weekend, I think you would expect some kind of market pop in response.</p><p>But the point is still very strong investment. Even if it's not quite at the pace of that initial burst right after the passage of the law, basically right on target and still in that 3 percent overall economic growth mode which was the point of the tax reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Check out James' op-ed in the \"Journal\" this morning.</p><p>Coming up this morning, joining this conversation, my exclusive interview with the chairman of UBS. Axel Weber is here. We will also speak with Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis. We're talking about this market activity this year with John and Axel has a lot to stay in terms of the global story. Rock Group co-founder and Patron Spirits co-found John Paul Dejoria is here as well. Plus Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy. Also Senate-Elect Marsha Blackburn joining us as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off here with this top story -- turmoil for big tech. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting Facebook considered charging companies access for users' data. This is from internal e-mails viewed by the \"Journal\".</p><p>Facebook not the only technology company facing trouble and potential regulation. Google is facing employee backlash over its project Dragonfly which would be a censored search engine for China. Really interesting to note that Google walked away from doing business with the Pentagon and instead chose to do business with China where they have to censor their search engine.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Tennessee Congresswoman and Senator-Elect Marsha Blackburn. Senator-Elect -- congratulations to you. Good to see you.</p><p>SENATOR-ELECT MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE: Thank you, Maria. Nice to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us this morning. You've been working a lot on this potential, I don't know if you want to call it regulatory response or what is the response to this in terms of technology? What do you want to see happen within big tech?</p><p>BLACKBURN: What I would like to see happen is passage of the Browser Act which is privacy regulations. It puts one -- one template in place for the entire ecosystem, whether it is your Internet service provider, which is your ISP or it is one of the edge providers which is Facebook, Google, Twitter, those companies, big tech.</p><p>And Maria -- they have resisted this. What they wanted was to put all of the privacy regulation on the ISPs. That would have been the 2015 rules that the Obama administration had wanted to put in place. But it needs to be one set of rules for the ecosystem.</p><p>And then you get into issues past that and the privacy regulations, you get into the other issues which have to do with the operating systems, which is the Google operating system which you can turn the thing off, pull the sim card, these devices still are tracking you. And yes, that is an invasion of your privacy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So is that the big issue? Characterize what the problem is around big tech. They're tracking us all the time and we don't know it.</p><p>BLACKBURN: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there's also an issue that you and your colleagues have pointed out about censoring conservative conversation.</p><p>BLACKBURN: That is right. And those are two separate issues.</p><p>Now when it comes to privacy, here is what we need to do. We need to make certain that the consumer, the individual that is looking at that computer screen and conducting much of their transactional life online, that they have the ability to say to these different systems, whether it is Google or Facebook or whomever on the edge, no, you do not have access to my sensitive data and I have the right to block you from using that.</p><p>And when it comes to non-sensitive data, like your search history that you can say I am opting out and reserving to myself the individual the right to protect my virtual self online; and you, big tech, cannot use my search data and then turn around and sell that to an advertiser or somebody.</p><p>FREEMAN: Senator-Elect -- James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: I hate to raise a discouraging word, because I don't know many people who are more excited about your election than I am. I'm not going to knock your predecessor at this moment, but in this particular issue, do you worry about creating a new Internet regulator in Washington? Do you worry about big companies like Facebook benefiting from heavy regulation more than their potential competitors will, who may have a tougher time complying with this kind of regulation?</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes. Not at all -- James. That is why I think it's important that we do light touch privacy standards and put that in place.</p><p>And we have a privacy regulator in the marketplace now. It's called the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC. And having that light touch regulation in place where they are able to say, ok, the individual reserves their privacy. It is the same thing that has happened in the physical space, if you will.</p><p>And for decades, different retailers and merchants and individuals you conduct transactions with have had affinity programs, loyalty programs. And what you want to do is replicate that in the virtual space and allow the individual to decide what information they want to share and what they want to hold private.</p><p>As it is right now, big tech can just run roughshod if you will over your transactional life online and they are scooping this information. When you look at things like the Science Project and you see that these Google operating systems will track every single base station that you pass, even with the phone deactivated, if you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So you don't know who to trust. You've got the technology companies tracking us. You've got China tracking us.</p><p>I've got to get your take on this breaking news this morning. And this comes from Reuters, Senator-Elect Blackburn. The Trump administration reportedly considering checking Chinese students' phone records and social media accounts for anything that may raise concerns about why they are in the United States. Your reaction to this report?</p><p>And it only comes a couple days after we know that there was another report that showed us that China is judging everybody -- the 1.4 billion people there -- and coming up with a national score, an individual score, rather, for each person. And that's going to dictate whether you can get a mortgage, whether you can get on a train or a plane.</p><p>So should the U.S. be spying on Chinese citizens to make sure they're here for the right reasons?</p><p>BLACKBURN: Well, let me say this about China. We have been concerned about the way they interact with U.S. companies for many, many, many years. And when it comes to dealing with them, I've not seen the report that you're referencing but I will say this. I think that Secretary Pompeo is doing a really quite remarkable job handling and working on the world stage and making certain that we make wise decisions in our interactions with other countries. And so I look forward to seeing what he has to say about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're going to keep the pressure on big tech.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What else are your priorities once you begin your term in the Senate?</p><p>I mean the President tweeted on the Mueller probe this morning, I'd like to know what you think about that. Here's what the President said just a little while ago. \"Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime? At the same time Mueller and the angry Democrats aren't even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. A total disgrace.\"</p><p>This of course, as Senate Republicans blocked legislation yesterday that would protect special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Was that the right move? Tell us where you are on the Mueller investigation and what you're going to do once you get there in the Senate.</p><p>BLACKBURN: I'll tell you, Maria -- when I was campaigning across the state in Tennessee, and something would be said about the Mueller investigation, Tennesseans would say this thing needs to get wrapped up. This thing needs to get finished. And Tennesseans are really not, you know, they're not that concerned about the story of the day, if you will.</p><p>What they are concerned about is the story of their lives and they are absolutely so pleased with what they see as consistent growth. And I was listening to the conversation --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN: -- relative to that. They like the fact that the economy is growing. Things are better for their family.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN: They are looking forward to having a good Christmas and just really rocking it in 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, like I said yesterday, it's time.</p><p>BLACKBURN: It's time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's see what you've got, Robert Mueller. It's been two years. We'll see if you and your colleagues will see that report early in the new year.</p><p>Good to see you. Marsha Blackburn -- thanks very much for your insights this morning.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Good to see you.</p><p>Coming up, Ford is shifting gears -- the automaker reworking its plants to ramp-up SUV and pickup truck production. It will not cutting jobs while doing so.</p><p>Then a change for Dick's Sporting Goods, the controversial decision by the athletic retailer to potentially get rid of virtually all of its hunting gear.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Futures are lower this morning, well off of the lows of the morning though. Dow Industrials now looking down about 30 points, S&amp;P down 6, down 30 points on the Nasdaq as well.</p><p>Do you think it's good news, Mike Murphy, if we see follow-through to a 600-point rally yesterday or is it bad news? Sometimes people want to make sure that you see that the selling is done before coming in. You want to see --</p><p>MURPHY: We had a 10 percent correction. We had a lot of selling come into the market. We had a very positive announcement from the Fed yesterday. We had a big rally. I want more of the rally. And if we get anything out of the G-20 this weekend, yesterday's rally will be tame in what happens Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So does that tell you anything about what happens the rest of the year if in fact we see buying follow-through this morning? Even though markets are lower right now.</p><p>MURPHY: It does. I mean the way I look at it is that we sold off for one of the main reasons was the trade war, the tariffs and the effect that could have. And if you take that off the table, we go back to where we were in the markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The steel and aluminum tariffs are not going away. And when President Trump is tweeting about import tariffs on small cars to match what we already do on light trucks, I don't think that this tariff issue is going away any time soon.</p><p>MURPHY: But that's part of the China issue, right. If that gets resolved.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They say, but it's not. It's to save the steel industry in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Markets are lower this morning, down as you can see. We'll keep watching that.</p><p>Meanwhile there's this. Ford Motor moving around some of its U.S. workers to meet the growing demand for pickups and SUVs.</p><p>Cheryl Casone on that now and headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes -- Maria.</p><p>The change is going to affect more than 1,100 workers but no jobs are going to be cut in this one. Ford added it's confident it's going to be able to find new jobs for 150 other workers at a Michigan plant.</p><p>Now this is just days after General Motors said its' cutting nearly 15,000 jobs and closing five factories in North America.</p><p>Ford shares are down 25 percent this year while GM shares are down 10 percent. So some pressure on these stocks for the year.</p><p>I want to stay on cars. Amazon is getting into the toy car business. This is Amazon's new self-driving toy car. It's called the AWS DeepRacer. You can program the car to drive itself. It uses A.I. to learn to drive better through trial and error.</p><p>It's also launching a racing league of these cars to put customers' programming skills to the test. That's $400, by the way, when it comes out next year if you're willing to spend that on a toy car. It's available to preorder now for a special price of $249 -- Maria. Sending it back to the group that has kids because I don't know. It's expensive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>MURPHY: Do you ride in the car or is it you just control the car?</p><p>CASONE: You just control it.</p><p>MURPHY: Ok.</p><p>FREEMAN: Does the car record everything going on in the household and then send that back --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- to Amazon while it's moving around the living room? Or does it just drive I think would be one natural question.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It comes like -- I'm betting that they're recording us at all times.</p><p>Meanwhile President Trump just tweeted on the Mueller probe again. Here's what he said. \"When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style witch hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end or will it just go on forever. After wasting more than $40 million (is that possible), it has proven only one thing -- there was no collusion with Russia. So ridiculous.\" The President writes this morning.</p><p>We're looking at real estate realities next, the outlook on housing. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>New concerns about the health of the housing market. October new home sales sliding to the lowest level in more than two and-a-half years. It is the latest sign that rising interest rates are hitting the market.</p><p>Joining us now is Rogers Healy and Associates real estate owner and CEO, Rogers Healy. Good to see you Rogers. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>Are we seeing a slowdown --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROGERS HEALY, CEO, ROGERS HEALY AND ASSOCIATES: Good morning. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in housing and tell us how severe it is.</p><p>HEALY: It's not severe. I mean first of all, what we do is seasonal, right. Especially in residential, it is seasonal. And so this time of year we do see a slowdown. But obviously the last two years, really the last four or five years it's been really, really, really, really, really, really busy and really, really good.</p><p>But it has slowed down a little bit. And for interest rates to get closer to 5 percent, it's more expensive for the house the person thought they could afford. Now they really can't. So, you know, that has definitely slowed us down but the market is still fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Rogers -- sorry, Mike. Rogers -- you're in Texas.</p><p>HEALY: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are you worried about the impact on the major drop in oil prices on the Texas economy and on your business?</p><p>HEALY: You said do I worry about it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Because you would hear -- everybody's in the oil business or at least they know somebody in the oil business, oil and gas business, so you would hear from them that they're concerned, that they're getting ready to cut, you know, cut jobs. They're not going to pass on a pay increase. I just wonder what you're hearing on the ground about the impact there on real estate.</p><p>HEALY: Yes, I guess I should start with yes, ma'am, I will tell you.</p><p>Yes. You know, we saw this happen about seven or eight years ago. And people just kind of sit on the sideline. But I'm in Dallas. So in Dallas we don't really see the effect of the oil and gas market like if Houston would. But it's still people just cautious, right, and prior they were cautiously optimistic. Now they're just a little bit hesitant.</p><p>But just like the real estate market, the oil and gas market is cyclical and goes in waves. But we're really not concerned. I think I saw this morning that oil is about to be under $50 a barrel for the first time in a little bit. But it's going to come back, just like everything always does.</p><p>MURPHY: Rogers -- you hear so much about millennials and their desire to rent versus owning a home. I see that changing at some point. Are there any signs of that yet?</p><p>HEALY: Yes, I saw a meme the other day that said millennials are walking around here like they rent the place. And --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like that.</p><p>HEALY: Yes, so we work a lot with millennials. And you know, obviously the American dream has been, will always be owning your own piece of real estate. But, you know, the shift is going to happen I think with rental rates -- I think rental rates are going to eventually start to decrease. And we've seen this with rental rates as real estate rates have increased as far as owning a home, rental rates have increased too.</p><p>So I think it's going to become a beggar's can't be choosers situation. And eventually millennials and especially the millennials that are in real estate -- they're going to go toward leaning towards purchasing a home.</p><p>But right now they're obviously still renting. But, you know, when they want to start a family, when they want to go and actually have savings, they're going to probably go do something more strategic.</p><p>FREEMAN: Rogers -- James Freeman here with the \"Wall Street Journal\", news side of our paper had a story about people doing cash-out refinancings even as rates go up. So they're taking the equity out of the home, they're accepting a mortgage with a higher interest rate.</p><p>This doesn't sound like a recipe for healthy financial system when the downturn comes. I guess in some ways maybe there is already a downturn in real estate. But are you seeing a lot of these cash-out refinancings where the borrower ends up much more with a higher rate and less equity in the home?</p><p>HEALY: Yes, it sounds like they need a better financial advisor, not a better realtor. And you know, these people that got in over their heads back in 2005, 2006, 2007 -- you know, that was the big foreclosure boom that I experienced with my first group of clients.</p><p>But these guys that are doing cash-out refinances, they didn't manage their money, you know, strategically probably all across the board. I mean if they've got enough equity in their home and you know, you've seen a year over year 4 percent to 8 percent compounded adjustment, yes -- hello? Sorry.</p><p>If you see a year over year, you're going to try to find some money somewhere. That's going to always happen. But we're not going to have the foreclosures that we had back in the days of the big short.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rogers -- good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>HEALY: You too. Thank you. Have a good day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rogers Healy here.</p><p>Coming up, stock market surge - we break down Wall Street's reaction to Fed chairman Powell's remarks yesterday that he erased November's losses. It was a 650-point move on the Dow.</p><p>We're talking with the chairman of UBS, Axel Weber in studio next, exclusive.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, November 29th. Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages. We are well off of the lows of the morning actually. Markets have been under pressure this morning after a powerful rally yesterday that took the market soaring. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell gave a positive read of on the economy yesterday sending markets higher across the board. Powell gave some insight on what the Federal Reserve's plans are moving forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: There is no preset policy path. We'll be paying very close attention to what incoming economic and financial data are telling us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And with that, the markets soared. The Dow re-raising its November decline on Powell's speech, finishing higher by more than 600 points, the Dow Industrials on track for the best week since the 2016 election.</p><p>This morning, European markets are higher as well. Take a look at the FT- 100 up three quarters of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris up two thirds of a percent and the DAX Index in Germany up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Markets were mixed overnight in Asia. As you can see here, fractional moves although the Shanghai Composite in China down 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>Investing in vaping, tobacco giant Altria is looking to take a stake in the embattled e-cigarette company Juul. Details on that deal potentially coming up.</p><p>Then the future of the future, the phone of the future, rather, we are taking a look at the new 3D phone that doesn't need any special glasses. We'll show it to you.</p><p>Plus, hunting season could be over, why Dick's Sporting season is thinking about pulling hunting gear from its stores all together.</p><p>But first this, our top story this half an hour, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, he said the economy is doing well yesterday. He addressed the New York Economic Club yesterday. Powell said that the Fed is close to fulfilling its goals of promoting maximum employment and price stability.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL: The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent. A 49-year low and many other measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests. Inflation is near our two percent target and the economy is growing at an annual rate of about three percent, well above most estimates of its longer run trend.</p><p>My FOMC colleagues and I as well as many private sector economists are forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment and inflation remaining near two percent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Those comments particularly about being close to neutral on rates, two percent, getting the attention of investors. The Dow Industrials shot up as you can see, closing up better than 600 points on the session. That was 2-1/2 percent.</p><p>Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive, UBS chairman, Axel Weber. Great to see you Mr. Chairman. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to Jay Powell yesterday?</p><p>WEBER: I think as a former central banker I would say there was nothing extraordinary he said. He was just acknowledging that by now after several rate hikes over two or three years, the Fed is close to neutral. And I think the real issue for markets is they have been quite jibbery this year because three major expectation of what really supported equity markets in the past are starting to be questioned.</p><p>The first is will earning growth continue to be as strong as it has? And there's some doubt about that. The second one is really monetary policy that was a major supporter of equity, markets is starting to be at neutral, so it's less supportive, it may actually become restrictive. And the final point is the economy data, the economic data we're seeing are more mixed.</p><p>So, there is a mix of head winds that the markets are experiencing that we haven't seen in that combination for the last couple of years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, you know, there are other things that the Fed is dealing with. I mean, you were the chairman of the Bundesbank -- the president of the Bundesbank. And you didn't have the kind of issue of winding down a $3 trillion balance sheet, right? That's one of the issues that the Federal Reserve faces right now, not just raising rates but winding down the balance sheet. Are they going to be able to do that without tightening too much too fast?</p><p>WEBER: But that's exactly what Jay was pointing at. There are two issues that they face. First one is they need to contain inflation because with the economy doing well, there is a risk that inflation will go up. It's been pretty contained. The Fed was able in this cycle to raise rates, roughly at half the speed of what they did in the past, and they've traveled about half the distance.</p><p>And the real question is, I don't think that normalization of monetary policy will be completed in the current cycle. It will take another economic cycle to really go to neutral. Because after a very long period of very low interest rates, raising interest rates has happened very cautious, but the balance sheets are still very, very expanded. So they'll continue to reduce the balance sheet.</p><p>But my expectation is they won't even go back to where the Fed's balance sheet was before the crisis. Central banks have now become a much larger central counterparty in markets. And for that, I think structurally central bank balance sheets will be larger.</p><p>And I think there's good reasons to be cautious about normalizing monetary policy because we're coming out of a 10 year low interest rate environment and therefore you have to be cautious and you should not overshoot. You need to look at the economy where central bank support has been taken for granted for a decade, and weaning that off has to happen with some eyes on a really cautious normalization. In can't stay where they are for a long time because financial markets stability could be threatened. And that balance was pointed out by Jay Powell yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But of course, as rates move higher and as we see commodities prices facing the impact of perhaps tariffs, you're seeing this worry about margins. So market has been very volatile. Are you seeing margin pressure at UBS?</p><p>WEBER: No, I think what we're expecting going forward is there will be continued to be challenges in the markets and margin pressure will arise here and there. But the real challenge that I think the markets will have is liquidity.</p><p>As the ECB gets off their purchase program for the first time in the last 10 years, central bank balance sheets globally, the sum of what central banks are doing will no longer support the economy. It will no longer expand balance sheet. Central bank balance sheets globally will start to shrink and that is a new phenomenon. Because so far, the ECB's expansion and the bank of Japan's expansion has more than made up the shrinking of the balance sheet by the Fed. That will change at the end of the year.</p><p>So, there's clearly going to be some headwinds for the next year economy. There's clearly going to be some headwinds from -- you know, the effects of the -- of the tax reductions and physical reforms in the U.S. are starting to ban. Market growth is going to be more normalized. But there's no reason to worry, I don't see an imminent recession on the horizon, maybe a soft spot in the economy for the next first half of the year.</p><p>Because one thing that has taken toll now is these trade disputes which didn't really impact the economy but now with China, U.S. heading ahead in a sort of more conflicted way, many global firms are re-wiring their global production chains. So multinationals are really changing the way where they produce and how they produce and that has taken a toll for a short- term on the economy.</p><p>So, I expect the first quarter, the second quarter next year to be quite weak and that is a soft spot. It's not a recession. Most data that we're seeing are not in the typical pattern of what usually you see before a recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you are expecting a weak first and second quarter in 2019 then?</p><p>WEBER: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and we saw some of that in what you said when you reported earnings last month, they were 26 percent above the expectations. But you set new targets in terms of what you want to achieve.</p><p>One of those targets is you want to bring more money into your wealth management business. Tell us about it.</p><p>WEBER: It's true. So, what we did is basically reaffirmed our strategy. You know, about seven years ago when we looked at the strategy we changed the way we ran the bank. Now, a couple of years later, we've given different market developments. We wanted to look at whether that's still in place and we felt that is the case.</p><p>But we have some targeted growth initiative. One is really our ultra business and we're the only truly global wealth manager with a large amount of clients in the ultra space that is the richest individual and the richest people in our economies. And we want to grow that business by $70 billion over the next three years, largely focused on growing our U.S. business.</p><p>And that is something where we feel -- you know, unlike a couple of years ago we're expanding our global business and in particular with the U.S. being a strong market, we're expanding our U.S. business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you do that, Axel? How do you that grow a business when you're seeing such uncertainty and worry in a market where the market will be down 600 points one day and up 600 the next day? How do you invest that money and make the case for these very wealthy individuals that you want UBS to be handling that allocation?</p><p>WEBER: Well, I think what you're seeing in the next few years is diversification will become much more important than it has been in the past even for U.S. based investors.</p><p>So, U.S. based investors typically have a very strong bias in their portfolio towards U.S. investments. As the U.S. economy is starting to see some soft spots, and its emerging markets are coming out of a correction, you would start see investors looking globally at a different mix between developed markets and emerging markets. You will also see them look at a different balance between fixed income and equity investment. And as global investor we can bring that diversification to clients and we can help them invest.</p><p>Part of what we're also very good at and what we're expanding is investment in sustainability. And that in particular is very attractive for the richest -- you know, clients that we have because they want to see their investments also raise sustainability and many of the clients around the globe look at sustainable investment as a new form which is under- represented in their portfolio. And we have a targeted initiative in that area.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point. And I know these are investors that want long-term performance. They're not looking to -- you know, make major moves overnight. I want to get back to that because that's an important point.</p><p>Let me get your reaction though first to this breaking news overnight and that is about Deutsche Bank, a competitor of yours, authorities raided Deutsche Bank's headquarters as part of a probe into money laundering. Now there's expectations that this company has gotten so weak it's going to need some kind of a takeover. Anybody's guess whether or not the German government will allow its largest bank to be acquired by another but will UBS be interested in acquiring Deutsche Bank?</p><p>WEBER: No, I think what we've said already in the past is we're looking for targeted growth in our areas that where we have expertise and we're a wealth manager. And wealth management and asset management, that's the core of what we do and we continue to look at that.</p><p>We don't rule out inorganic options but it will not be full-fledged mergers. It will be more targeted acquisitions in the areas where we already excel, where we've feel that we have a value proposition and we want to expand that value proposition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Any issues to that are still ongoing that you can tell us about with regard to UBS in terms of any of this regulatory or rulings from -- I know the French court was ruling on a trial back in February for UBS. Is that now in the rear view mirror for the company?</p><p>WEBER: It's not yet. We have a -- we have a verdict that comes out in February. So, there will be no new news until then. We're still in discussion with authorities.</p><p>We have not foregone the ability to settle the two remaining issues that we have and for us really what matters going forward is to not have new issues emerge. So, we're very focused on compliance. We're very focused on operational risk and dealing with them, cyber resilience. So, we really want to avoid problems in the future and we've learned our lessons from the past.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I know that was a priority of yours when you first stepped into the role.</p><p>WEBER: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's get the bad news out of the way and deal with this. Your thoughts on the regulatory environment in general. The president to the U.S. obviously has rolled back a number of regulations. How does the industry change from that standpoint?</p><p>WEBER: I think the U.S. is setting the pace here. What we've seen is almost a decade of re-regulation. What is important now is -- you know, like, with monetary policy normalization, do not overdo it.</p><p>Of course, you can always rollout additional regulation but I think banks now need some certainty around the regulatory environment in the future. So that they can refocused on supporting the economy and that is happening in the United States. And I see that happening with some delay in Europe and in Asia-Pacific.</p><p>In Switzerland we're discussing some of the final regulations around (INAUDIBLE) three implementation and too big to fail. But my expectation is by summer next year we'll have more regulatory certainty and then we can refocused on doing business and doing business well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the investor sentiment right now in the face of all of this, how does it look? Are you worried about investing in this -- in this market today?</p><p>WEBER: I think we see a lot of our clients are on the sidelines. There's a huge amount of cash sitting on the sidelines. But you know in (INAUDIBLE) the mood was very good and I was actually one of the few that wasn't as positive about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>WEBER: We're seeing now a correction that has gone further and was more pronounced than I expected then. I think the market is overdoing it in the other direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Overdue in the other direction.</p><p>WEBER: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Axel, it's great to see you.</p><p>WEBER: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. The chairman of UBS, Axel Weber. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The president is tweeting this morning on tariffs, here's what he just wrote, billions of dollars pouring into the coffers of the USA because of the tariffs being charged to China. There's a long way to go. If companies do not want to pay tariffs, build in the USA. Otherwise, let's just make our country richer than ever before. Writes the president.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: One, it will never pay down the debt. You're running over trillion dollar annual budget deficit right now. And number two, its attacks on people who buy stuff from overseas. So, let's not brag about taxing the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've had a problem with these tariffs from day one and we are seeing an impact in terms of companies making moves like Volvo this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, and that's actually in relation -- Volvo is holding off on hiring down in South Carolina because of the retaliatory tariff from China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's now a 40 percent tariff on car imports from the U.S. into China. So that's hurting companies that make cars here and export them to China and that's a lot of the foreign manufacturers that have plans here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, we've got a deal in the works. Altria Group reportedly in talks to acquire juul labs, that's the e-cigarette company. Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines. Cheryl, over you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It's interesting, Maria. The Journal says that Altria, of course the maker of Marlboro and parliament cigarettes is looking to take in a significant minority stake in Juul. Right now there's no definitive deal on the table, but Juuls value by investors this summer about $16 billion. Shares of Altria are higher in the premarket right now. So stock to watch for all of you more than half a percent.</p><p>Well, Dick's Sporting Goods is considering dropping hunting supplies from over 700 stores because of declining sales. It's already pulled hunting gear from 10 stores. Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods are up about 26 percent so far this year.</p><p>And remember Big Mouth Billy Bass? He's back and he can talk back too.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Everyone's favorite wall-mounted singing fish is now programmed to respond to Amazon's Alexa. He will lip sync to Alexa's voice and dance to sounds fom Amazon music when you pair it with a compatible echo device, Maria. Fun for the whole family.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like it.</p><p>CASONE: I love the singing fish.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is fun. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, it is 3D without the glasses, we're checking out the brand-new cell phone that's aiming to shake up the business. My exclusive interview with ROK Group co-founder John Paul DeJoria is next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. 3D content with a click, a mobile brand is aiming to shake up the cell phone industry with a game-changing new device. In a Fox Business exclusive right now, ROKiT is revealing its first ever smartphone that allows users to watch 3D content without any 3D glasses. Joining us right now is the co-founder of ROK Group, co-founder of Patron Spirits and co-founder and chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems, he is John Paul DeJoria and it is good to see you, John Paul.</p><p>JOHN PAUL DEJORIA, CO-FOUNDER OF ROK GROUP, CO-FOUNDER OF PATRON SPIRITS AND CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, JOHN PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS: Always a pleasure. You know, we're launching these phones with the same philosophy we have at all our Paul Mitchell Schools, give back first. All of our students participate, you know, in raising funds to help people out. So, we thought to start a business, why not change the dynamics. First thing we did was before (INAUDIBLE) we gave away free to homeless veterans that were on the street there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How great.</p><p>DEJORIA: Gave them the phone and at the same time --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then you gave them for also veterans.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO OF ROSECLIFF: You obviously conquered the market with shampoo then tequila. So I'm betting on you not against you on this, but going after Apple seems like a kind of tough person to go after. Can you unseat the iPhone or just take some of their market share?</p><p>DEJORIA: Well, what I'm looking at is not unseating anybody. I want everybody to prosper. I'm looking at a brand-new field, it's a whole new area. Granted, they'll sell for under $300 each and it's a smartphone that does unbelievable things. We have a bundle that goes with it.</p><p>For example, telemedicine, where seven days a week, 24 hours a day, there's a doctor on the phone with you. Other technologies we're working with the NASA as one of our partners that scan the body to do unbelievable health things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>DEJORIA: We're going to introduce those in about three months from now. So, shall we say we're a bit of a disrupter because the price, no one can believe these smartphones are going to sell for under $300 but they are --</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: When you talked about giving away some of the phones. That seems like almost giving it away compared to a $1,000 or more phone. What are we giving up if we're the customer and we're getting this $300 phone with 3D images, what are we not getting that you would get in a more expensive phone?</p><p>DEJORIA: An extra $700 or $800 added on. No, this is a very advanced smartphone and it has different things you can bundle on it. Life insurance, but this is for dollars.</p><p>Give you an idea, recently we took the country of India, we're wi-fiing the entire country of India, to help the lower classes become higher classes because we're putting them on the internet and some of our technologies doing that. And we're looking at right now, doing a city in the United States so. People, no matter where you are, could try (INAUDIBLE) and make phone calls anywhere in the world for less than $5.00 a month.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are a true entrepreneur and innovator. J.P., good to see you.</p><p>DEJORIA: It's always a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. We'll be watching the developments.</p><p>DEJORIA: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: John Paul DeJoria. Still ahead, spotlight on America's Heartland, next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018112902cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVG-3KF1-JB20-G3SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 29, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>CC0002J45</classCode><className>FORD MOTOR CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002PJX</classCode><className>ALTRIA GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0003T9K</classCode><className>DICK'S SPORTING GOODS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

He told them to picture it stocked with their data broken up into categories like finances, location, relationships and hobbies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">''That is you,'' Mr. Mundt said. ''And I promise you this wall knows you better than your wife.'' </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Few listened to Mr. Mundt when, a few years ago, he began raising alarms about the data collected by the tech giants. While online services like Facebook and Google did not charge a dime, people paid a high price by giving the companies so many personal details, he argued. And the people had no choice, because the companies had no real competitors.</p><p>  But in February, his agency ruled that Facebook had broken the country's law, and demanded that the company stop automatically sharing data among the services it owns, like Instagram and WhatsApp, or websites that use its ''like'' and ''share'' buttons. It was the first such ruling in Europe, putting in practice ideas that had never fully escaped academic and think-tank debates.</p><p>  As American regulators and lawmakers intensify their scrutiny of Big Tech, there is a lot of discussion about whether or how they could accuse the companies of violating antitrust law. Often, regulators look to whether a company is causing consumer harm -- a standard that can be hard to prove when a service is free.</p><p>  The response from Mr. Mundt is simple. The only way to take on Facebook and some of its peers is to attack what they value most: data.</p><p>  He argues that the companies are so dominant in their core businesses that consumers, if they want to search the internet or be on social media, have no choice but to share their personal data. The data then strengthens the tech companies' position over rivals even more -- and therefore is anticompetitive, Mr. Mundt says.</p><p>  The companies have strongly fought against his argument. But it is gaining traction in antitrust circles, as Mr. Mundt, who has led Germany's antitrust agency for almost a decade, urges officials in other nations to make the same point.</p><p>  After the Facebook ruling, Mr. Mundt received calls from regulators and lawyers around the world to discuss the idea. He helped organize a meeting of fellow antitrust officials in Colombia, where they spent four days discussing tech regulation. Joseph Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department antitrust division, were among those attending.</p><p>  ''The German authority is way out in front here and in a real sense the leading antitrust authority in the world with respect to these technology issues,'' said Thomas Vinje, partner at the Clifford Chance law firm in Brussels and a veteran of tech industry antitrust battles involving Microsoft and Google.</p><p>  Other regulators are looking to build on Germany's approach. The European Commission is in the early stages of an investigation into Facebook, including its use of data, said a person familiar with the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>  Online platforms constantly collect data on users: what is clicked on, how fast a person scrolls past a post, what video a person stops to watch. The information helps a company like Facebook infer characteristics about interests, personal connections and financial demographics to better target advertising, or train machine-learning algorithms that can be used for future products.</p><p>  It is an extraordinarily lucrative business model. Facebook made $55 billion from advertising last year, while Google's ad sales totaled $116 billion.</p><p>  What's distressing to regulators is the lack of new competitors, a trend Mr. Mundt attributes to a company's access to data and plentiful financial resources. He says Facebook controls more than 95 percent of the social networking market in Germany. Without competition, the social network unfairly forces people to make an all-or-nothing choice between agreeing to unlimited data collection or not using Facebook at all.</p><p>  When investigating Facebook, German regulators built a map of the information the company collects. It looked similar to the one Mr. Mundt described during his recent speech -- a web of personal information that branched into details about homeownership, life events, politics and buying behavior.</p><p>  Mr. Mundt contends that Facebook and other tech giants don't need to be broken up, as Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have suggested. Instead, he thinks governments should limit their ability to collect data. The approach can have an effect similar to a breakup by isolating a company's different services.</p><p>  ''The business model is to gather and process data, full stop. There is nothing else,'' Mr. Mundt said in an interview. ''If they don't have data, they can have 10,000 very intelligent engineers who tell you what you can make out of data, but without the data you don't make anything.''</p><p>  Germany is at the forefront of a deeper realization among regulators and policymakers globally that laws must evolve to keep pace with technological change. Rules that regulate industries like oil or transportation, where dominance is measured in physical goods and price gouging, don't as easily apply to services that are digital, are often free and rely on people's attention and data more than infrastructure.</p><p>  Europe has regularly used antitrust law to take on the tech industry. The European Commission has punished Amazon, Apple, Google and Qualcomm in recent years for unfair competition. And more actions are expected in the years ahead. An investigation into Amazon's use of data was started last year. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust regulator, has said data must play a more central role in assessing market dominance in the digital economy, particularly when reviewing acquisitions by tech companies.</p><p>  ''Antitrust law will become irrelevant in the digital marketplace if it doesn't adopt to understanding the power of data in analyzing market power and dominance,'' said Gene Kimmelman, the former chief counsel of the Justice Department antitrust division who is now the president of Public Knowledge, a public interest advocacy group that favors stronger oversight of tech platforms.</p><p>  Critics say Germany's aggressive approach stretches the limits of antitrust law and won't stand up to court reviews. Mr. Mundt's focus on data is seen by some as overly simplistic and, if adopted widely, will make it harder to offer free services. Because data is shared widely among different businesses and industries, critics say, the attempts to limit its flow will cause unintended consequences and disruptions.</p><p>  ''European regulators are using competition policy to pursue objectives that are unrelated to competition,'' said Eline Chivot, a senior policy analyst in Brussels for the Center for Data Innovation, a group funded by a Washington think tank whose board includes representatives from Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. ''It introduces uncertainty.''</p><p>Facebook is appealing the German decision, arguing that it was transparent with users about how data is collected. The social network argues that its use of data helps improve the service and that German regulators singled it out for practices common across the internet.</p><p>  Even those who support Germany's broader goals question whether its approach will be effective. The February ruling allows Facebook to continue sharing data between Instagram and WhatsApp if it gets users to click a new permission box. Many wonder how effective the ruling will be because most people will sign off without much thought.</p><p>  ''It might be that you'll end up in the same place you started,'' said Jason Furman, a senior economic adviser in the Obama administration.</p><p>  Mr. Furman, a Harvard professor advising the British government on tech regulation, said that rather than relying on antitrust law alone, countries should create a dedicated regulator for the tech industry, to match those covering the banking, health and transportation sectors of the economy. He said a watchdog with expertise in the field could better review a company's behavior and use of data on a case-by-case basis. He said new laws requiring companies to make some of their data available to rivals also could seed competition.</p><p>  In the United States, where antitrust law has a narrower scope than in Europe, experts say Germany's approach won't work because it relies on privacy and consumer protection rules that don't exist in America. But lawmakers and federal regulators in Washington are studying new ways to account for data in regulating the digital economy.</p><p>  Mr. Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department antitrust division, said in a speech last month that lack of competition may be leading to weaker online privacy protections. ''Diminished quality is also a type of harm to competition,'' he said.</p><p>  Mr. Mundt says Germany's approach is not a final answer, but he hopes it inspires bolder action by regulators, who he says must push legal boundaries just as the companies have done.</p><p>  ''We need innovative cases,'' he said. ''What we have done with Facebook can't be found in a textbook.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Andreas Mundt, Germany's antitrust regulator, is targeting data collection.

Congress and state attorneys general have their sights on the companies, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is no shortage of people arguing that America's large technology companies \u2014 namely Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 have gotten too big and too powerful. That has helped spur the scrutiny by the government officials.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But what to do about the issue? On that, the industry's critics are split.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Some would like to see the businesses broken up. Others want more robust regulation. And there are shades of gray on both sides. Here are four of the most prominent prescriptions being debated.</p><p> Bright-line breakups: This is the most drastic surgery, splitting off large portions of the big tech companies.</p><p> The guiding principle is simple. If you own a dominant online marketplace, you cannot also offer the goods, services and software applications sold on that marketplace.</p><p> So Amazon could not own the leading e-commerce marketplace and sell Amazon-label goods there. Or Google could not have both the dominant search engine and its Google Shopping service, which shows up in search results. Apple could own the App Store that offers music services, but not sell its own music service there. And so on.</p><p> Bundling businesses on top of a dominant service invites conflicts of interest and discrimination against rivals, thwarting competition, proponents of this countermeasure say.</p><p> \"The world is going to be better off after we break up these companies,\" said Barry Lynn, executive director of Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has embraced the idea of bright-line breakups in her presidential campaign.</p><p> But such a sweeping overhaul of the tech industry could bring unknown risks for the companies and shareholders. Many economists are leery of broadly prohibiting companies from entering new businesses, fearing potential losses of efficiency and consumer welfare.</p><p> The last big government-mandated breakup targeted AT&amp;T in the early 1980s, and that was the dissolution of a government-granted monopoly.</p><p> Still, the idea is not unthinkable. The remedy initially proposed in the government's antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, endorsed by three leading economists, was to split the Windows operating system business from Microsoft's Office productivity software business.</p><p> After George W. Bush was elected president, his administration settled the case without a breakup.</p><p> Selective split-ups: This is a case-by-case approach to breakups rather than a broad rule applied to all the tech giants. A current example is a plan that would require Facebook to shed Instagram and WhatsApp. A detailed proposal on this, laying out the alleged anti-competitive conduct, was developed by two leading antitrust scholars, Tim Wu of Columbia Law School and Scott Hemphill of New York University Law School, along with Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook.</p><p> The three have made their presentation to federal and state antitrust regulators and to congressional investigators. They explain that starting about 2010, when mobile computing and photo-sharing services were taking off and Facebook was lagging in those areas, the Menlo Park company embarked on a years-long campaign to buy nascent competitors.</p><p> The biggest purchases were the photo-sharing service Instagram in 2012 and the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014.</p><p> Typically, regulators challenge mergers when they give a company a big share of an established market. That was not the case when Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram, a startup with 13 employees in an emerging field.</p><p> Instead, the three argue, the strategy was to buy out budding threats.</p><p> \"We think that's the better perspective of what was going on \u2014 maintenance of monopoly in the social network market,\" Hemphill said.</p><p> In Facebook's case, Wu said, \"the remedy is straightforward: Unwind the acquisitions.\"</p><p> But an issue in spinning off a unit like Instagram is whether doing so enhances competition. Would a stand-alone Instagram be a real rival to Facebook, or would people simply stay with the dominant social network, Facebook, and Instagram suffer?</p><p> New tech watchdog: Getting breakups approved by the nation's courts, which are generally conservative on economic matters, would be a stretch. Besides, some experts argue, a more comprehensive way to police the big tech companies would be with a beefed-up force of regulators.</p><p> One idea is the creation of a new regulator, a Digital Authority. It would be an expert group to supplement traditional antitrust regulators in the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. It would be able to move faster and have the expertise to constantly track the tech markets and trends.</p><p> \"Its mandate would be to protect competition,\" said Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale University School of Management.</p><p> The new regulator was the central recommendation of a recent report about the digital services that was sponsored by the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago. Scott Morton led a group of eight antitrust experts and technologists who worked on the study. Since the report was released in May, members of the group have made a series of presentations to policymakers.</p><p> In online markets, the flywheel of network effects \u2014 the more people who use a service, the more users, developers and advertisers it attracts \u2014 is especially powerful, creating dominant companies. Yet even in digital markets, the door to new entrants must remain open, said Scott Morton, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.</p><p> In traditional antitrust, regulators and courts move at a measured pace, slowly and often after the fact. The goal of a new digital regulator, she said, \"would be to save the rival before it is killed.\"</p><p> Unlock the data: There are also narrower regulatory proposals. Some of these involve rules that would loosen a dominant company's control of user data, by either forcing that company to share the data with a smaller competitor or giving users more ability to take their data from one service and move it to a competitor.</p><p> The Stigler Center study cited those data moves in a list of potential regulations and enforcement actions.</p><p> The idea, broadly, is that data can be a barrier to competition, and that freeing up the personal information collected by the tech giants could lower that barrier.</p><p> The big online services make money from data, collecting, analyzing and exploiting information from consumers, merchants, advertisers and others.</p><p> And the network effect of data is formidable. The more data the companies have, the more fuel to feed the machine-learning algorithms that power their businesses.</p><p> \"Data is the real trump card these platforms have,\" said A. Douglas Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School and a member of the Stigler Center study team.</p><p> Melamed, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, favors a rule that would require dominant digital services to give other companies access to their user data for a fee. That would help level the playing field for new entrants and other rivals, he said, but wouldn't be free for them, either.</p><p> \"You let the competitors have access to their backrooms for a reasonable fee,\" Melamed said.</p><p> Such a solution would require regulatory oversight to set guidelines for fair licensing terms. Data sharing would also entail some privacy risk, since no privacy-protection technique is foolproof.</p><p> A related idea is to require tech companies to make user data portable. That means people could move their information from one service to another, forcing digital businesses to compete by devising superior offerings rather than locking in user data.</p><p> Steve Lohr is a New York Times writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-edc91546a9c288daf6761957b235a8354d176f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WW6-1P01-DXVP-V2GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Even the current antitrust discussion in the mainstream press has taken on a populist tone. For example, the Wall Street Journal, Economist, and Financial Times--which more instinctively tend to take a laissez faire economic approach--have pushed for more aggressive antitrust enforcement. (1) The critics of the current antitrust approach that has lasted for forty-plus years (2) make antitrust the causal factor for such things as a loss of democracy, (3) deteriorating healthcare, (4) income inequality, (5) and labor force issues, (6) among others. Some Democrats in Congress have called for a fundamental rethinking of antitrust, called \"A Better Deal: Cracking Down on Corporate Monopolies and the Abuse of Economic and Political Power.\" (7) A series of policy-oriented books also sound the alarm of bigness. (8)</p><p>Such populists actively hearken back to the Brandeisian concern regarding \"bigness.\" (9) Indeed, Carl Shapiro notes, \"[n]ot since 1912, when Teddy Roosevelt ran for President emphasizing the need to control corporate power, have antitrust issues had such political salience.\" (10) For some critics, the growing concentration of American power is nothing less than a threat to American democracy. (11) However, the populist resurgence in antitrust, taken to its logical conclusion, would be to \"reinvigorate\" antitrust law with criminal prosecutions for conduct via statutory antitrust law that is already available and which technically still remains good law. (12)</p><p>I. ANTITRUST AND DETERRENCE</p><p>The basis of antitrust enforcement derives from models of optimal deterrence. (13) Under an optimal deterrence antitrust framework, a firm or individual will be deterred in situations where the expected costs of illegal activity exceed the expected benefits of such activity due to a calculation of the probability and magnitude of the penalties. (14)</p><p>Criminalization in antitrust has been based on the idea that criminalization leads policy closer to optimal deterrence because it increases the severity of penalties. (15) Criminalization has been pushed globally in the area of cartels, (16) where detection has proven difficult and where civil fines against firms may underdeter. (17) However, unlike collusion, which is done in secret because such agreements are illegal, (18) other forms of antitrust conduct covered by the Sherman Act are not done in secret, such as traditional pricing-related practices including exclusive dealing, tying, and bundling. (19)</p><p>Antitrust law contains a mix of criminal and civil penalties to deter cartel formation and cartel activity at both the organizational and individual levels under [section] 1 of the Sherman Act. (20) The basis for holding both individuals and firms accountable is that, by doing so, antitrust is better able to address what may be different organizational and individual incentives and motivations. (21) Thus, incentives for both organizational and individual compliance potentially bring antitrust closer to optimal deterrence. (22) That is, criminalization creates potential risks for firms in terms of stock market return-based penalties, reputational penalties, debarment, and government fines. (23) These potential criminal sanctions and repercussions from criminal sanctions create incentives for firms to monitor their agents to ensure some level of antitrust compliance. (24) However, because of agency cost problems, the firm and its agents' incentives may be different. (25) Hence, criminal penalties for individuals may be appropriate in such settings. (26)</p><p>Many antitrust scholars propose that increased amounts of fines and jail time bring antitrust closer to optimal deterrence for cartel-related behavior. (27) Criminal sanctions reduce cartel formation and encourage firms and individuals to defect from existing cartels. (28) This defection (via a leniency program) is important for purposes of gathering information about the cartel for prosecution of other cartel members. (29) Without leniency and the threat of criminal sanctions, it would be difficult to gather information about what are secret and illegal contracts. (30) Gary Becker and Richard Posner take a different view with regard to cartels, in which they believe that fines alone would be better than incarceration for what is an economic act. (31)</p><p>In areas of traditional antitrust civil enforcement (for example, bundling, exclusive dealing, tying, resale price maintenance (RPM), nonprice restraints, et cetera), the case for incarceration is weaker because these are not hidden agreements and the behavior is well known by others in the marketplace. (32) Thus, detection is not as much of a concern. Further, in the case of behavior that might have some offsetting procompetitive justifications generally, but not in that particular case, monetary fines do not create significant costs to society and serve to compensate victims. (33) A large-enough fine would therefore serve to deter future illegal behavior. (34) In contrast, locking up individuals for antitrust violations that are based on exclusion or predation would lead to incarceration of individuals who otherwise would be productive to society. (35)</p><p>Criminalization of traditional business behavior creates additional problems. In noncollusion cases, criminalization might deter the very sort of risk taking that should be rewarded in a market economy. (36) As the Supreme Court explained in Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP:</p><p>The mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system. The opportunity to charge monopoly prices--at least for a short period--is what attracts \"business acumen\" in the first place; it induces risk taking that produces innovation and economic growth. (37)</p><p>Without the ability to undertake business practices that may increase consumer welfare but which may be legally risky, firms do not have a sufficient incentive to undertake investments in new product or service offerings because of the fear of jail time. (38)</p><p>Coming from a different intellectual tradition, professors of jurisprudence have also thought about the optimal criminal system. (39) Professors of jurisprudence lament that there has been a tendency toward overcriminalization, especially for types of conduct that should not be considered criminal. (40) This concern of overcriminalization has been pronounced in the works of important criminal law theorists such as R. A. Duff, (41) Sanford Kadish, (42) Andrew Ashworth, (43) and Douglas Husak. (44) Overall, one concern is that criminalization should be reserved for only the most serious crimes. (45) From the standpoint of antitrust, the most serious crime is the one that is not at all ambiguous in terms of the harm--collusion. (46) For this reason, the Supreme Court refers to collusion as \"the supreme evil of antitrust.\" (47) The clear harm that collusion creates has meant that for thousands of years collusion has been viewed as a serious moral concern, from the Babylonian Talmud (48) and Christian Scriptures (49) to Adam Smith. (50)</p><p>The discussion about optimal deterrence and antitrust provides a framework for understanding the development of the criminal antitrust regime from its origins to the present. The next Part explores this antitrust history, which provides the necessary background to understand how criminal antitrust enforcement of collusion is different from criminal antitrust enforcement of other types of behavior, all of which have fallen out of use in the modern era.</p><p>II. CRIMINAL ANTITRUST THEN AND NOW</p><p>A. Early Criminal Antitrust</p><p>Originally, under the Sherman Act as enacted in 1890, all antitrust criminal offenses were misdemeanors rather than felonies. (51) The classification of a misdemeanor meant that unlawful conduct could result in criminal penalties of incarceration for a period of time for one year or under for a violation of the Sherman Act. (52) In early antitrust history, jail time was not a preferred penalty. (53) Even for cartels, criminal enforcement of antitrust was quite rare. (54) Members of cartels were incarcerated once in 1921, (55) but not again until 1959. (56) Criminal offenses by companies also were not significant in antitrust law relative to civil cases. (57) There was some criminal enforcement of non \"hard core\" collusion prior to World War II (WWII), with infrequent jail time, mostly dealing with organized labor. (58) When there was significant criminal enforcement for non-cartel matters, particularly during the largest period of antitrust criminal enforcement during the tenure of Thurman Arnold as head of the DOJ Antitrust Division, the criminal penalties were fines rather than jail time and the severity of the penalties were rather weak. (59)</p><p>B. The Rise of Modern Criminal Enforcement</p><p>The rise of criminal antitrust enforcement in the 1970s provides some background as to the current state of criminal enforcement of U.S. antitrust law. The Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (APPA) increased criminal penalties. (60) Congress transformed antitrust criminal penalties from misdemeanors to felonies. (61) It also increased the maximum term of imprisonment for antitrust conduct from one year to three years. (62)</p><p>Increased vigor by the Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division to prosecute collusion with higher sentences, including incarceration, matched Congress's decision to increase criminal penalties. (63) In 1977, the DOJ promulgated guidelines that pushed for higher jail terms for antitrust offenses. (64) The DOJ's focus was on cartel enforcement and was based on a sense that antitrust penalties did not sufficiently deter wrongdoing. (65) It still took a number of years for the new maximum criminal penalties to be used, as 1981 was the first time that courts imposed the maximum prison term of three years as a penalty for a collusion case. (66)</p><p>Penalties have not remained static since the 1970s. Rather, there has been an incremental increase in both fines and criminalization with regard to collusion. (67) In 1987, the U.S. Sentencing Commission applied the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (passed in 1984) to cartel offenses. (68) Further, in 1990, the Antitrust Amendments Act of 1990 increased the potential monetary penalties for violations of the Sherman Act. (69) Congress increased penal terms again in 2004 under the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act (ACPERA), this time to a maximum of ten years. (70)</p><p>These financial penalties for firms are costly and therefore impact firm decision making with regard to antitrust related risk. (71) A metaanalysis of cartel scholarship concludes that \"at a fundamental level, the most important result [of the academic literature] is that high fines are a crucially important element of deterrence.\" (72)</p><p>The record of enforcement of criminal cases outside of explicit collusion has been limited since WWII. (73) More than a generation has passed since there have been any criminal indictments, let alone jail time, for [section] 1 and [section] 2 noncollusion cases. The DOJ has brought a single criminal noncollusion antitrust case since the introduction of the felony penalties.</p><p>C. The Judicial Structure of Antitrust Law and Its Implications on Criminal Enforcement</p><p>Even though antitrust is based on statute, it has a common-law style of development. (74) In Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., the Supreme Court made this explicit, stating \"[f]rom the beginning the Court has treated the Sherman Act as a common-law statute.\" (75) However, the Court had regularly made statements as to the common-law nature of the Sherman Act in prior cases. (76)</p><p>Even though antitrust is commonlaw-like in its application, it works differently than other types of common law. There is a significant history to antitrust shifting with time, thereby limiting stare decisis. In Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, the Court explained:</p><p>As a charter of [economic] freedom, the [Sherman] Act has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions. It does not go into detailed definitions which might either work injury to legitimate enterprise or through particularization defeat its purposes by providing loopholes for escape. (77)</p><p>More recently, in Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, the Court concluded, \"[w]e have therefore felt relatively free to revise our legal analysis as economic understanding evolves and... to reverse antitrust precedents that misperceived a practice's competitive consequences.\" (78)</p><p>This conceptualization by the Court of a consumer welfare-based singular goal for antitrust has existed only for a generation. (79) In its earlier years, the Court found ways to allow certain criminal behavior due to multiple goals, and also encouraged behavior that was not consumer welfare enhancing. (80)</p><p>III. ANTITRUST AND GOALS</p><p>In a world with multiple goals of antitrust that included the protection of small businesses against competition, the case for criminal enforcement of noncollusion behavior may have had some justification (even if it was misguided). (81) However, once the goals changed to a singular goal that was based on economic analysis in which efficiencies were welcomed, this changed the moral and legal basis for business practices. (82) The idea that efficiency was somehow immoral was laid to rest, and instead morality focused on the importance of lower prices, increased quality, and increased innovation for consumers. (83) Similarly, a change from per se illegality to a rule of reason made criminal enforcement problematic as it set a much lower standard for incarceration for individuals than other criminal statutes. (84)</p><p>Antitrust in the premodern era, and in particular, the late 1940s to the early 1970s, was an area of antitrust populism that embraced multiple goals both by the antitrust agencies (85) and the Supreme Court. (86) Antitrust populism manifested itself in Supreme Court rulings that opened up antitrust liability both criminally and civilly for all sorts of price and nonprice offenses and rejected outright efficiencies as irrelevant for mergers. (87) These other goals included the protection from competition of small and inefficient businesses over competitors who would lower prices, improve quality, and/or increase innovation. (88)</p><p>Several cases embody the tradition of noneconomic goals. In United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, the Second Circuit noted that \"one of [antitrust's] purposes was to perpetuate and preserve, for its own sake and in spite of possible cost, an organization of industry in small units which can effectively compete with each other.\" (89) Similarly, the Court in Brown Shoe Co. v. United States cautioned that \"we cannot fail to recognize Congresses] desire to promote competition through the protection of viable, small, locally owned businesses. Congress appreciated that occasional higher costs and prices might result from the maintenance of fragmented industries and markets.\" (90) This populist impulse in antitrust that did not place economic analysis in the forefront (and indeed shifting trends in antitrust economics) meant that, the Supreme Court and lower courts oftentimes ruled in ways that go against sound economics by the standard we use today. This period from the late 1940s to late 1970s is what Professor Donald Turner termed antitrust's \"inhospitality tradition.\" (91)</p><p>The inhospitability tradition was one in which antitrust courts created doctrines that were not based solely on industrial organization economic considerations as we understand them today. (92) As a result, there were a number of goals in antitrust that harmed consumers. (93) For example, courts were concerned about competitors (even inefficient ones) rather than consumers in mergers, (94) ignored merger efficiencies and treated them as unlawful, (95) found various marketing practices for vertical price and nonprice restraints to be per se illegal, (96) significantly limited unilateral refusals to deal, (97) limited intellectual property rights, (98) were overinclusive in their approach to ancillary restraints, (99) and took a view that efficient price discrimination that lowers prices for consumers should be per se illegal. (100)</p><p>Multiple goals also muddled earlier antitrust cases, including those addressing collusion. For example, during the period of the Great Depression, courts did not strictly enforce criminal antitrust laws. (101) As Professors William Kovacic and Carl Shapiro note, \"in the depths of the Depression, even the Court's stand against naked horizontal output restrictions wavered.\" (102) In Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, the Court found that a conspiracy that allowed for output restriction of uniform pricing by coal producers did not violate the Sherman Act. (103) Such a case, if brought today with a singular goal of consumer welfare, would have come out the opposite way.</p><p>This tradition of economic folly gave way to a singular goal based on economic effects. As such, in conduct cases via a rule of reason and in mergers based on economically guided merger guidelines, an economics-based approach is not criminally enforced but, in fact, more generally, it is civilly subject to a weighing of pro- and anticompetitive harms. (104) Though antitrust has always been subject to the economics of its time, (105) economic analysis took a more central role in the mid-1970s as a result of shifts in academic thinking that began in the 1950s and 1960s. (106)</p><p>The notion that antitrust should be based on a consumer-welfare calculation (though not always clear as to what the Court meant by consumer welfare) (107) soon followed from Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. (108) In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., the Supreme Court articulated, \"[The Congressional floor debates] suggest that Congress designed the Sherman Act as a 'consumer welfare prescription.'\" (109) A few years later, the Supreme Court returned to goals of antitrust in NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma when it noted that \"[a] restraint that has the effect of reducing the importance of consumer preference in setting price and output is not consistent with this fundamental goal of antitrust law.\" (110)</p><p>In those areas in which the academic consensus on economic practices has developed, the Supreme Court has shifted to rule of reason from per se illegality. (111) This is perhaps clearest in Leegin. There, the Court stated:</p><p>Though each side of the debate can find sources to support its position, it suffices to say here that economics literature is replete with procompetitive justifications for a manufacturer's use of resale price maintenance.... Notwithstanding the risks of unlawful conduct, it cannot be stated with any degree of confidence that resale price maintenance \"always or almost always tend[s] to restrict competition and decrease output.\" Were the Court now to conclude that vertical price restraints should be per se illegal based on administrative costs, we would undermine, if not overrule, the traditional \"demanding standards\" for adopting per se rules. (112)</p><p>Leegin involved a shift from per se illegality to the rule of reason. (113) While Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States first introduced the rule of reason, (114) the rule of reason has been better defined over the last thirty years. (115) However, full blown rule of reason cases decided on the merits are rare. (116) As a consequence, a number of areas of antitrust law in the area of vertical restraints, if anything, has moved to de facto per se legality. (117) As a result of the current antitrust paradigm, notice and consistency currently exists in court cases because of the economic basis of such cases. (118) As the next Part suggests, a shift to more criminal enforcement of such cases threaten both notice and consistency.</p><p>The above review of shifts in antitrust doctrinal development as well as policy thinking sets up the next part of the Article. Because the current antitrust regime is fundamentally different than a generation ago, a return to certain forms of antitrust in the criminal area creates potentially troubling constitutional concerns with regard to both desuetude and void for vagueness.</p><p>IV. DESUETUDE</p><p>A. Desuetude and Its Meaning</p><p>Desuetude is a concept where a practice that has been fixed by law loses its authority due to a lack of usage. (119) When this lack of usage has been long enough, a \"negative custom\" of nonusage replaces the usage of the law. (120) Nonusage for a lengthy period of time suggests either that the legal practice is obsolete or was never legitimate in the first place. (121)</p><p>The basis of desuetude originated during the Roman Empire and from the work of Emporers Julian and Justinian. (122) The desuetude idea has been continuously recognized in Western civilization since that time. (123)</p><p>There is a temporal element to desuetude. As Richard Albert explains, \"[s]tatutory desuetude occurs when some combination of the sustained non-application of a law, contrary practice over a significant duration of time, official disregard and the tacit consent of public and political actors leads to the implicit repeal of that law.\" (124) That is, lack of use of the statute is not enough. (125) Desuetude is a function of the amount of time since the government enforced the statute. (126)</p><p>The types of cases that often get brought up in the context of desuetude are ones that address issues of morality: \"Most unenforced criminal laws survive in order to satisfy moral objections to established modes of conduct. They are unenforced because we want to continue our conduct, and unrepealed because we want to preserve our morals.\" (127) Issues that once caused moral outrage but are no longer viewed that way under contemporary communal standards are desuete. (128) The fairness-related issue regarding morality is best summed up by Arthur Bonfield:</p><p>First, a very long-continued and well-settled failure to enforce a widely-ignored statute is as much a positive expression of public policy as would be its express legislative abrogation. The reason for this is that such a protracted course of administrative conduct must at least reflect the electorate's acquiescence to the provision's demise as effective law. Otherwise, the politically responsive administrators of our penal laws would have suffered--over such an appreciable period--the consequences of their long disregard of public preference. Second, when the community has acquiesced in an enactment's long-continued administrative nullification by not terminating it, the provision disappears as law in any meaningful sense. It is neither observed nor enforced, and is virtually eradicated from the legal consciousness of the body politic. (129)</p><p>It is only in the criminal context that statutes would fall in disuse. (130) In the civil context, potential private plaintiffs that find statutes potentially advantageous are likely to use them for settling or winning a case. (131) However, repealing criminal laws are more difficult. (132) William Stuntz notes,</p><p>[t]here is good reason to believe that the level of legislative inertia in such cases--the cost of undoing that which would not be done today--is higher for criminal statutes than for other sorts of legislation. Which means that the statute books contain a host of crimes that are not crimes at all in terms of popular understandings. (133)</p><p>Thus, unlike civil laws, criminal laws fall into disuse rather than being repealed.</p><p>Desuetude has an important function in understanding types of conduct. In her analysis of desuetude, Hillary Greene explains that \"[t]he true significance of nonenforcement becomes clearer when one stops to consider what it means to make something a crime.\" (134) That is, a crime is an action taken that society is willing to enforce. (135) As a consequence, the lack of enforcement of such a crime suggests that society may not really want to enforce the statute. (136) Greene explains that \"[n]onenforcement of a criminal statute could, in short, effectively decriminalize the conduct prescribed by the statute.\" (137)</p><p>Nonenforcement of a statute suggests that the risk of prosecution is zero, or close to it. (138) Thus, to overturn a criminal statute that is unenforced creates problems of standing. (139) When there is no enforcement, it is difficult to challenge the constitutionality of the law. (140) Thus, the sudden enforcement of obsolete statutes creates due process concerns because the statutes can be used in a discriminatory manner. (141) Further desuete statutes also create problems of notice. Both commentators and courts have identified that the enforcement of obsolete statutes creates problems of fair notice. (142) This in turn creates due process concerns. (143)</p><p>The primary basis for desuetude as a doctrine is the concept that the long nonusage of the law, despite numerous opportunities to do so, creates negative customs. (144) These negative customs in turn prohibit the subsequent reinforcement of the statute. (145) The common-law tradition, as a tradition of custom and long usage, is the basis for law. (146) Likewise, nonuse creates the basis for not enforcing the law. (147)</p><p>What exactly constitutes long use (or disuse) is not totally clear. For example, Scottish law considered fifty years sufficient for a law to fall into disuse. (148) In contrast, Spanish law required only ten years for a law to fall in disuse for purposes of desuetude. (149) Other lengths of time vary from one hundred years to forty years to the discretion of the judge. (150)</p><p>Not all scholars believe the desuetude is a viable legal theory in practice. (151) A number of legal commentators suggest that desuetude is not recognized by American law. (152) However, the basis of desuetude--which as common law is based on custom over time--has a deep philosophical basis in the writings of Anglo-American thinkers such as Edward Coke, William Blackstone, John Adams, and James Wilson. (153) Desuetude has also appealed to more modern thinkers such as Alexander Bickel, (154) Guido Calabresi, (155) and Cass Sunstein. (156)</p><p>Doubters of an American doctrine of desuetude point to the Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia u. John R. Thompson Co. (157) However, that cases's facts are highly specific, which suggests the Court's rejection of the doctrine specifically in those circumstances. (158) This narrow reading of Thompson is justified given the facts of the case. Thompson regarded a law that prohibited racial discrimination in the food service industry based on the local Washington Acts of 1872 and 1873. (159) The case did not totally rule out judicial discretion regarding desuetude. (160) Rather, the Court left open this possibility, though it did not articulate the specific situations in which desuetude would occur. (161) As the Court stated, \"[c]ases of hardship are put where criminal laws so long in disuse as to be no longer known to exist are enforced against innocent parties. But that condition does not bear on the continuing validity of the law; it is only an ameliorating factor in enforcement.\" (162) Examining the ameliorating factor in Thompson, the prosecutions that served as the basis of the case did not come as a surprise. (163) Rather, prosecutors warned of their intention to prosecute violations. (164)</p><p>B. Desuetude in Antitrust</p><p>Having provided an overview of desuetude, this Part applies the doctrine of desuetude to antitrust. The case for applying desuetude to both Sherman Act cases and Robinson-Patman cases is strong. There has been no criminal indictment of any Sherman Act noncollusion offenses since the 1970s (165) and no Robinson-Patman criminal indictment cases since the late 1950s. (166) During this period, the moral perception of antitrust criminality changed in the antitrust agencies, the antitrust bar, and academics. (167) The only discussion of criminal penalties of the current antitrust era has been reserved for collusion. (168)</p><p>1. Sherman Act Criminal Enforcement Outside of Explicit Collusion</p><p>Sherman Act criminal enforcement outside of cartels has been historically very rare. (169) This is particularly true outside of the collusion context for practices involving Sherman [section] 1. It is even more rare for criminal enforcement of Sherman [section] 2 activity. (170) Professors William Breit and Kenneth Elzinga summarize the DOJ's criminal enforcement as follows:</p><p>During the first fifty years of antitrust enforcement under the Sherman Act, of 252 criminal prosecutions only twenty-four resulted in jail sentences, and only eleven of those involved businessmen (the rest were trade-union leaders). Moreover, ten of the eleven cases involved acts of violence, threats, and other forms of intimidation, and the remaining jail sentence was suspended. From 1940 to 1955 only eleven prison sentences were imposed, and in almost every case the sentences were suspended. It was not until 1959 that a prison sentence was imposed for price-fixing alone, in which no acts of violence or union misconduct were involved. In that case the court imposed a ninety-day prison term on four individuals and fined each $5,000. (171)</p><p>The nature of criminal enforcement also changed between the early period of enforcement to the start of the famous heavy electric equipment cartel cases of the late 1950s (172) through the renewed emphasis on criminal cartel enforcement in the late 1970s. (173) According to empirical work by Joseph Gallo and his coauthors, incarceration was very rare in the pre-1963 antitrust era, in which prison was imposed in only 24 of 463 criminal convictions (5.1 percent). (174) Similarly, during the 1963 to 1973 period, 4.8 percent of criminal convictions resulted in incarceration. (175) The APPA changed the nature of enforcement. (176) Since its passage through 1984 (the end of the Reagan administration's first term), 20 percent of criminal convictions resulted in incarceration. (177) All of these convictions and jail sentences were for collusion, except for monopolization convictions in 1969 (six months in jail) and 1973 (thirty days in jail). (178) None of these jail sentences for monopolization occurred after antitrust offenses became felonies. (179)</p><p>There is some discrepancy between Gallo's work and Posner's 1970 paper that statistically examines antitrust enforcement. (180) According to Posner, who based his data on the Commerce Clearing House \"Bluebook\" summaries of DOJ Antitrust cases, (181) the only criminal monopolization jail sentences were between 1925 and 1929, which included a conviction for violence, and a noncriminal monopolization conviction in 1969. (182) Even if both Posner and Gallo are together both correct about the total number of criminal monopolization convictions that resulted in incarceration, the total number of incarcerations for monopolization in the history of the Sherman Act is incredibly rare and has not been a part of antitrust life for more than a generation. (183)</p><p>The most recent criminal action against a noncollusion case is instructive of how far things have changed in terms of thinking about antitrust. In 1978, the DOJ indicted a firm for criminal RPM, which resulted in a nolo contendere plea and a fine. (184) The ability to threaten criminal sanctions for behavior that is not typically used to extract harsher penalties otherwise is the type of due process concern that animates the support for desuetude from thinkers such as Bickel and Sunstein. (185) Even today, forty years after the indictment, desuetude via nonenforcement of criminal RPM could create negative custom to prevent its current application. (186) Given changes in RPM policy moving it from per se to rule of reason, which itself is based on an economic consensus that there may be procompetitive effects to RPM, (187) such an indictment today would be highly unlikely and may even violate the void for vagueness doctrine as discussed further in the next Part. (188)</p><p>Notice in antitrust regarding nonenforcement of criminal Sherman Act activity is problematic. (189) The DO J has shown prosecutorial discretion not merely by not bringing such challenges, but also by making clear that criminal enforcement is reserved for cartels. (190) Guidance from the DOJ provides notice for naked restraints that are per se illegal. (191) Yet, the Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations, (192) Antitrust Guidance for Human Resource Professionals, (193) Antitrust Guidelines for Collaborations Among Competitors, (194) and the DOJ Antitrust Division Manual (196) are silent regarding criminal prosecution for other sorts of violations. The lack of discussion of criminal sanctions for other sorts of antitrust conduct strengthens the sense that the norm for enforcement has shifted to one of criminal nonenforcement for noncollusive conduct. Thus, a revival of criminal enforcement for Sherman Act violations that are noncollusive are desuete and not valid as statutes for further criminal enforcement.</p><p>2. Enforcement of Robinson-Patman</p><p>The Robinson-Patman Act was passed as a statute to protect small retailers against larger and more efficient retailers. (196) The FTC aggressively enforced civil Robinson-Patman cases in the 1950s and 1960s. (197) From an economic standpoint, Robinson-Patman enforcement is retrograde and hurts the most vulnerable consumers by having them pay higher prices than they should for various goods and for retarding necessary economies of scale. (198)</p><p>Though rare, there have been criminal cases brought by the DOJ under the Robinson-Patman Act. (199) Yet, Robinson-Patman enforcement is particularly problematic regarding desuetude from the standpoint of both notice and duration. This is both true of criminal and civil Robinson-Patman cases brought by the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). (200) There has been only a single government enforcement action of Robinson-Patman since the George H.W. Bush administration (and an odd case at that), and no criminal enforcement since the late 1950s. (201)</p><p>a. DOJ Enforcement of Robinson-Patman</p><p>In the 1970s, the DOJ unilaterally stopped its Robinson-Patman enforcement, which meant an end to the possibility of criminal enforcement. (202) In the 1977 Report on the Robinson-Patman Act, the DOJ called the Act \"protectionist\" and economic legislation that had \"deleterious impact upon competition.\" (203) The DOJ also suggested that \"serious consideration\" should be given to the repeal of the Robinson-Patman Act. (204)</p><p>b. FTC Enforcement of Robinson-Patman</p><p>The FTC has been the sole enforcer of Robinson-Patman (civilly) since the 1950s. (205) During 1965 to 1968, the period of its most significant enforcement, the FTC averaged ninety-seven new Robinson-Patman investigations per year. (206) Of these investigations, the FTC averaged twenty-seven complaints annually. (207) A number of these investigations resulted in decided cases, which were pro-plaintiff. (208) Such case law had significant repercussions. The nadir of such cases were Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co. (209) and FTC u. Morton Salt Co. (210)</p><p>The FTC by the late 1970s had significantly curtailed its Robinson-Patman civil enforcement. (211) In 1975, the House Small Business Committee held hearings regarding Robinson-Patman enforcement. (212) During the hearings, the FTC Bureau of Economics Director, Professor F. M. Scherer, testified regarding Robinson-Patman enforcement. (213) Scherer's congressional testimony illustrated the anticompetitive effect of Robinson-Patman enforcement. (214) This testimony reflected how in the 1970s the FTC brought fewer Robinson-Patman cases because such cases hurt consumers and helped small and inefficient competitors. (215)</p><p>By the mid-1970s, enforcement was down considerably as the FTC initiated four Robinson-Patman investigations and three complaints per annum. (216) On the civil enforcement side, the FTC has brought only a single Robinson-Patman case since the end of the George H.W. Bush era. (217)</p><p>3. The Overall View of Robinson-Patman</p><p>Government action, or lack thereof, reflects a broader societal understanding of Robinson-Patman. Robert Bork, who shaped modern antitrust law more than any other thinker, called Robinson-Patman \"antitrust's least glorious hour\" in 1978. (218) Richard Posner authored a monograph attacking Robinson-Patman in 1976. (219) Among more modern thinkers, the most celebrated living professor of antitrust, Herbert Hovenkamp, laments that Robinson-Patman has \"all but evaded the economic revolution in antitrust.\" (220) This academic consensus on the Robinson-Patman Act is also shared by the practitioner community. (221) The congressionally appointed Antitrust Modernization Commission in 2007 called for the repeal of the Robinson-Patman Act. (222)</p><p>Given that the last criminal Robinson-Patman case is from the late 1950s (reaching the Supreme Court in the early 1960s) with no subsequent cases since that time, (223) unilateral nonenforcement of the criminal statutes from the DOJ in the late 1970s, (224) and no federal civil enforcement of any sort of Robinson-Patman cases by the FTC, (225) along with academic and bipartisan support for major modification or repeal of the statute, (226) any criminal Robinson-Patman enforcement would today be subject to the doctrine of desuetude.</p><p>V. VOID FOR VAGUENESS</p><p>Desuetude is not the only means by which to attack the potential reuse of a criminal antitrust aspect to noncollusion based conduct that has fallen in disuse. One could make an argument that the void for vagueness doctrine applies with regard to the Sherman Act for noncollusion criminal enforcement. (227) Void for vagueness is a doctrine where the law in question is too vague to provide notice of the type of conduct that is to be deemed illegal. (228) The linkage between desuetude and vagueness is that \"[a] penal enactment which is linguistically clear, but has been notoriously ignored by both its administrators and the community for an unduly extended period, imparts no more fair notice of its proscriptions than a statute which is phrased in vague terms.\" (229)</p><p>The rule of reason for Sherman Act [section] 1 and [section] 2 cases complicates the ability to bring criminal penalties, such as incarceration, to antitrust for cases that would fall under this legal doctrine. Rule of reason liability in practice means that any prosecution would necessarily have a proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard that seems inapplicable to conduct that may have a procompetitive effect. (230)</p><p>A defendant could raise a void for vagueness claim in such circumstances. That is, when the government charges price-fixing, the clarity of the prohibition and the long line of cases have permitted courts to overlook what is a federal common law prohibition in a regime where there is supposedly no federal common law of crime. (231) The nature of the rule of reason inquiry does not easily lend itself to this criminal standard. Going beyond this core prohibition would raise grave (and probably winning) due process challenges under the void for vagueness doctrine. (232)</p><p>A. Background on the Void for Vagueness Doctrine</p><p>Void for vagueness as a doctrine is itself a rather indeterminate concept because of the doctrine's broad language. (233) Doctrinally, John Calvin Jeffries notes, \"[t]he inquiry is evaluative rather than mechanistic; it calls for a judgment concerning not merely the degree of indeterminacy, but also the acceptability of indeterminacy in particular contexts.\" (234) This indeterminacy manifests itself across Supreme Court cases, particularly with regard to what an ordinary person might think, as does fair notice. (235)</p><p>The Supreme Court has explained the doctrine in the following terms:</p><p>[T]he terms of a penal statute... must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.... And a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act... so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law. (236)</p><p>The classic paper on the vagueness doctrine, by Anthony Amsterdam, explains that the \"doctrine was born in the reign of substantive due process and throughout that epoch was successfully urged exclusively in cases involving regulatory or economic-control legislation.\" (237) Antitrust falls within the economic-control and regulatory sphere. (238)</p><p>Peter Low and Joel Johnson make a critical insight into vagueness. They note:</p><p>Necessarily, it puts two issues to a federal court. The first is a construction of the text of the law. The federal court must determine what the federal law means, and may of course do so in a manner that avoids the vagueness problem. Or, for one reason or another, it may feel required to read the federal law in a manner that brings constitutional vagueness principles into play. (239)</p><p>Low and Johnson claim that to establish a vagueness claim, first, there needs to be conduct. (240) Conduct is not at question for antitrust violations under the rule of reason. (241) Next, the law needs to have been predictable. (242) The problematic situations are those in which the behavior in question is based on law that one should have understood would be included in the prohibition. (243) A statute that is too vague often is standardless. The concern is that a particular statute \"is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.\" (244)</p><p>B. Antitrust and Void for Vagueness</p><p>Antitrust potentially may fall into a void for vagueness problem. (245) This is not to suggest that all of antitrust is void for vagueness, (246) or that all per se criminal antitrust is unconstitutional. (247) Rather, there is a case to be made, given that for antitrust restraints are based on a rule of reason approach, that any attempt to criminalize such behavior again might also lead to a challenge based on a void for vagueness argument. (248)</p><p>On its face, the Sherman Act appears vague. One can begin with the words of the Sherman Act itself. (249) Section 1 of the Sherman Act explains that \"[e]very contract, combination... or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce... is declared to be illegal.\" (250) Section 2 of the Sherman Act states that \"[e]very person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce ... shall be deemed guilty.\" (251) However, case law has filled in the gaps as to what sort of limits exist for the Sherman Act and similar state antitrust laws. (252)</p><p>One might argue that if a current court had the inclination, it could sustain a broad variety of criminal antitrust prosecutions by citing United States v. Lanier, where the criminal civil rights statute was upheld regarding sexual assault cases. (253) In Lanier, the U.S. Supreme Court offered guidance as to the \"three related manifestations of the fair warning requirement\" that are required whether or not a criminal statute may be unconstitutionally vague. (254) These include: (1) the vagueness doctrine, (2) the rule of lenity, and (3) retroactive application of a new construction of the statute. (255) The purpose of the fair warning requirements is to ensure that the \"statute, either standing alone or as construed, ma[k]e it reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant's conduct was criminal.\" (256) The vagueness manifestation may be at play in the antitrust context.</p><p>1. The Void for Vagueness Sherman Act Cases</p><p>The most important federal antitrust void for vagueness Supreme Court decision is Nash u. United States. (257) To understand Nash, one must first understand its context in terms of Justice Holmes's prior dissent in Northern Securities Co. v. United States. (258) Justice Holmes did not believe in competitive effects; he rejected this approach in both Northern Securities and Nash. (259) Justice Holmes argued, \"[t]he act says nothing about competition.\" (260) Instead, the act was based on prior common law. (261)</p><p>In Northern Securities, Justice Holmes laid out how criminal use of [section] 2 of the Sherman Act was to be conceptualized. (262) He explained, \"that whatever is criminal when done by way of combination is equally criminal if done by a single man.\" (263) The Court picked up this language of the ultimate goal of Sherman Act [section] 1 and [section] 2 being the same in other cases, most notably in Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States. (264)</p><p>In Standard Oil, the Court explained the prohibitions in [section] 2 were meant simply to complement [section] 1:</p><p>[T]o make the prohibitions of the act all the more complete and perfect by embracing all attempts to reach the end prohibited by the first section... even although the acts by which such results are attempted to be brought about or are brought about be not embraced within the general enumeration of the first section. (265)</p><p>The Court again picked up this language in later cases, such as Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc. (266) In Klor's, the Court explained that the goal of the prohibitions of both [section] 1 and [section] 2 of the Sherman Act \"was to adopt the common-law proscription of all 'contracts or acts which it was considered had a monopolistic tendency and which interfered with the 'natural flow' of an appreciable amount of interstate commerce.\" (267) Thus, what is criminal in a [section] 1 setting potentially could be equally applicable in a [section] 2 setting.</p><p>Such an understanding is not without critique. There have been a few cases that have attacked the Sherman Act on vagueness grounds. Some attacks were based on state antitrust cases and others were based on federal cases. (268) One issue that complicated federal antitrust law for some time were the early rule of reason cases, Standard Oil (269) and United States v. American Tobacco Co., (270) under which it was not clear when the rule of reason would apply vis-a-vis per se illegality. The first such case to test the limits of Standard Oil was Nash, where a defendant claimed that the term \"restraint of trade,\" in the Sherman Act was not clear. (271) The Court, however, rejected the void for vagueness claim, although the statute did not effectively lay out the elements that must be proven in a successful criminal action. (272) Since Nash, no party has successfully brought a void for vagueness federal antitrust case. (273) Yet, the limits of Nash and other cases suggest that certain Sherman Act cases today might be viewed as vague. (274)</p><p>Supreme Court cases have made certain antitrust doctrines clearly not void for vagueness. The easiest such case involved price-fixing, which the Supreme Court continues to find per se illegal. (275) In United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., the Court articulated:</p><p>The aim and result of every price-fixing agreement, if effective, is the elimination of one form of competition. The power to fix prices, whether reasonably exercised or not, involves power to control the market and to fix arbitrary and unreasonable prices. The reasonable price fixed today may through economic and business changes become the unreasonable price of tomorrow. Once established, it may be maintained unchanged because of the absence of competition secured by the agreement for a price reasonable when fixed. Agreements which create such potential power may well be held to be in themselves unreasonable or unlawful restraints, without the necessity of minute inquiry whether a particular price is reasonable or unreasonable as fixed and without placing on the government in enforcing the Sherman Law the burden of ascertaining from day to day whether it has become unreasonable through the mere variation of economic conditions. Moreover, in the absence of express legislation requiring it, we should hesitate to adopt a construction making the difference between legal and illegal conduct in the field of business relations depend upon so uncertain a test as whether prices are reasonable--a determination which can be satisfactorily made only after a complete survey of our economic organization and a choice between rival philosophies. (276)</p><p>What this decision makes clear is that the nature of inquiry (per se illegality) matters for a void for vagueness claim, as does the fact that the economics of the conduct in question clearly suggest that the practice is anticompetitive. (277) Similarly, in United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., the Court stated that when the per se rule applies, the reasonableness of the activity is irrelevant, noting, \"[w]hatever economic justification particular price-fixing agreements may be thought to have, the law does not permit an inquiry into their reasonableness.\" (278) This approach has been blessed by the leading antitrust treatise. (279) These cases suggest that antitrust is not vague when the conduct being undertaken is clearly illegal and where this is well understood. (280)</p><p>2. Changing Antitrust Thinking and Its Implications on Void for Vagueness Arguments</p><p>The vague prohibitions in antitrust laws suggest that parties should raise constitutional questions when enforcement posture is changing based on economics that may or may not violate antitrust laws.</p><p>a. Rule of Reason</p><p>Understanding the rule of reason helps to conceptualize the limits to criminal rule of reason Sherman Act enforcement that may potentially lead to vagueness concerns. The full rule of reason inquiry is open ended. (281) This has led to some academic criticism of the rule of reason. (282) Nevertheless it has some structure. As the Supreme Court discussed in Leegin:</p><p>The rule of reason is designed and used to eliminate anticompetitive transactions from the market.... As courts gain experience considering the effects of these restraints by applying the rule of reason over the course of decisions, they can establish the litigation structure to ensure the rule operates to eliminate anticompetitive restraints from the market and to provide more guidance to businesses. Courts can, for example, devise rules over time for offering proof, or even presumptions where justified, to make the rule of reason a fair and efficient way to prohibit anticompetitive restraints and to promote procompetitive ones. (283)</p><p>This type of rule of analysis is longstanding, although the specific contours of the rule of reason have changed over time. The Court reserves per se liability for those agreements that are \"so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality.\" (284) The economic presumptions about when a rule is better set as per se versus rule of reason also finds support in the leading antitrust treatise (285) and from the most-cited and influential antitrust scholar (286) of this generation. (287)</p><p>More generally, the push to rule of reason is a function of a concern that an overinclusive rule would chill procompetitive behavior. (288) Though antitrust jurisprudence on this issue is modern, the very first rule of reason case, Standard Oil, articulated this concern by noting that not all restraints are problematic under the Sherman Act, only unreasonable restraints. (289) Similarly, Justice Brandeis's opinion in Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, explained the basis of the rule of reason as follows:</p><p>But the legality of an agreement or regulation cannot be determined by so simple a test, as whether it restrains competition. Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences. (290)</p><p>This basis for the rule of reason helped lay the foundation for subsequent rule of reason cases. (291)</p><p>Rule of reason analysis is linked to the void for vagueness doctrine. (292) In Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., a vagueness case involving Colorado's antitrust law, the Court articulated that the Sherman Act cannot be considered vague when the restraints in question had procompetitive effects and were not per se illegal because the anticompetitive effects were outweighed by the procompetitive effects. (293) The Court stated:</p><p>[T]hat it was recognized in their text that there were incidental restraints of trade that the statute was not intended to cover.... where the language of the federal statute was read in the light of the common law, and in accordance with its reason, and was construed not to penalize such partial restraints of trade as at common law were not only permitted but were promoted in the interest of the freedom of trade itself. (294)</p><p>A rule of reason burden-shifting approach in antitrust looks very different from the approach taken under criminal law with regard to burdens. As Lawrence Solan explains, \"[p]roof beyond a reasonable doubt has been the government's burden in criminal cases for virtually this country's entire history.\" (295) By its definition, the rule of reason is anything but beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, the rule of reason in operation is based on doubt, due to shifting burdens of proof for the plaintiff and defendant. (296) The purpose of the rule of reason is to \"distinguish[] between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer's best interest.\" (297)</p><p>The rule of reason inquiry under black-letter law is relatively clear. (298) There is a three-step process of burden shifting. (299) First, the plaintiff has the burden to allege and provide that there is sufficient evidence that the defendant has sufficient market power to undertake an anticompetitive restraint, (300) and that the defendant has imposed such a restraint. (301) Next, if the plaintiff can meet this burden and establish a prima facie case of anticompetitive harm, the burden then shifts to the defendant. (302) The defendant must show a procompetitive justification for the restraint. (303) If the defendant provides sufficient evidence of a procompetitive justification for the restraint, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff. (304) The plaintiff then may show that the same restraint could have been achieved through a less restrictive alternative. (305)</p><p>Given how infrequently the Supreme Court hears antitrust cases, let alone full-blown rule of reason cases, the lack of developed antitrust case law as to the rule of reason amplifies the potential vagueness of the application of criminal sanctions in cases decided under the rule of reason. (306) This is especially problematic given how antitrust per se conduct has narrowed over time. (307)</p><p>The rule of reason presents potential problems for purposes of criminal enforcement. Even the dissent in Leegin questions the use of criminal penalties for rule of reason cases. (308) Justice Breyer asked, \"[a]re there special advantages to a bright-line rule? Without such a rule, it is often unfair... for enforcement officials to bring criminal proceedings.\" (309) The concern for overreach of criminal penalties for business behavior that might fall under the rule of reason has been articulated in other decisions. (310) For example, the fear of criminal conduct for what should not be per se prohibitions, but a rule of reason animates the Court in non per se Sherman Act conduct cases. (311) In Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., the Court explained, \"[manufacturers would be likely to forgo legitimate and competitively useful conduct rather than risk treble damages and perhaps even criminal penalties.\" (312) The Court made this statement when a dealer who sold calculators brought a claim regarding termination by the supplier. (313) At issue was whether or not such behavior was a per se violation. (314) The Court held that such a vertical restraint was not per se illegal under [section] 1 of the Sherman Act except in a situation where the restraint included an agreement of price or price levels. (315) Understanding the quotation in the context of the broader case, the Court seems to suggest that criminal sanctions are only possible in a per se world rather than that of the rule of reason.</p><p>b. Court as Regulator</p><p>The Court articulated a concern in United States v. United States Gypsum Co. that criminal convictions should not be within the Court's toolkit where courts would serve as regulators. (316) The Court observed:</p><p>The criminal sanctions would be used, not to punish conscious and calculated wrongdoing at odds with statutory proscriptions, but instead simply to regulate business practices regardless of the intent with which they were undertaken. While in certain cases we have imputed a regulatory purpose to Congress in choosing to employ criminal sanctions ... the availability of a range of nonpenal alternatives to the criminal sanctions of the Sherman Act negates the imputation of any such purpose to Congress in the instant context. (317)</p><p>This type of concern regarding criminal penalties for Sherman Act violations clarifies the purpose and basis of antitrust. (318) The Court further explained, \"[s]imply put, the Act has not been interpreted as if it were primarily a criminal statute; it has been construed to have a 'generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions.'\" (319) As a result, the Court noted that it is not the case that \"judicial elaboration of the Act always yielded the clear and definitive rules of conduct which the statute omits; instead open-ended and fact-specific standards like the 'rule of reason' have been applied to broad classes of conduct falling within the purview of the Act's general provisions.\" (320) These types of conduct lead to potential problems with regard to criminality. The Court explained, \"[w]ith certain exceptions for conduct regarded as per se illegal because of its unquestionably anticompetitive effects... the behavior proscribed by the Act is often difficult to distinguish from the gray zone of socially acceptable and economically justifiable business conduct.\" (321)</p><p>More recent cases also make clear the Court's deep reluctance to have antitrust law serve as a price regulator. In Trinko, the Court articulated a concern that antitrust courts, as an institutional matter, are not well suited \"to act as central planners, identifying the proper price, quantity, and other terms of dealing.\" (322) The Court reiterated this institutional concern in Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v. Linkline Communications, Inc. (323)</p><p>The Court has rejected void for vagueness concerns in a number of areas of law that require rate regulation or concerns of price-related conduct, such as railroads (324) or antitrust. (325) However, the types of concerns regarding these earlier cases are different than the specific vagueness concerns that are raised with regard to a rule of reason approach. Let us begin with Nash, the first attack on the Sherman Act on vagueness grounds. (326) At issue, in part, was whether or not criminal sanctions under the Sherman Act for an agreement to fix bids based on vertical and predatory behavior were void for vagueness. (327) The Court held that the Sherman Act was not void because a \"prudent man\" would understand the clarity required to undertake such an agreement. (328)</p><p>3. Intent</p><p>Intent plays a role outside of per se cases, which makes it more difficult to prove. This has mitigated vagueness concerns for the Sherman Act. (329) However, it also sets a very high bar for potential criminal enforcement of noncollusion based Sherman Act crimes. (330) United States v. Gypsum Co. was an information exchange case outside of the traditional per se boundaries. (331) The underlying conduct was defendants that would telephone their competitors in order to verify prices to avoid liability under Robinson-Patman by establishing a meeting-competition defense. (332) The defendants denied that they had intended to engage in illegal activity. (333) The Court addressed this criminal case by applying a rule of reason analysis. (334)</p><p>In Gypsum, the Court held that intent could not be presumed in rule of reason cases. (335) The Supreme Court articulated that intent was a critical part of criminal enforcement. (336) A defendant needed to have \"undertaken with knowledge of its probable consequences and hav[e] the requisite anticompetitive effects\" (337) or alternatively be \"undertaken with the purpose of producing anticompetitive effects ... even if such effects [do] not come to pass.\" (338)</p><p>Post-Gypsum, lower courts have held that intent exists when the government can prove that a defendant has knowledge that he participated in a cartel. (339) Thus, under per se criminal [section] 1 antitrust, criminal intent is not an element of the criminal violation. (340) However, under the rule of reason, it is an inference. (341) This inference seems rather significant since the rule of reason normally requires a more significant analysis. (342) Nevertheless, the intent requirement creates a potential void for vagueness problem as the shortcut which prevents judges or juries from deciding the reasonableness of the restraint, (343) which goes to the issue of effect.</p><p>Intent has been read into [section] 2 of the Sherman Act (although typically to show effect for monopolization cases). (344) The same concerns of intent also play a role in attempted monopolization cases. (345) This reading in of intent is perhaps even more problematic because of the difficulty of understanding the difference between the intent to partake in procompetitive versus anticompetitive activity. (346) Courts have considered intent in Supreme Court cases such as Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp. (347) and Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., (348) and important circuit court cases, such as United States v. Microsoft Corp. (349) and LePage's Inc. v. 3M. (350) However, A.A. Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, Inc. mentions with disfavor that \"[t]raipsing through the warehouses of business in search of misleading evidence both increases the costs of litigation and reduces the accuracy of decisions,\" (351) and California Dental Ass'n v. FTC casts doubt on the use of intent altogether. (352) Nevertheless, intent plays a limited role in [section] 2 cases. The same concerns of intent also play a role in attempted monopolization cases. (353)</p><p>Intent is problematic from the standpoint of current cases in part because it distracts from the economic evidence that an effects-based antitrust requires. (354) However, as a criminal matter, proving intent would be necessary for a criminal conduct case, and the level of intent would be a higher level than that required civilly. (365) Given the conceptual difficulty in some courts and in the leading treatise on intent even in civil noncollusion conduct cases, (356) proving intent criminally, where intent has been read into the statute, may lead to a void for vagueness problem. (357)</p><p>4. Severity of Punishment and Void for Vagueness</p><p>Severity of punishment is an important factor in vagueness considerations. (368) Whereas the old antitrust void for vagueness cases were decided during an era in which an antitrust crimes were misdemeanors, the current antitrust criminal structure has significant potential jail time. (359) Severity of punishment is a factor for the Court in vagueness analysis. (360) In Johnson v. United States, the Court found a provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act that defined a violent felony to be void for vagueness based on language that a felony \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" (361) In Johnson, the penalty was a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years. (362) As a result, vagueness concerns \"appl[ied] not only to statutes defining elements of crimes, but also to statutes fixing sentences.\" (363)</p><p>The more serious the penalties for a criminal statute, the more important vagueness concerns become. (364) Thus, there is legitimate concern that high prison sentences for monopolization or noncartel conduct would be unproportional. Price fixing typically averages three years in prison per conviction. (365) However, unlike areas of clear wrongdoing such as collusion, sentences that would be as long (if not longer) for noncollusive criminal conduct begin to look potentially excessive. This could be in violation of the Eighth Amendment. (366)</p><p>The concern about proportionality has been articulated in the antitrust context for over one hundred years. (367) Certainly, the concern of proportionality would be at issue with regard to Sherman Act rule of reason cases where the statutory maximum is significant, with increasing criminal penalties for individuals and corporations. (368)</p><p>Without a clear and objective standard for what criminal enforcement would look like for noncollusion cases under the Sherman Act, antitrust may have a void for vagueness problem. Such a result would also threaten the clarity that has emerged after a shift in case law and agency practice, which has provided guidance as to the difference between criminal and civil enforcement by the Antitrust Division for certain forms of conduct. (369) The increase in criminal fines for what is clearly per se illegal antitrust conduct in terms of collusion is inappropriate in cases where there is a procompetitive rationale for the behavior under the rule of reason. (370)</p><p>5. Void for Vagueness for Robinson-Patman Criminal Violations</p><p>Antitrust vagueness has been attacked not merely in the Sherman Act but also in the Robinson-Patman Act. In United States u. National Dairy Products Corp., the Supreme Court held that pricing below cost was not void for vagueness under the Robinson-Patman Act. (371) This case and holding are technically still good case law. (372) However, the Court has also made it clear that due to the Sherman Act's lack of detail and specificity, the Act more generally has not been interpreted \"as if it were primarily a criminal statute.\" (373) This lack of specificity is a concern based on vagueness.</p><p>However, a number of things set the Robinson-Patman Act apart for void for vagueness arguments made under the Sherman Act. First, the Robinson-Patman Act is not decided under the rule of reason. (374) Rather, a Section 2(a) claim under the Act requires, \"(1) A difference in price, (2) in reasonably contemporaneous sales of two buyers purchasing from a single seller, (3) involving commodities, (4) of like grade and quality (5) that may injure competition.\" (375) Even if the elements of a violation are made, there are affirmative defenses, such as under Section 2(b) of the Act.</p><p>Second, the rationale in National Dairy was due to conduct that involved below-cost pricing. (376) By today's standard for below-cost pricing, the conduct would not only not be criminal, it would also not be a violation of the Act, which the Court now treats akin to the Sherman Act in terms of economic analysis for predatory pricing under [section] 2, and requires recoupment. (377) By focusing on per se conduct, not only is there a notice with regard to desuetude, as discussed earlier, but also with regard to vagueness because of the notice problem.</p><p>The Court also made a distinction in National Dairy that seems less appropriate today. It articulated that First Amendment vagueness cases are different from those cases that purely address economic issues and that the concern of the latter is less important. (378) However, the Court has found statutes void for vagueness in other types of economic crimes, most notably in Skilling v. United States (involving misrepresentation of the financial performance of Enron). (379) The Court was concerned about whether the scope of the setting standards of disclosure for corporate executives was appropriate as a delegation between the courts and the DOJ in light of the of the institutional complexity and heavy potential jail time for individuals. (380) The open-ended nature of mail fraud created the possibility of \"a wider range of offensive conduct... [that] would raise the due process concerns underlying the vagueness doctrine.\" (381) This type of concern, if applied to Robinson-Patman, may suggest a case for void for vagueness in the criminal context.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>This Article has examined how the common law doctrine of desuetude would prevent punishment that is unduly harsh, such as criminalization, because such punishment has fallen out of use. (382) This can be applied to antitrust for both Sherman Act and Robinson-Patman Act claims. Further, this Article has addressed how criminalization for antitrust violations that have moved from per se illegality to rule of reason creates a potential void for vagueness problem due to a lack of notice and disproportionate enforcement. (383) This is because antitrust criminal liability (including incarceration) for pricing-related practices that are rule of reason based have a lower standard (akin to preponderance of the evidence) than do traditional felonies that require a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. (384) Thus, while criminal antitrust for noncollusion crimes technically remains good law, it may be unconstitutional.</p><p>As a matter of antitrust policy, antitrust is better functioning now as to both procedure and substance than it was during its nadir of the 1950s and 1960s. (385) This is not to say that the current institutional structure and case outcomes of antitrust are perfect--far from it. Rather, antitrust has a workable institutional structure, a singular goal that allows for a more even application of law as to both process and substance. (386) Criminal enforcement for a generation has been limited to those cases that involve \"naked\" collusion--the so called \"hard-core\" cartels where there is direct evidence of illegal activity. (387) Violators of Sherman [section] 1 for collusion regularly go to jail, as they should. (388) However, the changing institutional structure of antitrust towards a more populist approach suffers from a \"nirvana fallacy\" under which feasible policies, as compared to ideal normative policies, are viewed as inherently inefficient because of their various imperfections. (389)</p><p>Antitrust has pushed back from criminal penalties for other types of conduct that are part of daily business behavior and that might chill procompetitive business behavior. (390) Where there are concerns of exclusion or predation, often these cases are ones in which the balance between anticompetitive effects and procompetitive justifications are complex and require a rule of reason analysis. (391) To criminalize behavior that has the potential to be efficient under a rule of reason analysis returns antitrust to an era of business in-hospitability. Such an enforcement regime would chill business risk taking, precisely the sort of risk taking that the Supreme Court has stated to be the very purpose of competition which antitrust is to protect. (392) Worse, after more than a generation of nonenforcement, such enforcement would violate the doctrine of desuetude and present a void for vagueness problem. As such, a return to a more populist antitrust that would recriminalize many forms of business conduct not only presents constitutional problems, but also retards innovation and chills business decision making that may in fact serve to enhance consumer welfare. (393) The potential for jail for practices that have procompetitive behavior would damper such practices, which in turn would hurt consumers. Enhancing consumer welfare is exactly what the antitrust laws are supposed to do. (394)</p><p>D.

Conviction of an offense tends to be regarded as something distinctive; it differs from an adverse civil judgment or an adverse regulatory decision in that it involves public censure for wrongdoing. The link between criminal law and punishment is therefore crucial; punishment, in the sense of the imposition of hard treatment, requires justification, which includes, as a necessary condition, the commission of a crime. This argument can and should be taken further; insofar as the punishment involves restrictions on liberty, and certainly if it involves a deprivation of liberty (e.g., imprisonment), only serious wrongdoing can be a sufficient justification for this.\").</p><p>(44.)

Should the ACCC regulations go forward, Facebook has threatened to remove all news content.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"The ACCC wants to use a kangaroo court arbitration system to force tech giants to subsidise traditional media,\" said ATA Communications Director, Emilio Garcia, \"Facebook's announcement that it would ban all news content from its platform if the ACCC's regulations are implemented is terrifying, but not surprising. \"<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"Government overregulation continues to make running a business in Australia increasingly expensive and risky. The ACCC's action on big tech is no exception. Successful companies struggle to thrive when, at any moment, the government could force them to hand over large portions of their profits to industries in decline.\"</p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>\"The ACCC's regulations give Facebook a choice between eliminating news content on its platform altogether or letting corporate news outlets leach seemingly unlimited sums off of their profits. Few businesses could survive the second choice.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"52 per cent of Australians get their news from social media. As a result, the ACCC's regulations would stop millions from easily accessing news content. Hindering the public's ability to access journalistic sources would have problematic and compounding ramifications.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"The ACCC's regulations are not well thought through, and the implementation of such rules would be messy and complex. Beyond that, we should not accept the premise that the government should have the power to force one company to subsidise another. Once that precedent is set, there is no knowing where it will end. The parliament of Australia must vote down the ACCC's regulations.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-112306</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RY-BPF1-DY1R-B394-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"312\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Willow Bay in Los Angeles.</p><p>VARNEY: Hello, Willow.  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Stuart Varney in New York.</p><p>Our top story tonight, a powerful blue chip bounce as investors await testimony from Alan Greenspan.  The Dow surged today, its first winning session in a week.  One factor fuelling that rally: the hope that when the Fed chairman appears tomorrow before the Senate Banking Committee he will make it clear that more relief on interest rates is on the way.</p><p>The Dow gained 165 points today -- that's 1 1/2 percent.  It closed at 10,946.  Big Board volume was more than a billion shares. But the Nasdaq, well, that was weighed down by fears that the data storage sector is in a slump.  More on that later.  The index gained just 18 points.  It closed the session at 2,489.  The volume on the Nasdaq today, 1.7 billion shares.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 on the upside, again at 15 points, closing out the day at 1,330.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, Chairman Greenspan wasn't the only buzz worthy topic on Wall Street today.  Genomics was also grabbing the spotlight.</p><p>Celera Genomics along with the publicly funded Human Genome Project have published rival genetic maps in a landmark scientific achievement.  Wall Street seemed to be impressed.  Celera jumped more than 6, rallying along with certain other biotech stocks, including Gilead Sciences, Affymetrix, Protein Design Labs and Human Genome Sciences.</p><p>But just how much of today's news is a breakthrough for investors?</p><p>Steve Young reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The two rival groups racing to publish \"the book of life\" finished with a much smaller volume than anyone expected: about 30,000 genes in the human code instead of 100,000.  That could mean the idea that a single gene equals a disease is wrong and that genes work in combination.  If so, pharmaceutical companies could find that their individual gene patents are worth less.</p><p>TODD NELSON, DAIN RAUSCHER WESSELLS: Wall Street should care because we originally said we had 500 drugable targets.  The promise of genomics was to get that to 5,000 to 10,000 drugable targets. There's a relationship between gene discovery and drug discovery.  And now that people think there are fewer genes, is that worth less?</p><p>YOUNG: Nelson says the answer is no.  He thinks with other techniques a larger number of genes still will be discovered.  But even the head of a biotech company that still says there could be 100,000 human genes is cautious about how long it will take to hit paydirt.</p><p>WILLIAM HASELTINE, CEO, HUMAN GENOME SCIENCES: We put it at more like three to five years before the first drugs are out, 10 years before there are many drugs out and 20 years before this type of science changes medicine as we know it.</p><p>YOUNG: Celera, the private company some now say has a better blueprint than the consortium, soared 15 percent on publication of its genetic map.  But the stock's below $50, down from nearly $250 just a year ago.</p><p>Celera's been far more volatile than most biotech stocks in an index Wall Street analysts follow closely.  It's up 20 percent in the same time period.</p><p>It's quite a comedown if humans don't have 100,000 but just 30,000 genes, only twice as many as a worm.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: But the head of the U.S. consortium member says this has to be good news: the genetic haystack is two-thirds smaller -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: That is the optimistic scientific opinion.  Steve Young, thanks. Will this scientific breakthrough led to investment riches? Later in the broadcast, we'll ask the driving force behind Celera, Craig Venter.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, Willow, as we mentioned earlier, tech stocks were held back today on concerns that the data storage business is struggling.  Blame those concerns on one company: Emulex.  Shares of the data storage equipment maker cratered after warning late Friday that some companies were putting off orders.  And if that continued, Emulex said it would not meet quarterly forecasts.</p><p>Emulex today lost a staggering 37 points, nearly 50 percent of its value, coming all the way down to $40 at 40 3/8.  Quite a setback in what's been a rough year for the company victimized, remember, last summer by a hoax that slammed the stock.</p><p>And the damage today was hardly contained to just Emulex.  Let's go to John Metaxas at the Nasdaq marketsite with a look at the Emulex fallout and more -- John.</p><p>JOHN METAXAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Stuart, it really was a mixed session here.  We finished up.  We broke a three-day losing streak at the Nasdaq.  But the Emulex story was a drag early in the trading and counterbalanced by, of course, the strength in the genomics stocks.</p><p>Emulex did affect other companies in the storage -- data storage area, including QLogic.  Emulex was downgraded today by Asha Kumark (ph) at U.S.  Bank Corp Piper Jaffray, who also downgraded QLogic, saying they face same of the same earnings risk: that slowdown in storage technology spending.  QLogic down $15.</p><p>Brocade Communications, a maker of fiber channel switches, down $11 and change despite the fact that they'll be entering the Nasdaq 100 tomorrow.  And McData, a supplier to data storage makers, down $6 on the day.</p><p>Network Appliance, which beat earnings expectations last week by a penny but had disappointing revenues, was actually down $4 1/2 but finished up on the session.</p><p>Biotechs were up 4 percent.  The chip stocks also surged today, and they were some support underneath the Nasdaq.  Intel among the gainer as was Xilinx and Broadcom.  PMC-Sierra continued lower on concerns about that Cisco inventory buildup.  But Applied Materials, a leading chip equipment maker, up better than a dollar.  They report earnings tomorrow.  Some mixed commentary on that stock out of the brokerage community today.</p><p>Looking at our big caps, we had Cisco Systems surging nicely from their gains last week, but the stock is still down 25 percent in the month of February.  Sun, another big gainer among the big caps.  But for those gainers, we had losers in Microsoft and Oracle.</p><p>So it was a mixed session today, concerns about the future earnings, and we're waiting for Greenspan tomorrow -- Stuart, Willow. BAY: We are indeed.  John Metaxas at the Nasdaq marketsite, thanks, John.</p><p>The Emulex effect was not confined to the Nasdaq today.  One of the company's big customers got hit on the Big Board in very heavy trading: EMC.</p><p>Terry Keenan joins us now from the New York Stock Exchange with more on that and all the action today on Wall Street -- Terry.</p><p>TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, I will get to EMC in just a moment.  It's sort of one of the stealth tech stocks here, one of the biggest on the New York Stock Exchange.  Because it isn't included on the Dow, a lot of people forget about it.  They didn't forget about it today.  It was down sharply.</p><p>Let's get to the Dow first.  It posted a triple-digit gain for the second Monday in a row, but you may notice that the Dow still can't make a convincing charge above 11,000.  And that, of course, has been the case now for more than a year.</p><p>Today, investors waiting for an encouraging word from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan tomorrow when he testifies before Congress.  They got some positive words today from Kathy Mynahan (ph), the head of the Boston Fed.  She said that the Fed's two rate cuts this year are already helping out the economy.</p><p>That said, investors today stuck with mostly the safer, more defensive names.  They were the big movers, although 25 of the Dow 30 stocks did manage to gain here today.  Some nice market breadth.</p><p>Here are the standouts: Johnson &amp; Johnson up more than 3 percent after Banc America upgraded the stock from a buy to a strong buy.  IBM also having a good day despite allegations in a new book that Big Blue made $10 million selling equipment to the Nazis during World War II. Didn't hurt the stock today.  Boeing having a strong day as did Wal- Mart.  Its Mexican division reported a 5.2 percent increase in same- store sales.  The stock up more than 5 percent.  And GE also up nearly 5 percent today.  Goldman Sachs' Jack Kelly (ph) listing the stock as one of its favorites -- his favorites.</p><p>And Honeywell, G.E.'s merger partner, also gaining about the same amount today.</p><p>As for the market breadth here, it was positive and very positive as you could see: 19 to 11 in favor of advancers.  Volume did remain on the light; just over a billion shares traded here.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at EMC.  The computer storage company having another tough day on that Emulex news.  Traded down more than $2.  Also news that last week it laid off 3 percent of its workforce. Wall Street had been hoping that the storage sector would be immune to the slowdown in the rest of technology.  That obviously is not the case.  EMC shares have been hammered of late, down almost 50 percent from a high about 100, set last year, and down 18 percent, as you can see year there, year to date -- Stuart. VARNEY: All right.  That's Terry Keenan at the Big Board. Thanks, Terry.</p><p>Thousands of miles away from Wall Street today, a ruling that truly rocked the music industry and fans of Napster. The popular online music swapping service was dealt a blow from a federal court in California, which concluded Napster is infringing on copyrights.  But the service is still up and running.</p><p>Bruce Francis joins us now with the details of today's complex decision.</p><p>What do you have, Bruce?</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Up and running for now, Stuart.</p><p>Bedtime for Napster?  Not yet.  The service stays up and running while a lower court figures out issues like identifying copyrighted files.  But today, the recording industry clearly gained the upper hand in its love-hate -- well, mostly hate -- relationship with Napster.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS (voice-over): No rest for Napster user Peter Sayer this past weekend: a rush to find music before a potential shutdown yielded a bonanza.</p><p>PETER SAYER, NAPSTER USER: Million -- about a million other users run to it as well, and that creates a large volume of shared files so there's more out there to download and we go nuts downloading.</p><p>FRANCIS: Napster, which allows users to exchange recorded music over the Internet, plays on for Sayer and some 50 million other registered users, but perhaps not for long.  A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that an earlier order shutting down Napster has to be modified.  Once it is, though, the service could be halted.</p><p>In a slam-dunk for the recording industry, the Ninth District Court of Appeals found that \"Napster knew or had reason to know of its users' infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights.\"</p><p>Napster CEO Hank Barry vowed to appeal.</p><p>HANK BARRY, CEO, NAPSTER: We believe -- and this is contrary to what the court ruled today -- that Napster users are not copyright infringers, and we will pursue every legal avenue to keep Napster operating.</p><p>FRANCIS: The recording industry, including Warner Music, which like CNN is owned by AOL Time Warner, couldn't be happier.</p><p>HILARY ROSEN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, RIAA: \u2026 that a business model built on infringement is not only morally wrong but legally wrong, and we're very gratified that the Ninth Circuit today agreed with us 100 percent.</p><p>FRANCIS: Last fall, German entertainment giant Bertelsmann broke ranks with the recording industry and invested in Napster and struck a deal to develop a subscription version.  And while he's still too young to legally drown his sorrows over today's ruling in a beer, Napster's founder Shawn Fanning says that effort continues.</p><p>SHAWN FANNING, FOUNDER, NAPSTER: I'm focused on building this better service, and I still hope to have it in place this year.</p><p>FRANCIS: But fans of a free Napster might not stick around.</p><p>MIKE STEINBERG, NAPSTER USER: You know, just as I guess I got into this one, I could easily get into another one if it was the same -- same idea and you wouldn't have to subscribe to it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: And Napster could appeal the injunction and the rest of the decision to the Supreme Court.  If so, the company should hope that attorney David Boies has better luck this time with the nation's highest bench.  Boies last Supreme Court case: the Gore challenge to the Florida election results.</p><p>And Stuart, as for how long this all takes out, more than a few days they're expecting, but probably less than a few months: a narrow window for Napster-lovers.</p><p>VARNEY: Understood.  Bruce, thanks very much.</p><p>And just ahead on MONEYLINE, you've heard the expression any press is good press, but is that true for a former president causing a ruckus on the lecture circuit?</p><p>Also, as the new president pushes his military spending plan, we'll look at which companies may win and lose the war for dollars. Willow and I will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"Tech Watch,\" titans of the digital world gathered in sunny California today at the Goldman Sachs conference, and tried to convince Wall Street that despite the recent slowdown, their business outlook is still bright.</p><p>Casey Wian spent the day there and caught up with some of the tech leaders, including one whose stock was under pressure today on Wall Street -- Casey.</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, it's actually turned cloudy here in La Quinta, California at the Goldman Sachs technology conference, where companies are trying to convince Wall Street analysts and money managers that despite an economic slowdown and a weak performance by technology stocks, their business prospects remain bright. This morning, the conference got under way with a keynote speech by Thomas Siebel, chairman and CEO of Siebel Systems.  His company makes customer relationship management software, known as CRM.  Siebel says there's a fundamental shift under way at the companies who are his customers -- automakers, banks and telecoms -- that will keep his business strong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THOMAS SIEBEL, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, SIEBEL SYSTEMS: In the future, the way that they're going to do business is any way the customer wants to do business, any time, any place, any language, any currency, any channel: over the Internet, through retail, through the call center, over the Web, and the Web TV, the kiosk, what have you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WIAN: Siebel says he expects the CRM market to grow to about $6.8 billion this year.  That's 50 percent over -- 50 percent growth over last year.</p><p>Another presentation came from -- excuse me -- EMC Chairman Mike Reuttgers.  He warned against what he called a wall of worry that's standing in the way of technology stocks.  Reuttgers says he's seen little evidence of any pullback in technology spending by the companies he deals with, because, as he put it, the smart companies are going to spend right through this economic downturn.  He also talked about the debate over a hard or soft economic landing.  He says neither of those is likely to happen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE REUTTGERS, CHAIRMAN, EMC: I don't think it's either a hard landing or a soft landing.  If there's only a two-quarter slowdown, people are going to want to accelerate out the other side.  So I've called it a touch-and-go landing, where you let the wheels touch and then you accelerate out of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WIAN: Despite all that rosy talk, EMC and other storage stocks were dragged down by what happened to Emulex, which you talked about earlier, Willow.  And we will be hearing from Emulex executives at this conference tomorrow and they'll be subjected to, I'm sure, some very tough questioning -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: All right, Casey, we're looking forward to that tomorrow. Casey Wian reporting, thanks.</p><p>Coming up next, Southern California's struggling utility gets its day in court.  Will the company be allowed to raise rates on customers?  We'll give you the details on the decision.  Stuart and I will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) VARNEY: Ford and Navistar are hitching up.  The two industry heavyweights announced today plans for a joint venture to build commercial trucks at Navistar's facility in Mexico.  The trucks will be marketed and sold separately in the U.S.  The companies said they will also explore opportunities in smaller commercial vehicles and diesel engines as well.</p><p>The move comes as demand for trucks has been running out of steam.  Navistar stock, which is off 35 percent from its 52-week high, lost another 86 cents today while Ford picked up 88 cents.</p><p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed</p><p>BAY: In other corporate headlines today, oil services giant Schlumberger agreed to buy information technology firm Sema for 5.2 billion.  Schlumberger will use Sema to expand its IT strategy, a business it wants to build further and is hoping will generate more stable revenue.</p><p>But investors panned the deal and Schlumberger stock lost more than $9 to close at 69.  Sema gained just better than two.</p><p>Potomac Electric Power Company agreed to buy Delaware-based utility, Conectiv for about 2.2 billion.  If approved, the deal will allow Potomac to have a transmission system that runs between Washington, D.C. and Wilmington, Delaware, a key link that would make it one of the largest electricity delivery companies on the East Coast.</p><p>On the news, Potomac stock gained 50 cents and Connectiv also powered higher up more than 1 1/4.</p><p>Today, a Southern California judge dealt a blow to the state's second-largest electrical utility, ruling against Socal Edison's request to raise rates on customers.  The company, deep in debt, asked the judge to let it hike retail prices because wholesale prices have soared, costing the utility billions.  Most retail rates in the state have been capped since the industry was deregulated back in 1996.</p><p>Today's decision was a setback to the utility, but it's not over yet.  The two sides go back to court in March to schedule a full trial on the issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL LOCKYEAR, ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF CALIFORNIA: Rates could have been substantially increased today depending on what the federal court did, and so the fact that the court on abstained from entering an order that the plaintiffs requested is good for rate payers, but there's still lots and lots of further work that needs to be done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAY: Let's take a look at how California's electrical utilities did today.  Both PG and Edison International, which owns Southern California Edison, fell sharply after the decision, but trimmed their losses to end off less than one.</p><p>VARNEY: And coming up on MONEYLINE, Attorney General John Ashcroft wades into the Marc Rich presidential pardon controversy. We'll tell you about his first news conference and his new role after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Profile,\" Craig Venter, the president of Celera Genomics.  The man who once flirted with becoming a professional surfer instead joined the Navy in 1965, where he served as a medical corpsman in Vietnam.</p><p>In 1975, he earned his doctorate in physiology and pharmacology. In 1984, he joined the National Institutes of Health.  In '98, he launched Celera, and two years later, finished the first rough draft of the human genome.</p><p>Venter has left open the door to possibly studying his own genetic makeup.  His response: \"Why not if that's the business I'm in?\"</p><p>Mr. Venter joins us in our next half hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Attorney General John Ashcroft is suggesting that he'd work with Congress on its investigation of the Marc Rich pardon.  More on that now from Wolf Blitzer in the \"MONEYLINE News Digest\" -- Wolf.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Stuart.  It was John Ashcroft's first news conference as attorney general.  He wouldn't comment directly on whether the Justice Department should name a special counsel to investigate former President Clinton's controversial pardon.  But he did describe the president's right to pardon as -- quote -- \"very substantial.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN ASHCROFT, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: When a president exercises that right, he operates, I would hope, within the limits of the Constitution, and there are very few limits in that respect.  And I don't believe that I can reach a conclusion beyond that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: Ashcroft said he would take seriously a House committee's request to grant immunity for Rich's ex-wife, Denise, in exchange for her testimony.  He added that immunity has complicated prosecutions like Iran-Contra, but said he'll bear that in mind if Congress needs to go ahead and do its work.</p><p>In Georgia today, President Bush today visited troops at Fort Stewart and spelled out his plans to spend more money on the military.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today I'm announcing that are proposed 2002 budget will add $5.7 billion in new spending on the people of our military.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: The budget proposal includes money to boost pay and benefits for service personnel.  Also today, rescue crews say the search for nine people missing in Friday's submarine accident off Hawaii may end shortly.  Investigators say they're focusing on why the USS Greenville wasn't using its most accurate sonar when it surfaced into a Japanese fishing boat.</p><p>And a study by federal investigators has found that U.S. airlines are taking steps to improve customer service, but they're still not addressing the biggest cause of dissatisfaction, delayed and canceled flights.</p><p>Finally, ready for its closeup, the asteroid Eros.  NASA successfully landed its picture-snapping NEAR probe on the 21-mile- long space rock today.  It's the first landing ever by a spacecraft on an asteroid.</p><p>And I'll have much more on those stories and the rest of the day's top stories on WOLF BLITZER REPORTS, including an interview with Ralph Nader.  That's at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 on the West Coast -- Stuart and Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Wolf.</p><p>Coming up in our second half hour, much more on the market action.  And a preview of Alan Greenspan's testimony tomorrow and a look at why two rate cuts from the Fed has not yet lit a fire under the market.</p><p>And later, Clinton and the speaking circuit, another Wall Street giant gears up for the former president: Is it worth the controversy? We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's headlines, a federal appeals court deals a body blow to Napster, holding the online music service responsible for copyright violations.  But a court lets the music play on, for now. And Wall Street waits for Alan Greenspan to address the Senate tomorrow.  Will the Fed chairman drop any signals about interest rate policy going forward?</p><p>Plus, as one Wall Street powerhouse regrets inviting citizen Clinton, others line up to hear from the former president: why speaking fees may keep on coming through all the controversies.</p><p>VARNEY: For those of you just joining us, let's get a quick check on today's market action.  Blue chip stocks kicked off the week on a tear, posting a triple-digit surge as investors scrambled for the security of some old economy stalwarts.</p><p>The Dow rose from the get-go, driven by financial and retailing shares to gain 165 points, moving up to 10,946, and the volume topped a billion shares.  Tech stocks also turned their back on early losses, picking up some steam to end 18 points higher at 2,489.  1.7 billion shares moved on the Nasdaq.  In the broader market, the S&amp;P 500, a move up there of some 15 points.</p><p>But investors spent the day on edge, waiting for key testimony tomorrow from the Fed chairman.  Kitty Pilgrim reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was a bargain basement sale for Dow stocks with all the earmarks of a markdown sale. Big-name stocks such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Wal-Mart, Boeing, G.E., and IBM managed nice gains.</p><p>The comeback couldn't come at a better moment.  The Dow closed last week just below break-even for the year.  Today's rally put it back in the black.</p><p>For the Nasdaq, today's gain did little.  The index is still down 12 percent since the end of January, when the Fed last lowered interest rates, failing to offset market pessimism.</p><p>ART HOGAN, JEFFERIES &amp; COMPANY: I think what had happened was we bought the market anticipation of the rate cut and we did so much so that I think we had a natural aftereffect of you buy -- you buy on the rumor and sell on the news.</p><p>PILGRIM: Now, because the market didn't rally after the Fed's last rate cut, many think the upside is limited.  Earnings have been abysmal and tax season may cut into investment capital.</p><p>GREG WARR, GREGORY D. WARR &amp; COMPANY: We're seeing minor rallies as far as money managers going in and trying to scoop up stocks, but there's really no support.</p><p>PILGRIM: Despite selling since the last rate cut, investors will be turning to their economic guru, expecting reaffirmation.  The Fed will stay aggressive on rates.  Every lens from camera to microscopic will be on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan when he heads to Capitol Hill tomorrow.</p><p>RICHARD CRIPPS, LEGG MASON: I don't think that he can say much other than the fact that the market is expecting that the Fed is going to cut interest rates one or two if not even three more times, do what it has to do to get the economy to go.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PILGRIM: Market watchers say the Fed chairman will be walking a fine line.  He needs to indicate that the expected rate cuts will be coming without being too pessimistic about economic growth -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: A fine line indeed.  Kitty Pilgrim, thanks very much.</p><p>Well, the markets have indeed been in the doldrums since the Fed's last move on concerns over the state of the economy and also corporate profits.  But our next sees some light at the end of the tunnel and suggests this may be the time to step out there and buy.</p><p>We're now joined Ron Hill, equity strategist At Brown Brothers Harriman.  Ron, welcome back.</p><p>RON HILL, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN: Nice to be here, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Is your advice flat-out buy stocks now?  If you've got money on the side, put it into stocks, invest fully now?</p><p>HILL: Yes, and the reason is because we're at the start of a liquidity lift by the Fed.  There have been 13 liquidity cycles in the last 50 years, and the average gain within one year of the start of that cycle has been 40 percent on the S&amp;P 500.  Worst year was 30 percent.  Best year 67 percent.</p><p>VARNEY: So you're simply saying, look, on a historical basis you cannot fight the Fed on the upside or the downside, the Fed is lowering rates, get in there and buy because it will have a market impact flatout?</p><p>HILL: That's right.  What happens is P/E ratings are going to expand, profits are going to be lousy, but the profits are going down for the same reason that the Fed is lowering rates.  The economy is weak and the liquidity comes in there.  The money supply is growing three times faster than the nominal economy right now.  That's a lot of extra buying power to come into financial assets.</p><p>VARNEY: Why are tech stocks lagging behind old-economy Dow industrial type stocks?</p><p>HILL: Well, they've obviously had a tremendous run.  And if you actually look at last year, it was sort of really a year of two markets.  The New York Stock Exchange composite hit a low in March while the Nasdaq hit a high, and then they sort of reversed.  The New York Stock Exchange actually hit a new all-time high in September.</p><p>The Nasdaq is still suffering after a huge blow off top.  But at the same point in time, now you should begin to think about what happens early in the food chain of technology as companies like the semiconductor equipment makers begin to look for orders coming down from the Intels and things like that.  Orders beget, sales beget profits, and by then the stocks have already moved.  That's one of the reasons you should be watching them now.</p><p>VARNEY: Are those the kind of stocks that you would jump into right now? Over and above old-economy stocks, no, you would go for technology flat-out?</p><p>HILL: You'd be going for technology and also for retail. Retail actually moves ahead of technology when you get this return to a more cyclical type name in the stock market.  So, look at retailers led by sort of the specialty apparel companies, which have already started to move, companies like American Eagle Outfitters, Pacific Sunwear.  These should be the flying wedge that lead the retailers higher.  As that happens, traditionally what you do is you begin to step away from your health care bet and then you start to look for the timing for the big tech move.</p><p>VARNEY: The premise of your argument is that the economy is going to go down like that and then come straight -- it's a V.  That's the premise of your argument, isn't it?</p><p>HILL: Well, it's a V, but it's sort of a low takeoff.  It's -- one of our guys called a modified \"VU,\" because, you know, the second quarter is not going to be anything to write home about, but by the fourth quarter we're probably back toward 3 1/2 percent growth rate on a quarterly annualized rate.</p><p>And remember, that's sort of where the Fed would really like to see us.  That's their long-term sustainable level of noninflationary growth for this economy.</p><p>VARNEY: It's not the old days, 1999, is it?</p><p>HILL: No, Stuart.  It certainly isn't that.  But you know, with the Fed on your side, it's a good time to be looking at stocks again.</p><p>VARNEY: Quick question: Have you ever recommended a gold stock in the last 10 years?</p><p>HILL: No, sir.</p><p>VARNEY: And will you in the next 10?</p><p>HILL: I hope not.</p><p>VARNEY: Ron Hill, always a pleasure.  Thank you very much.</p><p>HILL: Thank you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: And here's what's just ahead for you.  As President Bush considers his military budget, how much do military contractors and defense contractors, investors receive?  How much do they stand to cash in on this one?  We'll tell you.</p><p>Plus, can former President Clinton keep up the earning power given to protests that dogged his recent speech?  We will be back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Today's moves lifted the S&amp;P 500 back into positive territory for the year.  But the broader market may have a major challenge ahead, to post the kind of bull run that would make investors forget about a miserable 2000.</p><p>Terry Keenan down at the New York Stock Exchange takes a look \"Behind the Numbers\" -- Terry. KEENAN: Well, Willow, we just heard it from Ron Hill, and it is the conventional wisdom on Wall Street these days that while earnings will likely be flat or even worse this year, stock prices will go up as investors anticipate an economic and earnings recovery in 2002.  In fact, last week, two of Wall Street's leading bulls stuck with their most aggressive price targets even as they cut earnings estimates.</p><p>Abby Joseph Cohen, for example, says that she's sticking with her S&amp;P 500 price target of 1,650 by year's end even though consensus profit estimates have dropped.  Ed Kerschner, the market strategist at UBS Warburg, is even more optimistic with a target of 1,715, or a P/E of 30 by year's end.</p><p>Well, if that sounds expensive, history shows that it is. According to Ned Davis Research, the price/earnings ratio on the S&amp;P 500 has averaged just 14 since 1929, and has fallen to single digits at the start of every major bull market in the 1950s, 1970s and early 1980s.</p><p>Only once, according to the folks at Ned Davis, did a bull run begin with a P/E above 20, and that was in 1998 when the Federal Reserve flooded the system with liquidity.  In fact, at today's closing price, the S&amp;P 500 sports a P/E ratio of 24.8, right where it was in the summer of 19998.  But back then, earnings were still rising, and today they aren't.</p><p>The bottom line, while multiples tend to expand in advance of an economic upturn, as Ron Hill just mentioned, this time prices are already at exalted levels relative to their historical norm.  It's one reason why more cautious observers on Wall Street, such as Byron Ween (ph) of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, worry that the Fed can't cut rates fast enough to compensate for the big fall-off in earnings growth.</p><p>And Stuart, of course, the S&amp;P 500 is only part of the story. The Nasdaq is even more expensive on a historical basis.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, it certainly is, and Terry Keenan, thanks very much.  At the Big Board for us, Terry Keenan.</p><p>Well, today, President Bush turned his attention to military spending.  The commander in chief took his first flight on Air Force One as president to visit troops in Georgia.</p><p>Last year, defense stocks soared in anticipation of a Bush presidency.  How might they fare now that the details of his military spending plans are becoming clear.</p><p>Fred Katayama takes a look in tonight's \"Sector Report.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Bush promised to boost pay for soldiers after he reviewed the troops for the first time as commander.</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our nation can never fully repay our debt to you, but we can give you our full support, and my administration will.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The president has said he would not ask for money until a complete review of the Pentagon is completed, and he's hinted that the defense budget would only grow slightly.  Analysts do not expect a huge run-up in defense stocks this year.</p><p>JON KUTLER, QUARTERDECK INVESTMENT PARTNERS: Under a Bush administration, I think companies are more concerned about what programs will be cut in order to fund other ones.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Two areas many analysts bet Mr. Bush will fund are the $60 billion national missile defense system and electronics.</p><p>PIERRE CHAO, CS FIRST BOSTON: \u2026 that this administration is very focused on national missile defense and they're going to go ahead with that program.  That's going to benefit players like Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and TRW.  The other area that's very clear that they're pushing ahead in is wanting to move on toward next generation technologies, and one of the underlying elements of all those technologies, a lot of defense electronics and information systems.  That plays to a Raytheon or Northrup Grumman, an L3 Communications.</p><p>KATAYAMA: But Boeing and its partner, Textron, could lose out on their $30 billion V-22 Osprey, the aircraft that lifts off like a helicopter and flies like a plane.</p><p>ROBERT FRIEDMAN, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: The reason why I think this program is highly vulnerable for a total cancellation is that there were unfortunately four accidents in which there were several fatalities.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The Army's heavy tank, the Crusader, could get crushed because it was designed to combat antiquated Cold War strategies.  The contractors behind that program, General Dynamics and a firm controlled by the Carlisle Group.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATAYAMA: Overall, analysts say it's hard to pick individual winners and losers.  Given the rash of mergers, only half a dozen major players are left, and they now make an array of hardware.  As one analyst put it, cutting one program to free up money for another is like taking money out of the left pocket and putting it into the right pocket.</p><p>Now, checking out how defense issues made out in today's trading, it was a mixed bag.  Boeing delivered a strong showing to the upside, rising more than one.  Northrup Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon all fell a fraction -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: All right, Fred, we'll keep an eye on those.  Fred Katayama reporting.</p><p>Coming up next, it is bound to become a bestseller, the debut of the book of life.  We'll talk with the man in charge of Celera Genomics version, Craig Venter, when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Shares of biotech youngster Celera Genomics Group jumped 15 percent today on the publication of its landmark and controversial map of the human genome, a cheat-sheet for human DNA.</p><p>Joining us from Washington to discuss this milestone, Craig Venter, president of Celera.</p><p>Craig, welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>CRAIG VENTER, PRESIDENT, CELERA GENOMICS: Thank you.  How are you?</p><p>BAY: And I should say congratulations on a major historic scientific breakthrough.  Of course, everybody on Wall Street is interested what the implications are for investors.  Can you tell us, first of all, when we'll start to see drugs and treatments based on this map?</p><p>VENTER: Well, I think there's a number of things already in the works around the world based on earlier parts of genomics.  But I think that what this new data tells us is the next steps are going to be a little bit more complicated and need new tools, new advanced analyses.</p><p>For example, we're setting up to do million protein sequences a day to really try and examine the next phase, because as you heard earlier today, we found far fewer genes than most people expected, which means the protein world and dissecting that is going to be a very key step for really developing new and advanced diagnostics and therapeutics.</p><p>BAY: So, Craig, let me ask you a question about that new discovery.  So then are you suggesting that because there are 30,000 as opposed to the conventional wisdom of 100,000-or-so, it will be more complicated to devise treatments based on the map or less?</p><p>VENTER: It's going to actually be ironically more complicated. I think when people thought about having 100,000 or more genes, they thought about we would have one gene perhaps for every major trait, every major disease, every major biological function.  So it was sort of linear thinking.</p><p>That's not how our physiology actually works.  In fact, because there's fewer genes, we're going to see this larger expansion, much more regulation.  It's going to be the control of the proteins, the protein-protein interactions.  That's why we announced a few weeks ago this new interaction with the U.S. government, the Sandia Labs, Compaq Computer and Celera to try and build now the world's largest supercomputer to try and deconvolute all this complex information.  We can't just do it a gene at a time anymore.</p><p>BAY: You make money by selling access to your database to allow companies to navigate the maps.  So what does today's publication of the map mean for your revenue stream?</p><p>VENTER: I think it's going to get more people interested in understanding the next phases of biology.  Having that map in front of them is going to be difficult for any scientist just to work on their one little spot, which they could do before without knowing all this information really existed.  We're entering to this new holistic view of biology, where we have to look at all the genes, all the proteins in context.  That's why we're alive and how we're alive.  And for scientists to do that, they're going to have to have these new computer tools, the new high-end informatics, the ability to navigate through this information.</p><p>So we think it's going to drive this business forward much more rapidly.</p><p>BAY: Clearly a complex and historic discovery.  Craig Venter of Celera Genomics, thanks for joining us.</p><p>VENTER: Thank you very much.</p><p>BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE, citizen Clinton on the speaking circuit.  Will recent controversies put a crimp or give added life to the former president's drawing power?</p><p>VARNEY: Plus, with Alan Greenspan heading to Capitol Hill tomorrow, we'll ask our financial editor, Myron Kandel, what the markets will want to be hearing.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: His presence sparked a firestorm at his first major speaking engagement after leaving the White House.  But while one Wall Street house says it now regrets hosting citizen Clinton, another major firm is sticking by its plan to pay top dollar to hear from the former president.</p><p>As Susan Lisovicz reports, the ongoing controversies surrounding Mr. Clinton may only enhance his worth on the lecture circuit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PROTESTER: We want the people (UNINTELLIGIBLE), Mr. Clinton,</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Angry protesters referring to the latest controversy surrounding former President Bill Clinton outside his speaking engagement last week in Boca Raton.  Even as a retired president, Mr. Clinton is still a lightning rod, and that's one reason he is so coveted on the speaking circuit.</p><p>But the Wall Street brokerage giant Morgan Stanley Dean Witter now says it regrets it paid the former president $100,000 to speak at that private conference in Boca Raton.  Morgan's chairman and CEO Philip Purcell sent an e-mail to complaining customers that said \"We made a mistake,\" that the firm \"should have thought twice before the speaking invitation was extended, especially in light of Mr. Clinton's actions in leaving the White House.\" Credit Suisse First Boston is also reportedly paying the former president a six-figure fee for a speaking engagement later this month. And political experts say Mr. Clinton's continuing controversies won't diminish his opportunities in the future, either.</p><p>KARLYN BOWMAN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: He'll have a lot of speaking engagements, and I think the one that he had at Morgan Stanley reflects the deep division of opinion that there is about this president.  On the one hand, Americans approve very strongly of the job that he did as president.  But on the other, they don't think he's honest and trustworthy.</p><p>LISOVICZ: A source knowledgeable with Morgan Stanley's conference says a small number of the dozens of clients who complained closed their accounts in protest.  The source says Mr. Clinton's speaking performance, however, was widely regarded as wonderful by people in attendance.</p><p>Many veteran political experts say even if U.S. firms get cold feet about booking public citizen Bill Clinton in the near future, overseas businesses won't.</p><p>PHILIP FREIDMAN, POLITICAL CONSULTANT PJP ADVISORS: If he were to spend the next year touring foreign countries and giving speeches, there is no end to the amount of money that he could make and no end to the amount of applause that he would receive.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISOVICZ: And financial compensation is important to the former president after a long career as a public servant.  CNN has learned that Mr. Clinton may now be setting his office in Harlem at a cost that would be less than half that of an office space he had been considering in midtown Manhattan -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, Susan Lisovicz reporting in New York.  Thank you, Susan.</p><p>Now, Mr. Greenspan goes to Washington tomorrow, exactly one month and 10 days after shocking the financial world with a half point interest rate cut that came in between Federal Reserve meetings. Since then, however, the stock market's gone virtually nowhere.</p><p>Well, Mr. Greenspan speaks again tomorrow.  What could be the market reaction?  Could we start to see some kind of reaction tomorrow?</p><p>Here with his thoughts on that, Myron Kandel, financial editor. What is going to happen?</p><p>MYRON KANDEL, CNNFN FINANCIAL EDITOR: Well, Stuart, there's an old \"Bing Cosby\" song that said \"Accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative.\" And I think that's the approach that Alan Greenspan is going to take tomorrow when he testifies to the Senate Banking Committee. Now, he really scared folks when he talked about the economy slowing to zero growth, right, and I think tomorrow he's talking not only to the senators on the committee but to the American consumer, because consumer confidence has really tumbled and Greenspan is very aware that consumer confidence is what -- is what is going to determine the course of the economy.</p><p>So I think he's going to look at the glass being half full rather than half empty as we get into the second half of this year, and I think that will be good for the stock market.</p><p>VARNEY: Do you think that tomorrow's speech, tomorrow's presentation is very, very important for starting the stock market off on a nice rally?  Does it start tomorrow?</p><p>KANDEL: It started today, I think, and it gets accentuated tomorrow.  I think we get above 11,000 for the first time since September at the close.  And then, you know, once we're at in 11,000, 12,000 can't be far behind, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: And you said that many times.</p><p>KANDEL: Yeah.</p><p>VARNEY: Myron Kandel, thank you very much.</p><p>Up next, \"Ahead of the Curve\": some of what you need to know tonight before those markets open again tomorrow.  Willow and I return in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Taking a look at some of what could move the markets tomorrow: All eyes will be on Washington as Alan Greenspan testifies before Congress on the state of the economy.  Also watch for earnings from Applied Materials.  Investors are looking for 63 cents per share plus quarterly reports from BP Amoco and Sycamore Networks.</p><p>And tomorrow, tune into \"Ahead of the Curve\": Hugh Johnson of First Albany will give his take on the economy ahead of Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony.</p><p>VARNEY: And finally tonight, one week after a strong debut performance, NBC's Saturday night XFL matchup was sacked by a remake of the popular classic \"The Parent Trap.\" Viewers chose Walt Disney over the wrestling-meets-football offering by a wide margin.  Ratings for the XFL fell 55 percent from last week's standout performance. That's according to Nielsen's overnight numbers.</p><p>In addition to losing viewers, the game also lost power.  A generator in an NBC truck ran out of juice, cutting the signal of the game for most of the first quarter.  The outage had nothing to do with the continuing power crisis in California.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, thank you.  As a West Coast resident, I appreciate you pointing that out.

Khanna talks tech jobs across America with Prime Minister Tony Blair, Microsoft CEO Brad Smith at Web Summit</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>Washington: Office of the MP Ro Khanna has issued the following news release:</p><p>This week, Rep. Ro Khanna, member of the House Oversight Committee and Congressional Representative for Silicon Valley, participated in the 2019 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal.</p><p>Rep. Khanna joined two of Web Summit\u2019s robustly attended panels. The first, \u201cNone left behind: Making tech work for the many\u201d was a fireside chat in conversation with former Prime Minister Tony Blair. The second, \u201cRebuilding trust in tech\u201d was a conversation with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith. Khanna had several individual conversations with speakers while there, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who touted his efforts and innovation.</p><p>Rep. Khanna has traveled across rural America discussing opportunities to bring technology jobs into communities left behind and mapping out a future for the global economy. Rep. Khanna, in early 2020, will introduce a bill that will establish a grant program to build up tech-related schooling opportunities in the middle America \u2013 legislating his vision of transition to innovation-based economies. His plan entails a multibillion-dollar investment inspired by Morrill Act of 1862. Khanna has traveled to several economically distressed cities in Kentucky, West Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina and South Carolina. There, Rep. Khanna has partnered with local lawmakers to bring Silicon Valley representatives to meet with local businesses and universities to help form partnerships.</p><p>\u201cThe reality is that technology has enriched our lives in so many ways. In enhancing communication, enhancing the promise of medicine, enhancing the possibility of information. And yet that innovation and wealth has been concentrated in a few areas. And people in Silicon Valley are increasingly aware that many have been left out in rural America, in minority communities\u2026. Our country will fall apart if we don\u2019t integrate and provide those opportunities to these places that have been left out. Put simply, no child should be forced to leave their hometown to get a good job.</p><p>How are we going to create new jobs given the technology revolution? What are we going to do to make sure there\u2019s not geographic inequality? What are we going to do to have thoughtful regulations, so democracy is enhanced, not undermined, based on these new platforms? So, my view is that the central question of governance is how are we going to have thoughtful economic policy, thoughtful regulation, to deal with the technology revolution, and that\u2019s sorely missing in Congress.</p><p>Our politics are either about the restoration of the past, or an embrace of the future. At a very simple level, Donald Trump is saying \u2018let\u2019s go back to the past, let\u2019s go back to the way life used to be,\u2019 and if you believe, as I do, in a multi-cultural democracy\u2026 you have to convince people that technology and the future is going to be a force for good in their lives, not a force of disruption. That to me is the central challenge for modern politics,\u201d said Rep. Khanna.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great pleasure to be with Ro as well, whose work I admire greatly. The people being left behind are the people who don\u2019t understand how technology is changing the world, who feel that the force of globalization is passing them by. The big challenge\u2026 is how do you get the changemakers and the policymakers together.</p><p>Today, the question of technology should run throughout government. My view is you need to reorder politics around handling this technological revolution\u2026. the problem today is that you\u2019ve got a real world revolution in this room, and you\u2019ve got politics in the other room, and the question is how you put that together.</p><p>Technology is more than about Big Tech. It\u2019s about all those companies that are being created now, that are doing new things, that are innovating. We need that energy to be in the political room as well . . . a lot of the time these guys want to be as far away from government as possible, I understand that. But it\u2019s necessary for the politicians to understand the world in order that they make the right policy. And this dislocation between the revolution that\u2019s happening on the ground and the political debate is worrying and it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d said Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2590622</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFS-7661-JDG9-Y0CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"708\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Banks, already under pressure to explain why they have not passed on the full 75 basis point drop in the cash rate this year to borrowers, have been criticised for continuing to charge longstanding customers more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are not saying in any way it is illegal; we are not in any way saying it is unethical,\" Sims says. \"We are just saying to consumers, be aware if you stay with one entity, be it banking, be it energy, over time and you're not inquiring about better rates,\" Sims says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His position is intended to signal a lack of competition in the mortgage market, but not a regulator that is hot to trot to intervene.</p><p>In electricity, in contrast, there has been heavy intervention in the market. \"We could show you where a 45 per cent discount was a worse deal than zero discount, so it was completely confusing. The electricity industry let that get out of hand. I have a lot of evidence that they think so, too.\" Sims says that situation was not true of banking. \"With banking we are saying to customers 'look, you might save a few basis points if you ring them up and say I'm thinking of moving'.\" Where Sims could well call for intervention is in his upcoming recommendations on water trading in the Murray-Darling Basin.</p><p>Australia leads the world with the most advanced market but in recent months, exacerbated by the drought, emotions have run hot, with accusations of unconscionable conduct by water hoarders as prices have skyrocketed. The ACCC spent November consulting throughout the Murray-Darling basin. \"I guess the issue is: has it got more sophisticated than the nature of the market can handle?\" Sims asks.</p><p>He contrasts the water market with the foreign exchange market, where he says an arbitrage play would typically be a sign that the market is working well. \"Pardon the pun - the water market is pretty illiquid, because it is really 40 markets connected by rivers when they flow or don't flow. The question we have to address is, is it too thin a market to cater for how it now works?\" Sims is unmoved by the politics. \"We are too early into this to indicate what we might recommend to government, but I don't think we will be constrained by sovereign risk issues. Given how we understand how this market works, we will try to solve what is the right way it should work.\" Sims finishes the year delighted, he says, with the government's response to his digital platforms review. He bats off any criticism that his central recommendation - a \"voluntary\" code between the likes of Google and Facebook and traditional media - will be ineffective, given the form of big tech.</p><p>\"I think there's been a misunderstanding here. The word voluntary underplays that it will be enforceable and there's an imperative to get something done because there is a big stick at the end of it.\" That big stick is the threat of a government-mandated code by next November if the carve-up of the rivers of gold is not sorted by then.</p><p>Sims has healthy doubts about digital. He famously would not have an Amazon Alexa at home, he mistrusts Google's assurances on Fitbit data as part of its $2.1bn takeover, and he has taken Google to court this year over alleged misleading of customers on the treatment of their location data. By the release of the draft report in July, Sims had five in-depth investigations running into big tech.</p><p>Sims is looking to shift the dial in consumer protection, with a far greater weight on fairness that will alarm business. Sims argues that judges have understandably interpreted unconscionable conduct narrowly, at a time when society wants to deal with what is unfair.</p><p>\"Let's say on a digital platform that a scam is being run that Facebook knows about and they don't do anything to take it down. Now is that unconscionable? No, it would not amount to unconscionable. Is it unfair? Well, people are suffering detriment. Why don't you take it down?</p><p>\"If what we're worried about is customers being treated unfairly, my view is, don't bring in a whole lot of laws. I worry we're trying to legislate for particular things when, if there's behaviour we don't want, just make that illegal. If what we're trying to do is stamp out unfairness in the marketplace, why don't we just say so?\" Any move to a threshold of fairness would be seen as a dramatic change in business and could lead to the same sort of rearguard action as the controversial Section 46 \"effects\" test on market power. \"Well that was irrational as well,\" Sims says. \"I understand that would be the reaction from many, but I don't think it is. I don't think business does itself any favours by opposing everything that comes along. My message to them is, if you can see the wider benefit, just endorse it even though it might not be in your particular interest, because then you have more credibility for opposing things when there are really things that should not happen.\" One of the most contentious actions under way is the regulator's criminal cartel conduct case against ANZ, Citi and Deutsche on alleged syndicate behaviour. Under scrutiny is the grant-ing of immunity to JPMorgan, whose executives, along with ACCC personnel, are being grilled. \"Obviously with cartels you are talking about covert behaviour where it is hard to work out what is going on. So every competition regulator around the world that we would identify with has these immunity programs.\" Whatever the regulator achieves, he can be sure of one thing: more complaints about petrol. Why is there no big stick for petrol pricing? \"Good question,\" Sims grins. \"It is the dominant criticism, every time we announce something there is always a Twitter feed of 'well that's hopeless - what are you doing about petrol?'\"\" Sims says people, including some members of parliament, misunderstand the law. \"People understandably say 'I saw signs for $1.20 three days ago and now it's $1.50. The world oil price hasn't gone up, I'm getting ripped off, what's the ACCC doing about it?' \"Well firstly, that form of ripping off is not illegal. When the price is at the bottom of the cycle, it is an unusually good deal and when it is at the top of the cycle, it is a lousy deal, so if you average it through the year, are petrol prices too high?</p><p>\"You can quibble about 1c or 2c, 3c, but that is all you're talking about. You are not getting ripped off by 30c. You are if you buy at the top of the cycle and we have our website to help people avoid that.\"Ticky Fullerton is Sky News Business Editor and co-anchor of Business Weekend, Sundays at 11am on Sky News Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-919f5c601eee11eaa66677545c0b2609d217cfa0fd941f91210ed942c851a42c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRP-DM01-JD3N-51W8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1152\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001819</classCode><className>WATER RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REQ5NzhGQjlGRUY3NEU0M0FCQTQwMDMyOTAxMTlENzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk</classCode><className>Water Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X57</classCode><className>CONSUMER LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDJBNDY2Rjc3Mzk4NDI3NUJDOTlCQTRCNzE2M0IwRTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU</classCode><className>Consumer Protection</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926110GJ</classCode><className>CONSUMER PROTECTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DDG6</classCode><className>CONSUMER WATCHDOGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001149</classCode><className>MISCONDUCT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000680</classCode><className>EXTERNAL DEBT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009TR5</classCode><className>CUSTOMER ACQUISITION STRATEGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST00093KS</classCode><className>SOVEREIGN RISK</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DEZ9</classCode><className>FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

This is driven by the continued uncertainty in the macro environment which, in our view, also reflects in the divergent performance of some big tech names such as Cisco. This year, IT budgets are likely to be used up completely unlike in CY09 which saw only 70-75% of the budgeted amount being spent. Further, CY10 volumes have not only benefited from underinvestment in the previous years leading to some pent up demand, but have also seen increased spending related to regulatory/compliance issues. While select accounts have seen some higher pricing, on a blended basis, pricing remains stable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Offshoring gaining traction:</emphasis> Europe contributes 22% of Infosys` total revenues and the management indicated that exposure to the troubled European nations is limited as UK/Germany/France is the key markets for Infosys. Also, its exposure to public and government projects in these markets is limited. The management noted that demand is cost-structure driven, as certain verticals such as retail are under an increasing pressure to optimise costs. This is also notably leading to greater push for Offshoring in Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outlook:</emphasis> While IT budgets are likely to be finalised by Jan-Feb `10, early discussions suggest that budgets could be flattish. There has been some pick-up in discretionary spends and verticals such as manufacturing and retail are witnessing improved spends. In the telecom space, OEM spends are still under check but specific service providers are likely to see better spends. Further as per the management, tech spends are likely to be driven by continued focus of corporates towards enhancing their competitiveness, regulatory compliance and M&amp;A given high cash balances with large companies.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.myiris.com/shares/research/RCML/ESCORTS_20101202.pdf\">http://www.myiris.com/shares/research/RCML/ESCORTS_20101202.pdf</url> Click here to view full report </p><p>Disclaimer: IRIS has taken due care and caution in compilation of data for its web site.

Trump, 2019</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">July 11, 2019</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please sit down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to thank you all for being here, very special day, very important day. Many of you are friends, and many of you are friends that I don't know what you look like, but I know what you sound like-[laughter]-which, I guess, is probably more important. Right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I want to thank you. And it's a terrific day to be together. And if you look, you're in a very famous place. We all work very hard. And I don't know if you call it \"influence,\" I don't know if you call it \"power,\" but whatever it is, we're in the White House. And we're going to stay in the White, and we're going to get our agenda done and completed beautifully. Hey, you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So I'm thrilled to welcome you here. And we're all working very hard. And I don't know if you know, but we just did 27,000 on the Dow. That's the highest in history. We're up a couple of hundred points today-the highest in history-for those of you that like the stock market.</p><p>But the stock market means jobs. I view it as jobs, and I view it as 401(k)s. A lot of people say, \"Oh, the rich people are getting rich.\" But if you look at the numbers, the greatest impact, proportionately, is blue-collar workers in what's happened, in this miracle that's happening.</p><p>And people with 401(k)s, they're up 72 percent and 67 percent. And the wife or the husband-whoever is responsible-the other one says: \"You're a genius. You're a great financial investor.\" [Laughter] \"Darling, you're up 77 percent this year.\" [Laughter]</p><p>So a lot of good things happened. A lot of people are happy. And I think, really, everybody is happy; some people just aren't willing to admit it. Does that make sense? [Laughter]</p><p>So this is a historic day. Never before have so many online journalists and influencers-and that's exactly what you are; you're journalists, and you're influencers-come together in this building to discuss the future of social media. Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our Nation. You're challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the American people. And that's what you're doing: You're going right to the people.</p><p>Possibly, we wouldn't be here right now. I asked somebody: \"What do you think I'd do without social media? Would I be here?\" Because I said, \"I think so.\" [Laughter] But they weren't so sure. [Laughter] I have to say that; you know that. I'm not sure I believe that, but I have to say it.</p><p>But you communicate directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake-news filter. It's very simple. Together, you reach more people than any television broadcast network by far, not even close.</p><p>We're delighted to be joined at this summit by someone you know very well: our Senior Adviser for Digital Strategy and somebody that's been working for me for a long time, for many years, Dan Scavino. Where is Dan? Stand up. Come here. Great job.</p><p>So, long before we were even doing this, he was at a club-running a club and other businesses. And he was okay at doing it. [Laughter] Not the greatest. I wouldn't say the greatest. [Laughter] But you know what he was great at? He was always looking at his computer screen. I said, \"That guy is incredible.\"</p><p>So, right at the beginning, I said, \"That's the man.\" And there was nobody better at that. And I think Hillary had 28 people, and I had Dan. [Laughter] Right? It's true. I had my Dan. And he works about 28 hours a day, and he works very hard. But he doesn't work-I mean, he loves it. He loves it. And his imagination and, really, working with all of you and many of you, he'll come up with ideas, and you'll come up with ideas. And he'll run into my office. He said, \"You've got to see this.\"</p><p>And a lot of times, I'll go out, and I'll spend a lot of money on a concept. I'll say: \"Here's a concept. Come up with this.\" And we'll hire these companies, and they want a lot of money. And they come back-it just happened the other day, right? I said: \"That's terrible. These guys have no talent.\" [Laughter] The people that have the talent are the people that we deal with. And it's true.</p><p>And some of you are extraordinary. I can't say everybody, but-[laughter]. No, but some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable. [Laughter] It's true. Unbelievable.</p><p>So I'm going to go back to the basics of Washington. I'm going to introduce some of my Secretaries. Steve Mnuchin. Steve? Where's Steve? Steve has done a fantastic job. Wilbur Ross. Wilbur? We have a meeting in a little while, on the census and citizenship. Can you believe: \"Are you a citizen of the United States of America?\" \"Sir, you can't ask that question.\" [Laughter] \"Why?\" \"Because the Court said you can't.\"</p><p>We have three very unfriendly courts. They fight us all the way. The judges don't like us too much, I guess. But think of that, Herman. Think of that question: \"Are you a citizen?\"</p><p>We spend-this is another thing that's so crazy: $20 billion on a census-$20 billion. They spend $20 billion. I said, \"20 billion what?\" [Laughter] Twenty billion dollars on a census.</p><p>They go through houses-they go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. \"How many toilets do they have?\" \"How many desks do they have?\" \"How many beds?\" \"What's their roof made of?\" [Laughter] The only thing we can't ask is, \"Are you a citizen of the United States?\" [Laughter] No, is this the craziest thing? Twenty billion. Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing, Charlie.</p><p>Also, David Bernhardt, great job you're doing-Interiors. He's the largest landlord in the United States. When my friends tell me how big they are, they-\"I just bought another building.\" Big deal, Kevin, right? They bought another building. Then, I look at David Bernhardt; he controls half of the United States. [Laughter] Department of Interiors. There's a lot of land-a lot of beautiful land-that we're taking good care of, David. Right?</p><p>Acting Director Russ Vought. Russ, thank you. Great job. We're working on our budget.</p><p>Along with some of the great Members of Congress and a wonderful friend of mine who's my leader, right? He's my leader. I tell him that to his face because it makes him feel good. I don't know if I believe that, Marsha. [Laughter] But, Kevin-stand up, Kevin. Kevin McCarthy, everybody.</p><p>Senator Marsha Blackburn of the great State of Tennessee. We campaigned together. And she did-we can say it now: She ran against the most popular Democrat in the last 50 years. He really was great. A good man, right? And Governor for quite a long time, 8 years. And she just didn't stop.</p><p>Senator Marsha Wedgeworth Blackburn. I beat him by 12 points.</p><p>The President. Twelve points. She was down by 10, and she won by 12. That's right. She was down by 10, and she won by 12. And she wouldn't stop. They just-every day, \"Where is she?\" \"She's here. She's there.\" Fantastic job you did. We're proud of you.</p><p>Sen. Blackburn. Thank you-[inaudible].</p><p>The President. Well, thank you, honey. That's great. It was just-honestly, working with people that know what they're doing, it's fun. That was fun. And you know what you're doing.</p><p>Representative Dan Crenshaw, who is very good at this, by the way, Dan. Very good at this. Really good. Thank you. It's great to have you in the party. And you have more courage than I do, Dan. Okay? That courage of yours is incredible. Thank you very much. Great job.</p><p>A friend of mine and a wonderful person and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future, I'd say-I hear a lot of very positive things-Liz Cheney. Liz, thank you. Thank you.</p><p>And you know, I pardoned somebody named Scooter Libby. A lot of you don't know who Scooter Libby is. Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly. And Liz was right on the forefront of that one. And I said, \"What do you think, Liz?\" And you said: \"Absolutely. He deserves it.\" And it's been a very popular pardon. He was treated very, very brutally and unfairly. So thank you for that, for that help.</p><p>Matt Gaetz. Where's Matt? Where's Matt? Stand up, Matt. Boy, a great defender. He gets on television, and he's like-it doesn't stop. [Laughter] And he's smart, and he's good, and he loves Florida, and he loves his people, and he's a hard worker. And, Matt, thank you very much. I really appreciate it very much.</p><p>And Mike Johnson. Mike, thank you. Great job, Mike.</p><p>And I want to thank a man who I said, a long time ago, when we said, \"Let's do it\"-because Josh Hawley is special. He is somebody that-I said, \"Josh, you've got to run.\" \"Well, I don't know.\" You know, he had a good setup-pretty well, right? You weren't going anywhere. He could do whatever he wanted in his great State.</p><p>And I said, \"I'm telling you, you can do it.\" And she turned out-she's a tough candidate. Whether you like her or you don't like her, she's tough. Right? And by the end of that, that was incredible. That was a hell of a race, and he won. And he's young, and he's brilliant. And I'm going to ask him to come up and say a few words, if you don't mind, about what we're doing. And come on up right now. I think it would be a good time, right?</p><p>Senator Joshua D. Hawley. Thank you. Well, first of all, can we just give another round of applause to the President of the United States for his leadership on this issue? You know, the media says-the establishment media, the fake media-they say: \"Oh, there's no censorship in social media. That's all made up. That's all fake.\" You and I know that that's not true. You and I know the truth is that the social media giants would love to shut us down. They would love to shut us up. They would love to shut him up more than anything else. And we can't let them. And that's why we need to step up now.</p><p>And I think we need to say to them, \"Here's the deal.\" Google, Facebook, Twitter-they've gotten these special deals from Government. They've gotten a special giveaway from Government. They're treated unlike anybody else. If they want to keep their special deal, here's the bargain: They have to quit discriminating against conservatives. Do you agree with that? No more! No more discrimination. It's that simple. That's all we're asking for.</p><p>They ought to abide by the same principles of free speech and the First Amendment that this country embraces, that we love and call our own. And I don't think it's too much to ask for these huge tech platforms-who've gotten rich off our information, right? Off of our data, off of everything we've given them-they've gotten rich off of it. They've gotten rich off their special privileges from Government. If they want to keep those, they shouldn't discriminate. They shouldn't censor. They shouldn't shut us down.</p><p>I want to thank the President again for his incredible leadership. Thank you for allowing me to be here. Thank you, Mr. President, for all that you do.</p><p>The President. And you know, Josh is doing-right now he's doing some very important legislation, because we have to do something about what's happening. I never hear about the other side. I can tell you-I think I'm pretty good at getting out a message, but technologically, I would think I'm okay. Just okay. [Laughter] But I'll tell you, a lot of bad things are happening.</p><p>I have people come up to me: \"Sir, we want to follow you. They don't let us on.\" And it was so different than it was even 6, 7 months ago. I was picking up unbelievable amounts of people. And I'm hotter now than I was then, okay? Because, you know, you also cool off, right? But much hotter. [Laughter] Especially with a nice, new stock market like it is, right?</p><p>But, no, I'm hotter now. And I go to Dan, and I say: \"Hey, what's going on here? It used to take me a short number of days to pick up 100,000 people.\" I'm not complaining; we're like 60some-odd million. But then, we have five different sites. We have another site with 25 million. We have another site with 10 or 12. Then, we have Facebook. Then, we have Instagram. We have a lot; we've got a lot of people, way, way over 100 million.</p><p>But I used to pick them up, and I-when I say \"used to,\" I'm talking about a few months ago. I was picking them up 100,000 people every-very short period of time. Now it's, I would say, 10 times as long.</p><p>And I noticed things happening when I put out something-a good one-that people like. [Laughter] Right? A good tweet. It goes up. It used to go up-it would say \"7,000, 7,008, 7,017, 7,024, 7,032, 7,044.\" [Laughter] Right? Now it goes \"7,000, 7,008, 6,998.\" Then, they go, \"7,009, 6,074.\" I say, \"What's going on?\" It never did that before. It goes up, and then they take it down, and then it goes up. I never had that. Does anyone know what I'm talking about with this?</p><p>Audience members. Yeah!</p><p>Audience member. We all do.</p><p>The President. I never had that before. I used to watch it. It would be like a rocket ship when I put out a beauty. [Laughter] Like when I said-remember I said somebody was \"spying on me\"? That thing was like a rocket. I got a call 2 minutes later. \"Did you say that?\" I said, \"Yes, I said that.\" \"Well, it's exploding.\" [Laughter] \"It's exploding.\" I turned out to be right. I turned out to be right. And we turn out to be right about lot of things.</p><p>But I never had it. I'm just saying from-you know, from the standpoint of a-of somebody that maybe has used social media better than anybody, Josh, because I became President. I'm sure I could have done it, as we said, much-I would have-there's no question I would have done it either way.</p><p>I said to Mark Burnett the other day-I said, \"So 'The Apprentice'\"-had I never done \"The Apprentice\"-because it was a tremendous hit for 12 seasons. I said, \"Had I never done 'The Apprentice,' would I be President?\" He said, \"Maybe not.\" And I said, \"I think I would have.\" But I'm always going to say that. [Laughter] I'm always going to say it. But it was a great show.</p><p>But with social media-so I've never seen it before where I go up and then come down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Now, ultimately, you get-but it goes very slowly. But I've never seen where it's subtracted. And I really believe people are-they're taking it up as it goes up. And it- sometimes, it comes down substantially.</p><p>A number of months ago, I was at a certain number-you know, many millions-and then all of a sudden, I was down over a million. And then, I came down-I said, \"What's going on?\" And you checked, Dan, and you said: \"They say they're doing adjustments. They say they don't like some of the people.\"</p><p>And I don't have the fake people. You know, a lot of people buy people. I don't want to do that, because, first of all, if I did it, it's a front page story all over the place. [Laughter] But I know a lot of people-there's no question about it, because I see some numbers that are phony numbers where they have these, you know, many, many millions of followers. And I say, \"There's no way because nobody has any interest in these people.\" [Laughter] There's-they have no-now, Herman Cain, they have interest in, okay? But they have no interest in these people. They're playing games. They're playing games.</p><p>James Woods. I don't know James, but he's an interesting guy, and he's a conservative guy. And he is a straight shooter. He's tough. But when they want to take him off-and other people like him; many in this room, some in this room-it's a very, very bad-it's a very bad thing.</p><p>So I have many millions of followers across various accounts. And together, everyone in this room, we reach over a half a billion followers. And I think that's probably a low number. Because one of the things I get that's a little benefit-I'll go, \"Watch.\" Like, I did Golan Heights. I gave Israel the-the real credit over-and you know, Golan Heights in Israel. Very important.</p><p>But I gave representation, in the strongest form, of the Golan Heights-Israel. And I talked about it, little quick tweet. They've been looking at it-for 52 years, they've been trying to get it. They couldn't get it. They'd have many summits where people would fly in, talk about the Golan Heights, and then fly out. This went on many, many summits. It's about a 52-year period. I said, \"What happened?\" They said, \"Nothing.\" They'd fly in. They'd fly out. Some had beautiful planes. Some didn't. [Laughter] Some probably didn't get there by plane. But they'd have many summits.</p><p>I said, \"Watch, I'm going to do this.\" And I said, \"We recognize the Golan Heights as being part of Israel.\" It was a big thing. I go, \"Watch this.\" Boom. I press it, and within 2 seconds, \"We have breaking news.\" John Roberts of Fox was over, and he said: \"We have breaking news. Please, break it up.\" Doesn't matter what they're talking about, John, does it? He breaks it up.</p><p>Now, that's Twitter. That's social media. I call Twitter a \"typewriter.\" That's what I really call Twitter, because it goes onto Facebook automatically, and it goes onto Instagram. And it goes onto television, more so Fox than it does CNN. If it's something bad, they'll put it on. [Laughter]</p><p>If I have a spelling deal, they will put it on. [Laughter] It's-\"Donald Trump spelled the word 'the' wrong.\" You know? [Laughter] \"He doesn't know how to spell 'the.' He spelled it 'TH-I.'\" [Laughter] You know, I couldn't care-any kind of a punctuation mistake, they put it on. So I'm very, very careful. I really-I'm actually a good speller. But everyone said, \"The fingers aren't as good as the brain.\" [Laughter]</p><p>But it is true. And it's incredible what it does. I put out a social media statement. And I was telling Kellyanne the other day, I said, you know, I used to put out, like, a press release, right? And people would pick it up, sort of, you know, in the next day, 2 days. They'd find it sitting on a desk. If I put out-we hardly do press releases anymore, because if I put out, on social media, a statement-like I'm going to in a little while on something totally unrelated, but a very important statement. Now they're going crazy. \"What it is? Tell me what it is.\" Watch. [Laughter] But it's very important.</p><p>But if I put that out in a press release, I'm telling you, Kevin, people don't pick it up. It's me-same. If I put it out on social media, it's like an explosion. Fox, CNN, crazy MSNBC- they're stone-cold crazy. [Laughter] I made them a lot of money with \"The Apprentice.\" And I gave them a top show when they were dying on NBC. But they don't like me too much. They wanted a big extension. They used Arnold Schwarzenegger instead, big movie star. You know what? He died. He died. [Laughter] I was there 12 years, 14 seasons. And then, they pick a movie actor, and he dies on us. [Laughter]</p><p>You know, I own that with Mark Burnett and some people. And I said-they said, \"Would you rather have him had been like this tremendous massive success?\" You own it, so you benefit, financially. \"Or would you rather have him die?\" So they just say, \"You did it for 14 seasons, 12 years.\" I said, \"I think I'd rather him die at it.\" [Laughter] That means you don't need the money. I'd rather have him die at it. Anyway.</p><p>But with amazing creativity and determination, you're bypassing the corrupt establishment- and it is corrupt-and you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media, which not all of it, but much of it is far greater percentages than anyone would understand. As the cameras start to go off. There go the red lights. Look, boom. I can always tell. [Laughter]</p><p>I can always tell. Like, when I talk about-and I'll be in the stadium. The red lights are all on. Everyone has got-and then we start talking about, like, the media-how dishonest it is, how corrupt it is, how fake it is. And you see lights going off. [Laughter] Lights immediately go off. And usually, they don't come back. They say, \"This guy is impossible.\" [Laughter]</p><p>But I want to just say, because you people have a lot of courage. To each and every one of you, I say: Thank you very much, on behalf of a nation. Thank you very much. It's very important what you're doing. You're getting the-you're getting, in many cases, the honest word out, not in all cases, but in many cases.</p><p>When historians look back at this time, they will see that many of the biggest news stories of our era were totally ignored. I can tell you that I deal with the media, and the spin they put on it- or sometimes, they'll leave it out, and then if there's something slightly negative, they'll make it, you know, headline news. They'll put it down as headline news. Or even covered up by the media-they were broken up by citizens.</p><p>And you'll take a look at what's happening, and you see stories that should be phenomenal, big, beautiful stories and it turns out that they don't get covered. We did something yesterday on kidney and kidney dialysis, and there's a tremendous number of people with problems with kidneys. And it was Secretary Azar-it was a big, big important thing. It got very little coverage. You know, very positive-what we did is such-such a great thing.</p><p>I don't care. We don't have to get the-hey, it's good for our Nation. It's good for people to read about it and see the strides that we've made and what we're doing. But that doesn't get covered, and it should get covered. And it doesn't get covered for a reason, because they don't want to give that to a conservative. They don't want to let that happen.</p><p>Now, if somebody else were in this position-such as the previous administration-they'd make that headline news all over the place, what we did yesterday. But when we're doing it, they give very little credit to that.</p><p>But anything bad that happens-I always say: \"They can take bad and make it horrible. They can take a good story and make it sort of bad. And they can take a great, great story and make it anywhere from good to slightly bad.\" [Laughter] It's incredible what they can do.</p><p>I say I haven't had a good story in 2\u00bd years. I used to get great press. Steve Mnuchin knows. He said, \"Man, you get the greatest press.\" Until I got elected. [Laughter] Then, it stopped. But I used to get the greatest press, possibly one of the reasons I'm here.</p><p>But we're getting the word out, and we get it out in a different way. I didn't think we'd have to-Charlie, I didn't think it would be this tough and-by the way, two very special people-I have to say hello to them. [Laughter]Because my wife said, \"I see these two beautiful women- African American, incredible women-that are on television. They are unbelievable.\" This is 2 years ago. She was before her time. They have no idea who I'm talking about. [Laughter] She was-our First Lady said, \"You have to see these women. They're incredible. They're genius. And they like you.\" I said, \"I want to see them.\" [Laughter] And I like them. I love them, actually. I love them. Come. Come. I don't want them to fall, because it will be a major story. [Laughter]</p><p>So when the historians look back, they're going to see something very important took place right here. Before today, it took place. It started taking place a number of years ago, and it's something that nobody ever thought would happen.</p><p>Free speech is a bedrock of American life. Our constitutional rights must be fiercely protected. And I want you to know that we will always have your back. We're fighting for you very hard. We're going to be calling a big meeting of the companies for-in a week or two. They have to be here.</p><p>And Josh is really leading a very strong group of people. This isn't just Josh. This is you leading a tremendous group, and they feel equally as strongly as you, because they see the unfairness of what's happening.</p><p>And remember: We won. We have a bigger voice than anybody. But we don't get covered fairly. Can you imagine if we were covered fairly? We had our best polls-like, yesterday, they were telling me. I said: \"Could you imagine if I actually got good press instead of-even fair press. I don't want good; I want fair.\" Can you imagine what those numbers would be? They make up stories-you know, the Russian hoax. I call it the \"Russian hoax,\" the witch hunt. All bad publicity, and yet we're doing great in the polls.</p><p>So people understand it. The public is very smart. But we're getting the word out about so many things-not just that-about so many things. And maybe the most important thing about how great our country is doing. Jobs-now more people working today than ever in the history of our country. Ever in the history of our country-think of that. Unemployment are the best numbers in 51 years. For African American, the best numbers in our history-in our history, Herman, right? Including you. So-and you're making a lot, I hope.</p><p>But Hispanic American-best numbers in history. Right? Stand up. [Applause] Good. And I like your dresses, by the way, very much. No, not you, sir. You. [Laughter] Thank you. I saw you the other day. Fantastic job.</p><p>But Hispanic American-the best in history. Asian American-the best in history. Women-I think, Kellyanne-the best in 75 years. The best in-best unemployment numbers in 75 years. What we're doing-it's nothing like this has been done.</p><p>Our military is now strong. When I took it over, it was depleted. We had planes that were so old they didn't fly. They'd have to go to the desert to get parts. When we took it over, it was not a good situation. We got $700 billion, then $716 billion. And we're going to be asking for another one this year. And it's all manufactured in the United States. We make it ourselves. And that's always good, because that's jobs. Now, in this case, jobs aren't important compared to military defense, but we make the best planes and rockets and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nothing like it. And we're doing something that's incredible.</p><p>So our military is strong. Our country is really powerful and really strong. Never been like this.</p><p>[At this point, the President swatted a fly away from his face.]</p><p>Whoops. How did a fly get into the White House? [Laughter] I don't like that. I don't like flies. I don't like flies. [Laughter]</p><p>So I just want to tell you, just in finishing up, we had a terrible bias. We have censorship like nobody has any understanding or nobody can believe. When you see the Google executives together, and one of their executives decides to put it on the phone-right? That's right. Thank you. Oh, there he is. Stand up, please. Stand up. How good-what a great job. Somebody said he's controversial. I said: \"He's not controversial. He's truthful.\"</p><p>Audience member. That's right! Yes!</p><p>The President. He's truthful. That was a great job. That was one of many. Thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic.</p><p>So, you know, they're playing with a lot of minds, and they're playing unfairly. And the funny thing is that, in theory, they shouldn't be liking the other side. They shouldn't be liking the other side. They should be, really, liking our side, because we're the ones that want freedom far more.</p><p>You see what's happening up in the debate stand. You see what they're doing to each other. You're seeing the hatred that they have up there. And it's a very different philosophy. It's a very different thought.</p><p>And I'll say this: The election that's coming up is, I think-and you know, we talk 2016, and I would say maybe that's the most important, and certainly, I said it. But what we're really fighting for-there has never been a difference of this candidate, our candidate, your candidate against whoever it may be. There will never be anything like that, hopefully, again, because what they're looking at is pure socialism or worse than socialism. You know, there's a word called \"communism\" too. There's a word called-they don't like to use it. Very rarely do you hear that. But there's a word called \"communism,\" and they're trying to get socialism over the line.</p><p>But these people are-this is beyond socialism, to a large extent. And I think that we're going to have a tremendous success. We had a-sort of, an opening rally in Orlando, Florida. We had 109,000-maybe more; I think it was nine-wanting to come. We were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming. We have a 21,000-seat stadium, and then, with the basketball court, it held many more than that. It was packed. And we had a similar number outside, and we had thousands and thousands of people that wanted to be there. And this was an opening.</p><p>And you look at Biden; they say he had 600 people. That wasn't 600; that was 150 people. [Laughter] That was 150. That was a very small crowd. [Laughter] And even their big crowds-I mean, if they have 1,000 people, it's like a big crowd. We have enthusiasm that's far greater than the left. It's not even a contest. They don't want to say that. They never will say that.</p><p>We had, on the Mall, just the other day-Fourth of July-a tremendous success. It was pouring. The weather was just-it was beautiful, in one way. They learned it was my real hair that day-[laughter]-because I was drenched. Well, that is the one good thing. I ran, and they learned it's my hair, because I've been through every windstorm, sandstorm. Let's go over here. Let's go this one, that one-this desert. Let's go to this ocean and get out of the plane. \"Sir, the wind is blowing at about 70 miles an hour.\" I said, \"Boy, it's got to be mine.\" [Laughter]</p><p>But we've seen it all. We've seen it all. And I tell you what: More than anything else, I've met great people. I've met great people. Dedicated people. And I think that the election coming up, Kevin, this is the most important election of our times.</p><p>This is an election where our country is going to go one way, or it's going to head in the direction of Venezuela. And that's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen. This Green New Deal-and I-you know, I hate to speak badly of it right now, because it's a little early. I spoke too early on Elizabeth \"Pocahontas\" Warren. [Laughter] I spoke-I should have saved it.</p><p>But you know-so I don't like to go too early because I don't want them to change. I like the Green New Deal. I want them to keep going. I don't want them to make-you know, the problem with this business: They can make a change, and immediately upon making the-it lasts for about a week. You look at, for instance, on the wall, Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall. Right, Liz? Totally in favor. Everybody. Hillary. Everybody. They were all in favor of a wall, just a few years ago.</p><p>Now a wall is a-well, that's okay. They want open borders. They want people to pour in, including criminals, the worst criminals. They want people to pour into our country. Nobody can tell me that's good, politically. Nobody can tell me.</p><p>So all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations, they've got a right to speak their mind. That includes them. That includes them. But they don't have the same difficulty. They don't get shut out. I wrote a few terms. I said to my son Don, who's here somewhere- where are you, Don? Where are you, Don? He's very good. Kimberly. Don. People like Don, I tell you. Good. Thank you, Don.</p><p>But we wrote out a few-shadow ban, hundred percent. You look at what's going on. You know, I could go-the blocking-just the basic blocking of what we want to get out. The fact that they don't let them join. They don't. There was-there's no doubt in my mind that I should have millions and millions-I have millions of people-so many people, I wouldn't believe it. But I know that we've been blocked.</p><p>People come up to me, and they say: \"Sir, I can't get you. I can't follow you. They make it impossible.\" These are people that are really good at what they do. They say, \"They make it absolutely impossible.\" And you know, we can't have it. We're not going to let it happen. Josh, we're not going to let it happen.</p><p>And you know, if they did it on both sides, if it were done to the other side, to the other group-and I'm representing everybody. I do. I represent everybody. I fully understand liberal. I fully understand Democrat. We want to get along. We want to make sure that everybody loves each other, if that's possible. And maybe, I really believe it is. Someday, it will be.</p><p>I, for a while, have said that the thing that's going to bring us together is great success. Now we have tremendous success, greater than we've ever had before. I mean, our country picked up trillions of dollars in value, in worth. China has gone down trillions of dollars. The tariffs have hurt them. I don't want to hurt them, but I want to give us a fair playing field. But China has gone down trillions. We've gone up-not billions, trillions. We've gone up in value, in worth.</p><p>I want everybody to do well, but they've got to treat us fairly. They've got to treat- everybody has to be treated fairly. Their side, our side-we all have to be treated fairly.</p><p>And you know, the farmers say, \"We just want a level playing field, sir.\" I love the farmers. They're patriots. And China, as you know, targeted the farmers, because they think they could get to me by hurting the people that I love and that we take care of. And it had no impact.</p><p>I would watch, even on networks that don't exactly like me, and I'd watch as they interview farmers. And they'd have 10 or 12 people sitting around. They're saying: \"We don't care. The President is right. We've been ripped off for many years. Somebody has to do\"-somebody had to do this.</p><p>China made, over the last 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars. You could say four to five hundred billion dollars a year. That's not sustainable. That's not-we built China. And you know what? They've done a great job. I don't blame them; I blame our former Presidents and the leaders of our country for allowing this to go on ever since the World Trade Organization opened up. They allowed this to go on. They allowed hundreds of billions of dollars a year to be taken out of our country and to be used to rebuild China. So those days are over.</p><p>So right now they're paying 25 percent on $250 billion. A lot of money coming in. You know, we had a 3.2 GDP for the first quarter. Everyone said, \"I wonder how that happened.\" Because first quarter is the weakest quarter always-almost-almost always. And we had like this great quarter.</p><p>But I don't consider 3.2 great. I consider much higher. And frankly, if we had lower interest rates-you know, we're forced to pay more money than other countries, because we have a rate that's high. We have somebody that likes raising rates. Now, I think he's maybe going to change, but we'll find out. But if we had lower, we'd have another 10,000 points. We're doing-we just set a record. You know, I'm a very greedy person. We just set a record: 27,000. I said, \"We could be 10,000 points higher.\" We could be 10,000-because there's no inflation. A big thing is inflation. There's no inflation. But we're doing so well. We're going to keep it that way.</p><p>So I just want to introduce-because a person that I've admired for a long time who is a great lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, and she's one of the leading First Amendment lawyers in our country. And, Harmeet, could you come up, just say a few words, please? Thank you.</p><p>Dhillon Law Group, Inc., Founder Harmeet K. Dhillon. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. It's a tremendous honor to be here with a lot of people who I really respect and admire.</p><p>The corrupt establishment that you talked about and the mainstream media have told a lot of people in this room that the social media censorship and the banning that we're experiencing is all in our heads. They're gaslighting us with this lie.</p><p>[Ms. Dhillon continued her remarks, concluding as follows. ]</p><p>Now, Senator Blackburn knows, from what happened to her on Twitter, that these companies are trying to stop the ordinary men and women who you represent from hearing their voices. I'm very concerned that they affected the outcome of the 2018 election. And if we let them do what they're going to-what they've been doing, it's going to affect the outcome of the 2020 election as well.</p><p>So, Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting everybody here to talk about these issues. And we're all behind you joining the fight to make sure that every American's voice is heard. Thank you very much.</p><p>The President. And what Harmeet said is so, so true. I mean it's-it's really incredible. You know, I've watched, and I've watched some of these scenes that have been taped and gotten through-talented people, by the way-but gotten through and gotten to the public where you see the hatred of our party, of our people, of our voice. And you say, \"That's the collusion.\" It's a collusion between the Democrats and the media and social media and these platforms. It's a disgraceful thing.</p><p>And another thing, I believe you're representing a young man who just got slugged, viciously slugged. I think it's a disgrace. Do you ever notice they pick on certain people? I mean, he would tell you he's not the toughest person in the world physically, right? They don't go after Bikers for Trump. [Laughter]</p><p>Do you ever notice that? They don't go after our construction workers, who love us. They don't go after the police. They don't go after-we have incredible people. You know, we're the elite. They say they're elite. You know. Do you ever hear this? Hey, I live better than all of them. [Laughter] Great education. The greatest houses. The great-but I guess I'm not elite. They live like in the basement of their mom's home. [Laughter] Their arms are this big. Look, like this. But they have the black-they have the black masks on, and they have sticks. And they hit people. [Laughter] They hit people in the face, in the head, this Antifa.</p><p>But do you ever notice the Antifa is never there when we have a bikers rally? [Laughter] They're never there when the construction workers and the unions are honoring the President. They're never around. They're always there when you have a single guy protesting in front of a school.</p><p>And as you probably know-I think all of you know-we did something very serious. I signed an Executive order recently. We're taking money away from those schools. We're going to-you know, we give them billions and billions of dollars, and they don't allow free speech. And we don't want anything special, but we want free speech.</p><p>We're also joined by someone affected by this troubling bias very, very much-and president of Live Action and somebody I've watched, really, with great admiration. Lila, please come up. Lila Rose. Thank you.</p><p>Live Action President Lila Rose. Thank you so much, Mr. President. It's really an honor to be here. Thank you for doing this important summit.</p><p>The President. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>Ms. Rose. I represent Live Action. I'm the founder and president, and we are a pro-life organization which reaches millions of people every week with the truth about abortion and human dignity.</p><p>[Ms. Rose continued her remarks, concluding as follows. ]</p><p>And then, recently, our videos have been viewed more highly than almost any other abortion-related content on YouTube. But YouTube-we made it to the first page of search results, but YouTube buried our pro-life videos and boosted pro-abortion videos. So this double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech, even though they say that they are politically neutral and they don't discriminate. They even testified before Congress and said that.</p><p>So thank you so much to the administration and to you, Mr. President, for holding this very important summit.</p><p>The President. Thank you.</p><p>Ms. Rose. Thank you.</p><p>The President. Great job. Thank you very much.</p><p>So one of the advantages of being President is, when you ask for a meeting, you get it, generally. I don't know, I can't think of too many I haven't gotten. And you say, \"I'd like to see you in Oval Office.\" Or you have somebody call-Oval Office.</p><p>I have been with all of these people at the highest level, one-on-one, just recently, with Google. Just recently, with Twitter. The top. Right? And you talk to them and you swear they're like your best friend. \"Oh, sir. No, we're-we're-we believe-we-freedom of speech. Oh, yes.\"</p><p>Audience member. [Inaudible]</p><p>The President. And we go out-</p><p>He says, \"Liar.\" Who said that? [Laughter] Must come from Queens. [Laughter]</p><p>So it's very interesting to see that. And-and the level of-you know, you look at them-the sincerity. And I say, \"That's fantastic.\" And they'll leave. And then, I'll realize, 3 or 4 weeks later, it's worse. It actually got worse.</p><p>Because I say-look, I believe in technology. I believe in free markets. I believe in freedom of speech. I believe in all of the things, and they are super genius. I'll tell you, I'm dealing with China. And they admitted there's nobody like Silicon Valley. There's nobody smart, in that sense; maybe not smart in other senses. I've watched some of them speak before Congress; it's not pretty. [Laughter] I say, \"I could do much better than that.\" [Laughter]</p><p>But I tell you what: Technologically, it's unbelievable what they think of. Even Dan and I, when we sat with you-know-who at Twitter-number one. We talked about certain things. He says, \"You know, we could do this, this, this.\" I said, \"That's really great.\" You know, this is incredible stuff. China will admit there's nobody like these brains. But they're not using that brilliance, and they're not using what we gave them fairly. And they have to do that.</p><p>And we don't want to stifle anything. We certainly don't want to stifle free speech, but that's no longer free speech. See, I don't think that the mainstream media is free speech either, because it's so crooked. It's so dishonest.</p><p>So, to me, free speech is not when you see something good, and then you purposely write bad. To me, that's very dangerous speech, and you become angry at it. But that's not free speech. Somebody came to my office-and I won't say who, but a very big person-and I said, \"Okay, you don't like the term 'fake news'\"-which I think I get credit for, but I'm sure that, if I said I get credit, they'll say, \"Thirteen years ago, somebody came up with the terms 'fake.'\" [Laughter] I think I'd get credit. I'd be very proud to take it. But I think I'd get credit.</p><p>Now, by the way, the worst fakers of all are using \"fake news.\" I saw the other day on CNN-total fakes-I see on CNN-they go, \"Fake-news media has reported\"-no, no, they're fake-news media. [Laughter] They've turned it around. They've turned it around.</p><p>So I'm not going to allow-and Josh and all of us, we're not just going to allow it to happen like this. We're not going to be silenced.</p><p>Two months ago, we created a new White House tool to report social media bias, censorship, and discrimination. We saw you folks being taken off, and we fought on all of you. And many of you are back now. But many of the names-I won't mention your names-but some of you were taken off for absolutely no reason.</p><p>I mean, in all fairness, some of you I could almost understand. [Laughter] I mean, some of you guys are out there. [Laughter] But even you should have a voice. [Laughter] But some of you-no, some of you deserve-[applause]-some of you. I mean, it's genius, but it's bad. [Laughter]</p><p>But they take off people that are-you know, that you wouldn't believe. And we received over 16,000 responses just in a tiny little period of time talking about this subject.</p><p>Based on the feedback that we're hearing from you, I'm announcing that we will ask representatives of the major social media platforms to join me at the White House over the next month, have a big meeting and a real conversation. We want-might want to invite some of you. I know, Josh, we're going to have you and some of the Senators.</p><p>And it's amazing how the Senators-including Democrats, in all fairness-which is probably because they know it can turn on them also. It can turn very quickly. But they want to come. So we'll let you know the date, okay?</p><p>And today I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free speech rights of all Americans. That's you people in this room and a lot of people out there. There are a lot of people.</p><p>We hope to see transparency, more accountability, and more freedom. That's on both sides. This is not-I am not speaking for our side, assuming we're all-I don't even know if you're on our side. You could be some of the most liberal people in the world in this audience, and that's okay. I don't care. But we're talking about for everybody. Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people.</p><p>To all of the social media influencers here today-a lot of-you have a lot of power, and you have a lot of strength. And you know, you have to use it wisely. Many of you do, but you have to. I want to thank you once again for being here. You're very special people. You're very brilliant people, in so many cases. I look around the room, I mean, I see people that really have almost found a new life over the last short period of time with this new technology. But this new technology is so powerful and so important, and it has to be used fairly. It has to be used fairly.</p><p>So thank you all for being here. It's a great honor, tremendous honor.</p><p>We're going to take a few questions, I think. And then, I'll head out. And you're going to actually come-if you want, you can come to the great Rose Garden. You can stand in the rain with me. We're going to talk a little bit about the fact that we're not allowed to ask for whether or not somebody is a citizen on the census form. And I think we have a solution that will be very good for a lot of people, really good.</p><p>[The event continued with a question-and-answer session, and no transcript was provided.]</p><p>NOTE: The President spoke at 3:51 p.m. in the East Room at the White House.

Trump, 2019 </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please sit down. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to thank you all for being here, very special day, very important day. Many of you are friends, and many of you are friends that I don't know what you look like, but I know what you sound like?[laughter]?which, I guess, is probably more important. Right? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I want to thank you. And it's a terrific day to be together. And if you look, you're in a very famous place. We all work very hard. And I don't know if you call it \"influence,\" I don't know if you call it \"power,\" but whatever it is, we're in the White House. And we're going to stay in the White, and we're going to get our agenda done and completed beautifully. Hey, you. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So I'm thrilled to welcome you here. And we're all working very hard. And I don't know if you know, but we just did 27,000 on the Dow. That's the highest in history. We're up a couple of hundred points today?the highest in history?for those of you that like the stock market. </p><p>But the stock market means jobs. I view it as jobs, and I view it as 401(k)s. A lot of people say, \"Oh, the rich people are getting rich.\" But if you look at the numbers, the greatest impact, proportionately, is blue-collar workers in what's happened, in this miracle that's happening. </p><p>And people with 401(k)s, they're up 72 percent and 67 percent. And the wife or the husband?whoever is responsible?the other one says: \"You're a genius. You're a great financial investor.\" [Laughter] \"Darling, you're up 77 percent this year.\" [Laughter] </p><p>So a lot of good things happened. A lot of people are happy. And I think, really, everybody is happy; some people just aren't willing to admit it. Does that make sense? [Laughter] </p><p>So this is a historic day. Never before have so many online journalists and influencers?and that's exactly what you are; you're journalists, and you're influencers?come together in this building to discuss the future of social media. Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our Nation. You're challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the American people. And that's what you're doing: You're going right to the people. </p><p>Possibly, we wouldn't be here right now. I asked somebody: \"What do you think I'd do without social media? Would I be here?\" Because I said, \"I think so.\" [Laughter] But they weren't so sure. [Laughter] I have to say that; you know that. I'm not sure I believe that, but I have to say it. </p><p>But you communicate directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake-news filter. It's very simple. Together, you reach more people than any television broadcast network by far, not even close. </p><p>We're delighted to be joined at this summit by someone you know very well: our Senior Adviser for Digital Strategy and somebody that's been working for me for a long time, for many years, Dan Scavino. Where is Dan? Stand up. Come here. Great job. </p><p>So, long before we were even doing this, he was at a club?running a club and other businesses. And he was okay at doing it. [Laughter] Not the greatest. I wouldn't say the greatest. [Laughter] But you know what he was great at? He was always looking at his computer screen. I said, \"That guy is incredible.\" So, right at the beginning, I said, \"That's the man.\" And there was nobody better at that. And I think Hillary had 28 people, and I had Dan. [Laughter] Right? It's true. I had my Dan. And he works about 28 hours a day, and he works very hard. But he doesn't work?I mean, he loves it. He loves it. And his imagination and, really, working with all of you and many of you, he'll come up with ideas, and you'll come up with ideas. And he'll run into my office. He said, \"You've got to see this.\" </p><p>And a lot of times, I'll go out, and I'll spend a lot of money on a concept. I'll say: \"Here's a concept. Come up with this.\" And we'll hire these companies, and they want a lot of money. And they come back?it just happened the other day, right? I said: \"That's terrible. These guys have no talent.\" [Laughter] The people that have the talent are the people that we deal with. And it's true. </p><p>And some of you are extraordinary. I can't say everybody, but?[laughter]. No, but some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable. [Laughter] It's true. Unbelievable. </p><p>So I'm going to go back to the basics of Washington. I'm going to introduce some of my Secretaries. Steve Mnuchin. Steve? Where's Steve? Steve has done a fantastic job. Wilbur Ross. Wilbur? We have a meeting in a little while, on the census and citizenship. Can you believe: \"Are you a citizen of the United States of America?\" \"Sir, you can't ask that question.\" [Laughter] \"Why?\" \"Because the Court said you can't.\" </p><p>We have three very unfriendly courts. They fight us all the way. The judges don't like us too much, I guess. But think of that, Herman. Think of that question: \"Are you a citizen?\" </p><p>We spend?this is another thing that's so crazy: $20 billion on a census?$20 billion. They spend $20 billion. I said, \"20 billion what?\" [Laughter] Twenty billion dollars on a census. </p><p>They go through houses?they go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. \"How many toilets do they have?\" \"How many desks do they have?\" \"How many beds?\" \"What's their roof made of?\" [Laughter] The only thing we can't ask is, \"Are you a citizen of the United States?\" [Laughter] No, is this the craziest thing? Twenty billion. Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing, Charlie. </p><p>Also, David Bernhardt, great job you're doing?Interiors. He's the largest landlord in the United States. When my friends tell me how big they are, they?\"I just bought another building.\" Big deal, Kevin, right? They bought another building. Then, I look at David Bernhardt; he controls half of the United States. [Laughter] Department of Interiors. There's a lot of land?a lot of beautiful land?that we're taking good care of, David. Right? </p><p>Acting Director Russ Vought. Russ, thank you. Great job. We're working on our budget. </p><p>Along with some of the great Members of Congress and a wonderful friend of mine who's my leader, right? He's my leader. I tell him that to his face because it makes him feel good. I don't know if I believe that, Marsha. [Laughter] But, Kevin?stand up, Kevin. Kevin McCarthy, everybody. </p><p>Senator Marsha Blackburn of the great State of Tennessee. We campaigned together. And she did?we can say it now: She ran against the most popular Democrat in the last 50 years. He really was great. A good man, right?And Governor for quite a long time, 8 years. And she just didn't stop. </p><p>Senator Marsha Wedgeworth Blackburn. I beat him by 12 points. </p><p>The President. Twelve points. She was down by 10, and she won by 12. That's right. She was down by 10, and she won by 12. And she wouldn't stop. They just?every day, \"Where is she?\" \"She's here. She's there.\" Fantastic job you did. We're proud of you. </p><p>Sen. Blackburn. Thank you?[inaudible]. The President. Well, thank you, honey. That's great. It was just?honestly, working with people that know what they're doing, it's fun. That was fun. And you know what you're doing. </p><p>Representative Dan Crenshaw, who is very good at this, by the way, Dan. Very good at this. Really good. Thank you. It's great to have you in the party. And you have more courage than I do, Dan. Okay? That courage of yours is incredible. Thank you very much. Great job. </p><p>A friend of mine and a wonderful person and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future, I'd say?I hear a lot of very positive things?Liz Cheney. Liz, thank you. Thank you. </p><p>And you know, I pardoned somebody named Scooter Libby. A lot of you don't know who Scooter Libby is. Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly. And Liz was right on the forefront of that one. And I said, \"What do you think, Liz?\" And you said: \"Absolutely. He deserves it.\" And it's been a very popular pardon. He was treated very, very brutally and unfairly. So thank you for that, for that help. </p><p>Matt Gaetz. Where's Matt? Where's Matt? Stand up, Matt. Boy, a great defender. He gets on television, and he's like?it doesn't stop. [Laughter] And he's smart, and he's good, and he loves Florida, and he loves his people, and he's a hard worker. And, Matt, thank you very much. I really appreciate it very much. </p><p>And Mike Johnson. Mike, thank you. Great job, Mike. </p><p>And I want to thank a man who I said, a long time ago, when we said, \"Let's do it\"?because Josh Hawley is special. He is somebody that?I said, \"Josh, you've got to run.\" \"Well, I don't know.\" You know, he had a good setup?pretty well, right? You weren't going anywhere. He could do whatever he wanted in his great State. </p><p>And I said, \"I'm telling you, you can do it.\" And she turned out?she's a tough candidate. Whether you like her or you don't like her, she's tough. Right? And by the end of that, that was incredible. That was a hell of a race, and he won. And he's young, and he's brilliant. And I'm going to ask him to come up and say a few words, if you don't mind, about what we're doing. And come on up right now. I think it would be a good time, right? </p><p>Senator Joshua D. Hawley. Thank you. Well, first of all, can we just give another round of applause to the President of the United States for his leadership on this issue? You know, the media says?the establishment media, the fake media?they say: \"Oh, there's no censorship in social media. That's all made up. That's all fake.\" You and I know that that's not true. You and I know the truth is that the social media giants would love to shut us down. They would love to shut us up. They would love to shut him up more than anything else. And we can't let them. And that's why we need to step up now. </p><p>And I think we need to say to them, \"Here's the deal.\" Google, Facebook, Twitter?they've gotten these special deals from Government. They've gotten a special giveaway from Government. They're treated unlike anybody else. If they want to keep their special deal, here's the bargain: They have to quit discriminating against conservatives. Do you agree with that? No more! No more discrimination. It's that simple. That's all we're asking for. </p><p>They ought to abide by the same principles of free speech and the First Amendment that this country embraces, that we love and call our own. And I don't think it's too much to ask for these huge tech platforms?who've gotten rich off our information, right? Off of our data, off of everything we've given them?they've gotten rich off of it. They've gotten rich off their special privileges from Government. If they want to keep those, they shouldn't discriminate. They shouldn't censor. They shouldn't shut us down. I want to thank the President again for his incredible leadership. Thank you for allowing me to be here. Thank you, Mr. President, for all that you do. </p><p>The President. And you know, Josh is doing?right now he's doing some very important legislation, because we have to do something about what's happening. I never hear about the other side. I can tell you?I think I'm pretty good at getting out a message, but technologically, I would think I'm okay. Just okay. [Laughter] But I'll tell you, a lot of bad things are happening. </p><p>I have people come up to me: \"Sir, we want to follow you. They don't let us on.\" And it was so different than it was even 6, 7 months ago. I was picking up unbelievable amounts of people. And I'm hotter now than I was then, okay? Because, you know, you also cool off, right? But much hotter. [Laughter] Especially with a nice, new stock market like it is, right? </p><p>But, no, I'm hotter now. And I go to Dan, and I say: \"Hey, what's going on here? It used to take me a short number of days to pick up 100,000 people.\" I'm not complaining; we're like 60-some-odd million. But then, we have five different sites. We have another site with 25 million. We have another site with 10 or 12. Then, we have Facebook. Then, we have Instagram. We have a lot; we've got a lot of people, way, way over 100 million. </p><p>But I used to pick them up, and I?when I say \"used to,\" I'm talking about a few months ago. I was picking them up 100,000 people every?very short period of time. Now it's, I would say, 10 times as long. </p><p>And I noticed things happening when I put out something?a good one?that people like. [Laughter] Right? A good tweet. It goes up. It used to go up?it would say \"7,000, 7,008, 7,017, 7,024, 7,032, 7,044.\" [Laughter] Right? Now it goes \"7,000, 7,008, 6,998.\" Then, they go, \"7,009, 6,074.\" I say, \"What's going on?\" It never did that before. It goes up, and then they take it down, and then it goes up. I never had that. Does anyone know what I'm talking about with this? </p><p>Audience members. Yeah! </p><p>Audience member. We all do.</p><p>The President. I never had that before. I used to watch it. It would be like a rocket ship when I put out a beauty. [Laughter] Like when I said?remember I said somebody was \"spying on me\"? That thing was like a rocket. I got a call 2 minutes later. \"Did you say that?\" I said, \"Yes, I said that.\" \"Well, it's exploding.\" [Laughter] \"It's exploding.\" I turned out to be right. I turned out to be right. And we turn out to be right about lot of things. </p><p>But I never had it. I'm just saying from?you know, from the standpoint of a?of somebody that maybe has used social media better than anybody, Josh, because I became President. I'm sure I could have done it, as we said, much?I would have?there's no question I would have done it either way. </p><p>I said to Mark Burnett the other day?I said, \"So 'The Apprentice'\"?had I never done \"The Apprentice\"?because it was a tremendous hit for 12 seasons. I said, \"Had I never done 'The Apprentice,' would I be President?\" He said, \"Maybe not.\" And I said, \"I think I would have.\" But I'm always going to say that. [Laughter] I'm always going to say it. But it was a great show. </p><p>But with social media?so I've never seen it before where I go up and then come down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Now, ultimately, you get?but it goes very slowly. But I've never seen where it's subtracted. And I really believe people are?they're taking it up as it goes up. And it?sometimes, it comes down substantially. </p><p>A number of months ago, I was at a certain number?you know, many millions?and then all of a sudden, I was down over a million. And then, I came down?I said, \"What's going on?\" And you checked, Dan, and you said: \"They say they're doing adjustments. They say they don't like some of the people.\" </p><p>And I don't have the fake people. You know, a lot of people buy people. I don't want to do that, because, first of all, if I did it, it's a front page story all over the place. [Laughter] But I know a lot of people?there's no question about it, because I see some numbers that are phony numbers where they have these, you know, many, many millions of followers. And I say, \"There's no way because nobody has any interest in these people.\" [Laughter] There's?they have no?now, Herman Cain, they have interest in, okay? But they have no interest in these people. They're playing games. They're playing games. </p><p>James Woods. I don't know James, but he's an interesting guy, and he's a conservative guy. And he is a straight shooter. He's tough. But when they want to take him off?and other people like him; many in this room, some in this room?it's a very, very bad?it's a very bad thing. </p><p>So I have many millions of followers across various accounts. And together, everyone in this room, we reach over a half a billion followers. And I think that's probably a low number. Because one of the things I get that's a little benefit?I'll go, \"Watch.\" Like, I did Golan Heights. I gave Israel the?the real credit over?and you know, Golan Heights in Israel. Very important. </p><p>But I gave representation, in the strongest form, of the Golan Heights?Israel. And I talked about it, little quick tweet. They've been looking at it?for 52 years, they've been trying to get it. They couldn't get it. They'd have many summits where people would fly in, talk about the Golan Heights, and then fly out. This went on many, many summits. It's about a 52-year period. I said, \"What happened?\" They said, \"Nothing.\" They'd fly in. They'd fly out. Some had beautiful planes. Some didn't. [Laughter] Some probably didn't get there by plane. But they'd have many summits. </p><p>I said, \"Watch, I'm going to do this.\" And I said, \"We recognize the Golan Heights as being part of Israel.\" It was a big thing. I go, \"Watch this.\" Boom. I press it, and within 2 seconds, \"We have breaking news.\" John Roberts of Fox was over, and he said: \"We have breaking news. Please, break it up.\" Doesn't matter what they're talking about, John, does it? He breaks it up. </p><p>Now, that's Twitter. That's social media. I call Twitter a \"typewriter.\" That's what I really call Twitter, because it goes onto Facebook automatically, and it goes onto Instagram. And it goes onto television, more so Fox than it does CNN. If it's something bad, they'll put it on. [Laughter] </p><p>If I have a spelling deal, they will put it on. [Laughter] It's?\"Donald Trump spelled the word 'the' wrong.\" You know? [Laughter] \"He doesn't know how to spell 'the.' He spelled it 'T?H?I.'\" [Laughter] You know, I couldn't care?any kind of a punctuation mistake, they put it on. So I'm very, very careful. I really?I'm actually a good speller. But everyone said, \"The fingers aren't as good as the brain.\" [Laughter] </p><p>But it is true. And it's incredible what it does. I put out a social media statement. And I was telling Kellyanne the other day, I said, you know, I used to put out, like, a press release, right? And people would pick it up, sort of, you know, in the next day, 2 days. They'd find it sitting on a desk. If I put out?we hardly do press releases anymore, because if I put out, on social media, a statement?like I'm going to in a little while on something totally unrelated, but a very important statement. Now they're going crazy. \"What it is? Tell me what it is.\" Watch. [Laughter] But it's very important. </p><p>But if I put that out in a press release, I'm telling you, Kevin, people don't pick it up. It's me?same. If I put it out on social media, it's like an explosion. Fox, CNN, crazy MSNBC?they're stone-cold crazy. [Laughter] I made them a lot of money with \"The Apprentice.\" And I gave them a top show when they were dying on NBC. But they don't like me too much. They wanted a big extension. They used Arnold Schwarzenegger instead, big movie star. You know what? He died. He died. [Laughter] I was there 12 years, 14 seasons. And then, they pick a movie actor, and he dies on us. [Laughter] </p><p>You know, I own that with Mark Burnett and some people. And I said?they said, \"Would you rather have him had been like this tremendous massive success?\" You own it, so you benefit, financially. \"Or would you rather have him die?\" So they just say, \"You did it for 14 seasons, 12 years.\" I said, \"I think I'd rather him die at it.\" [Laughter] That means you don't need the money. I'd rather have him die at it. Anyway. </p><p>But with amazing creativity and determination, you're bypassing the corrupt establishment?and it is corrupt?and you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media, which not all of it, but much of it is far greater percentages than anyone would understand. As the cameras start to go off. There go the red lights. Look, boom. I can always tell. [Laughter] </p><p>I can always tell. Like, when I talk about?and I'll be in the stadium. The red lights are all on. Everyone has got?and then we start talking about, like, the media?how dishonest it is, how corrupt it is, how fake it is. And you see lights going off. [Laughter] Lights immediately go off. And usually, they don't come back. They say, \"This guy is impossible.\" [Laughter] </p><p>But I want to just say, because you people have a lot of courage. To each and every one of you, I say: Thank you very much, on behalf of a nation. Thank you very much. It's very important what you're doing. You're getting the?you're getting, in many cases, the honest word out, not in all cases, but in many cases. </p><p>When historians look back at this time, they will see that many of the biggest news stories of our era were totally ignored. I can tell you that I deal with the media, and the spin they put on it?or sometimes, they'll leave it out, and then if there's something slightly negative, they'll make it, you know, headline news. They'll put it down as headline news. Or even covered up by the media?they were broken up by citizens. </p><p>And you'll take a look at what's happening, and you see stories that should be phenomenal, big, beautiful stories and it turns out that they don't get covered. We did something yesterday on kidney and kidney dialysis, and there's a tremendous number of people with problems with kidneys. And it was Secretary Azar?it was a big, big important thing. It got very little coverage. You know, very positive?what we did is such?such a great thing. </p><p>I don't care. We don't have to get the?hey, it's good for our Nation. It's good for people to read about it and see the strides that we've made and what we're doing. But that doesn't get covered, and it should get covered. And it doesn't get covered for a reason, because they don't want to give that to a conservative. They don't want to let that happen. </p><p>Now, if somebody else were in this position?such as the previous administration?they'd make that headline news all over the place, what we did yesterday. But when we're doing it, they give very little credit to that. </p><p>But anything bad that happens?I always say: \"They can take bad and make it horrible. They can take a good story and make it sort of bad. And they can take a great, great story and make it anywhere from good to slightly bad.\" [Laughter] It's incredible what they can do. </p><p>I say I haven't had a good story in 2\u00bd years. I used to get great press. Steve Mnuchin knows. He said, \"Man, you get the greatest press.\" Until I got elected. [Laughter] Then, it stopped. But I used to get the greatest press, possibly one of the reasons I'm here. </p><p>But we're getting the word out, and we get it out in a different way. I didn't think we'd have to?Charlie, I didn't think it would be this tough and?by the way, two very special people?I have to say hello to them. [Laughter]Because my wife said, \"I see these two beautiful women?African American, incredible women?that are on television. They are unbelievable.\" This is 2 years ago. She was before her time. They have no idea who I'm talking about. [Laughter] She was?our First Lady said, \"You have to see these women. They're incredible. They're genius. And they like you.\" I said, \"I want to see them.\" [Laughter] And I like them. I love them, actually. I love them. Come. Come. I don't want them to fall, because it will be a major story. [Laughter] </p><p>So when the historians look back, they're going to see something very important took place right here. Before today, it took place. It started taking place a number of years ago, and it's something that nobody ever thought would happen. </p><p>Free speech is a bedrock of American life. Our constitutional rights must be fiercely protected. And I want you to know that we will always have your back. We're fighting for you very hard. We're going to be calling a big meeting of the companies for?in a week or two. They have to be here. </p><p>And Josh is really leading a very strong group of people. This isn't just Josh. This is you leading a tremendous group, and they feel equally as strongly as you, because they see the unfairness of what's happening. </p><p>And remember: We won. We have a bigger voice than anybody. But we don't get covered fairly. Can you imagine if we were covered fairly? We had our best polls?like, yesterday, they were telling me. I said: \"Could you imagine if I actually got good press instead of?even fair press. I don't want good; I want fair.\" Can you imagine what those numbers would be? They make up stories?you know, the Russian hoax. I call it the \"Russian hoax,\" the witch hunt. All bad publicity, and yet we're doing great in the polls. </p><p>So people understand it. The public is very smart. But we're getting the word out about so many things?not just that?about so many things. And maybe the most important thing about how great our country is doing. Jobs?now more people working today than ever in the history of our country. Ever in the history of our country?think of that. Unemployment are the best numbers in 51 years. For African American, the best numbers in our history?in our history, Herman, right? Including you. So?and you're making a lot, I hope. </p><p>But Hispanic American?best numbers in history. Right? Stand up. [Applause] Good. And I like your dresses, by the way, very much. No, not you, sir. You. [Laughter] Thank you. I saw you the other day. Fantastic job. </p><p>But Hispanic American?the best in history. Asian American?the best in history. Women?I think, Kellyanne?the best in 75 years. The best in?best unemployment numbers in 75 years. What we're doing?it's nothing like this has been done. </p><p>Our military is now strong. When I took it over, it was depleted. We had planes that were so old they didn't fly. They'd have to go to the desert to get parts. When we took it over, it was not a good situation. We got $700 billion, then $716 billion. And we're going to be asking for another one this year. And it's all manufactured in the United States. We make it ourselves. And that's always good, because that's jobs. Now, in this case, jobs aren't important compared to military defense, but we make the best planes and rockets and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nothing like it. And we're doing something that's incredible. </p><p>So our military is strong. Our country is really powerful and really strong. Never been like this. </p><p>[At this point, the President swatted a fly away from his face.] </p><p>Whoops. How did a fly get into the White House? [Laughter] I don't like that. I don't like flies. I don't like flies. [Laughter] So I just want to tell you, just in finishing up, we had a terrible bias. We have censorship like nobody has any understanding or nobody can believe. When you see the Google executives together, and one of their executives decides to put it on the phone?right? That's right. Thank you. Oh, there he is. Stand up, please. Stand up. How good?what a great job. Somebody said he's controversial. I said: \"He's not controversial. He's truthful.\" </p><p>Audience member. That's right! Yes! </p><p>The President. He's truthful. That was a great job. That was one of many. Thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic. </p><p>So, you know, they're playing with a lot of minds, and they're playing unfairly. And the funny thing is that, in theory, they shouldn't be liking the other side. They shouldn't be liking the other side. They should be, really, liking our side, because we're the ones that want freedom far more. </p><p>You see what's happening up in the debate stand. You see what they're doing to each other. You're seeing the hatred that they have up there. And it's a very different philosophy. It's a very different thought. </p><p>And I'll say this: The election that's coming up is, I think?and you know, we talk 2016, and I would say maybe that's the most important, and certainly, I said it. But what we're really fighting for?there has never been a difference of this candidate, our candidate, your candidate against whoever it may be. There will never be anything like that, hopefully, again, because what they're looking at is pure socialism or worse than socialism. You know, there's a word called \"communism\" too. There's a word called?they don't like to use it. Very rarely do you hear that. But there's a word called \"communism,\" and they're trying to get socialism over the line. </p><p>But these people are?this is beyond socialism, to a large extent. And I think that we're going to have a tremendous success. We had a?sort of, an opening rally in Orlando, Florida. We had 109,000?maybe more; I think it was nine?wanting to come. We were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming. We have a 21,000-seat stadium, and then, with the basketball court, it held many more than that. It was packed. And we had a similar number outside, and we had thousands and thousands of people that wanted to be there. And this was an opening. </p><p>And you look at Biden; they say he had 600 people. That wasn't 600; that was 150 people. [Laughter] That was 150. That was a very small crowd. [Laughter] And even their big crowds?I mean, if they have 1,000 people, it's like a big crowd. We have enthusiasm that's far greater than the left. It's not even a contest. They don't want to say that. They never will say that. </p><p>We had, on the Mall, just the other day?Fourth of July?a tremendous success. It was pouring. The weather was just?it was beautiful, in one way. They learned it was my real hair that day?[laughter]?because I was drenched. Well, that is the one good thing. I ran, and they learned it's my hair, because I've been through every windstorm, sandstorm. Let's go over here. Let's go this one, that one?this desert. Let's go to this ocean and get out of the plane. \"Sir, the wind is blowing at about 70 miles an hour.\" I said, \"Boy, it's got to be mine.\" [Laughter] </p><p>But we've seen it all. We've seen it all. And I tell you what: More than anything else, I've met great people. I've met great people. Dedicated people. And I think that the election coming up, Kevin, this is the most important election of our times. </p><p>This is an election where our country is going to go one way, or it's going to head in the direction of Venezuela. And that's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen. This Green New Deal?and I?you know, I hate to speak badly of it right now, because it's a little early. I spoke too early on Elizabeth \"Pocahontas\" Warren. [Laughter] I spoke?I should have saved it. </p><p>But you know?so I don't like to go too early because I don't want them to change. I like the Green New Deal. I want them to keep going. I don't want them to make?you know, the problem with this business: They can make a change, and immediately upon making the?it lasts for about a week. You look at, for instance, on the wall, Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall. Right, Liz? Totally in favor. Everybody. Hillary. Everybody. They were all in favor of a wall, just a few years ago. </p><p>Now a wall is a?well, that's okay. They want open borders. They want people to pour in, including criminals, the worst criminals. They want people to pour into our country. Nobody can tell me that's good, politically. Nobody can tell me. </p><p>So all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations, they've got a right to speak their mind. That includes them. That includes them. But they don't have the same difficulty. They don't get shut out. I wrote a few terms. I said to my son Don, who's here somewhere?where are you, Don? Where are you, Don? He's very good. Kimberly. Don. People like Don, I tell you. Good. Thank you, Don. </p><p>But we wrote out a few?shadow ban, hundred percent. You look at what's going on. You know, I could go?the blocking?just the basic blocking of what we want to get out. The fact that they don't let them join. They don't. There was?there's no doubt in my mind that I should have millions and millions?I have millions of people?so many people, I wouldn't believe it. But I know that we've been blocked. </p><p>People come up to me, and they say: \"Sir, I can't get you. I can't follow you. They make it impossible.\" These are people that are really good at what they do. They say, \"They make it absolutely impossible.\" And you know, we can't have it. We're not going to let it happen. Josh, we're not going to let it happen. </p><p>And you know, if they did it on both sides, if it were done to the other side, to the other group?and I'm representing everybody. I do. I represent everybody. I fully understand liberal. I fully understand Democrat. We want to get along. We want to make sure that everybody loves each other, if that's possible. And maybe, I really believe it is. Someday, it will be. </p><p>I, for a while, have said that the thing that's going to bring us together is great success. Now we have tremendous success, greater than we've ever had before. I mean, our country picked up trillions of dollars in value, in worth. China has gone down trillions of dollars. The tariffs have hurt them. I don't want to hurt them, but I want to give us a fair playing field. But China has gone down trillions. We've gone up?not billions, trillions. We've gone up in value, in worth. </p><p>I want everybody to do well, but they've got to treat us fairly. They've got to treat?everybody has to be treated fairly. Their side, our side?we all have to be treated fairly. </p><p>And you know, the farmers say, \"We just want a level playing field, sir.\" I love the farmers. They're patriots. And China, as you know, targeted the farmers, because they think they could get to me by hurting the people that I love and that we take care of. And it had no impact. </p><p>I would watch, even on networks that don't exactly like me, and I'd watch as they interview farmers. And they'd have 10 or 12 people sitting around. They're saying: \"We don't care. The President is right. We've been ripped off for many years. Somebody has to do\"?somebody had to do this. </p><p>China made, over the last 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars. You could say four to five hundred billion dollars a year. That's not sustainable. That's not?we built China. And you know what? They've done a great job. I don't blame them; I blame our former Presidents and the leaders of our country for allowing this to go on ever since the World Trade Organization opened up. They allowed this to go on. They allowed hundreds of billions of dollars a year to be taken out of our country and to be used to rebuild China. So those days are over. </p><p>So right now they're paying 25 percent on $250 billion. A lot of money coming in. You know, we had a 3.2 GDP for the first quarter. Everyone said, \"I wonder how that happened.\" Because first quarter is the weakest quarter always?almost?almost always. And we had like this great quarter. </p><p>But I don't consider 3.2 great. I consider much higher. And frankly, if we had lower interest rates?you know, we're forced to pay more money than other countries, because we have a rate that's high. We have somebody that likes raising rates. Now, I think he's maybe going to change, but we'll find out. But if we had lower, we'd have another 10,000 points. We're doing?we just set a record. You know, I'm a very greedy person. We just set a record: 27,000. I said, \"We could be 10,000 points higher.\" We could be 10,000?because there's no inflation. A big thing is inflation. There's no inflation. But we're doing so well. We're going to keep it that way. </p><p>So I just want to introduce?because a person that I've admired for a long time who is a great lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, and she's one of the leading First Amendment lawyers in our country. And, Harmeet, could you come up, just say a few words, please? Thank you. </p><p>Dhillon Law Group, Inc., Founder Harmeet K. Dhillon. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. It's a tremendous honor to be here with a lot of people who I really respect and admire. </p><p>The corrupt establishment that you talked about and the mainstream media have told a lot of people in this room that the social media censorship and the banning that we're experiencing is all in our heads. They're gaslighting us with this lie. </p><p>[Ms. Dhillon continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] </p><p>Now, Senator Blackburn knows, from what happened to her on Twitter, that these companies are trying to stop the ordinary men and women who you represent from hearing their voices. I'm very concerned that they affected the outcome of the 2018 election. And if we let them do what they're going to?what they've been doing, it's going to affect the outcome of the 2020 election as well. </p><p>So, Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting everybody here to talk about these issues. And we're all behind you joining the fight to make sure that every American's voice is heard. Thank you very much. </p><p>The President. And what Harmeet said is so, so true. I mean it's?it's really incredible. You know, I've watched, and I've watched some of these scenes that have been taped and gotten through?talented people, by the way?but gotten through and gotten to the public where you see the hatred of our party, of our people, of our voice. And you say, \"That's the collusion.\" It's a collusion between the Democrats and the media and social media and these platforms. It's a disgraceful thing. </p><p>And another thing, I believe you're representing a young man who just got slugged, viciously slugged. I think it's a disgrace. Do you ever notice they pick on certain people? I mean, he would tell you he's not the toughest person in the world physically, right? They don't go after Bikers for Trump. [Laughter] </p><p>Do you ever notice that? They don't go after our construction workers, who love us. They don't go after the police. They don't go after?we have incredible people. You know, we're the elite. They say they're elite. You know. Do you ever hear this? Hey, I live better than all of them. [Laughter] Great education. The greatest houses. The great?but I guess I'm not elite. They live like in the basement of their mom's home. [Laughter] Their arms are this big. Look, like this. But they have the black?they have the black masks on, and they have sticks. And they hit people. [Laughter] They hit people in the face, in the head, this Antifa. </p><p>But do you ever notice the Antifa is never there when we have a bikers rally? [Laughter] They're never there when the construction workers and the unions are honoring the President. They're never around. They're always there when you have a single guy protesting in front of a school. </p><p>And as you probably know?I think all of you know?we did something very serious. I signed an Executive order recently. We're taking money away from those schools. We're going to?you know, we give them billions and billions of dollars, and they don't allow free speech. And we don't want anything special, but we want free speech. </p><p>We're also joined by someone affected by this troubling bias very, very much?and president of Live Action and somebody I've watched, really, with great admiration. Lila, please come up. Lila Rose. Thank you. </p><p>Live Action President Lila Rose. Thank you so much, Mr. President. It's really an honor to be here. Thank you for doing this important summit. </p><p>The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. </p><p>Ms. Rose. I represent Live Action. I'm the founder and president, and we are a pro-life organization which reaches millions of people every week with the truth about abortion and human dignity. </p><p>[Ms. Rose continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] </p><p>And then, recently, our videos have been viewed more highly than almost any other abortion-related content on YouTube. But YouTube?we made it to the first page of search results, but YouTube buried our pro-life videos and boosted pro-abortion videos. So this double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech, even though they say that they are politically neutral and they don't discriminate. They even testified before Congress and said that. </p><p>So thank you so much to the administration and to you, Mr. President, for holding this very important summit. </p><p>The President. Thank you. </p><p>Ms. Rose. Thank you. </p><p>The President. Great job. Thank you very much. </p><p>So one of the advantages of being President is, when you ask for a meeting, you get it, generally. I don't know, I can't think of too many I haven't gotten. And you say, \"I'd like to see you in Oval Office.\" Or you have somebody call?Oval Office. </p><p>I have been with all of these people at the highest level, one-on-one, just recently, with Google. Just recently, with Twitter. The top. Right? And you talk to them and you swear they're like your best friend. \"Oh, sir. No, we're?we're?we believe?we?freedom of speech. Oh, yes.\" </p><p>Audience member. [Inaudible] </p><p>The President. And we go out?? </p><p>He says, \"Liar.\" Who said that? [Laughter] Must come from Queens. [Laughter] So it's very interesting to see that. And?and the level of?you know, you look at them?the sincerity. And I say, \"That's fantastic.\" And they'll leave. And then, I'll realize, 3 or 4 weeks later, it's worse. It actually got worse. </p><p>Because I say?look, I believe in technology. I believe in free markets. I believe in freedom of speech. I believe in all of the things, and they are super genius. I'll tell you, I'm dealing with China. And they admitted there's nobody like Silicon Valley. There's nobody smart, in that sense; maybe not smart in other senses. I've watched some of them speak before Congress; it's not pretty. [Laughter] I say, \"I could do much better than that.\" [Laughter] </p><p>But I tell you what: Technologically, it's unbelievable what they think of. Even Dan and I, when we sat with you-know-who at Twitter?number one. We talked about certain things. He says, \"You know, we could do this, this, this.\" I said, \"That's really great.\" You know, this is incredible stuff. China will admit there's nobody like these brains. But they're not using that brilliance, and they're not using what we gave them fairly. And they have to do that. </p><p>And we don't want to stifle anything. We certainly don't want to stifle free speech, but that's no longer free speech. See, I don't think that the mainstream media is free speech either, because it's so crooked. It's so dishonest. </p><p>So, to me, free speech is not when you see something good, and then you purposely write bad. To me, that's very dangerous speech, and you become angry at it. But that's not free speech. Somebody came to my office?and I won't say who, but a very big person?and I said, \"Okay, you don't like the term 'fake news'\"?which I think I get credit for, but I'm sure that, if I said I get credit, they'll say, \"Thirteen years ago, somebody came up with the terms 'fake.'\" [Laughter] I think I'd get credit. I'd be very proud to take it. But I think I'd get credit. </p><p>Now, by the way, the worst fakers of all are using \"fake news.\" I saw the other day on CNN?total fakes?I see on CNN?they go, \"Fake-news media has reported\"?no, no, they're fake-news media. [Laughter] They've turned it around. They've turned it around. </p><p>So I'm not going to allow?and Josh and all of us, we're not just going to allow it to happen like this. We're not going to be silenced. </p><p>Two months ago, we created a new White House tool to report social media bias, censorship, and discrimination. We saw you folks being taken off, and we fought on all of you. And many of you are back now. But many of the names?I won't mention your names?but some of you were taken off for absolutely no reason. </p><p>I mean, in all fairness, some of you I could almost understand. [Laughter] I mean, some of you guys are out there. [Laughter] But even you should have a voice. [Laughter] But some of you?no, some of you deserve?[applause]?some of you. I mean, it's genius, but it's bad. [Laughter] </p><p>But they take off people that are?you know, that you wouldn't believe. And we received over 16,000 responses just in a tiny little period of time talking about this subject. </p><p>Based on the feedback that we're hearing from you, I'm announcing that we will ask representatives of the major social media platforms to join me at the White House over the next month, have a big meeting and a real conversation. We want?might want to invite some of you. I know, Josh, we're going to have you and some of the Senators. </p><p>And it's amazing how the Senators?including Democrats, in all fairness?which is probably because they know it can turn on them also. It can turn very quickly. But they want to come. So we'll let you know the date, okay? And today I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free speech rights of all Americans. That's you people in this room and a lot of people out there. There are a lot of people. </p><p>We hope to see transparency, more accountability, and more freedom. That's on both sides. This is not?I am not speaking for our side, assuming we're all?I don't even know if you're on our side. You could be some of the most liberal people in the world in this audience, and that's okay. I don't care. But we're talking about for everybody. Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people. </p><p>To all of the social media influencers here today?a lot of?you have a lot of power, and you have a lot of strength. And you know, you have to use it wisely. Many of you do, but you have to. I want to thank you once again for being here. You're very special people. You're very brilliant people, in so many cases. I look around the room, I mean, I see people that really have almost found a new life over the last short period of time with this new technology. But this new technology is so powerful and so important, and it has to be used fairly. It has to be used fairly. </p><p>So thank you all for being here. It's a great honor, tremendous honor. </p><p>We're going to take a few questions, I think. And then, I'll head out. And you're going to actually come?if you want, you can come to the great Rose Garden. You can stand in the rain with me. We're going to talk a little bit about the fact that we're not allowed to ask for whether or not somebody is a citizen on the census form. And I think we have a solution that will be very good for a lot of people, really good. </p><p>[The event continued with a question-and-answer session, and no transcript was provided.] </p><p>NOTE: The President spoke at 3:51 p.m. in the East Room at the White House.

EDT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please sit down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to thank you all for being here -- a very special day, a very important day. Many of you are friends, and many of you are friends that I don't know what you look like, but I know what you sound like -- (laughter) -- which, I guess, is probably more important. Right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I want to thank you. And it's a terrific -- it's a terrific day to be together. And, if you look, you're in a very famous place. We all work very hard. And I don't know if you call it \"influence,\" I don't know if you call it \"power,\" but whatever it is, we're in the White House. And we're going to stay in the White, and we're going to get our agenda done and completed beautifully. (Applause.)</p><p>So I'm thrilled to welcome you here. And we're all working very hard. And I don't know if you know, but we just did 27,000 on the Dow. That's the highest in history. We're up a couple of hundred points today. (Applause.) The highest in history -- for those of you that like the stock market.</p><p>But the stock market means jobs. I view it as jobs, and I view it as 401(k)s. A lot of people say, \"Oh, the rich people are getting rich.\" But if you look at the numbers, the greatest impact, proportionately, is blue-collar workers in what's happened, in this miracle that's happening. (Applause.)</p><p>And people with 401(k)s, they're up 72 percent and 67 percent. And the wife or the husband -- whoever is responsible -- the other one says, \"You're a genius. You're a great financial investor.\" (Laughter.) \"Darling, you're up 77 percent this year.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>So a lot of good things happened. A lot of people are happy. And I think, really, everybody is happy; some people just aren't willing to admit it. Does that make sense\" (Laughter.)</p><p>So this is a historic day. Never before have so many online journalists and influencers -- and that's exactly what you are; you're journalists and you're influencers -- come together in this building to discuss the future of social media.</p><p>Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation. You're challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the American people. And that's what you're doing -- you're going right to the people.</p><p>Possibly, we wouldn't be here right now. I asked somebody, \"What do you think I'd do without social media\" Would I be here?\" Because I said, \"I think so.\" (Laughter.) But they weren't so sure. (Laughter.) I have to say that; you know that. I'm not sure I believe that, but I have to say it.</p><p>But you communicate directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake-news filter. It's very simple. Together, you reach more people than any television broadcast network by far -- not even close.</p><p>We're delighted to be joined at this summit by someone you know very well: our Senior Advisor for Digital Strategy and somebody that's been working for me for a long time, for many years, Dan Scavino. Where is Dan\" (Applause.) Stand up. Come here. Great job.</p><p>So, long before we were even doing this, he was at a club -- running a club and other businesses. And he was okay at doing it. (Laughter.) Not the greatest. I wouldn't say the greatest. (Laughter.) But you know what he was great at\" He was always looking at his computer screen. I said, \"That guy is incredible.\"</p><p>So, right at the beginning, I said, \"That's the man.\" And there was nobody better at that. And I think Hillary had 28 people and I had Dan. (Laughter.) Right\" (Applause.) I had my Dan. And he works about 28 hours a day, and he works very hard. But he doesn't work -- I mean, he loves it. He loves it.</p><p>And his imagination and, really, working with all of you and many of you -- he'll come up with ideas and you'll come up with ideas. And he'll run into my office. He said, \"You got to see this.\"</p><p>And a lot of times, I'll go out and I'll spend a lot of money on a concept. I'll say, \"Here's a concept. Come up with this.\" And we'll hire these companies, and they want a lot of money. And they come back -- it just happened the other day, right\" I said, \"That's terrible. These guys have no talent.\" (Laughter.) The people that have the talent are the people that we deal with. And it's true.</p><p>And some of you are extraordinary. I can't say everybody, but -- (laughter). No, but some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable. (Laughter and applause.) True. Unbelievable.</p><p>So I'm going to go back to the basics of Washington. I'm going to introduce some of my Secretaries. Steve Mnuchin. Steve\" Where's Steve\" Steve has done a fantastic job. (Applause.)</p><p>Wilbur Ross. Wilbur\" We have a meeting -- (applause) -- in a little while, on the census and citizenship. Can you believe: \"Are you a citizen of the United States of America?\" \"Sir, you can't ask that question.\" (Laughter.) \"Why?\" \"Because the court said you can't.\"</p><p>We have three very unfriendly courts. They fight us all the way. The judges don't like us too much, I guess. But think of that, Herman. Think of that question: \"Are you a citizen?\"</p><p>We spend -- this is another thing that's so crazy: $20 billion on a census -- $20 billion. They spend $20 billion. I said, \"20 billion what?\" (Laughter.) Twenty billion dollars on a census.</p><p>They go through houses -- they go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. \"How many toilets do they have?\" \"How many desks do they have?\" \"How many beds?\" \"What's their roof made of?\" (Laughter.) The only thing we can't ask is, \"Are you a citizen of the United States?\" (Laughter and applause.) No, isn't it the craziest thing\" Twenty billion. (Applause.) Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing, Charlie.</p><p>Also, David Bernhardt, great job you're doing -- Interiors. (Applause.) He's the largest landlord in the United States. When my friends tell me how big they are, they -- \"I just bought another building.\" Big deal, Kevin, right\" They bought another building. Then I look at David Bernhardt; he controls half of the United States. (Laughter.) Department of Interior. There's a lot of land -- a lot of beautiful land -- that we're taking good care of, David. Right?</p><p>Acting Director Russ Vought. Russ, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) We're working on our budget. (Applause.)</p><p>Along with some of the great members of Congress and a wonderful friend of mine who's my Leader, right\" He's my Leader. I tell him that to his face because it makes him feel good. I don't know if I believe that, Marsha. (Laughter.) But, Kevin -- stand up, Kevin. Kevin McCarthy, everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>enator Marsha Blackburn of the great state of Tennessee. We campaigned together. (Applause.) And she did -- we can say it now: She ran against the most popular Democrat in the last 50 years. He really was great. A good man, right\" THE PRESIDENT: And governor for quite a long time -- eight years. And she just didn't stop.</p><p>SENATOR BLACKBURN: I beat him by 12 points.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Twelve points. (Applause.) She was down by 10, and she won by 12. That's right. She was down by 10, and she won by 12. And she wouldn't stop. They just -- every day, \"Where is she?\" \"She's here. She's there.\" Fantastic job you did. We're proud of you.</p><p>SENATOR BLACKBURN: Thank you (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, honey. That's great. It was just -- honestly, working with people that know what they're doing, it's fun. That was fun. And you know what you're doing.</p><p>Representative Dan Crenshaw, who is very good at this, by the way, Dan. (Applause.) Very good at this. Really good. Thank you. It's great to have you in the party. And you have more courage than I do, Dan. Okay\" That courage of yours is incredible. Thank you very much. Great job.</p><p>A friend of mine, and a wonderful person, and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future, I'd say -- I hear a lot of very positive things -- Liz Cheney. Liz, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.</p><p>And, you know, I pardoned somebody named Scooter Libby. A lot of you don't know who Scooter Libby is. Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly. And Liz was right on the forefront of that one. And I said, \"What do you think, Liz?\" And you said, \"Absolutely. He deserves it.\" And it's been a very popular pardon. He was treated very, very brutally and unfairly. So, thank you for that -- for that help.</p><p>Matt Gaetz. Where's Matt\" Where's Matt\" Stand up, Matt. (Applause.) Boy, a great defender. He gets on television, and he's like -- it doesn't stop. And he's smart, and he's good, and he loves Florida, and he loves his people, and he's a hard worker. And, Matt, thank you very much. I really appreciate it very much.</p><p>And Mike Johnson. Mike, thank you. (Applause.) Great job, Mike.</p><p>And I want to thank a man who I said, a long time ago, when we said, \"Let's do it\" -- because Josh Hawley is special. He is somebody that -- I said, \"Josh, you got to run.\" \"Well, I don't know.\" You know, he had a good set-up -- pretty well, right\" You weren't going anywhere. He could do whatever he wanted in his great state.</p><p>And I said, \"I'm telling you, you can do it.\" And she turned out -- she's a tough candidate. Whether you like her or you don't like her, she's tough. Right\" And by the end of that, that was incredible. That was a hell of a race and he won. And he's young and he's brilliant. And I'm going to ask him to come up and say a few words, if you don't mind, about what we're doing. And come on up right now. I think it would be a good time, right\" (Applause.)</p><p>SENATOR HAWLEY: Thank you. Well, first of all, can we just give another round of applause to the President of the United States for his leadership on this issue\" (Applause.)</p><p>You know, the media -- the media says -- the establishment media, the fake media -- they say, \"Oh, there's no censorship in social media. That's all made up. That's all fake.\" You and I know that that's not true. You and I know the truth is that the social media giants would love to shut us down. They would love to shut us up. They would love to shut him up more than anything else. And we can't let them. And that's why we need to step up now.</p><p>And I think we need to say to them, \"Here's the deal.\" Google, Facebook, Twitter -- they've gotten these special deals from government. They've gotten a special giveaway from government. They're treated unlike anybody else. If they want to keep their special deal, here's the bargain: They have to quit discriminating against conservatives. Do you agree with that\" No more! (Applause.) No more discrimination. It's that simple. (Applause.) That's all we're asking for.</p><p>They ought to abide by the same principles of free speech and the First Amendment that this country embraces, that we love and call our own. And I don't think it's too much to ask for these huge tech platforms -- who've gotten rich off our information, right\" Off of our data, off of everything we've given them -- they've gotten rich off of it. They've gotten rich off their special privileges from government. If they want to keep those, they shouldn't discriminate. They shouldn't censor. They shouldn't shut us down.</p><p>I want to thank the President again for his incredible leadership. Thank you for allowing me to be here. Thank you, Mr. President, for all that you do. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, you know, Josh is doing -- right now, he's doing some very important legislation because we have to do something about what's happening. I never hear about the other side. I can tell you -- I think I'm pretty good at getting out a message, but, technologically, I would think I'm okay. Just okay. But I'll tell you, a lot of bad things are happening.</p><p>I have people come up to me, \"Sir, we want to follow you. They don't let us on.\" And it was so different than it was even six, seven months ago. I was picking up unbelievable amounts of people. And I'm hotter now than I was then, okay\" Because, you know, you also cool off, right\" But much hotter. (Laughter.) Especially with a nice, new stock market like it is, right?</p><p>But, no, I'm hotter now. And I go to Dan, and I say, \"Hey, what's going on here\" It used to take me a short number of days to pick up 100,000 people.\" I'm not complaining; we're like 60-some-odd million. But then we have five different sites. We have another site with 25 million. We have another site with 10 or 12. Then we have Facebook. Then we have Instagram. We have a lot -- you know, a lot of people -- way, way over 100 million.</p><p>But I used to pick them up, and I -- when I say \"used to,\" I'm talking about a few months ago. I was picking them up 100,000 people every -- very short period of time. Now it's, I would say, 10 times as long.</p><p>And I noticed things happening when I put out something -- a good one -- that people like. (Laughter.) Right\" A good tweet. It goes up. It used to go up -- it would say \"7,000, 7,008, 7,017, 7,024, 7,032, 7,044.\" (Laughter.) Right\" Now it goes \"7,000, 7,008, 6,998.\"</p><p>Then they go, \"7,009, 6,074.\" I say, \"What's going on?\" It never did that before. It goes up, and then they take it down, and then it goes up. I never had that. Does anyone know what I'm talking about with this?</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I never had that before. I used to watch it. It would be like a rocket ship when I put out a beauty. (Laughter and applause.) Like when I said -- remember I said somebody was \"spying on me\"? That thing was like a rocket. I got a call two minutes later. \"Did you say that?\" I said, \"Yeah, I said that.\" \"Well, it's exploding.\" (Laughter.) \"It's exploding.\" I turned out to be right. I turned out to be right. And we turn out to be right about lot of things. (Applause.)</p><p>But I never had it. I'm just saying from -- you know, from the standpoint of a -- of somebody that maybe has used social media better than anybody, Josh, because I became President. I'm sure I could have done it, as we said, much -- I would have -- there's no question I would have done it either way.</p><p>I said to Mark Burnett the other day -- I said, \"So, The Apprentice...\" Had I never done \"The Apprentice\" -- because it was a tremendous hit for 12 seasons. I said, \"Had I never done The Apprentice, would I be President?\" He said, \"Maybe not.\" And I said, \"I think I would have.\" But I'm always going to say that. (Laughter.) I'm always going to say it. But it was a great show.</p><p>But with social media -- so I've never seen it before where I go up and then come down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Now, ultimately, you get -- but it goes very slowly. But I've never seen where it's subtracted. And I really believe people are -- they're taking it up as it goes up. And it -- sometimes it comes down substantially.</p><p>A number of months ago, I was at a certain number -- you know, many millions -- and then all of a sudden, I was down over a million. And then I came down -- I said, \"What's going on?\" And you checked, Dan, and you said, \"They say they're doing adjustments. They say they don't like some of the people.\"</p><p>And I don't have the fake people. You know, a lot of people buy people. I don't want to do that because, first of all, if I did it, it's a front page story all over the place. (Laughter.) but I know a lot of people -- there's no question about it, because I see some numbers that are phony numbers where they have these, you know, many, many millions of followers. And I say, \"There's no way because nobody has any interest in these people.\" (Laughter.) There's -- they have no --</p><p>Now, Herman Cain, they have interest in, okay\" (Applause.) But they have no interest in these people. They're playing games. They're playing games.</p><p>James Woods. I don't know James, but he's an interesting guy and he's a conservative guy. And he is a straight shooter. He's tough. But when they want to take him off -- and other people like him; many in this room, some in this room -- it's a very, very bad -- it's a very bad thing.</p><p>So I have many millions of followers across various accounts. And together, everyone in this room, we reach over a half a billion followers. And I think that's probably a low number. Because one of the things I get that's a little benefit -- I'll go, \"Watch.\" Like, I did Golan Heights. I gave Israel the -- the real credit over -- and, you know, Golan Heights in Israel. Very important.</p><p>But I gave representation, in the strongest form, of the Golan Heights -- Israel. And I talked about it in a little quick tweet. They've been looking at it -- for 52 years, they've been trying to get it. They couldn't get it. They'd have many summits where people would fly in, talk about the Golan Heights, and then fly out. This went on many, many summits. It's about a 52-year period. I said, \"What happened?\" They said, \"Nothing.\" They'd fly in. They'd fly out. Some had beautiful planes. Some didn't. Some probably didn't get there by plane. But they'd have many summits.</p><p>said, \"Watch, I'm going to do this.\" And I said, \"We recognize the Golan Heights as being part of Israel.\" It was a big thing. I go, \"Watch this.\" Boom. I press it and, within two seconds, \"We have breaking news.\" John Roberts of Fox was over, and he said, \"We have breaking news. Please, break it up.\" Doesn't matter what they're talking about, John, does it\" He breaks it up.</p><p>Now, that's Twitter. That's social media. I call Twitter a \"typewriter.\" That's what I really call Twitter, because it goes onto Facebook automatically and it goes onto Instagram. And it goes onto television -- more so Fox than it does CNN. If it's something bad, they'll put it on. (Laughter.)</p><p>If I have a spelling deal, they will put it on. (Laughter.) It's -- \"Donald Trump spelled the word 'the' wrong.\" You know\" (Laughter.) \"He doesn't know how to spell, 'the.' He spelled it 'T-H-I.'\" (Laughter.) You know, I couldn't care -- any kind of a punctuation mistake, they put it on. So I'm very, very careful. I really -- I'm actually a good speller. But everyone said, \"The fingers aren't as good as the brain.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But -- but it is true. And it's -- it's incredible what it does. I put out a social media statement. And I was telling Kellyanne the other day, I said, you know, I used to put out like a press release, right\" And people would pick it up, sort of, you know, in the next day, two days. They'd find it sitting on a desk. If I put out -- we hardly do press releases anymore because if I put out, on social media, a statement -- like I'm going to in a little while on something totally unrelated, but a very important statement. Now they're going crazy. \"What it is\" Tell me what it is.\" Watch. (Laughter.) But it's very important.</p><p>But if I put that out in a press release, I'm telling you, Kevin, people don't pick it up. It's me -- same. If I put it out on social media, it's like an explosion. Fox, CNN, crazy MSNBC -- they're stone-cold crazy. (Laughter.) I made them a lot of money with \"The Apprentice.\" And I gave them a top show when they were dying on NBC. But they don't like me too much. They wanted a big extension. They used Arnold Schwarzenegger instead -- a big movie star. You know what\" He died. He died. (Laughter.) I was there 12 -- 12 years, 14 seasons. And then they pick a movie actor and he dies on us. (Laughter.)</p><p>You know, I own that with Mark Burnett and some people. And I said -- they said, \"Would you rather have him had been like this tremendous massive success?\" You own it, so you benefit, financially. \"Or would you rather have him die?\" So they just say, \"You did it for 14 seasons, 12 years.\" I said, \"I think I'd rather him die at it.\" (Laughter.) That means you don't need the money. I'd rather have him die at it. Anyway.</p><p>But with amazing creativity and determination, you're bypassing the corrupt establishment -- and it is corrupt -- and you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media -- which not all of it, but much of it is far greater percentages than anyone would understand. As the cameras start to go off. There go the red lights. Look, boom. I can always tell. (Laughter.)</p><p>I can always tell. Like, when I talk about -- and I'll be in the stadium. The red lights are all on. Everyone has got -- and then we start talking about, like, the media -- how dishonest it is, how corrupt it is, how fake it is. And you see lights going off. (Laughter.) Lights immediately go off. And, usually, they don't come back. They say, \"This guy is impossible.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But I want to just say it because you people have a lot of courage. To each and every one of you, I say: Thank you very much, on behalf of a nation. Thank you very much. It's very important what you're doing. You're getting the -- you're getting, in many cases, the honest word out -- not in all cases, but in many cases.</p><p>When historians look back at this time, they will see that many of the biggest news stories of our era were totally ignored. I -- I can tell you that I deal with the media, and the spin they put on it -- or sometimes they'll leave it out, and then if there's something slightly negative, they'll make it, you know, headline news. They'll put it down as headline news. Or even covered up by the media -- they were broken up by citizens.</p><p>And you'll take a look at what's happening, and you see stories that should be phenomenal, big, beautiful stories and it turns out that they don't get covered. We did something yesterday on kidney and kidney dialysis, and there's a tremendous number of people with problems with kidneys. And it was Secretary Azar -- it was a big, big important thing. It got very little coverage. You know, very positive -- what we did is such -- such a great thing.</p><p>I don't care. We don't have to get the -- hey, it's good for our nation. It's good for people to read about it and see the strides that we've made and what we're doing. But that doesn't get covered and it should get covered. And it doesn't get covered for a reason because they don't want to give that to a conservative. They don't want to let that happen.</p><p>Now, if somebody else were in this position -- such as the previous administration -- they'd make that headline news all over the place, what we did yesterday. But when we're doing it, they give very little credit to that.</p><p>But anything bad that happens -- I always say, \"They can take bad and make it horrible. They can take a good story and make it sort of bad. And they can take a great, great story and make it anywhere from good to slightly bad.\" (Laughter.) It's incredible what they can do.</p><p>I say I haven't had a good story in two and a half years. I used to get great press. Steve Mnuchin knows. He said, \"Man, you get the greatest press.\" Until I got elected. (Laughter.) Then it stopped. But I used to get the greatest press -- possibly one of the reasons I'm here.</p><p>But we're getting the word out, and we get it out in a different way. I didn't think we'd have to -- Charlie, I didn't think it would be this tough and --</p><p>By the way, two very special people -- I have to say hello to them. Because my wife said, \"I see these two beautiful women -- African American, incredible women -- that are on television. They are unbelievable.\" This is two years ago. She was before her time. They have no idea who I'm talking about. (Laughter.) She was -- our First Lady said, \"You have to see these women. They're incredible. They're genius. And they like you.\" I said, \"I want to see them.\" (Laughter.) And I liked them. I loved them, actually. I loved them. Come. Come. (Applause.)</p><p>I don't want them to fall, because it'll be a major story. (Laughter.)</p><p>So, when the historians look back, they're going to see something very important took place right here. Before today, it took place. It started taking place a number of years ago, and it's something that nobody ever thought would happen.</p><p>Free speech is a bedrock of American life. Our constitutional rights must be fiercely protected. And I want you to know that we will always have your back. We're fighting for you very hard. We're going to be calling a big meeting of the companies for -- in a week or two. They have to be here.</p><p>And Josh is really leading a very strong group of people. This isn't just Josh. This is you leading a tremendous group, and they feel equally as strongly as you because they see the unfairness of what's happening.</p><p>And remember: We won. We have a bigger voice than anybody. But we don't get covered fairly. Can you imagine if we were covered fairly\" We had our best polls, like, yesterday, they were telling me. I said, \"Could you imagine if I actually got good press instead of -- even fair press. I don't want good; I want fair.\" Can you imagine what those numbers would be\" They make up stories -- you know, the Russian hoax. I call it the \"Russian hoax\" -- the witch hunt. All bad publicity, and yet we're doing great in the polls.</p><p>So people understand it. The public is very smart. But we're getting the word out about so many things -- not just that -- about so many things.</p><p>And maybe the most important thing about how great our country is doing. Jobs -- now more people working today than ever in the history of our country. Ever in the history of our country -- think of that. Unemployment are the best numbers in 51 years. For African American, the best numbers in our history -- in our history, Herman, right\" (Applause.) Including you. And you're making a lot, I hope.</p><p>But Hispanic American -- best numbers in history. (Applause.) Right\" Stand up. And I like your dresses, by the way, very much. No, not you, sir. You. (Laughter.) Thank you. I saw you the other day. Fantastic job.</p><p>But Hispanic American -- the best in history. Asian American -- the best in history. Women -- I think, Kellyanne -- the best in 75 years. The best in -- best unemployment numbers in 75 years. What we're doing -- it's nothing like this has been done.</p><p>Our military is now strong. When I took it over, it was depleted. We had planes that were so old they didn't fly. They'd have to go to the desert to get parts. When we took it over, it was not a good situation. We got $700 billion, and then $716 billion. And we're going to be asking for another one this year. And it's all manufactured in the United States. We make it ourselves. And that's always good, because that's jobs. Now, in this case, jobs aren't important compared military defense, but we make the best planes and rockets and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nothing like it. And we're doing something that's incredible.</p><p>So, our military is strong. Our -- our country is really powerful and really strong. Never been like this.</p><p>Whoops. How did a fly get into the White House\" (Laughter.) I don't like that. I don't like flies. I don't like flies. (Laughter.)</p><p>So I just want to tell you, just in finishing up, we had a terrible bias. We have censorship like nobody has any understanding or nobody can believe. When you see the Google executives together, and one of their executives decides to put it on the phone -- right\" That's right. Thank you. Oh, there he is. Stand up, please. Stand up. (Applause.) How good -- what a great job. Somebody said he's controversial. I said, \"He's not controversial. He's truthful.\" He's truthful. (Applause.) That was a great job. That was one of many. Thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic.</p><p>So, you know, they're playing with -- with a lot of minds and they're playing unfairly. And the funny thing is that, in theory, they shouldn't be liking the other side. They shouldn't be liking the other side. They should be, really, liking our side, because we're the ones that want freedom far more.</p><p>You see what's happening up in the debate stand. You see what they're doing to each other. You're seeing the hatred that they have up there. And it's a very different philosophy. It's a very different thought.</p><p>And I'll say this: The election that's coming up is, I think -- and, you know, we talk 2016, and I would say maybe that's the most important, and certainly I said it. But what we're really fighting for -- there has never been a difference of this candidate, our candidate, your candidate against whoever it may be. There will never be anything like that hopefully again, because what they're looking at is pure socialism or worse than socialism. You know, there's a word called \"communism,\" too. There's a word called -- they don't like to use it. Very rarely do you hear that. But there's a word called \"communism,\" and they're trying to get socialism over the line.</p><p>But these people are -- this is beyond socialism, to a large extent. And I think that we're going to have a tremendous success. We had a -- sort of, an opening rally in Orlando, Florida. We had 109,000 -- maybe more; I think it was nine -- wanting to come. We were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming. We have a 21,000-seat stadium, and then, with the basketball court, it held many more than that. It was packed. And we had a similar number outside, and we had thousands and thousands of people that wanted to be there. And this was an opening.</p><p>And you look at Biden; they say he had 600 people. That wasn't 600; that was 150 people. (Laughter and applause.) That was 150. That was a very small crowd. (Laughter.) And even their big crowds -- I mean, if they have 1,000 people, it's like a big crowd. We have enthusiasm that's far greater than the left. It's not even a contest. They don't want to say that. They never will say that.</p><p>We had, on the Mall, just the other day -- 4th of July -- a tremendous success. It was pouring. The weather was just -- it was beautiful, in one way. They learned it was my real hair that day -- (laughter) -- because I was drenched. Well, that is the one good thing. I ran, and they learned it's my hair, because I've been through every windstorm, sandstorm. Let's go over here. Let's go this one, that one -- this desert. Let's go to this ocean and get out of the plane. \"Sir, the wind is blowing at about 70 miles an hour.\" I said, \"Boy, it's got to be -- it's got to be mine.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But we've seen it all. We've seen it all. And I tell you what: More than anything else, I've met great people. I've met great people. Dedicated people. And I think that the election coming up, Kevin, this is the most important election of our times.</p><p>This is an election where our country is going to go one way or it's going to head in the direction of Venezuela. And that's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen. This Green New Deal -- and I -- you know, I hate to speak badly of it right now because it's a little early. I spoke too early on Elizabeth \"Pocahontas\" Warren. (Laughter.) I spoke -- I should've saved it.</p><p>But, you know -- so I don't like to go too early because I don't want them to change. I like the Green New Deal. I want them to keep going. I don't want them to make -- you know, the problem with this business: They can make a change, and immediately upon making the -- it lasts for about a week. You look at, for instance, on the wall, Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall. Right, Liz\" Totally in favor. Everybody. Hillary. Everybody. They were all in favor of a wall, just a few years ago.</p><p>Now a wall is a -- well, that's okay. They want open borders. They want people to pour in, including criminals -- the worst criminals. They want people to pour into our country. Nobody can tell me that's good, politically. Nobody can tell me.</p><p>So all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations, they've got a right to speak their mind. That includes them. That includes them. But they don't have the same difficulty. They don't get shut out. I wrote a few terms. I said to my son, Don, who's here some- -- where are you, Don\" Where are you, Don\" (Applause.) He's very good. Kimberly. Don. People like Don, I tell you. (Applause.) Good. Thank you, Don.</p><p>But we wrote out a few -- shadow ban, 100 percent. You look at what's going on. You know, I could go -- the blocking -- just the basic blocking of what we want to get out. The fact that they don't let them join. They don't. There was -- there's no doubt in my mind that I should have millions and millions -- I have millions of people -- so many people, I wouldn't believe it. But I know that we've been blocked.</p><p>People come up to me and they say, \"Sir, I can't get you. I can't follow you. They make it impossible.\" These are people that are really good at what they do. They say, \"They make it absolutely impossible.\" And, you know, we can't have it. We're not going to let it happen. Josh, we're not going to let it happen.</p><p>And, you know, if they did it on both sides, if it were done to the other side, to the other group -- and I'm representing everybody. I do. I represent everybody. I fully understand liberal. I fully understand Democrat. We want to get along. We want to make sure that everybody loves each other, if that's possible. And, maybe, I really believe it is. Someday it will be.</p><p>I, for a while, have said that the thing that's going to bring us together is great success. Now we have tremendous success -- greater than we've ever had before. I mean, our country picked up trillions of dollars in value and worth. China has gone down trillions of dollars. The tariffs have hurt them. I don't want to hurt them, but I want to give us a fair playing field. But China has gone down trillions. We've gone up tril- -- not billions, trillions. We've gone up in value and worth.</p><p>I want everybody to do well, but they've got to treat us fairly. They've got to treat -- everybody has to be treated fairly. Their side, our side -- we all have to be treated fairly.</p><p>And, you know, the farmers say, \"We just want a level playing field, sir.\" I love the farmers. They're patriots. And China, as you know, targeted the farmers because they think they could get to me by hurting the people that I love and that we take care of. And it had no impact.</p><p>I would watch, even on networks that don't exactly like me, and I'd watch as they interview farmers. And they'd have 10 or 12 people sitting around. They're saying, \"We don't care. The President is right. We've been ripped off for many years. Somebody has to do -- somebody had to do this.\"</p><p>China made, over the last 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars. You could say four to five hundred billion dollars a year. That's not sustainable. That's not -- we built China. And you know what\" They've done a great job. I don't blame them; I blame our former Presidents and the leaders of our country for allowing this to go on ever since the World Trade Organization opened up. They allowed this to go on. They allowed hundreds of billions of dollars a year to be taken out of our country and to be used to rebuild China. So those days are over.</p><p>So, right now, they're paying 25 percent on $250 billion. A lot of money coming in. You know, we had a 3.2 GDP for the first quarter. Everyone said, \"I wonder how that happened.\" Because first quarter is the weakest quarter always -- almost -- almost always. And we had like this great quarter.</p><p>But I don't consider 3.2 great. I consider much higher. And, frankly, if we had lower interest rates -- you know, we're forced to pay more money than other countries because we have a rate that's high. We have somebody that likes raising rates. Now, I think he's maybe going to change, but we'll find out. But if we had lower, we'd have another 10,000 points. We're doing -- we just set a record. You know, I'm a very greedy person. We just set a record: 27,000. I said, \"We could be 10,000 points higher.\" We could be 10,000 because there's no inflation. A big thing is inflation. There's no inflation. But we're doing so well. We're going to keep it that way.</p><p>So, I just want to introduce -- because a person that I've admired for a long time who is a great lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, and she's one of the leading First Amendment lawyers in our country. And, Harmeet, could you come up -- just say a few words, please\" Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS. DHILLON: Thank you, Mr. President. (Applause.) Thank you, Mr. President. It's a tremendous honor to be here with a lot of people who I really respect and admire.</p><p>The corrupt establishment that you talked about and the mainstream media have told a lot of people in this room that the social media censorship and the banning that we're experiencing is all in our heads. They're gaslighting us with this lie.</p><p>Let me tell you about a couple of people I represent in my law practice and the civil rights work that we do. David Horowitz is a great American, who is a supporter of yours -- has been in the movement for many decades. Well, Twitter abruptly de-platformed him one day -- took him off, said he was banned. And then, he complained and then they let him back on. And then, the next day, they did the exact same thing to him. That's not an accident.</p><p>James Damore is another great American who I represent. Mr. Damore complained internally about Google's discriminatory practices against conservatives and pushed for more balance. Not only was he fired for daring to do that, but then these social media platforms used their platforms to humiliate him publicly, weaponize their platforms, and make sure that he could not get a job in Silicon Valley. That's a disgrace.</p><p>But it goes beyond that. These social media CEOs have come to Congress in front of the -- many of these members of Congress here, and they've lied about what they do. They've lied about the data theft. They've lied about the media manipulation. And they can't get away with that.</p><p>Now, Senator Blackburn knows, from what happened to her on Twitter, that these companies are trying to stop the ordinary men and women who you represent from hearing their voices. I'm very concerned that they affected the outcome of the 2018 election. And if we let them do what they're going to -- what they've been doing, it's going to affect the outcome of the 2020 election as well.</p><p>So, Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting everybody here to talk about these issues. And we're all behind you joining the fight to make sure that every American's voice is heard. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And what Harmeet said is so, so true. I mean it's -- it's really incredible. You know, I've watched and I've watched some of these scenes that have been taped and gotten through -- talented people, by the way -- but gotten through and gotten to the public where you see the hatred of -- of our party, of our people, of our voice. And you say, \"That's the collusion.\" It's a collusion between the Democrats and the media and -- and social media and these platforms. It's a disgraceful thing. (Applause.)</p><p>And another thing, I believe you're representing a young man who just got slugged, viciously slugged. I think it's a disgrace. Do you ever notice they pick on certain people\" I mean, he would tell you he's not the toughest person in the world physically, right\" They don't go after Bikers for Trump. (Laughter.)</p><p>Do you ever notice that\" They don't go after our construction workers, who love us. They don't go after the police. They don't go after -- we have incredible people. You know, we're the elite. They say they're elite. You know. Do you ever hear this\" Hey, I live better than all of them. (Laughter.) Great education. The greatest houses. The great- -- but I guess I'm not elite. They live like in the basement of their mom's home. (Laughter.) Their arms are this big. Look, like this.</p><p>But they have the black -- they have the black masks on, and they have sticks. And they hit people. They hit people in the face, in the head -- this Antifa.</p><p>But do you ever notice the Antifa is never there when we have a bikers rally\" (Laughter.) They're never there when the construction workers and the unions are honoring the President. They're never around. They're always there when you have a single guy protesting in front of a school.</p><p>And as you probably know -- I think all of you know -- we did something very serious. I signed an executive order recently. We're taking money away from those schools. (Applause.) We're going to -- you know, we give them billions and billions of dollars, and they don't allow free speech. (Applause.) And we don't want anything special, but we want free speech.</p><p>We're also joined by someone affected by this troubling bias very, very much -- and President of Live Action and somebody I've watched, really, with great admiration. Lila, please come up. Lila Rose. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS. ROSE: Thank you so much, Mr. President. It's really an honor to be here. Thank you for doing this important summit.</p><p>I represent Live Action. I'm the founder and president, and we are a pro-life organization which reaches millions of people every week with the truth about abortion and human dignity.</p><p>We have been, for four years, banned from doing any advertising on Twitter. And they told us that, in order to reinstate our accounts, we'd have to stop calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood and stop sharing our pro-life content. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other abortion groups continue to advertise.</p><p>Last month, we were permanently suspended from Pinterest, and they accused us of spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation with our pro-life content, with no evidence. And then, news media groups picked up the narrative and spread it around. Meanwhile, abortion groups, including abortion clinics, post freely on Pinterest.</p><p>And then, recently, our videos have been viewed more highly than almost any other abortion-related content on YouTube. But YouTube -- we made it to the first page of search results, but YouTube buried our pro-life videos and boosted pro-abortion videos. So this double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech, even though they say that they are politically neutral and they don't discriminate. They even testified before Congress and said that.</p><p>So thank you so much to the administration and to you, Mr. President, for holding this very important summit. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Thank you very much.</p><p>So, one of the advantages of being President is when you ask for a meeting, you get it, generally. I don't know -- I can't think of too many I haven't gotten. And you say, \"I'd like to see you in Oval Office.\" Or you have somebody call -- Oval Office.</p><p>I have been with all of these people at the highest level -- one-on-one, just recently, with Google. Just recently, with Twitter. The top. All right\" And you talk to them and you swear they're like your best friend. \"Oh, sir. No, we're -- we're -- we believe -- we -- freedom of speech. Oh, yes. Absol-...\"</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And we go out --</p><p>He says, \"Liar.\" Who said that\" (Laughter.) Must come from Queens. (Laughter.)</p><p>So -- so it's very interesting to see that. And -- and the level of -- you know, you look at them -- the sincerity. And I say, \"That's fantastic.\" And they'll leave. And then, I'll realize, three or four weeks later, it's worse. It actually got worse.</p><p>Because I say -- look, I believe in technology. I believe in free markets. I believe in freedom of speech. I believe in all of the things, and they are super genius.</p><p>I'll tell you, I'm dealing with China. And they admitted there's nobody like Silicon Valley. There's nobody smart, in that sense -- maybe not smart in other senses. I've watched some of them speak before Congress; it's not pretty. (Laughter.) I say, \"I could do much better than that.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But I tell you what: Technologically, it's unbelievable what they think of. Even Dan and I, when we sat with you-know-who at Twitter -- number one. We talked about certain things. He says, \"You know, we could do this, this, this.\" I said, \"That's really great.\" You know, this is incredible stuff.</p><p>China will admit there's nobody like these brains. But they're not using that brilliance and they're not using what we gave them fairly. And they have to do that.</p><p>And we don't want to stifle anything. We certainly don't want to stifle free speech, but that's no longer free speech. See, I don't think that the mainstream media is free speech either because it's so crooked. It's so dishonest.</p><p>So, to me, free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write bad. To me, that's very dangerous speech and you become angry at it. But that's not free speech. Somebody came to my office -- and I won't say who, but a very big person. And I said, \"Okay, you don't like the term 'fake news'\" -- which I think I get credit for, but I'm sure that, if I said I get credit, they'll say, \"Thirteen years ago, somebody came up with the terms 'fake.'\" (Laughter.) I think I'd get credit. I'd be very proud to take it. But I think I'd get credit.</p><p>Now, by the way, the worst fakers of all are using \"fake news.\" I saw the other day on CNN -- total fakes -- I see on CNN -- they go, \"Fake-news media has reported...\" No, no -- they're fake-news media. (Laughter.) They've turned it around. (Applause.) They've turned it around.</p><p>So I'm not going to allow -- and Josh and all of us, we're not just going to allow it to happen like this. We're not going to be silenced.</p><p>Two months ago, we created a new White House tool to report social media bias, censorship, and discrimination. We saw you folks being taken off, and we fought on all of you. And many of you are back now. But many of the names -- I won't mention your names -- but some of you were taken off for absolutely no reason.</p><p>I mean, in all fairness, some of you I could almost understand. (Laughter.) I mean, some of you guys are out there. (Laughter.) But even you should have a voice. (Laughter.) But some of you -- no, some of you deserve -- (applause) -- some of you. I mean, it's genius, but it's bad. (Laughter.)</p><p>But they take off people that are -- you know, that you wouldn't believe. And we received over 16,000 responses just in a tiny little period of time talking about this subject.</p><p>Based on the feedback that we're hearing from you, I'm announcing that we will ask representatives of the major social media platforms to join me at the White House over the next month, have a big meeting and a real conversation. We want -- might want to invite some of you. I know, Josh, we're going to have you and some of the senators.</p><p>And it's amazing how the senators -- including Democrats, in all fairness -- which is probably because they know it can turn on them also. It can turn very quickly. But they want to come. So we'll let you know the date, okay?</p><p>And today, I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans. That's you people in this room and a lot of people out there. There are a lot of people.</p><p>We hope to see transparency, more accountability, and more freedom. That's on both sides. This is not -- I am not speaking for our side, assuming we're all -- I don't even know if you're on our side. You could be some of the most liberal people in the world in this audience, and that's okay. I don't care. But we're talking about for everybody. Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people.</p><p>To all of the social media influencers here today -- a lot of -- you have a lot of power and you have a lot of strength. And, you know, you have to use it wisely. Many of you do, but you have to.</p><p>I want to thank you once again for being here. You're very special people. You're very brilliant people, in so many cases. I look around the room -- I mean, I see people that really have almost found a new life over the last short period of time with this new technology. But this new technology is so powerful and so important, and it has to be used fairly. It has to be used fairly.</p><p>So thank you all for being here. It's a great honor. Tremendous honor.</p><p>We're going to take a few questions, I think. And then I'll head out. And you're going to actually come -- if you want, you can come to the great Rose Garden. You can stand in the rain with me. We're going to talk a little bit about the fact that we're not allowed to ask for whether or not somebody is a citizen on the census form. And I think we have a solution that will be very good for a lot of people -- really good.</p><p>END 4:42 P.M.

EDT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please sit down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to thank you all for being here - a very special day, a very important day. Many of you are friends, and many of you are friends that I don't know what you look like, but I know what you sound like - (laughter) - which, I guess, is probably more important. Right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I want to thank you. And it's a terrific - it's a terrific day to be together. And, if you look, you're in a very famous place. We all work very hard. And I don't know if you call it \"influence,\" I don't know if you call it \"power,\" but whatever it is, we're in the White House. And we're going to stay in the White, and we're going to get our agenda done and completed beautifully. (Applause.)</p><p>So I'm thrilled to welcome you here. And we're all working very hard. And I don't know if you know, but we just did 27,000 on the Dow. That's the highest in history. We're up a couple of hundred points today. (Applause.) The highest in history - for those of you that like the stock market.</p><p>But the stock market means jobs. I view it as jobs, and I view it as 401(k)s. A lot of people say, \"Oh, the rich people are getting rich.\" But if you look at the numbers, the greatest impact, proportionately, is blue-collar workers in what's happened, in this miracle that's happening. (Applause.)</p><p>And people with 401(k)s, they're up 72 percent and 67 percent. And the wife or the husband - whoever is responsible - the other one says, \"You're a genius. You're a great financial investor.\" (Laughter.) \"Darling, you're up 77 percent this year.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>So a lot of good things happened. A lot of people are happy. And I think, really, everybody is happy; some people just aren't willing to admit it. Does that make sense? (Laughter.)</p><p>So this is a historic day. Never before have so many online journalists and influencers - and that's exactly what you are; you're journalists and you're influencers - come together in this building to discuss the future of social media.</p><p>Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation. You're challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the American people. And that's what you're doing - you're going right to the people.</p><p>Possibly, we wouldn't be here right now. I asked somebody, \"What do you think I'd do without social media? Would I be here?\" Because I said, \"I think so.\" (Laughter.) But they weren't so sure. (Laughter.) I have to say that; you know that. I'm not sure I believe that, but I have to say it.</p><p>But you communicate directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake-news filter. It's very simple. Together, you reach more people than any television broadcast network by far - not even close.</p><p>We're delighted to be joined at this summit by someone you know very well: our Senior Advisor for Digital Strategy and somebody that's been working for me for a long time, for many years, Dan Scavino. Where is Dan? (Applause.) Stand up. Come here. Great job.</p><p>So, long before we were even doing this, he was at a club - running a club and other businesses. And he was okay at doing it. (Laughter.) Not the greatest. I wouldn't say the greatest. (Laughter.) But you know what he was great at? He was always looking at his computer screen. I said, \"That guy is incredible.\"</p><p>So, right at the beginning, I said, \"That's the man.\" And there was nobody better at that. And I think Hillary had 28 people and I had Dan. (Laughter.) Right? (Applause.) I had my Dan. And he works about 28 hours a day, and he works very hard. But he doesn't work - I mean, he loves it. He loves it.</p><p>And his imagination and, really, working with all of you and many of you - he'll come up with ideas and you'll come up with ideas. And he'll run into my office. He said, \"You got to see this.\"</p><p>And a lot of times, I'll go out and I'll spend a lot of money on a concept. I'll say, \"Here's a concept. Come up with this.\" And we'll hire these companies, and they want a lot of money. And they come back - it just happened the other day, right? I said, \"That's terrible. These guys have no talent.\" (Laughter.) The people that have the talent are the people that we deal with. And it's true.</p><p>And some of you are extraordinary. I can't say everybody, but - (laughter). No, but some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable. (Laughter and applause.) True. Unbelievable.</p><p>So I'm going to go back to the basics of Washington. I'm going to introduce some of my Secretaries. Steve Mnuchin. Steve? Where's Steve? Steve has done a fantastic job. (Applause.)</p><p>Wilbur Ross. Wilbur? We have a meeting - (applause) - in a little while, on the census and citizenship. Can you believe: \"Are you a citizen of the United States of America?\" \"Sir, you can't ask that question.\" (Laughter.) \"Why?\" \"Because the court said you can't.\"</p><p>We have three very unfriendly courts. They fight us all the way. The judges don't like us too much, I guess. But think of that, Herman. Think of that question: \"Are you a citizen?\"</p><p>We spend - this is another thing that's so crazy: $20 billion on a census - $20 billion. They spend $20 billion. I said, \"20 billion what?\" (Laughter.) Twenty billion dollars on a census.</p><p>They go through houses - they go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. \"How many toilets do they have?\" \"How many desks do they have?\" \"How many beds?\" \"What's their roof made of?\" (Laughter.) The only thing we can't ask is, \"Are you a citizen of the United States?\" (Laughter and applause.) No, isn't it the craziest thing? Twenty billion. (Applause.) Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing, Charlie.</p><p>Also, David Bernhardt, great job you're doing - Interiors. (Applause.) He's the largest landlord in the United States. When my friends tell me how big they are, they - \"I just bought another building.\" Big deal, Kevin, right? They bought another building. Then I look at David Bernhardt; he controls half of the United States. (Laughter.) Department of Interior. There's a lot of land - a lot of beautiful land - that we're taking good care of, David. Right?</p><p>Acting Director Russ Vought. Russ, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) We're working on our budget. (Applause.)</p><p>Along with some of the great members of Congress and a wonderful friend of mine who's my Leader, right? He's my Leader. I tell him that to his face because it makes him feel good. I don't know if I believe that, Marsha. (Laughter.) But, Kevin - stand up, Kevin. Kevin McCarthy, everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>Senator Marsha Blackburn of the great state of Tennessee. We campaigned together. (Applause.) And she did - we can say it now: She ran against the most popular Democrat in the last 50 years. He really was great. A good man, right? THE PRESIDENT: And governor for quite a long time - eight years. And she just didn't stop.</p><p>SENATOR BLACKBURN: I beat him by 12 points.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Twelve points. (Applause.) She was down by 10, and she won by 12. That's right. She was down by 10, and she won by 12. And she wouldn't stop. They just - every day, \"Where is she?\" \"She's here. She's there.\" Fantastic job you did. We're proud of you.</p><p>SENATOR BLACKBURN: Thank you (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, honey. That's great. It was just - honestly, working with people that know what they're doing, it's fun. That was fun. And you know what you're doing.</p><p>Representative Dan Crenshaw, who is very good at this, by the way, Dan. (Applause.) Very good at this. Really good. Thank you. It's great to have you in the party. And you have more courage than I do, Dan. Okay? That courage of yours is incredible. Thank you very much. Great job.</p><p>A friend of mine, and a wonderful person, and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future, I'd say - I hear a lot of very positive things - Liz Cheney. Liz, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.</p><p>And, you know, I pardoned somebody named Scooter Libby. A lot of you don't know who Scooter Libby is. Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly. And Liz was right on the forefront of that one. And I said, \"What do you think, Liz?\" And you said, \"Absolutely. He deserves it.\" And it's been a very popular pardon. He was treated very, very brutally and unfairly. So, thank you for that - for that help.</p><p>Matt Gaetz. Where's Matt? Where's Matt? Stand up, Matt. (Applause.) Boy, a great defender. He gets on television, and he's like - it doesn't stop. And he's smart, and he's good, and he loves Florida, and he loves his people, and he's a hard worker. And, Matt, thank you very much. I really appreciate it very much.</p><p>And Mike Johnson. Mike, thank you. (Applause.) Great job, Mike.</p><p>And I want to thank a man who I said, a long time ago, when we said, \"Let's do it\" - because Josh Hawley is special. He is somebody that - I said, \"Josh, you got to run.\" \"Well, I don't know.\" You know, he had a good set-up - pretty well, right? You weren't going anywhere. He could do whatever he wanted in his great state.</p><p>And I said, \"I'm telling you, you can do it.\" And she turned out - she's a tough candidate. Whether you like her or you don't like her, she's tough. Right? And by the end of that, that was incredible. That was a hell of a race and he won. And he's young and he's brilliant. And I'm going to ask him to come up and say a few words, if you don't mind, about what we're doing. And come on up right now. I think it would be a good time, right? (Applause.)</p><p>SENATOR HAWLEY: Thank you. Well, first of all, can we just give another round of applause to the President of the United States for his leadership on this issue? (Applause.)</p><p>You know, the media - the media says - the establishment media, the fake media - they say, \"Oh, there's no censorship in social media. That's all made up. That's all fake.\" You and I know that that's not true. You and I know the truth is that the social media giants would love to shut us down. They would love to shut us up. They would love to shut him up more than anything else. And we can't let them. And that's why we need to step up now.</p><p>And I think we need to say to them, \"Here's the deal.\" Google, Facebook, Twitter - they've gotten these special deals from government. They've gotten a special giveaway from government. They're treated unlike anybody else. If they want to keep their special deal, here's the bargain: They have to quit discriminating against conservatives. Do you agree with that? No more! (Applause.) No more discrimination. It's that simple. (Applause.) That's all we're asking for.</p><p>They ought to abide by the same principles of free speech and the First Amendment that this country embraces, that we love and call our own. And I don't think it's too much to ask for these huge tech platforms - who've gotten rich off our information, right? Off of our data, off of everything we've given them - they've gotten rich off of it. They've gotten rich off their special privileges from government. If they want to keep those, they shouldn't discriminate. They shouldn't censor. They shouldn't shut us down.</p><p>I want to thank the President again for his incredible leadership. Thank you for allowing me to be here. Thank you, Mr. President, for all that you do. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, you know, Josh is doing - right now, he's doing some very important legislation because we have to do something about what's happening. I never hear about the other side. I can tell you - I think I'm pretty good at getting out a message, but, technologically, I would think I'm okay. Just okay. But I'll tell you, a lot of bad things are happening.</p><p>I have people come up to me, \"Sir, we want to follow you. They don't let us on.\" And it was so different than it was even six, seven months ago. I was picking up unbelievable amounts of people. And I'm hotter now than I was then, okay? Because, you know, you also cool off, right? But much hotter. (Laughter.) Especially with a nice, new stock market like it is, right?</p><p>But, no, I'm hotter now. And I go to Dan, and I say, \"Hey, what's going on here? It used to take me a short number of days to pick up 100,000 people.\" I'm not complaining; we're like 60-some-odd million. But then we have five different sites. We have another site with 25 million. We have another site with 10 or 12. Then we have Facebook. Then we have Instagram. We have a lot - you know, a lot of people - way, way over 100 million.</p><p>But I used to pick them up, and I - when I say \"used to,\" I'm talking about a few months ago. I was picking them up 100,000 people every - very short period of time. Now it's, I would say, 10 times as long.</p><p>And I noticed things happening when I put out something - a good one - that people like. (Laughter.) Right? A good tweet. It goes up. It used to go up - it would say \"7,000, 7,008, 7,017, 7,024, 7,032, 7,044.\" (Laughter.) Right? Now it goes \"7,000, 7,008, 6,998.\"</p><p>Then they go, \"7,009, 6,074.\" I say, \"What's going on?\" It never did that before. It goes up, and then they take it down, and then it goes up. I never had that. Does anyone know what I'm talking about with this?</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I never had that before. I used to watch it. It would be like a rocket ship when I put out a beauty. (Laughter and applause.) Like when I said - remember I said somebody was \"spying on me\"? That thing was like a rocket. I got a call two minutes later. \"Did you say that?\" I said, \"Yeah, I said that.\" \"Well, it's exploding.\" (Laughter.) \"It's exploding.\" I turned out to be right. I turned out to be right. And we turn out to be right about lot of things. (Applause.)</p><p>But I never had it. I'm just saying from - you know, from the standpoint of a - of somebody that maybe has used social media better than anybody, Josh, because I became President. I'm sure I could have done it, as we said, much - I would have - there's no question I would have done it either way.</p><p>I said to Mark Burnett the other day - I said, \"So, The Apprentice...\" Had I never done \"The Apprentice\" - because it was a tremendous hit for 12 seasons. I said, \"Had I never done The Apprentice, would I be President?\" He said, \"Maybe not.\" And I said, \"I think I would have.\" But I'm always going to say that. (Laughter.) I'm always going to say it. But it was a great show.</p><p>But with social media - so I've never seen it before where I go up and then come down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Now, ultimately, you get - but it goes very slowly. But I've never seen where it's subtracted. And I really believe people are - they're taking it up as it goes up. And it - sometimes it comes down substantially.</p><p>A number of months ago, I was at a certain number - you know, many millions - and then all of a sudden, I was down over a million. And then I came down - I said, \"What's going on?\" And you checked, Dan, and you said, \"They say they're doing adjustments. They say they don't like some of the people.\"</p><p>And I don't have the fake people. You know, a lot of people buy people. I don't want to do that because, first of all, if I did it, it's a front page story all over the place. (Laughter.) but I know a lot of people - there's no question about it, because I see some numbers that are phony numbers where they have these, you know, many, many millions of followers. And I say, \"There's no way because nobody has any interest in these people.\" (Laughter.) There's - they have no -</p><p>Now, Herman Cain, they have interest in, okay? (Applause.) But they have no interest in these people. They're playing games. They're playing games.</p><p>James Woods. I don't know James, but he's an interesting guy and he's a conservative guy. And he is a straight shooter. He's tough. But when they want to take him off - and other people like him; many in this room, some in this room - it's a very, very bad - it's a very bad thing.</p><p>So I have many millions of followers across various accounts. And together, everyone in this room, we reach over a half a billion followers. And I think that's probably a low number. Because one of the things I get that's a little benefit - I'll go, \"Watch.\" Like, I did Golan Heights. I gave Israel the - the real credit over - and, you know, Golan Heights in Israel. Very important.</p><p>But I gave representation, in the strongest form, of the Golan Heights - Israel. And I talked about it in a little quick tweet. They've been looking at it - for 52 years, they've been trying to get it. They couldn't get it. They'd have many summits where people would fly in, talk about the Golan Heights, and then fly out. This went on many, many summits. It's about a 52-year period. I said, \"What happened?\" They said, \"Nothing.\" They'd fly in. They'd fly out. Some had beautiful planes. Some didn't. Some probably didn't get there by plane. But they'd have many summits.</p><p>said, \"Watch, I'm going to do this.\" And I said, \"We recognize the Golan Heights as being part of Israel.\" It was a big thing. I go, \"Watch this.\" Boom. I press it and, within two seconds, \"We have breaking news.\" John Roberts of Fox was over, and he said, \"We have breaking news. Please, break it up.\" Doesn't matter what they're talking about, John, does it? He breaks it up.</p><p>Now, that's Twitter. That's social media. I call Twitter a \"typewriter.\" That's what I really call Twitter, because it goes onto Facebook automatically and it goes onto Instagram. And it goes onto television - more so Fox than it does CNN. If it's something bad, they'll put it on. (Laughter.)</p><p>If I have a spelling deal, they will put it on. (Laughter.) It's - \"Donald Trump spelled the word 'the' wrong.\" You know? (Laughter.) \"He doesn't know how to spell, 'the.' He spelled it 'T-H-I.'\" (Laughter.) You know, I couldn't care - any kind of a punctuation mistake, they put it on. So I'm very, very careful. I really - I'm actually a good speller. But everyone said, \"The fingers aren't as good as the brain.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But - but it is true. And it's - it's incredible what it does. I put out a social media statement. And I was telling Kellyanne the other day, I said, you know, I used to put out like a press release, right? And people would pick it up, sort of, you know, in the next day, two days. They'd find it sitting on a desk. If I put out - we hardly do press releases anymore because if I put out, on social media, a statement - like I'm going to in a little while on something totally unrelated, but a very important statement. Now they're going crazy. \"What it is? Tell me what it is.\" Watch. (Laughter.) But it's very important.</p><p>But if I put that out in a press release, I'm telling you, Kevin, people don't pick it up. It's me - same. If I put it out on social media, it's like an explosion. Fox, CNN, crazy MSNBC - they're stone-cold crazy. (Laughter.) I made them a lot of money with \"The Apprentice.\" And I gave them a top show when they were dying on NBC. But they don't like me too much. They wanted a big extension. They used Arnold Schwarzenegger instead - a big movie star. You know what? He died. He died. (Laughter.) I was there 12 - 12 years, 14 seasons. And then they pick a movie actor and he dies on us. (Laughter.)</p><p>You know, I own that with Mark Burnett and some people. And I said - they said, \"Would you rather have him had been like this tremendous massive success?\" You own it, so you benefit, financially. \"Or would you rather have him die?\" So they just say, \"You did it for 14 seasons, 12 years.\" I said, \"I think I'd rather him die at it.\" (Laughter.) That means you don't need the money. I'd rather have him die at it. Anyway.</p><p>But with amazing creativity and determination, you're bypassing the corrupt establishment - and it is corrupt - and you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media - which not all of it, but much of it is far greater percentages than anyone would understand. As the cameras start to go off. There go the red lights. Look, boom. I can always tell. (Laughter.)</p><p>I can always tell. Like, when I talk about - and I'll be in the stadium. The red lights are all on. Everyone has got - and then we start talking about, like, the media - how dishonest it is, how corrupt it is, how fake it is. And you see lights going off. (Laughter.) Lights immediately go off. And, usually, they don't come back. They say, \"This guy is impossible.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But I want to just say it because you people have a lot of courage. To each and every one of you, I say: Thank you very much, on behalf of a nation. Thank you very much. It's very important what you're doing. You're getting the - you're getting, in many cases, the honest word out - not in all cases, but in many cases.</p><p>When historians look back at this time, they will see that many of the biggest news stories of our era were totally ignored. I - I can tell you that I deal with the media, and the spin they put on it - or sometimes they'll leave it out, and then if there's something slightly negative, they'll make it, you know, headline news. They'll put it down as headline news. Or even covered up by the media - they were broken up by citizens.</p><p>And you'll take a look at what's happening, and you see stories that should be phenomenal, big, beautiful stories and it turns out that they don't get covered. We did something yesterday on kidney and kidney dialysis, and there's a tremendous number of people with problems with kidneys. And it was Secretary Azar - it was a big, big important thing. It got very little coverage. You know, very positive - what we did is such - such a great thing.</p><p>I don't care. We don't have to get the - hey, it's good for our nation. It's good for people to read about it and see the strides that we've made and what we're doing. But that doesn't get covered and it should get covered. And it doesn't get covered for a reason because they don't want to give that to a conservative. They don't want to let that happen.</p><p>Now, if somebody else were in this position - such as the previous administration - they'd make that headline news all over the place, what we did yesterday. But when we're doing it, they give very little credit to that.</p><p>But anything bad that happens - I always say, \"They can take bad and make it horrible. They can take a good story and make it sort of bad. And they can take a great, great story and make it anywhere from good to slightly bad.\" (Laughter.) It's incredible what they can do.</p><p>I say I haven't had a good story in two and a half years. I used to get great press. Steve Mnuchin knows. He said, \"Man, you get the greatest press.\" Until I got elected. (Laughter.) Then it stopped. But I used to get the greatest press - possibly one of the reasons I'm here.</p><p>But we're getting the word out, and we get it out in a different way. I didn't think we'd have to - Charlie, I didn't think it would be this tough and -</p><p>By the way, two very special people - I have to say hello to them. Because my wife said, \"I see these two beautiful women - African American, incredible women - that are on television. They are unbelievable.\" This is two years ago. She was before her time. They have no idea who I'm talking about. (Laughter.) She was - our First Lady said, \"You have to see these women. They're incredible. They're genius. And they like you.\" I said, \"I want to see them.\" (Laughter.) And I liked them. I loved them, actually. I loved them. Come. Come. (Applause.)</p><p>I don't want them to fall, because it'll be a major story. (Laughter.)</p><p>So, when the historians look back, they're going to see something very important took place right here. Before today, it took place. It started taking place a number of years ago, and it's something that nobody ever thought would happen.</p><p>Free speech is a bedrock of American life. Our constitutional rights must be fiercely protected. And I want you to know that we will always have your back. We're fighting for you very hard. We're going to be calling a big meeting of the companies for - in a week or two. They have to be here.</p><p>And Josh is really leading a very strong group of people. This isn't just Josh. This is you leading a tremendous group, and they feel equally as strongly as you because they see the unfairness of what's happening.</p><p>And remember: We won. We have a bigger voice than anybody. But we don't get covered fairly. Can you imagine if we were covered fairly? We had our best polls, like, yesterday, they were telling me. I said, \"Could you imagine if I actually got good press instead of - even fair press. I don't want good; I want fair.\" Can you imagine what those numbers would be? They make up stories - you know, the Russian hoax. I call it the \"Russian hoax\" - the witch hunt. All bad publicity, and yet we're doing great in the polls.</p><p>So people understand it. The public is very smart. But we're getting the word out about so many things - not just that - about so many things.</p><p>And maybe the most important thing about how great our country is doing. Jobs - now more people working today than ever in the history of our country. Ever in the history of our country - think of that. Unemployment are the best numbers in 51 years. For African American, the best numbers in our history - in our history, Herman, right? (Applause.) Including you. And you're making a lot, I hope.</p><p>But Hispanic American - best numbers in history. (Applause.) Right? Stand up. And I like your dresses, by the way, very much. No, not you, sir. You. (Laughter.) Thank you. I saw you the other day. Fantastic job.</p><p>But Hispanic American - the best in history. Asian American - the best in history. Women - I think, Kellyanne - the best in 75 years. The best in - best unemployment numbers in 75 years. What we're doing - it's nothing like this has been done.</p><p>Our military is now strong. When I took it over, it was depleted. We had planes that were so old they didn't fly. They'd have to go to the desert to get parts. When we took it over, it was not a good situation. We got $700 billion, and then $716 billion. And we're going to be asking for another one this year. And it's all manufactured in the United States. We make it ourselves. And that's always good, because that's jobs. Now, in this case, jobs aren't important compared military defense, but we make the best planes and rockets and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nothing like it. And we're doing something that's incredible.</p><p>So, our military is strong. Our - our country is really powerful and really strong. Never been like this.</p><p>Whoops. How did a fly get into the White House? (Laughter.) I don't like that. I don't like flies. I don't like flies. (Laughter.)</p><p>So I just want to tell you, just in finishing up, we had a terrible bias. We have censorship like nobody has any understanding or nobody can believe. When you see the Google executives together, and one of their executives decides to put it on the phone - right? That's right. Thank you. Oh, there he is. Stand up, please. Stand up. (Applause.) How good - what a great job. Somebody said he's controversial. I said, \"He's not controversial. He's truthful.\" He's truthful. (Applause.) That was a great job. That was one of many. Thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic.</p><p>So, you know, they're playing with - with a lot of minds and they're playing unfairly. And the funny thing is that, in theory, they shouldn't be liking the other side. They shouldn't be liking the other side. They should be, really, liking our side, because we're the ones that want freedom far more.</p><p>You see what's happening up in the debate stand. You see what they're doing to each other. You're seeing the hatred that they have up there. And it's a very different philosophy. It's a very different thought.</p><p>And I'll say this: The election that's coming up is, I think - and, you know, we talk 2016, and I would say maybe that's the most important, and certainly I said it. But what we're really fighting for - there has never been a difference of this candidate, our candidate, your candidate against whoever it may be. There will never be anything like that hopefully again, because what they're looking at is pure socialism or worse than socialism. You know, there's a word called \"communism,\" too. There's a word called - they don't like to use it. Very rarely do you hear that. But there's a word called \"communism,\" and they're trying to get socialism over the line.</p><p>But these people are - this is beyond socialism, to a large extent. And I think that we're going to have a tremendous success. We had a - sort of, an opening rally in Orlando, Florida. We had 109,000 - maybe more; I think it was nine - wanting to come. We were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming. We have a 21,000-seat stadium, and then, with the basketball court, it held many more than that. It was packed. And we had a similar number outside, and we had thousands and thousands of people that wanted to be there. And this was an opening.</p><p>And you look at Biden; they say he had 600 people. That wasn't 600; that was 150 people. (Laughter and applause.) That was 150. That was a very small crowd. (Laughter.) And even their big crowds - I mean, if they have 1,000 people, it's like a big crowd. We have enthusiasm that's far greater than the left. It's not even a contest. They don't want to say that. They never will say that.</p><p>We had, on the Mall, just the other day - 4th of July - a tremendous success. It was pouring. The weather was just - it was beautiful, in one way. They learned it was my real hair that day - (laughter) - because I was drenched. Well, that is the one good thing. I ran, and they learned it's my hair, because I've been through every windstorm, sandstorm. Let's go over here. Let's go this one, that one - this desert. Let's go to this ocean and get out of the plane. \"Sir, the wind is blowing at about 70 miles an hour.\" I said, \"Boy, it's got to be - it's got to be mine.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But we've seen it all. We've seen it all. And I tell you what: More than anything else, I've met great people. I've met great people. Dedicated people. And I think that the election coming up, Kevin, this is the most important election of our times.</p><p>This is an election where our country is going to go one way or it's going to head in the direction of Venezuela. And that's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen.</p><p>This Green New Deal - and I - you know, I hate to speak badly of it right now because it's a little early. I spoke too early on Elizabeth \"Pocahontas\" Warren. (Laughter.) I spoke - I should've saved it.</p><p>But, you know - so I don't like to go too early because I don't want them to change. I like the Green New Deal. I want them to keep going. I don't want them to make - you know, the problem with this business: They can make a change, and immediately upon making the - it lasts for about a week. You look at, for instance, on the wall, Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall. Right, Liz? Totally in favor. Everybody. Hillary. Everybody. They were all in favor of a wall, just a few years ago.</p><p>Now a wall is a - well, that's okay. They want open borders. They want people to pour in, including criminals - the worst criminals. They want people to pour into our country. Nobody can tell me that's good, politically. Nobody can tell me.</p><p>So all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations, they've got a right to speak their mind. That includes them. That includes them. But they don't have the same difficulty. They don't get shut out. I wrote a few terms. I said to my son, Don, who's here some- - where are you, Don? Where are you, Don? (Applause.) He's very good. Kimberly. Don. People like Don, I tell you. (Applause.) Good. Thank you, Don.</p><p>But we wrote out a few - shadow ban, 100 percent. You look at what's going on. You know, I could go - the blocking - just the basic blocking of what we want to get out. The fact that they don't let them join. They don't. There was - there's no doubt in my mind that I should have millions and millions - I have millions of people - so many people, I wouldn't believe it. But I know that we've been blocked.</p><p>People come up to me and they say, \"Sir, I can't get you. I can't follow you. They make it impossible.\" These are people that are really good at what they do. They say, \"They make it absolutely impossible.\" And, you know, we can't have it. We're not going to let it happen. Josh, we're not going to let it happen.</p><p>And, you know, if they did it on both sides, if it were done to the other side, to the other group - and I'm representing everybody. I do. I represent everybody. I fully understand liberal. I fully understand Democrat. We want to get along. We want to make sure that everybody loves each other, if that's possible. And, maybe, I really believe it is. Someday it will be.</p><p>I, for a while, have said that the thing that's going to bring us together is great success. Now we have tremendous success - greater than we've ever had before. I mean, our country picked up trillions of dollars in value and worth. China has gone down trillions of dollars. The tariffs have hurt them. I don't want to hurt them, but I want to give us a fair playing field. But China has gone down trillions. We've gone up tril- - not billions, trillions. We've gone up in value and worth.</p><p>I want everybody to do well, but they've got to treat us fairly. They've got to treat - everybody has to be treated fairly. Their side, our side - we all have to be treated fairly.</p><p>And, you know, the farmers say, \"We just want a level playing field, sir.\" I love the farmers. They're patriots. And China, as you know, targeted the farmers because they think they could get to me by hurting the people that I love and that we take care of. And it had no impact.</p><p>I would watch, even on networks that don't exactly like me, and I'd watch as they interview farmers. And they'd have 10 or 12 people sitting around. They're saying, \"We don't care. The President is right. We've been ripped off for many years. Somebody has to do - somebody had to do this.\"</p><p>China made, over the last 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars. You could say four to five hundred billion dollars a year. That's not sustainable. That's not - we built China. And you know what? They've done a great job. I don't blame them; I blame our former Presidents and the leaders of our country for allowing this to go on ever since the World Trade Organization opened up. They allowed this to go on. They allowed hundreds of billions of dollars a year to be taken out of our country and to be used to rebuild China. So those days are over.</p><p>So, right now, they're paying 25 percent on $250 billion. A lot of money coming in. You know, we had a 3.2 GDP for the first quarter. Everyone said, \"I wonder how that happened.\" Because first quarter is the weakest quarter always - almost - almost always. And we had like this great quarter.</p><p>But I don't consider 3.2 great. I consider much higher. And, frankly, if we had lower interest rates - you know, we're forced to pay more money than other countries because we have a rate that's high. We have somebody that likes raising rates. Now, I think he's maybe going to change, but we'll find out. But if we had lower, we'd have another 10,000 points. We're doing - we just set a record. You know, I'm a very greedy person. We just set a record: 27,000. I said, \"We could be 10,000 points higher.\" We could be 10,000 because there's no inflation. A big thing is inflation. There's no inflation. But we're doing so well. We're going to keep it that way.</p><p>So, I just want to introduce - because a person that I've admired for a long time who is a great lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, and she's one of the leading First Amendment lawyers in our country. And, Harmeet, could you come up - just say a few words, please? Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS. DHILLON: Thank you, Mr. President. (Applause.) Thank you, Mr. President. It's a tremendous honor to be here with a lot of people who I really respect and admire.</p><p>The corrupt establishment that you talked about and the mainstream media have told a lot of people in this room that the social media censorship and the banning that we're experiencing is all in our heads. They're gaslighting us with this lie.</p><p>Let me tell you about a couple of people I represent in my law practice and the civil rights work that we do. David Horowitz is a great American, who is a supporter of yours - has been in the movement for many decades. Well, Twitter abruptly de-platformed him one day - took him off, said he was banned. And then, he complained and then they let him back on. And then, the next day, they did the exact same thing to him. That's not an accident.</p><p>James Damore is another great American who I represent. Mr. Damore complained internally about Google's discriminatory practices against conservatives and pushed for more balance. Not only was he fired for daring to do that, but then these social media platforms used their platforms to humiliate him publicly, weaponize their platforms, and make sure that he could not get a job in Silicon Valley. That's a disgrace.</p><p>But it goes beyond that. These social media CEOs have come to Congress in front of the - many of these members of Congress here, and they've lied about what they do. They've lied about the data theft. They've lied about the media manipulation. And they can't get away with that.</p><p>Now, Senator Blackburn knows, from what happened to her on Twitter, that these companies are trying to stop the ordinary men and women who you represent from hearing their voices. I'm very concerned that they affected the outcome of the 2018 election. And if we let them do what they're going to - what they've been doing, it's going to affect the outcome of the 2020 election as well.</p><p>So, Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting everybody here to talk about these issues. And we're all behind you joining the fight to make sure that every American's voice is heard. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And what Harmeet said is so, so true. I mean it's - it's really incredible. You know, I've watched and I've watched some of these scenes that have been taped and gotten through - talented people, by the way - but gotten through and gotten to the public where you see the hatred of - of our party, of our people, of our voice. And you say, \"That's the collusion.\" It's a collusion between the Democrats and the media and - and social media and these platforms. It's a disgraceful thing. (Applause.)</p><p>And another thing, I believe you're representing a young man who just got slugged, viciously slugged. I think it's a disgrace. Do you ever notice they pick on certain people? I mean, he would tell you he's not the toughest person in the world physically, right? They don't go after Bikers for Trump. (Laughter.)</p><p>Do you ever notice that? They don't go after our construction workers, who love us. They don't go after the police. They don't go after - we have incredible people. You know, we're the elite. They say they're elite. You know. Do you ever hear this? Hey, I live better than all of them. (Laughter.) Great education. The greatest houses. The great- - but I guess I'm not elite. They live like in the basement of their mom's home. (Laughter.) Their arms are this big. Look, like this.</p><p>But they have the black - they have the black masks on, and they have sticks. And they hit people. They hit people in the face, in the head - this Antifa.</p><p>But do you ever notice the Antifa is never there when we have a bikers rally? (Laughter.) They're never there when the construction workers and the unions are honoring the President. They're never around. They're always there when you have a single guy protesting in front of a school.</p><p>And as you probably know - I think all of you know - we did something very serious. I signed an executive order recently. We're taking money away from those schools. (Applause.) We're going to - you know, we give them billions and billions of dollars, and they don't allow free speech. (Applause.) And we don't want anything special, but we want free speech.</p><p>We're also joined by someone affected by this troubling bias very, very much - and President of Live Action and somebody I've watched, really, with great admiration. Lila, please come up. Lila Rose. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS. ROSE: Thank you so much, Mr. President. It's really an honor to be here. Thank you for doing this important summit.</p><p>I represent Live Action. I'm the founder and president, and we are a pro-life organization which reaches millions of people every week with the truth about abortion and human dignity.</p><p>We have been, for four years, banned from doing any advertising on Twitter. And they told us that, in order to reinstate our accounts, we'd have to stop calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood and stop sharing our pro-life content. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other abortion groups continue to advertise.</p><p>Last month, we were permanently suspended from Pinterest, and they accused us of spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation with our pro-life content, with no evidence. And then, news media groups picked up the narrative and spread it around. Meanwhile, abortion groups, including abortion clinics, post freely on Pinterest.</p><p>And then, recently, our videos have been viewed more highly than almost any other abortion-related content on YouTube. But YouTube - we made it to the first page of search results, but YouTube buried our pro-life videos and boosted pro-abortion videos. So this double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech, even though they say that they are politically neutral and they don't discriminate. They even testified before Congress and said that.</p><p>So thank you so much to the administration and to you, Mr. President, for holding this very important summit. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Thank you very much.</p><p>So, one of the advantages of being President is when you ask for a meeting, you get it, generally. I don't know - I can't think of too many I haven't gotten. And you say, \"I'd like to see you in Oval Office.\" Or you have somebody call - Oval Office.</p><p>I have been with all of these people at the highest level - one-on-one, just recently, with Google. Just recently, with Twitter. The top. All right? And you talk to them and you swear they're like your best friend. \"Oh, sir. No, we're - we're - we believe - we - freedom of speech. Oh, yes. Absol-...\"</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And we go out -</p><p>He says, \"Liar.\" Who said that? (Laughter.) Must come from Queens. (Laughter.)</p><p>So - so it's very interesting to see that. And - and the level of - you know, you look at them - the sincerity. And I say, \"That's fantastic.\" And they'll leave. And then, I'll realize, three or four weeks later, it's worse. It actually got worse.</p><p>Because I say - look, I believe in technology. I believe in free markets. I believe in freedom of speech. I believe in all of the things, and they are super genius.</p><p>I'll tell you, I'm dealing with China. And they admitted there's nobody like Silicon Valley. There's nobody smart, in that sense - maybe not smart in other senses. I've watched some of them speak before Congress; it's not pretty. (Laughter.) I say, \"I could do much better than that.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But I tell you what: Technologically, it's unbelievable what they think of. Even Dan and I, when we sat with you-know-who at Twitter - number one. We talked about certain things. He says, \"You know, we could do this, this, this.\" I said, \"That's really great.\" You know, this is incredible stuff.</p><p>China will admit there's nobody like these brains. But they're not using that brilliance and they're not using what we gave them fairly. And they have to do that.</p><p>And we don't want to stifle anything. We certainly don't want to stifle free speech, but that's no longer free speech. See, I don't think that the mainstream media is free speech either because it's so crooked. It's so dishonest.</p><p>So, to me, free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write bad. To me, that's very dangerous speech and you become angry at it. But that's not free speech. Somebody came to my office - and I won't say who, but a very big person. And I said, \"Okay, you don't like the term 'fake news'\" - which I think I get credit for, but I'm sure that, if I said I get credit, they'll say, \"Thirteen years ago, somebody came up with the terms 'fake.'\" (Laughter.) I think I'd get credit. I'd be very proud to take it. But I think I'd get credit.</p><p>Now, by the way, the worst fakers of all are using \"fake news.\" I saw the other day on CNN - total fakes - I see on CNN - they go, \"Fake-news media has reported...\" No, no - they're fake-news media. (Laughter.) They've turned it around. (Applause.) They've turned it around.</p><p>So I'm not going to allow - and Josh and all of us, we're not just going to allow it to happen like this. We're not going to be silenced.</p><p>Two months ago, we created a new White House tool to report social media bias, censorship, and discrimination. We saw you folks being taken off, and we fought on all of you. And many of you are back now. But many of the names - I won't mention your names - but some of you were taken off for absolutely no reason.</p><p>I mean, in all fairness, some of you I could almost understand. (Laughter.) I mean, some of you guys are out there. (Laughter.) But even you should have a voice. (Laughter.) But some of you - no, some of you deserve - (applause) - some of you. I mean, it's genius, but it's bad. (Laughter.)</p><p>But they take off people that are - you know, that you wouldn't believe. And we received over 16,000 responses just in a tiny little period of time talking about this subject.</p><p>Based on the feedback that we're hearing from you, I'm announcing that we will ask representatives of the major social media platforms to join me at the White House over the next month, have a big meeting and a real conversation. We want - might want to invite some of you. I know, Josh, we're going to have you and some of the senators.</p><p>And it's amazing how the senators - including Democrats, in all fairness - which is probably because they know it can turn on them also. It can turn very quickly. But they want to come. So we'll let you know the date, okay?</p><p>And today, I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans. That's you people in this room and a lot of people out there. There are a lot of people.</p><p>We hope to see transparency, more accountability, and more freedom. That's on both sides. This is not - I am not speaking for our side, assuming we're all - I don't even know if you're on our side. You could be some of the most liberal people in the world in this audience, and that's okay. I don't care. But we're talking about for everybody. Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people.</p><p>To all of the social media influencers here today - a lot of - you have a lot of power and you have a lot of strength. And, you know, you have to use it wisely. Many of you do, but you have to.</p><p>I want to thank you once again for being here. You're very special people. You're very brilliant people, in so many cases. I look around the room - I mean, I see people that really have almost found a new life over the last short period of time with this new technology. But this new technology is so powerful and so important, and it has to be used fairly. It has to be used fairly.</p><p>So thank you all for being here. It's a great honor. Tremendous honor.</p><p>We're going to take a few questions, I think. And then I'll head out. And you're going to actually come - if you want, you can come to the great Rose Garden. You can stand in the rain with me. We're going to talk a little bit about the fact that we're not allowed to ask for whether or not somebody is a citizen on the census form. And I think we have a solution that will be very good for a lot of people - really good.
