Big Tech has been fast-moving into the mobile video space for a few[1] years now[2], and recently a slew of mobile-specific content has arrived.  Instagram launched IGTV in 2018, and is pushing creators to explore what's possible[3] for mobile video. Netflix introduced vertical 30-second previews[4], and is now experimenting with mobile-first features like vibrating movies[5]. Spotify is releasing vertical music videos[6]. Snap is deliveringplenty of premium mobile video content with its Snap Originals,[7] and hasmoreon the way.[8] But compared to traditional videos which have been around since 1895[9], mobile video is still a newborn baby. And for new parents, a good way to learn parenting is to look at what others are doing. On that note, mobile video producers should direct their attention to a format Chinese media companies have been experimenting with: the vertical drama (\u7ad6\u5c4f\u5267; sh\u00f9pngj\u00f9).</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/world/2019/07/17/chinese-vertical-dramas-made-for-phone-viewing-show-the-future-of-mobile-video/#iQiyi's\">https://thenextweb.com/world/2019/07/17/chinese-vertical-dramas-made-for-phone-viewing-show-the-future-of-mobile-video/#iQiyi's</url> Arg DirectorVertical dramas are what Chinese producers call their scripted content made especially for vertical mobile play. Chinese internet giant Tencent first dipped its toes into the vertical drama category in 2018, releasing short romcom series like My Boyfriend-ish Sister[10] (\u6211\u7684\u7537\u53cb\u529b\u59d0\u59d0;W\u01d2 de nny\u01d2ul ji\u011bji\u011b) and My Idiot Boyfriend[11] (\u6211\u7684\u4e8c\u8d27\u7537\u53cb; W\u01d2 de r hu\u00f2 nny\u01d2u).  Soon after, iQiyi, a production company under the other Chinese giant Baidu, released the slice-of-life sitcom Ugh! Life[12]! (\u751f\u6d3b\u5bf9\u6211\u4e0b\u624b\u4e86; Sh\u0113nghu\u00f3 du w\u01d2 xish\u01d2ule) in the same year. Its sister series Arg Director[13] (\u5bfc\u6f14\u5bf9\u6211\u4e0b\u624b\u4e86; D\u01ceoy\u01cen du w\u01d2 xish\u01d2ule), a sketch comedy show exploring the genre tropes from Chinese TV, was released in 2019.  Smaller players have also entered the vertical playing field with more modestly-scaled productions. A notable example is Mr Yan Dong! Don't Come Over[14] (\u989c\u4e1c\u5148\u751f\u522b\u8fc7\u6765; Yn d\u014dng xi\u0101nsh\u0113ng bi gu\u00f2li), a gay romantic series produced by Manman, an app dedicated to digital comicstrips. Popular video apps like Douyin (TikTok's Chinese version) and Kuaishou have begun curating professionally produced, scripted narrative content too. What's remarkable about vertical drama is that it's not just any scripted content cropped for a vertical aspect ratio. These shows are specifically imagined for the mobile screen from the ground up. This is evident in three features they all share.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/world/2019/07/17/chinese-vertical-dramas-made-for-phone-viewing-show-the-future-of-mobile-video/#iQiyi's\">https://thenextweb.com/world/2019/07/17/chinese-vertical-dramas-made-for-phone-viewing-show-the-future-of-mobile-video/#iQiyi's</url> Arg Director 1. Super short episodesAn episode in a vertical drama is typically between two and five minutes. They're written to deliver each plot-point or punchline as quickly as possible. Before you know it, an episode of Arg Director delivers 10 jokes and then quickly ends, leaving you with an appetite for more. This way, not only is a viewer much more likely to finish an episode, they're more likely to finish a whole season. With the bitesize episodes being snackable AND bingeable, vertical dramas lock in the viewer's attention with the same intensity as a tub of popcorn.  In the battle formobile audience's fragmented attention, longform content can't compete: this is the Popcorn League (Note that as the vertical format requires you hold the phone with one hand, it's taking one hand away from the actual popcorn, thus even winning half of THAT fight).      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/world/2019/07/17/chinese-vertical-dramas-made-for-phone-viewing-show-the-future-of-mobile-video/#iQiyi's\">https://thenextweb.com/world/2019/07/17/chinese-vertical-dramas-made-for-phone-viewing-show-the-future-of-mobile-video/#iQiyi's</url> Ugh! Life! 2. Vertical is treated as a genreThe great majority of vertical dramas released so far have a comedic dimension. This is, of course, by design: comedy is a genre known for conveying gratification in short bursts, and comedies typically have an emphasis on actors' facial reactions. Both of these elements are a great fit for mobile. Just as television has properties that suit certain content better than feature films, so does vertical mobile video. Namely, the medium is good for a lot of intense, fast-paced, and personal moments. Specific narrative devices, such as characters' internal dialogues or a very abrupt turn of events, would be awkward and out of place when used excessively in longform storytelling. However, these devices are the typical narrative building blocks in iQiyi's sitcom Ugh Life!, where characters in everyday situations often find extraordinary things happening around them, such as time-traveling, mind-control, or extremely disappointing blind dates. This doesn't mean the vertical mobile format is only fit for comedies, but rather that when Chinese producers ideated their vertical dramas, the medium's innate rhythm was accounted for.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/world/2019/07/17/chinese-vertical-dramas-made-for-phone-viewing-show-the-future-of-mobile-video/#A\">https://thenextweb.com/world/2019/07/17/chinese-vertical-dramas-made-for-phone-viewing-show-the-future-of-mobile-video/#A</url> pilot episode for the show 'Cursed to be Single' (\u5355\u8eab\u72d7\u7684\u8bc5\u5492; D\u0101nsh\u0113n g\u01d2u de z\u01d4zh\u00f2u) 3. A fragmented visual languageA combination of split screens, swipes, and quick cuts dominate the visual language of the vertical drama. This is, of course, a style appropriate for the short episodes and fast comedic rhythm of these shows. But it also allows each moment on screen to contain more information. While the vertical mobile video has very limited visual space for spatial context and mise-en-scne, it compensates by literally pushing double or triple the amount of visual information into focus. This results in a visually fragmented viewing experience that is nonetheless fluid and dynamic. We can also consider the mobile screen's form factor. The large film screen, through its overwhelming size, attempts to immerse the cinema-goer in another world. The mobile screen, which in this sense is the opposite of film, doesn't concern itself with immersion, but rather provides a tiny surreal portal into the universe of its content. It is this surreal distinction of the small mobile display from its real world surroundings that allows viewers to accept its supernatural visual language: faster, denser, and more information-rich than the real world can offer. It's important to note these elements are not particular to a Chinese context, but rather they're particular to the vertical mobile format. If we look at the Snap Originals released recently, we can actually find traces of the same features too. Mobile video is a new medium, but video creatives on both sides of the planet are beginning to figure out the things that work.

The company says the new technology could help people with paralysis communicate, although it is unclear how the invention, described by founder Mark Zuckerberg as the \"ultimate communication technology\" will make it into Facebook's services.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesla founder and tech billionaire Elon Musk announced he had gone one step further. His side project Neuralink unveiled plans to implant computer chips in people's brains that could treat diseases and enable superhuman intelligence.</p><p>But both these developments are still years away, and the UK tech scene's approach is far less theoretical. One East London start-up, Myndplay, has developed brainwave-reading technology that aims to create a generation of \"Jedi mind warriors\", according to founder Tre Azam.</p><p>The company has already worked with advertising giant Ogilvy to find the algorithm to measure pleasure, and has run a project with G4S to help prisoners control their tempers.</p><p>The technology, used as a headband or paired with virtual reality headsets, allows people to peek inside their own mind and watch how it reacts to external stimulus. This, Azam says, will allow people to learn more about themselves and become capable of increased levels of concentration or calm at will. Myndplay says its technology could also be used to control devices, replacing touchscreens or voice control systems. In a prototype released last week, the company proved small objects such as a fan or a lightswitch can be controlled using the power of concentration.</p><p>Ni2o, a University of Oxford spin-off, is close to commercialising a chip that could provide a less invasive alternative to deep brain stimulation to treat Parkinson's and other diseases. It could lower the cost of treatment from $23,000 (\u00a319,000) to less than $2,000 (\u00a31,650). The chip, smaller than a grain of rice, would be implanted in areas of the brain where clinical treatment is needed, sending tiny jolts of electrical energy to stimulate parts of the brain in response to neural impulses, allowing people to control their movements with far more ease.</p><p>\"A lot of research communities want a machine to be better than a human or augmenting a human. I saw there was a gap, and a necessity, for restoring human dignity,\" says Dr Newton Howard, a professor in Oxford's computational neuroscience lab. \"Each person we are able to treat is a success. It breaks my heart that we don't have a solution today.\" He admits the same technique could be used to stimulate the brain and turbocharge our intelligence. \"You can become a genius depending on the areas you are targeting and frequencies you operate in.\"</p><p>However, just as one can turn on the genius tap, this technology could be exploited in the reverse, blocking people's thoughts and dumbing them down. We should be concerned about the ethics of this technology, he argues. Last year reports emerged of workers in China being hooked up to mind-reading technology in an effort to tell whether they were feeling rage.</p><p>Researchers have also expressed concern that Big Tech could not only rewrite the way this technology is used, but scare regulators into blocking developments that would make a positive difference.</p><p>\"What keeps me awake at night is the thought that this could be developed by Musk and Zuckerberg,\" one researcher from a top UK university says. \"Their motives are weird, they know little about the topics that they jump into.\"</p><p>Dr Howard says one of his fears is Big Tech will \"turn things sour for everyone. Regulators might say 'We haven't been able to regulate you on social media, how do we trust augmenting your reign and allowing you into the human brain?' The damage is for everyone else that is well intended.\"</p><p>\u00a31,650 Potential cost of a new brain chip treatment to let patients with Parkinson's disease control their movements better</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Headband-worn tech could let users 'see' inside their mind and increase concentration</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUTELE-151887040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUTELE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSS-35R1-DYTY-C2S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334988</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58170\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 11, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But readers keep asking for regular updates on the Chook super fund so here goes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 2019 calendar year was out of the ordinary for most super funds, according to analysis published on Friday by consulting firm Chant West. It said the median growth fund was up 14.7 per cent in 2019, the best calendar year return since 2013 and the seventh best in the entire 27&amp;#xBD;-year history of compulsory superannuation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Even the worst performer in our growth category returned a healthy 10.5 per cent, which was nearly 9 per cent above the rate of inflation,\" Chant West said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Growth funds are those that have a 61 to 80 per cent allocation to growth assets and are the ones in which the majority of Australians are invested.\"</p><p>The trustees established the Chook super fund in 2012 to take control of their retirement savings and have greater flexibility in the transition to retirement phase. Money was shifted out of other funds including Media Super.</p><p>The fund's net return after fees for the past six months was 7.56 per cent and 26.65 per cent for the 2019 calendar year. The fee of 1 per cent of assets covers advice and accounting.</p><p>The recent performance compares well with the growth funds in the Chant West database, which showed returns of 5.8 per cent for six months and 20.8 per cent for the year. Chant West said high growth funds had returns of 5.3 per cent for six months and 17.6 per cent for the full year.</p><p>The accompanying graphic breaks down the results by asset class. The asset mix has since changed with 7 per cent of assets now in alternatives.</p><p>The strong Australian equities result for 2019 was helped by the surge in value of CSL, ResMed and Genworth. The performance numbers include income and growth.</p><p>Genworth did extremely well because of the amount paid in dividends. In the six months to December it paid out 54.9\u00a2 a share in special and ordinary dividends. Chanticleer had written previously about Genworth's ability to generate excess capital and distribute it as dividends.</p><p>The fund's investments are made through a combination of decisions by the trustees and the fund's adviser, Charlie Viola from Pitcher Partners Sydney Wealth Management. All the poor performers and some of the best performers in the latest six months were chosen by the trustees including Class, Splunk, Toyota, Rhipe, Jupiter Mines and Goodman Group.</p><p>The fund's trustees and Viola agree that shares in quality companies that deliver profits through the business cycle regardless of market volatility will remain sound long-term investments.</p><p>Viola says the forces within super's legislative and regulatory system are increasingly pushing trustees and advisers to recommend lower exposure to shares through \"lifecycle\" super options that become more conservative as the beneficiaries get older.</p><p>The surge in share prices over the past few years has ensured most super fund members are overweight equities and will be cutting exposures if they adopt the lifecycle approach favoured by regulators and the trustees of public offer funds.</p><p>If markets tumble this pressure to slash equity weightings in super fund portfolios will increase. But Viola questions the wisdom of super fund members meeting an arbitrary risk benchmark that forces them to sell quality assets that generate reliable, fully franked income through the economic cycle. \"If I think CBA will keep generating profit, and earnings per share (EPS) of say $4.90 plus and dividends of $4.30, do I care if it's worth $84 or $74?\" Viola asks.</p><p>\"Remember, the single dollar I spent on CBA when it was $84, still generates a better return at $74 than cash ever will as long as I don't sell it.\"</p><p>Over the past five years, CBA shares have fluctuated between a high in March 2015 of $96.32 to a low in October 2018 of $65.27 to Friday's close of $84. Over the same period the bank has paid out $21.31 in dividends. Its yield is 5.1 per cent and 7.28 per cent when grossed up for tax paid.</p><p>CBA was once in the Chook super fund, as was Westpac Banking Corp, but both stocks were sold in November 2018 in favour of ANZ. The Westpac decision proved smart and the CBA and ANZ decisions less so.</p><p>The fund's exposure to international equities is a combination of directly held shares and managed funds. The best directly held stocks have been Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and CME Group.</p><p>Two lessons learned in 2019 were that actively managed international funds can complement each other and index funds are a good low-cost option.</p><p>Loftus Peak and Magellan have been outstanding active managers over the past five years with the Loftus Peak Global Change Portfolio (which has a longer tenure under the current manager than the Loftus Peak Global Disruption Fund) returning 16.98 per cent per annum over five years and Magellan Global Fund returning 12.9 per cent per annum. Over seven years Magellan's return has been 18.4 per cent per annum.</p><p>At this stage the Chook super fund has done well with a three-year return of 16.17 per cent per annum and 14.54 per cent over five years. But the fund is one market crash away from being a feather duster.</p><p>The asset allocation at year end was Australian equities 42.17 per cent, international equities 39.56 per cent, property 5.59 per cent, fixed interest 1.82 per cent, cash 2.5 per cent, hybrids 0.19 and alternatives 8.18 per cent. The alternatives were added at year end so there is no meaningful period for measuring performance.</p><p>Banks can't do tech transformations</p><p>Banks and insurance companies have a serious problem with institutional investors after failing to deliver financial benefits from much touted digital transformation programs.</p><p>Shareholders lack confidence in the management of financial services companies when it comes to tech, according to Oliver Wyman's State of the Financial Services Industry 2020. This is an annual publication timed to coincide with the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p><p>Damning fund manager comments about the failure of large-scale digital transformation projects in financial services were picked up by Oliver Wyman during an investor sentiment survey in November last year.</p><p>\"There is very little evidence of investments improving banks' operating profitability,\" one fund manager told Oliver Wyman and consulting firm Procensus.</p><p>The survey found that only 25 per cent of investors are confident digital transformation strategies will be effective.</p><p>There is no geographic sourcing for the comments but Chanticleer suspects Australian institutions would hold similar views after watching as banks promised benefits from digital transformations and then, in most cases, failed to deliver.</p><p>\"With no comparable data points, investors understandably struggle to make sense of digital transformation, technology, and investment,\" the Oliver Wyman report said.</p><p>\"As one fund manager put it to us, \"It is all jumbled up - IT replacement, automation, customer journeys ... There seem to be some wins but it's anecdotal.\"</p><p>\"Investors end up being outright sceptical, or discounting change programs and the long-term benefits of digital technology. In the first half of 2019, European banks mentioned \"digital\" in 98 per cent of their external communications, compared to only 27 per cent of analyst research reports.\"</p><p>While investors are unconvinced about investment plans put forward by banks and insurers, they do see upside from digital technology implementation in the form of cost cutting.</p><p>Oliver Wyman concludes that banks wishing to transform themselves need to communicate better with shareholders, provide clear and measurable metrics and face up directly to the threat from fintechs and big tech.</p><p>TONY BOYD</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.boyd@afr.com\">tony.boyd@afr.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78vt0dtzxyuygpancgz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1C-T241-F0J6-J0MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1286\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Howe Institute.</p><p>The Study In Brief</p><p>Cultural activities are central to Canadians'prosperity, identity and well-being, but the evolution and availability of digital technologies has changed the context in which Canadians access cultural content. The promotion of Canadian culture must adapt to this new setting in which content delivery bandwidth is practically unlimited, and viewers are no longer captive to legacy media.</p><p>Since access to digital cultural content uses the same broadband infrastructure as other commercial activities, policies must facilitate Canadians' access and discovery of content without inhibiting the growth of our digital economy and affordability of broadband services. In this context, this Commentary recommends that governments support the availability of diverse Canadian cultural and information offerings, promote engagement with these offerings by audiences in Canada and the world, and build a more sustainable economic framework for the cultural and information sectors by:</p><p>* Focusing more clearly the funding framework for public cultural agencies and for cultural subsidies more generally, including that for the CBC, on the production, dissemination, and exhibition of original artistic or literary works for which a commercial market is not yet established; or for which there is a clear public rationale. A clear public rationale may include educational, informational, or community engagement benefits, or the potential to seed long-term international demand for Canadian cultural offerings.</p><p>* Working with all Canadian broadcasters and distributors of Canadian content on strategies and development to facilitate the \"discoverability\" of Canadian content on digitally mediated platforms, considering methods such as search engine optimization, targeted online advertising, mobile applications, and the translation of Canadian works for both foreign and domestic audiences; and encourage collaborative initiatives between content producers, broadcasters and distributors to develop and market Canadian content.</p><p>* Setting up a new \"Canadian Connections Program\" to streamline existing subsidies and credits not effectively aligned with the above objectives. This fund will focus instead on initiatives specifically aimed at engaging non-commercially available Canadian content with Canadian audiences. This new program would be administered through an arms' length body that would evaluate proposals based on criteria including type and diversity of content, and likelihood of engaging Canadian audiences.</p><p>* In that context, eliminate mandated funding of Canadian content by cable and satellite providers and mandatory Canadian content quotas for broadcasters, and by reducing these costs, facilitate competitively priced communications services; while ensuring a level playing field with respect to the federal taxes applied to digital services purchased by Canadians and the deductibility of advertising expenses across media;</p><p>* Reducing foreign investment restrictions applying to cultural industries, with the aim of attracting investment in Canada while retaining the ability to require of foreign investors undertakings toward boosting the financing and visibility of Canadian content.</p><p>Canada's cultural policy is in a state of flux. This is far from simply a matter of government budgetary ups and downs, although federal spending on culture has trended down over the past decade as a share of GDP.</p><p>A key objective ot Canadian cultural policy has been to connect and engage Canadian households with Canadian cultural and information products. However, given the vast array of competing offerings available across borders through digital technologies, the ability of policy to achieve that goal reliably has been under threat for some time.</p><p>The emergence of \"non-traditional\" competitors for Canadians' attention, based on digital platforms that are less constrained by regulation than traditional TV or radio distributors in terms of what they can offer Canadians, has resulted in a slow but steady decline in viewership and in the number of listeners of licensed TV broadcasters and radio stations. Meanwhile, listenership and viewership of non-regulated digital offerings, many based outside Canada, such as Netflix, Spotify or YouTube, are rising sharply (see CRTC 2018, Market Insights section, figure 1).</p><p>These trends are negatively affecting the revenues of owners of traditional delivery platforms for culture and information products, as advertising revenues migrate to new forms of content delivery (CRTC 2018, Market Insights section, Part 3: The Financial Picture). To compound the problem, regulators still require providers of cable or satellite television services to offer a certain quota of Canadian content in prime time and to help fund Canadian TV and film production, whereas their emerging competitors on digital platforms are not subject to these rules. Furthermore, foreign online services such as Netflix are not required to charge their Canadian customers federal goods and services tax, unlike their Canadian competitors.</p><p>Yet, in dealing with these effects, governments should be careful not to take away some of the immense benefits Canadians can derive from digital communications technologies or the use of platforms enabled by these technologies, or more generally from access to the internet. Limiting or taxing the use of these tools, which have become critical to Canadians'well-being and to Canada's future economic performance, including that of its own creative and information economy, would risk turning the country into a backwater. (1) In any event, as the federal government itself has reminded us (Canada 2016, 7), \"Canadians ... do not want to be restricted in what they can access.\"</p><p>Amid these changes, many authors, filmmakers, musicians, or those who help produce and distribute the product of their work, have been able to count on quotas to boost their market and, for some, on government-mandated funding from private broadcasters. They might now wonder how to find both audiences and revenues in a much more crowded and less regulated market, in which these supportive measures are less effective or their sources dwindling. Similar questions apply to journalists who report news from a Canadian viewpoint.</p><p>The challenges facing stakeholders in the cultural sector and cultural policy itself are well known, and have been extensively analyzed, including by two recent public reviews initiated by the federal government (Canada 2018, 2019b), by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC 2018) and in multiple studies published by the C.D. Howe Institute (see, for example, Hunter, Iacobucci, and Trebilcock 2010; Hunter, Engelhart, and Miller 2017; Schwanen 1997) and other think tanks (for example, Globerman 2016). Yet policymaking around them remains unsettled.</p><p>In this Commentary, I build on these public reviews--one of which is still ongoing at the time of writing, but has produced an interim report --as well as on earlier research and recent policy pronouncements, to assess the effectiveness of current cultural policy. I base this assessment first on a description of Canada's key cultural policy objectives and the tools used to achieve them. This is followed by a discussion of rationales suggested by the literature for government support of cultural activities. I then discuss whether the various policy tools the federal government uses in the pursuit of key cultural policy objectives still make sense in light of the broader rationale for supporting Canadian culture and the evolving technological and economic context, or whether better tools are available to achieve these policy objectives.</p><p>I propose ditching or revamping tools that are ill-adapted for Canada's policy objectives in the digital age. These include Canadian-content quotas for television and radio and requirements (as opposed to inducements) for the private sector to fund Canadian cultural products, as well as certain rules restricting foreign investment in Canadian cultural industries. Instead of these measures affecting mainly the supply of Canadian cultural productions, I propose an approach more focused on linking this supply with the potential demand for it. This approach would:</p><p>* facilitate the \"discoverability\" of Canadian cultural and information content on various platforms; refocus certain tax credits and parts of public funding toward a new program that would reward engaging Canadians with noncommercially available Canadian content.</p><p>* remove barriers to entry and better capitalization of cultural industries, while ensuring a level fiscal playing field for all providers of Canadian content; and</p><p>* shy away from taxes or funding obligations that would limit Canadians' access to the internet or the competitiveness of Canada's broadcasting and telecommunications sectors.</p><p>WHAT LS CULTURAL POLICY, AND where is It Headed?</p><p>In Canada, \"cultural policy\" is best understood through its two consistent and overarching objectives over the decades: (2)</p><p>* boosting the production of Canadian content: supporting the creation of arts, letters and information such as news and documentaries (\"offerings\") by Canadians and/or in Canada (\"Canadian content\") beyond what the market would otherwise provide; and</p><p>* preferential placementfor this content: influencing and even directing the extent to which this Canadian content is exhibited and the access Canadians should have to it, in preference to non-Canadian offerings.</p><p>Policy Tools</p><p>The federal government uses a number of policy tools to achieve these cultural objectives. Policies regarding film and television provide a salient example, because it is in this area that competition from US production--popular in the Canadian market and benefiting from large economies of scale in the home market--is most prominent. Among the policy tools in this sector are the following:</p><p>* ownership and financial support of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Canada's national public broadcaster, whose programming must be \"predominantly and distinctively Canadian\"; direct financial support to cultural agencies such as the National Film Board (NFB), Canada's public film producer and distributor, Telefilm Canada, which works to develop the Canadian audiovisual industry and products especially for television, and the Canadian Media Fund (CMF), which supports productions made for television and, increasingly, for digital media;</p><p>* requirements for private Canadian cable or satellite providers (known as broadcast distribution undertakings, or BDUs) to contribute a share of their broadcasting revenues to Canadian programming, largely through contributions to the CMF;</p><p>* quotas for the amount of Canadian content that major Canadian broadcasters must offer, including quotas specifically for evening prime time hours and for space for Canadian channels in BDUs' offerings to consumers; these quotas and related rules about the quantity and placement of Canadian content are key conditions of licenses awarded by the CRTC under the Broadcasting Act,</p><p>* mandated 80 percent Canadian ownership of broadcasters except those that distribute their programming only over the internet or mobile devices;</p><p>* a ban on takeovers of Canadian-owned and -controlled film distributors, and limiting new foreign-owned film distribution businesses to the importation and distribution of films for which they own world rights or are a major investor; in general, the Department of Canadian Heritage applies Canada's foreign investment policy in cases of proposed foreign investment in a Canadian cultural business, (3) and may deny any such investment (except those below a very low value threshold) if it deems insufficient the investor's commitment to developing Canada's cultural sector (Joneja 2013,197,201-2);</p><p>* a refundable tax credit for Canadian-owned producers of films or television programs, based on eligible labour expenditures, in order to boost the number of competitive Canadian TV and film offerings by independent, Canadian-owned producers; and</p><p>* refundable film and video production services tax credits, based on eligible labour expenditures regardless of ownership of the producer, to support the capacity to make films and TV programs in Canada.</p><p>This list considers only federal policies and agencies, but provincial policies often play a key complementary role. Indeed, over the past ten years, spending on cultural activities by provincial governments has overtaken that of the federal government (Figure 1)--crucially, in the area of provincial broadcasting, which includes public agencies specializing in educational and current affairs programming such as TV Ontario, TFO and Tele-Quebec. Provinces also offer tax credits for audio-visual productions in their jurisdictions, complementing those offered by the federal government.</p><p>Recent Official Policy Reviews</p><p>The federal government formed after the October 2015 general election was seized with the future of cultural policy, especially as it intersects with digital technologies. It has responded with two public reviews. The first, launched in April 2016 under the aegis of Heritage Canada, focused on Canadian content in a digital world. It yielded the Creative Canada vision in September 2017 (Canada 2017). The second review, focusing on Canada's broadcasting and telecommunications legislation, was launched in June 2018 under the aegis of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), and its report is due by the end of January 2020. As well, the government announced significant financial support for Canadian news media, which, among other measures, will take the form of tax credits toward the cost of producing original news content. Anticipating these developments, the CRTC had conducted its own \"Let's Talk TV\" consultations, starting in October 2013, which ended with a series of decisions in March 2015 that aimed to be consumer friendly while testing new models of funding and launched a discussion on the \"discoverability\" of Canadian content across a range of platforms used by consumers (CRTC 2015).</p><p>Of the Creative Canada report, it is fair to say that did not garner a consensus. This was not, of course, because of its proposed additional cash investments in Canadian productions via increased funding for the CMR Critics focused on Minister Melanie Joly's embrace of Netflix's promise to invest S500 million in original Canadian production over five years, as a key plank for supporting Canadian culture in the digital age--but exactly what Netflix would fund and even whether it constituted incremental funding was not clear (Taylor 2018). (4) Critics also decried the report's businesslike emphasis on embracing technology, entrepreneurship and exports as engines of growth in cultural industries, with little reference to the kind of content or the importance of culture as such (see, for example, Wells 2017).</p><p>Historically, many cultures and cultural creators have thrived by embracing technology, by being entrepreneurial and by expanding their audiences beyond their local market. A mid-sized market like Canada can help nurture artists with global ambitions--but fulfilling them requires the drive and wherewithal to project their creation beyond the domestic market, which often implies being commercially oriented. Modern technology has a key role to play here by making the works of Canadians more easily accessible than before to larger audiences: virtual trade in cultural products is growing much faster than physical trade (UNESCO 2019).</p><p>From that perspective, Creative Canada's approach to marketing Canada's cultural production abroad makes sense, as it would for any type of economic activity for which economies of scale or scope are important. Indeed, in her speech launching Creative Canada, Minister Joly extolled the success of Canadians on the New York Times bestseller list, at the Emmys or Oscars or in the video game or post-production industries. Yet, the more successful Canadian creators and cultural workers and businesses are, the less they need to rely on protection or to be subsidized at home. Practically in the same breath, however, the minister bemoaned the \"new wave of information\" brought by Facebook, Netflix, Spotify and YouTube that can \"drown out our content\"--even though many contemporary Canadian singers, for example, became international successes in part by using such platforms.</p><p>The critics and Minister Joly's own speech thus point to a dual reality: Canadian artists can become US or even global successes, but does that actually \"protect and promote our stories and our culture,\" which the minister set as a key goal of cultural policy? For this, a focus on the domestic market albeit with tools that recognize the integration of the domestic and global markets via the internet in particular--remains central, as also pointed out by the minister and as I elaborate on in this Commentary.</p><p>In also calling for a review of the Broadcasting, Telecommunications, and Copyright acts, Creative Canada recognized that modernizing cultural policy for the digital age requires addressing the entire legislative framework affecting the policy, and it anticipated the second review currently under way. Indeed, the 2017 federal budget had already announced a review and modernization of the Broadcasting and Telecommunications acts.</p><p>In June 2018, the federal government appointed an external panel to conduct this review of Canada's communication legislative framework (Canada 2019b). The framework in this case means the Telecommunications Act and the Radio-communications Act, (5) both of which fall under ISED, and the Broadcasting Act, under the Department of Canadian Heritage. A separate review of the Copyright Act was launched in December 2017 and is still under way.</p><p>The mandate of this Broadcasting and Telecommunications Legislative Review (BTLR) speaks not only of ensuring \"that Canadians continue to benefit from an open and innovative Internet,\" but also of examining \"issues such as telecommunications and content creation in the digital age, net neutrality and cultural diversity, and how to strengthen the future of Canadian media and Canadian content creation\" (Ibid.). In effect, it is dealing with a lot of the unfinished business left by the earlier digital age review.</p><p>The BTLR produced an interim report (BTLR 2019), based on its consultations across the country. However, without waiting for the final report, the minister of Canadian heritage declared that \"web giants\" will be \"required to create Canadian content + promote it on their platform\" (Menzies 2019). While continued support for Canadian audio-visual content is a message that features prominently in the BTLR's interim report, it is unclear how Canada can force web giants to contribute to it without raising the costs or diminishing the potential benefits of Canadians'access to the internet, which would go against the BTLR's mandate.</p><p>There is, in short, still a need to clarify the interface between cultural policy and a pro-consumer policy direction that would ensure the best access to what the Internet has to offer and other benefits of a competitive telecommunications system. This need is increasingly pressing. Without such clarification, Canada risks taking highly ineffective policy courses on both fronts.</p><p>To help clarify this interface, especially from the viewpoint of cultural policy, it is useful to take a step back and return to the fundamental rationale for cultural policy itself. This will help us understand what underpins the two overarching objectives described above and how specific tools can help Canada achieve these objectives effectively.</p><p>The Rationale for a Canadian Cultural Policy</p><p>The increasing ease with which Canadians' attention could be captured by US popular culture, starting in the 1920s initially through the spread of radio, then television and now through digital platforms, was and continues to be the key catalyst behind Canadian governments' policies on culture. In 1936, the minister of communications, C.D. Howe, introduced the Canadian Broadcasting Act, which created the CBC as the national broadcaster. This move was intended to address concerns that private Canadian radio stations would affiliate themselves with US networks and air programing already produced for the US market, which would block the opportunity for Canadian programming to reach Canadian audiences, given limited channel availability at the time. Yet, soon after the CBC's creation, private radio stations were complaining that it was taking business away from them by running US and commercial programs itself, and they demanded that the CBC become a strictly public service radio (Canadian Communications Foundation 2019).</p><p>This story provides an almost timeless illustration of the dynamic tension at the core of Canadian cultural policy between (i) the concern that stories, news and other cultural and information products made by Canadians, might not be as easily accessible to Canadian audiences as foreign content, and (ii) the business drive to bring to Canadian audiences programming (or printed matter) already developed for the much larger US market, since the latter are typically less costly per likely audience than the equivalent Canadian cultural products.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is not clear why this abundance of foreign programming should be a problem for the Canadian public, who in this day and age could just search for or demand alternative content should they not enjoy or get value from what they are watching. The question of what benefits Canadians might derive from a policy that tilts the available offerings toward more artistic, entertainment or information products from their own culture periodically needs to be asked--and answered.</p><p>Positive Externalities from Culture and Information</p><p>Certain rationales exist for governments to support cultural activities that also apply in the specific case of Canada. These are based on the idea that the private market--facing demand from buyers of cultural goods and services guided by their own preferences and budget constraints, and supply by providers that consider only their own private cost ol producing it--will underconsume or underprovide cultural goods or services. That is because such consumption or production can generate positive effects for others, or positive externalities, that private buyers or sellers will not take into account. (For a fuller discussion of these, see Payne 2003, 9-20; Schwanen 2001, 4-7; see also Hunter, Iacobucci, and Trebilcock 2010, table 1). These externalities are:</p><p>* the transmission to future generations of distinct Canadian stories and cultures that, it is surmised, benefit current and future Canadians, including the very continuity of a Canadian polity and of Canadian cultural communities in their various manifestations;</p><p>* the availability and accessibility of information such as news and documentaries or stories emanating from Canada and its diverse communities, which can promote vital understanding about and goodwill towards Canada, or provide information about what events mean for Canadians, enabling Canadians to make choices based on information that is relevant to them;</p><p>* activities that promote the sharing of common experiences among Canadians--such as festivals or cultural gift giving, or tracking the progress of Canada's amateur and national sports teams --which can build \"social capital,\" defined by Robert Putnam (1995) as \"norms and networks of civic engagement,\" and which in turn reduces the cost of other useful interactions among Canadians; (6)</p><p>* the increasing enjoyment of life by individuals who acquire more refined cultural tastes (culture as a \"merit good\") or simply discover new ways to improve their standard of living as a result of exposure to different types of cultural offerings; in that sense, cultural programs that divert attention away from mass culture play a role akin to that oi education;</p><p>* the local capacity to create artistic products, enjoy artistic experiences or receive an arts education, can enhance Canadians' standard of living beyond that strictly recorded in the market for cultural activities, and historically has been the foundation of new sources of wealth--for example, by facilitating the creation of more innovative and hence more valuable design and advertising, which in turn appear vital to Canada's ability to overcome its lesser ability than that of many peer countries to commercialize ideas. This rationale is akin to the argument for subsidizing research and development (R&amp;D). (7)</p><p>These externalities fit squarely within the framework of economic analysis, but they also span the broader question of the role of cultural policy in maintaining what is distinctly valuable about Canada and its cultures. As 1972 Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow argued, if information that is cheap and omnipresent is not relevant to the choices facing a particular organization, that organization can become \"non-agenda,\" and hence become irrelevant even to its own members (Arrow 1974). The same would apply to communities. In sum, the idea is that Canadians'exposure to Canadian cultural and information products and their capacity to produce art and other cultural goods or services generate positive externalities for Canadians as a whole.</p><p>Absent hard calculations of the value of many of these externalities,(8) whether a cultural good or service receives a subsidy ultimately depends on voters'attitudes (Payne 2003,26-7). There are, however, intermediary mechanisms that can help gauge the value to the public of government support for an activity. Encouragement by government, via tax incentives, of philanthropic donations to cultural pursuits, for example, has the enviable quality of supporting activities that the wider community, as opposed to the bureaucracy or recipient cultural groups, has clearly decided are worth it. Other indicators that support passes a \"public benefit\" test would be the public's interest in, expert acclaim for, or even unexpected practical application of the work the policy has supported.</p><p>Cultural Policy and Canadian Values and Identity</p><p>Cultural policy ultimately aims at facilitating the projection of Canadian creativity, arts and information into the wider society and economy, and in that sense it emanates from and supports Canadian identity or identities. That role, however, should be clearly separated from the idea that there might be \"Canadian values\" whose proponents might be more worthy of support through cultural policy than those who do not share them.</p><p>Canadian values and identity have always evolved, and to promote one version over others would run counter to the rationale for cultural policy described here. Indeed, Kymlicka (1991) argues that cultures must be able to evolve to thrive, which does not mean they cannot remain distinct. Blocking access to non-Canadian cultural products on the grounds that some official or even voters do not like the values they represent is a poor way to preserve the cultural identity of any group of Canadians. Only if the non-Canadian content were so pervasive and channels to access Canadian content so limited that Canadians were prevented, as a result, from becoming aware of domestic content that they might otherwise value, might restricting access to it be warranted.</p><p>Cultural Industries' Share of Economic Activity Is Not the Issue</p><p>When seeking to convince Canadians of the importance of supporting Canadian cultural content, official documents or speeches more often than not trumpet the contribution to Canadian jobs or to Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) of the industries that produce this content. (9) In a similar vein, the role that cultural products play in Canada's export performance is touted as a sign of success. (10) These metrics are offered both as a sign of success and as proof that cultural activities writ large are worthy of additional support and protection.</p><p>Certainly, cultural jobs and exports are valuable. By these standard economic metrics, however, they are no more worthy of special support than a dollar produced or a job created in another sector of the economy If those are the metrics, Canadians might well ask what is so special about cultural industries that they, and not some other industry, deserve special support.</p><p>This is not to say that run-of-the-mill measures of economic activity are not useful for some purposes. Knowing the importance of cultural industries and occupations in a particular area can be useful for tourism planning, for example, or to attract individuals and businesses that value a rich cultural environment. As with R&amp;D, it is difficult to predict the ultimate success of the work that goes into developing a new cultural offering, which might partly explain the focus on metrics of activity, as opposed to success in connecting with the public. But for activities that require constant public subsidization and protection, success ultimately should be gauged by metrics that are reasonably related to the public rationale for such support and creating jobs or GDP in the cultural industries does not primarily fit that bill.</p><p>As we have seen, the key rationales for cultural policy are the positive externalities Canadians are presumed to enjoy from Canadian cultural and information offerings. The benefits of such cultural activities are essentially realized when Canadians choose to enjoy, consume, share or build successful economic activities on these Canadian offerings. But are the tools currently used to support cultural policy doing so in ways best aligned with the rationales for having a cultural policy in the first place? If not, what other policy tools might be more effective.</p><p>The Effectiveness of Cultural policy tools</p><p>Inherent to the functioning of Canadian cultural policy is the differentiation between Canadian and non-Canadian content. That is because what generates the expected positive externalities--when the content is produced, viewed, read or listened to by a Canadian or by a foreign audience--is its quality of being Canadian. In many instances, the market would cater naturally to the value consumers attach to being able to differentiate between otherwise identical or similar products according to their place of origin. An example is diamonds that exhibit the \"Canadamark\" in contrast to others that might be less responsibly mined. But the fact that positive externalities arise from exposing Canadians (11) to Canadian cultural or information offerings implies that the market, left on its own, would underconsume or underprovide these. In turn, government policy, if it is to correct for this state of affairs, needs to be able to use tools that differentiate between a film or magazine that is Canadian and one that is not, even though both are otherwise similar products that compete for buyers' wallets, time and attention.</p><p>International trade agreements limit what Canada can do in this respect, but not fatally so. Under Article III of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for example, Canada cannot impose taxes on foreign goods that are \"like\" or \"directly competitive or substitutable for\" domestically produced goods. To Canada's dismay, in 1997 the GATT Appellate Body ruled that a news magazine with mainly US editorial content, but whose advertising was aimed at the Canadian market, was a directly competitive or substitutable good with a newsmagazine with mainly Canadian editorial content, and therefore Canada could not impose an excise tax only on the former (WTO 1997. For discussion, see Browne 1998; Schwanen 2001, (12-14).</p><p>Canadian trade policy has evolved considerably since the GATT was implemented in 1947, and Canada has now negotiated blanket \"cultural exemptions\" in trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). (12) It also refused to make commitments regarding the liberalization of trade in cultural services in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which came into effect in 1994. Of course, Canada pays a price for these positions in terms of access to foreign markets that it might have been able to obtain in exchange. Still, GATT rules do not prohibit the subsidization of domestic cultural (or any other) production, as long as this is not in the form of export subsidies or conditional on the recipient's using a domestic rather than an imported good.</p><p>International trade rules do, however, shape the specific measures Canada can adopt. The truce declared in the magazine dispute, following the signature of the GATS, allowed Canada to limit the deductibility of advertising expenses incurred in periodicals to those incurred by periodicals with a high percentage of original Canadian editorial content, in turn defined as content authored by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident and created specifically for the Canadian market. This worked under trade rules because the new Canadian measure affected advertising services, not periodicals as a good.</p><p>The resolution of the magazine dispute involved a fairly streamlined definition of \"original content\" produced by Canadians and aimed at the Canadian market. (13) But what qualifies as Canadian content for the purpose of applying content restrictions or eligibility for subsidies will vary across media and programs. For music, current rules are fairly-clear and concise: under the so-called MAPL system, a piece that meets two of the following four conditions qualifies: the Music is composed by a Canadian, the Artist is Canadian, the Performance is recorded or takes place in Canada and the Lyrics are by a Canadian. A TV program will be certified as Canadian if the producer, key creative functions (based on a points system), the director or screenwriter and one lead performer are Canadian, and a minimum of 75 percent of expenses are paid for services provided by Canadians or Canadian companies. (There are exceptions for international co-productions.) Rules governing what counts as Canadian for the purpose of eligibility for subsidies and tax credits can be even more complex. And rules limiting ownership or control of a sector or activity to Canadians can act as substitutes for content rules, on the theory that Canadian control is more likely to yield quality Canadian content, a theory to which I return below.</p><p>For the purpose of meeting the rationale of cultural policy--which is to generate the positive externalities discussed above through the willing use or enjoyment of Canadian content--a simple operational definition of Canadian content should suffice to guide policy across the board. I propose that \"Canadian content\" be defined as an artistic, literary or information offering of any kind:</p><p>* whose moral rights accrued initially to a Canadian permanent resident; or which depicts a performance given in Canada or predominantly by Canadian permanent residents; or which is produced on behalf of a Canadian government or public institution; or which largely and fairly documents any aspect of Canada as it is or was; or</p><p>* developed for a mostly Canadian audience, and is produced mostly by Canadian residents (or is an approved co-production under agreement with another country).</p><p>How effective, then, are the specific tools used to promote Canadian content?</p><p>Requirements of Licensed Broadcasters</p><p>Canadian-content quotas on television and radio seek to enhance the ease with which such content is available, relative to non-Canadian content, in the hope that Canadians might appreciate Canadian content more than they would have a chance to otherwise. Distributors of TV programs over the air, via cable and satellite, and over the internet via internet protocol TV (IPTV) (14) are also required to contribute a portion of their revenues to fund Canadian audio-visual productions. Such obiligations do not apply to providers of streaming and other services over the internet.</p><p>As Canadians embrace new technologies and platforms to access their entertainment and information, the ability of quotas to affect Canadians' viewing or listening habits is rapidly diminishing. Indeed, 2013 marked the first year in which the number of Canadian households subscribing to internet services exceeded the number of traditional television subscribers. Although 75 percent of Canadian households still subscribed to cable or satellite television distribution services in 2016--down markedly from 83 percent only four years before--87 percent of Canadian households subscribed to internet services (CRTC 2019, figure 1.1). In the economy more generally, the culture, entertainment and information services offered online through digital technologies have boomed relative to other economic activities, and in particular relative to traditional cultural and information businesses (Figure 2).</p><p>Thus, content providers' access to Canadian households via traditional \"push\" platforms that enable the content available to households to be programmed and controlled is clearly declining. Through platforms offering a vast trove of content, Canadians can \"pull\" the content of their choice from practically anywhere, on a multiplicity ot devices (Hunter, Iacobucci, and Trebilcock 2010 provide a good early exploration of the dynamics of \"pull\" vs. \"push\" platforms). Advertising revenues have followed the rise of the internet, eclipsing those of all traditional media (Hunter, Engelhart, and Miller 2017, 14-15). Broadcast distributors themselves have responded to emerging competition by offering \"on-demand\" services, further moving away from the model that allowed content to be pushed to Canadian households. In this context, requiring them to provide certain content, including a specific quota of Canadian shows or music during prime time, can only make them lose even more steam relative to competitors that cannot be regulated in that way.</p><p>According to Statistics Canada, in 2015 Canadians spent almost five hours per day on average primarily on leisure (Statistics Canada 2017). And increasingly, that time is spent using computers. The playing of video games alone increased from virtually nothing in 1992 to almost three-quarters of an hour per day per Canadian age fifteen and older in 2015. Purely in an accounting sense, this increase seems to have come at the expense of other leisure and voluntary activities, including arts and crafts, reading, watching television and \"socializing.\" Moreover, the generational aspects of this change are striking: only the aging of the population prevents a more pronounced average trend toward digital entertainment and access to information.</p><p>Broadcast distributors and providers of communications services are often one and the same company, as many firms have sought to exploit synergies across the two industries (see CRTC 2019, figure 3.7). As such, they must not only meet the competition for Canadians' attention from a practically infinite number of sources; they must also deliver modern, accessible and competitively priced communications and information infrastructure--in particular, good access to the internet--that is vital to Canada's economic future and that Canadians demand. These companies, however, are seeing their broadcasting revenues decline while their revenues from telecommunications grow (CRTC 2019, figure 3.2).</p><p>In the bygone world of a finite number of channels, each with a set schedule of offerings, the power of licensed broadcasters to generate above-market returns using non-Canadian programming (available relatively cheaply) could well have justified the obligation put on them to exhibit Canadian cultural content (Hunter, Iacobucci, and Trebilcock 2010,21-2). But in the now ferociously competitive context for reaching audiences--and in which Canadians have a wide array of choices for enjoying Canadian cultural content--not only are quotas quickly losing their traction; they are harming the ability of Canadian distributors who are subjected to those rules to compete for Canadians' attention and business, often against foreign-based entities. The same is true of obligations to support the production of Canadian content: they are a subsidy to the media production sector paid by a captive domestic broadcasting sector, and hence also by the major companies in the telecommunications sector, beyond the amounts they already spend of their own volition on Canadian programming that connects with its audiences. These policies harm Canadians' incomes more generally by, in effect, subsidizing sectors whose productivity is relatively sluggish at the expense of ones whose productivity is higher, thus impeding Canada's overall productivity performance, on which Canadians' standards of living depend (Figure 3).</p><p>According to many observers (see, for example, von Finckenstein 2017), it is time to devise communications policies that do not make Canadians pay for content they do not watch via compulsory contributions, regulations or special taxes that only hamper the capacity of the Canadian communications system to provide access to the internet, or more generally to provide modern communications infrastructure and services, that are central to the future of Canada's economy and Canadians' participation in it. These considerations are not lost on governments and regulators. Through the public consultations mentioned above and a recent report by the CRTC on the future of programming distribution in Canada (CRTC 2018), the federal government and the CRTC have been preparing both the cultural industries and the public for a profound revamp of the way cultural policy functions in Canada, particularly with regard to the distribution and funding of audio-visual products.</p><p>Deductibility of Advertising Expenses</p><p>As we have seen in the discussion on the Canada-US magazine dispute, Canadian businesses can deduct the cost of advertising placed in Canadian periodicals containing a certain amount of original Canadian content. The rules are somewhat different with respect to broadcast advertising aimed primarily at the Canadian market. In this case, the broadcaster must be Canadian for the expense to be deductible by the business doing the advertising.</p><p>Since the advent of the internet, Canadian businesses have had more avenues to reach their customers. Web-based services are not considered to be broadcasting by the Canada Revenue Agency, and therefore Canadian businesses may fully deduct those advertising expenses from their income. Although many web-based services on which Canadian businesses advertise are not Canadian, disallowing altogether the deductibility of advertising expenses incurred on these platforms would simply throw Canadian businesses under the bus against their foreign competitors. It would make it more difficult to reach their domestic market, and in general limit the growth of an industry, advertising, that employs a large share of Canada's cultural workers and has often contributed to generating a positive Canada \"brand\" on par with other cultural industries.</p><p>At the same time, we should encourage a level fiscal playing field between different players offering advertising-supported cultural content. From that perspective, the policy should be to allow Canadian advertisers to deduct only advertising expenses placed with any entity, Canadian or foreign, that pays Canadian sales and income taxes commensurate with its business in Canada. (15)</p><p>Public Subsidies and Tax Credits for Private Cultural and Information Productions</p><p>It is impossible to discuss in detail here the numerous subsidies available to support cultural activities in Canada. (16) However, one should broadly distinguish those programs meant to support individual artists, new creations and cultural innovation--for example, experimentation with digital technologies--or to connect cultural productions to their audiences, from programs that are more clearly directed at supporting economic activity in certain sectors, often to shield them from the effect of competition.</p><p>Two cases exemplify the latter: the Canadian Film or Video Productions Services Tax Credit, and the recently introduced tax credits to support the creation of original news content in traditional media. Both are subsidies to labour costs incurred by the private sector. They essentially support jobs in these sectors, without any reference to the Canadian-ness of the content in the former case and in either case without reference to future success in connecting Canadian culture or information with Canadian audiences.</p><p>The rationale offered for the film or video tax credit revolves around the need to maintain an audio-visual industry of a scale that can compete with US and other global production facilities.</p><p>The idea here is that, without such scale, Canada's ability to produce quality and attractive audio-visual content would be impaired. And this, it is true, might in turn impair the attainment of cultural policy objectives, notwithstanding the increasing ability of content producers to create effective audio-visual offerings using lower-cost digital technologies. If industry players want to scale up, they need only look at the large market next door, which many Canadians know intimately, which they can access easily, and to which in fact Canadian cultural industries, and its audio-visual industry in particular, already export successfully. (17)</p><p>The need to compete against the large number of US states that offer tax credits and other incentives for audio-visual productions can also be invoked as a reason to subsidize local Canadian audio-visual efforts. This would be an example of a \"second-best\" case for supporting an industry: Canada might well have some natural advantages in competing for such business, but US subsidies pull some of that activity south, creating an inefficient allocation of North American resources. If Canadian locations did not offer similar inducements, they would lose activities that economic efficiency would otherwise dictate be located in Canada. (18)</p><p>The recent announcement of large private investments in a film and television production studio in Hamilton very much falls in that category, with the investors touting Ontario's audio-visual production tax credits and Canada's tax credits, in addition to other attractive local features and supportive partnerships, as a key reason for their investment (Canadian Press 2019). However, with the economic boost flowing from cultural subsidies falling mainly locally, and their main justification being the need to compete against local US subsidies for similar activities, production services tax credits offered by the federal government that are not tied to particular Canadian-content requirements should be offered only when matching existing local or provincial subsidies apply.</p><p>The media support fund, initially announced in Finance Minister Bill Morneau's fall 2018 fiscal update, will distribute hundreds of millions of dollars over the next five years to subsidize the salaries of journalists from certain media outlets and other costs of producing and disseminating original news content. As well, not-for-profit news organizations will be able to issue charitable tax receipts, as long as they make their content available for free, and a non-refundable tax credit will be created for subscriptions to Canadian digital news (Zimonjic 2019).</p><p>The plight of traditional news media, which have seen advertising revenues melt away to the benefit of internet-based platforms, (19) is well known. The question of how to maintain viable independent news media--given the importance of a diversity of viewpoints, but also heightened concerns over the manipulation of content disseminated by interested parties under the guise of independent content--has preoccupied a number of governments around the world. Nevertheless, the main issue with subsidizing the jobs of journalists working for traditional news media is that it does not encourage the public to connect with these media, which is how such support could have a positive effect from the viewpoint of cultural policy. The suggestion by the Journalism and Written Media Independent Panel of Experts (2019) (20) that the federal government spend more in advertising in traditional media likewise raises the question of why advertise at all in a particular medium if it does not effectively reach the advertiser's intended audience.</p><p>Although public support for organizations that generate Canadian content that Canadians will actually absorb and the tax credit for subscriptions to Canadian digital news fit the objectives of cultural policy, the subsidization of specific industries, of the labour costs they incur, or even worse, of some organizations but not others should be scrapped as not justifiably contributing to the goals of Canadian cultural policy. Such subsidization should be replaced by eligibility for the broader package I propose below for connecting Canadian news and cultural content to the Canadian public, irrespective of the means of delivering the content.</p><p>State-Provided Content</p><p>Cultural production by agencies of the federal and provincial governments has tended to fit the rationales for cultural policy fairly closely, whether experimental (NFB) or educational (TV Ontario) or to connect Canadians with other Canadians across the country (CBC). That is to say, they arguably provide cultural benefits in the public interest that complement Canadian cultural offerings from the private sector.</p><p>As noted, however, the goal of educating and connecting Canadians with one another can be achieved only if Canadians willingly partake of or engage with the proposed content. The CBC, for example, competes with other media and entertainment platforms for Canadians' leisure time. Indeed, like other traditional media, the CBC has responded to recent trends by trying to leverage its brand on platforms other than traditional TV or radio. One challenge the CBC has had in this respect is the revealed need to shore up its viewership by offering more popular content arguably, more \"fun\" or sensational content (Doyle 2019). This content, however, could be provided just as well by private broadcasters and other content providers that compete with the CBC for viewers and advertising dollars.</p><p>Insofar as the CBC fulfils its raison d'etre to offer content that private broadcasters typically do not, the fact that it incidentally offers some content that competes with private sector offerings is legitimate, and likely inevitable anyway. However, the idea that its existence is necessary to provide Canadians with Canadian content they would not otherwise engage with should be subject to some test of its actual success in doing so, as is the case with the British Broadcasting Corporation, for example, whose performance is regularly assessed against its stated public purposes by the British regulator Ofcom. In this respect, the CBC could, like other providers and distributors of content, tap into new inducements specifically aimed at connecting Canadians with original Canadian content, as I propose below.</p><p>Restrictions on Foreign Ownership</p><p>Must a Canadian-owned business also produce or distribute the content for it to count as Canadian? In many cases, the production and distribution of Canadian cultural content seems to rely on Canadian-owned businesses that engage in these activities. But since there are barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI) in key cultural businesses, it is not clear whether that reliance is an artifact of policy or a sign of a particular advantage Canadians have at promoting and distributing Canadian cultural content.</p><p>If this reliance on Canadian businesses in newspapers, film distribution, book retailing and others is an artifact of policy, rather than a sign of the comparative advantage Canadian businesses actually have, then barriers to FDI in these sectors risk restricting both the diversity of the ownership pool and the capital investments available to produce and distribute Canadian content. This, in turn, risks exacerbating the already slumping productivity depicted in Figure 3 and in general making the connection between Canadian creators and the public more arduous than it should be.</p><p>Canadian policymakers should consider the abundant examples of foreign firms' financing, making and distributing cultural products that are strongly associated with another country's culture. (21) A current striking example is the success that US producers are making of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale--itself a warning of a dystopian future originally crafted with the former East Germany in mind. Many global behemoths no doubt hold scale advantages over the typical Canadian-owned cultural business, but Canadians in these businesses should benefit from economies of scope in finding Canadian offerings that will connect well with the Canadian public or with a global public with which \"Canadian-ness\" resonates. A foreign owner removed from the Canadian scene, in contrast, might not easily establish that connection, as demonstrated by the fact that distinctly Canadian businesses thrive in Canada in many sectors open to competition, despite the presence of global giants.</p><p>Unless we think that non-Canadian owners would not play by the rules we would expect a Canadian owner to abide by (22)--for example, if we thought they would discriminate against Canadian offerings for the Canadian or international market we should remove barriers to foreign ownership per se. Canadian Heritage would still vet foreign owners carefully for any threat that the investment might lessen the access of Canadian or foreign audiences to Canadian content, in the same way that it now vets new foreign investments in cultural industries below a small monetary threshold (23) or purchases by a foreign company of an existing foreign-owned cultural business in Canada. In the latter case, acquirers are already required to make commitments compatible with the goals of Canadian cultural policy (Joneja 2013). This practice could be extended to all foreign investments at the same time as Canada becomes more open to them. At a minimum, the federal government should demonstrate how any remaining disallowance of foreign ownership positively contributes to strengthening the domestic (as opposed to just domestically owned) industry in which it is in effect.</p><p>That being said, foreign investment policy should be especially calibrated vis-a-vis investments originating in countries that consider it fit, for security, cultural or other reasons, to maintain barriers to Canadian and other foreign investment in activities related to culture. Ideally, opportunities should be reciprocal. But in general, foreign countries have relaxed rules concerning the involvement of foreign players in their cultural and communications marketplace in recent years (Hunter, Iacobucci, and Trebilcock 2010), while Canada's barriers to foreign investment in audio-visual and broadcasting sectors remain well above those of the typical member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2018a, 2018b). In the United States, for example, the Federal Communications Commission has begun rolling back some restrictions on foreign ownership of broadcast station licences, although leaving them in place for owners, in a bid to encourage \"new sources of investments in the broadband industry.\"</p><p>In short, denial of a proposed acquisition by a foreign owner, in this as in other sectors, should be based on reasoned concerns about would-be foreign investors acting contrary to Canada's interest writ large, including whether their share of the Canadian market or their behaviour might negatively affect, through anti-competitive practices, the ability of Canadian content to reach the public.</p><p>WHAT IS TO BE DONE?</p><p>Those in the media sector who rely on Canadian exhibition quotas or on compulsory spending by private broadcasters, but who now see the quotas potentially bypassed, the compulsory spending potentially dry up and advertising revenues swept away by much more effective engines than traditional media, naturally worry. The response of politicians to these worries often focuses, also naturally enough, on what they can do to maintain existing jobs. Often, they assign blame to providers that have disrupted the old ways of doing things by introducing or exploiting new technologies. (24)</p><p>Neither reflex, however, is helpful in creating the conditions for the future success of cultural policy, which needs to be founded on the ability to connect Canadian content with its potential audiences, on the platforms and through the media these audiences find most convenient. This would include journalistic content generated and curated by traditional media. But since the traditional media can reinforce stereotypes or ignore alternative views (Dobson 2019), the policy picture should be nested in a broader one of access by Canadians to digital platforms that provide a vital and interactive conduit to a diverse Canadian cultural and information landscape. Ultimately, the focus should be on high-quality, engaging or useful content, not quantity of content.</p><p>Besides, producers and distributors of Canadian content now seem to have, from a technological standpoint, as many opportunities to connect with their audiences as everyone else through the internet and ubiquitous personal communications devices. What they might not have is the scale that giant platforms and providers of digital services have reached, and that allows them to reach audiences, and even direct audiences toward certain content. This raises the question of the competitive environment within which Canadian content reaches potential audiences. (25)</p><p>Competition Copyright and Taxation Issues</p><p>In devising policy, a fundamental question to ask is whether the digital age--which is bringing new means of reaching the public and hence new forms of competition--is also facilitating the emergence of a market in which a few dominant gatekeepers and other players could engage in anti-competitive practices such as predatory pricing, refusal to deal and abuse of dominance. If so, is Canada's competition regime adequate to the task of dealing with such a problem?</p><p>The C.D. Howe Institute's Competition Policy Council has concluded that Canada's competition authorities have the tools to address anti-competitive behaviour by digital giants in the Canadian marketplace (Competition Policy Council 2019). Nevertheless, Canadians will follow with interest the slew of official inquiries in the United States into the competitive practices of data-driven internet giants, including inquiries into how search results are produced and into competition for advertising (Sandler 2019).</p><p>Other key rules of the market for cultural and information products that must be considered relate to the treatment of intellectual property. As mentioned, the review of the Copyright Act is proceeding on a separate track from the legislative review of the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Acts, and speaks to the fair treatment of Canadian culture and information producers in the marketplace. Canada's cultural sector should not count on likely reforms, however, to tilt much the balance their way between the goal of fairly rewarding creators and others who own the rights to cultural or entertainment content, on the one hand, and that of making cultural and information products available as widely as possible for educational and creative purposes, on the other.</p><p>Although a natural tension between these two goals lies at the very heart of the copyright system, a recent House of Commons committee report generally ran counter to recommendations for stronger forms of copyright protection (such as limiting exceptions for fair dealing) made by Heritage Canada (Geist 2019). Instead, the economic argument in favour of more widespread access to content and information prevailed in the committee report. However, the Canada United States Mexico Agreement reached in late 2018 does provide for longer copyright protection and emphasizes enforcement. And, as noted by Boyer (2019), with technologies allowing the reproduction of content at practically zero marginal cost, it is fair to continue to examine novel approaches for compensating creators for the use of their work.</p><p>Another question related to fair competition has to do with the taxation of internet-based digital platforms that naturally operate in Canada but are not based here, and that have attracted revenues from Canadian firms advertising for the Canadian marketplace. It is inaccurate to describe this purchase by advertisers as \"taking $7 billion dollars out of the Canadian economy,\" as the Journalism and Written Media Independent Media Panel of Experts (2019) did in its report, since Canadian advertisers presumably are getting good value for their money. Nevertheless, it is potentially taking business away from similar entities that are taxed more heavily by virtue of being headquartered in Canada. As discussed above, I propose restoring parity in the marketplace--without taking away the ability of Canadian advertisers to reach their potential customers via the most cost-efficient means available--by allowing Canadian advertisers to deduct only advertising expenses placed with any entity, Canadian or foreign, that remits Canadian sales taxes and pays income taxes commensurate with its business in Canada. In that light, it is passing strange that Canadian governments (except in Quebec and Saskatchewan) have exempted Canadians from paying sales taxes on content subscriptions or other services purchased from companies not located in Canada, such as Netflix. This makes no sense from a fiscal policy perspective (Wyonch 2017) or from a cultural policy perspective. Apple's iTunes service started voluntarily charging Canadian sales taxes on purchases from its Canadian customers in January 2019. Amazon also charge sales tax on certain memberships and subscriptions. What they are doing, others should also be mandated to do.</p><p>In general, however, Canadian cultural policy should not be adopted in splendid isolation from other issues confronting Canada's economy and society. It should embrace a \"first do no harm\" approach toward all sectors, including the cultural and information sectors, as Canadians seek to capture the benefits and grapple with the consequences of new digital technologies. This means not restricting unnecessarily how Canadians use the market to access, upload content and do business via the internet, or imposing a tax on internet connectivity more broadly that would finance only cultural activities.</p><p>What policies, then, could encourage Canadians to enjoy, consume or use Canadian cultural content more willingly in the digital era? I propose a strategy with two new strands: 1) enhancing the discoverability and contestability for Canadian content; and 2) redirecting some existing funding toward a more pointed Canadian Connections Program, offered on a more competitive basis.</p><p>Discoverability and Contestability for Canadian Cultural Products</p><p>Since 2014, as it prepared for the \"Let's Talk TV\" consultations, the CRTC has pushed the industry and government policymakers to examine ways to promote the \"discoverability\" of Canadian content. The concept of discoverability as it applies to this discussion is not about the ability of consumers, who know what they are looking for, to find the Canadian content they seek. Rather, it is about increasing the chances, as audiences look for sources of education, entertainment or information amid the cornucopia of offerings available on various platforms, that the content they find is Canadian.</p><p>Making Canadian content more \"discoverable,\" in the sense of more likely to be found by consumers who are not necessarily looking for it, can be a challenge given the availability of a seemingly infinite array of content from any source. Yet there are now sophisticated ways to exploit users' data collected online and through other interactions--to discover what kind of content, including Canadian content, might interest them.</p><p>A serious effort to promote discoverability could include forming a consortium to foster the use of search engine optimization techniques (26) for sites featuring Canadian cultural or information content, and online advertising to drive potential consumers to Canadian content that potentially accords with their other likely preferences. (27) The consortium could also offer a new free mobile application for Canadian cultural and information programming, feeds and individual offerings from all sources. The app could direct users to different genres or regional content--offerings that meet a certain Canadian-content ratio depending on the genre selected, the way the CRTC now allows Canadian content to vary for Indigenous, jazz and ethnic radio licences, for example. The consortium could promote programming available anywhere in that country and entirely devoted to up-and-coming artists from all over the world as exists in Australia. (28)</p><p>A discoverability strategy would also support stronger collaboration, along the vertical chain from artists and studios to the public, on marketing plans for Canadian content. This would include encouraging content producers, broadcasters and distributors to collaborate more closely on the development and marketing of content (see Canadian Media Fund 2019, 55-6). Going in this direction might involve broadcasters' taking on a greater role in developing original audiovisual material, as Hunter, Engelhart, and Miller (2017) envisage, with the support of the proposed Canadian Connections Program I describe below.</p><p>As Burri (2019, 8) notes with respect to online content, \"the content that is supported and endorsed, often by public money, is valuable to citizens only if it can be found and accessed online.\" Pre-competitive collaboration toward enhancing the discoverability of Canadian content as a whole, in the ways described above, would strengthen the willing connection between Canadian content and Canadian audiences, and hence make public support for Canadian cultural endeavors more effective overall. It would also have the virtue, being mostly internet-based, of enabling this content to reach foreign audiences better--boosting the chances of global economic success for cultural products that can be digitized.</p><p>From the standpoint of cultural policy, the key policy objective remains for Canadians to enjoy or use Canadian content more--to want to see it or hear or read it. To that effect, I also suggest redirecting subsidies that currently support production toward rewarding success in making Canadians appreciate and willingly engage with Canadian content, especially new content that might otherwise struggle commercially.</p><p>Supporting the Market for Canadian Cultural Offerings: A Canadian Connections Program</p><p>A Canadian Connections Program, along the lines initially suggested by Dachis and Schwanen (2016, 7), would reward success in demonstrably engaging Canadians with Canadian cultural and information products beyond what the marketplace would provide. It would complement the work of agencies such as the NFB and programs delivered through Telefilm Canada that support research, innovation and development or original exhibition in a context of high fixed costs and uncertain demand for original cultural creations. Such existing programs seem well attuned to the rationales for cultural subsidies.</p><p>This new program would pay more attention to connecting (and developing) supply with potential demand. It would fund entities--publishers, broadcasters and internet-based distributors of cultural or information products--that successfully connect Canadian offerings, whose commercial viability has not been established, with a Canadian audience. It would replace programs that mainly support production activities--such as the refundable tax credit for Canadian-owned film productions and direct funding by government of the Canadian Media Fund--with support for juried, multiyear marketing plans that show the most promise for connecting such offerings with audiences.</p><p>The funding awarded through this program would not be limited to one cultural industry in particular. It could be administered by the Canadian Media Fund, whose ambit for this purpose would expand beyond audio-visual content. The fund would periodically call for proposals meeting minimum criteria with respect to type of content for example drama, amateur sports, documentary, children's, public affairs or minority language programming--and projected audiences. Proposals would be evaluated by a jury of experts according to their originality in relation to commercially available content and the credibility of their plan for connecting Canadians with this content--perhaps with special weight attached to the targeting of identifiable minority audiences or for content available across a number of provinces. Naturally, the jurors could not be political appointees or prospective recipients of subsidies. Successful recipients of subsidies would be bidders that offered to meet the minimum criteria for the least amount of requested subsidy, a format for funds allocation known as a \"reverse auction.\" Bidders for subsidies could be Canadian broadcasters, including the CBC, or other Canadian or foreign services offering cultural or information content to Canadians, likely working in partnership with various producers of Canadian content themselves.</p><p>This program would also replace Canadian-content rules--although not rules that require some Canadian channels being made prominently available throughout the country--and Canadian-content funding requirements for broadcasters administered by the CRTC. The subsidies it dispensed would be available only to entities with which Canadian advertisers could deduct advertising expenses. Funding for the program would come out of general government revenues. As noted, imposing a special tax on overall internet services that benefit virtually all Canadians--as the CRTC chair, for example, has suggested in order to fund Canadian cultural programs (Menzies 2019)--would contradict the goals of access to and development of the digital economy (see also Dachis and Schwanen 2016, 7).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>There is no measure of \"sufficient\" production or consumption of Canadian content. In the absence of public support, what Canadian cultural output would in fact be produced or consumed is a matter of conjecture. At the same time, the positive externalities generated for Canadians by cultural activities writ large and certain elements of the economics of producing cultural products that can be easily replicated in digital forms suggest that they would be underprovided and underconsumed in the unfettered market.</p><p>Although certain types of cultural activities are similar to research and development and might warrant support on similar grounds, the ultimate test of a successful cultural policy is whether Canadian cultural productions connect with their potential public and other users. This test is fundamentally one that requires paying attention to the potential demand for Canadian offerings, in contrast to measuring success via common metrics of economic activity such as jobs or GDP, which could be invoked as a basis for supporting any economic sector.</p><p>Canada's cultural policies need to become better suited to the digital age, while still reflecting the underlying rationales for such support. To that end, a number of policy tools should be replaced or revamped, including content and funding requirements for broadcasters and for broadcast distribution units, certain tax credits and direct funding of audio-visual and journalistic production, and prohibitions on foreign investment. Instead, there should be new investment in tools that enhance the discoverability of Canadian content, and a more rigorous focus--whose success should be periodically evaluated--on subsidizing cultural activities on the basis of their likelihood of connecting non-commercially available Canadian content with Canadian and foreign audiences. Policy success lies in whether government policy can effectively increase the audience, readership or viewership for Canadian content, including subsidized content that in time becomes a commercial winner. That, ultimately, is how to ensure a successful, and widely supported, cultural policy.</p><p>REFERENCES</p><p>Arrow, Kenneth. 1974. The Limits of Organization. New York: W.W.

He retains responsibility for any errors and the views expressed.</p><p>(1) To cite a policy paper by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Ferencz and Gonzales 2019,4), \"Information and communications technology services form the backbone of the digital economy by providing the necessary network infrastructure and underpinning the digitisation of other types of services. Once services activities can be digitised, they can be transferred across electronic networks ... Therefore policies that encourage competition and investment in high-speed networks are essential to unlock the full potential of the digital transformation.\"</p><p>(2) As exemplified by the Creative Canada Vision issued by the Department of Canadian Heritage (Joly 2017), which provides \"a roadmap that focuses on supporting our creators, delivering their content to domestic and international audiences, and ensuring that there is always a space for Canadians to connect through our stories.\" It offers a policy framework divided into three pillars: 1. \"Invest in Canadian creators, cultural entrepreneurs and their stories\"; 2. \"Promote discovery and distribution [of products from these Canadian creators]\"; and 3. \"Strengthen public broadcasting and local news.\"</p><p>(3) Under section 14.1 of the Investment Canada Act, a cultural business is \"a Canadian business that carries on any of the following activities, namely, (a) the publication, distribution or sale of books, magazines, periodicals or newspapers in print or machine readable form, other than the sole activity of printing or typesetting of books, magazines, periodicals or newspapers, (b) the production, distribution, sale or exhibition of film or video recordings, (c) the production, distribution, sale or exhibition of audio or video music recordings, (d) the publication, distribution or sale of music in print or machine readable form, or (e) radio communication in which the transmissions are intended for direct reception by the general public, any radio, television and cable television broadcasting undertakings and any satellite programming and broadcast network services.\"</p><p>(4) Netflix seems willing to make public the amounts it spends by country, perhaps as a way to differentiate itself vis-a-vis powerful emerging rivals in these markets (see Sweeney and Conlan 2019).</p><p>(5) As von Finckenstein (2017) notes: \"Any review of communications has to include the Radiocommunications Act which presently governs spectrum management and wireless communications. All communications, regardless of mode, should be covered by one communications act. The present division between wireline, wireless and cable communications predates the digital revolution and makes no sense in the age of the internet.\"</p><p>(6) For a reflection on the current state of social capital in Canada, see Valpy (2013).</p><p>(7) As well, many cultural products, especially audio-visual items and books available digitally, exhibit key characteristics of \"public goods,\" defined as goods that can be enjoyed by more than one person at the same time at no additional cost per person, beyond the sunk cost of making the initial product, and for which it is difficult to exclude anyone from enjoying. Given that pricing in private markets is based on marginal cost, the public good might not be produced without government support of these sunk costs (Payne 2003,6-8; Grant and Wood 2004, Appendix B). Indeed, they share these characteristics with knowledge generated by R&amp;D spending.</p><p>(8) And even if these positive externalities--that is, social benefits in addition to the private benefits accruing to those that might receive a subsidy--could be quantified, taxing other activities to subsidize cultural activities creates a deadweight economic loss, and so the perceived public benefits of cultural activities should at least compensate for that loss.</p><p>(9) Thus, in its opening two paragraphs, the 2019-20 departmental plan of the Department of Canadian Heritage states: \"The Government ot Canada is committed to promoting Canada's artists and creative and cultural industries ... Canadian Heritage and its portfolio organizations play a vital role in the ... economic life of Canadians. Arts, culture and heritage represent $53.8 billion in the Canadian economy and more than 650,000 jobs\" (Canada 2019a, 2).</p><p>(10) As the glowing description of international success by Canadian artists and the announcement of a first Creative Export Strategy as part of the Creative Canada Initiative made clear (Joly 2017).</p><p>(11) In many cases, exposing foreign audiences as well--for example, through the benefits that can accrue to Canadians generally from cultural diplomacy or cultural tourism in Canada, the scale of cultural activity that export success can enable, or a strong Canada \"brand.\"</p><p>(12) The Canada United StatesMexico Agreement that is meant to supersede the NAFTA, but is not yet in force, also includes a cultural exemption.</p><p>(13) For rules on the deductibility of advertising expenses with periodicals or broadcasters, see Canada, Justice Laws Website, at <url normalizedValue=\"https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-3.3/page-17.html\">https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-3.3/page-17.html</url>.</p><p>(14) \"Pirate'TPTV providers, as the name implies, operate outside of and in competition with regulated broadcasters and owners or licencees of content.</p><p>(15) On sales taxes as they apply to foreign-owned digital businesses, see Wyonch (2017). Regarding income taxes, what constitutes a fair share of taxes to be paid in any given country by a multinational company that books its net income in lower-tax jurisdictions is currently the subject of negotiations under the \"Base erosion and profit shifting\" initiative at the OECD, which aim to conclude by 2020.</p><p>(16) For a list of these programs, see Canada, \"Funding--Culture, history and sport,\" online at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/funding.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/funding.html</url>.</p><p>(17) A point prominently made by Heritage Minister Joly (2017).</p><p>(18) However, the cornucopia of US programs that have emerged since the late 1990s actually started as a response to \"runaway\" film productions attracted by Canadian film production incentives. In such tit-for-tat situations, a more efficient outcome might be achieved if everyone stopped subsidizing.</p><p>(19) Canadian newspapers have lost 96 percent of their advertising revenues since 2008 (Wells 2017).</p><p>(20) The panel has proposed a mechanism administered by the Canada Revenue Agency that relies on objective criteria as far as possible for the receipt of these funds.</p><p>(21) Thus , as Dachis and Schwanen (2016,15), note, II Postino, Like Waterfor Chocolate, Shakespeare in Love, Priscilla Queen of the Desert and Fargo, which many associate culturally with Italy, Mexico, England, Australia, and the United States, respectively, were released by companies based in another country.</p><p>(22) It is certainly possible to screen these investors for their good business experience and good character and integrity, as one would screen applicants for a banking licence, for example.</p><p>(23) Heritage Canada considers whether the investment will be \"promoting the creation, dissemination and preservation of diverse Canadian content; cultural participation and engagement, fostering and strengthening connections among Canadians; and active citizenship and civic participation\" (Facey and Krane 2017,52). Note that, unlike FDI rules applying to other businesses, Heritage Canada requires undertakings by a foreign investor to be made in perpetuity (53).</p><p>(24) See, for example, a recent exchange in the House of Commons over the paying off of 68 employees by Quebec broadcaster TVA, which the company blamed on unfair competition from \"web giants,\" in which the Canadian heritage minister said that the loss of even just one job was a tragedy, \"particularly when it affects the culture and communications sector.\" Available online at <url normalizedValue=\"https://openparliament.ca/debates/2019/6/5/\">https://openparliament.ca/debates/2019/6/5/</url> pablo-rodriguez-1/.</p><p>(25) A useful overview of why cultural products are not like \"ordinary commodities,\" requiring special attention from competition authorities, copyright rules, and the role of the advertising market as discussed below is provided Grant and Wood (2004), Appendix B.</p><p>(26) Webopedia defines search engine optimization as \"a methodology of strategies, techniques and tactics used to increase the amount of visitors to a website by obtaining a high-ranking placement in the search results page of a search engine\"; see <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.webopedia.eom/TERM/S/SEO.html\">https://www.webopedia.eom/TERM/S/SEO.html</url>.</p><p>(27) As with current support programs such as tax credits, certain genres such as pornography would be made ineligible.</p><p>(28) Triple j brands itself \"the place for the best new music from around Australia &amp;c the world\"; see <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/\">https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/</url>.</p><p>Caption: Figure 1: Federal, Provincial, Territorial and Local Government Spending on Culture and Broadcasting Services</p><p>Caption: Figure 2: Gross Domestic Product in Information and Cultural Industries</p><p>Caption: Figure 3: Labour Productivity in Information and Cultural Industries</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-611741751</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 611741751</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1J-KSD1-JCBJ-K0FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"15289\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 C.D.

Now, he\u2019s huddling with regulators to explain why Facebook needs to be broken up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent weeks, Mr. Hughes has joined two leading antitrust academics, Scott Hemphill of New York University and Tim Wu of Columbia University, in meetings with the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and state attorneys general. In those meetings, the three have laid out a potential antitrust case against Facebook, Mr. Wu and Mr. Hemphill said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For nearly a decade, they argue, Facebook has made \u201cserial defensive acquisitions\u201d to protect its dominant position in the market for social networks, according to slides they have shown government officials. Scooping up nascent rivals, they assert, can allow Facebook to charge advertisers higher prices and can give users worse experience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Hughes\u2019s involvement stands out because few founders have gone on to argue for the dismantling of their company. As the scrutiny of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies has intensified in the last year, many of the complaints about them have come from competitors or academics.</p><p>On Wednesday, Facebook announced that the F.T.C. had started an antitrust investigation into the company. The Justice Department has also started a broad antitrust review of the technology industry, as have lawmakers. And on Thursday, some state attorneys general met with the Justice Department to discuss competition in the industry.</p><p>It is unclear just what role Mr. Hughes, who left Facebook more than a decade ago and has become increasingly critical of Facebook in public, is playing in the pitches to regulators. In the slide presentation, a \u201cWho We Are\u201d page lists Mr. Hughes as the third member of the group. The page concludes with the bullet point, \u201cSpeaking only for ourselves, not a client.\u201d</p><p>But Mr. Hughes could, for example, provide investigators with leads to current and former company employees and competitors to interview or subpoena. A partly redacted copy of the slides was provided to The New York Times, with names of the people to interview blacked out. Mr. Wu and Mr. Hemphill have shared the redacted version of the slides with some other antitrust experts. One of them, who asked not to be identified, sent it to The Times.</p><p>Neither Mr. Hemphill nor Mr. Wu would discuss Mr. Hughes\u2019s involvement, other than to confirm he attended the presentations.</p><p>\u201cHe has been an important contributor to thinking about these issues,\u201d Mr. Hemphill said.</p><p>Mr. Hughes declined to comment, as did Facebook.</p><p>Mr. Hughes, who made hundreds of millions of dollars from his time at Facebook, has become an outspoken critic of the company\u2019s market power and the need for the government to take action. In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html\">lengthy Op-Ed article for The Times</url> in May, he wrote, \u201cWe are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well-intentioned the leaders of these companies may be.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hughes went on to describe the power held by Facebook and its leader Mr. Zuckerberg, his former college roommate, as \u201cunprecedented.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is time to break up Facebook.\u201d</p><p>The narrative from the two academics and Mr. Hughes in their presentation is that Facebook, founded in 2004, succeeded in its earlier years by simply outdoing its competitors, like Myspace, by providing a superior social network including fewer ads and promises of protecting users\u2019 privacy.</p><p>But by 2010, Facebook was scrambling to adapt to the shift to smartphone computing and the rise of new social network services, like photo sharing. The company\u2019s response, the presentation says, was its program to buy upstart rivals. The biggest deals were for Instagram, the photo sharing service, for $1 billion in 2012, and WhatsApp, the messaging service, for $19 billion in 2014.</p><p>At a House antitrust subcommittee hearing last week, a Facebook executive, when asked to name its rivals, hesitated and did not offer a list. Mr. Wu, who also testified, said, \u201cFacebook can\u2019t name its competitors because they bought them.\u201d</p><p>But in his written testimony, the executive, Matt Perault, director of public policy at Facebook, listed an array of competitors, including Snapchat, Telegram, Twitter and YouTube. And he described major acquisitions of companies like WhatsApp and Instagram as \u201cinvestments in innovation,\u201d new services for consumers that Facebook strengthened and expanded with money and resources.</p><p>The theory in the presentation by the two academics and Mr. Hughes is that an acquisition strategy can be an illegal tactic to shield a monopoly from competition. An upstart company, they say, need not be a full-fledged competitor at the time of the purchase, merely a potential threat.</p><p>The antitrust precedents, they say, stretch back to Standard Oil, which was built with a string of corporate purchases over decades, before the government broke it up in 1911.</p><p>\u201cThere is a direct connection between the conduct and the remedy \u2014 undo the acquisition,\u201d Mr. Hemphill said in an interview.</p><p>The professors and Mr. Hughes are not alone in focusing on Facebook\u2019s company-buying campaign. In March, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, wrote to the F.T.C., urging the agency begin an investigation of Facebook.</p><p>His first suggested line of inquiry was the social network\u2019s acquisition campaign. \u201cIt is clear that allowing Facebook to purchase Instagram and WhatsApp has deprived users of critical competition,\u201d Mr. Cicilline wrote.</p><p>Whether the F.T.C. will pursue the company-buying line of investigation is uncertain. The agency\u2019s investigations, which can last months or years, are largely conducted in secret. A representative for the F.T.C. declined to comment.</p><p>But antitrust experts say it may be the most promising target of inquiry, focused on a handful of acquisitions rather than a broad review of the company\u2019s conduct in general.</p><p>\u201cIt is a plausible theory, and it has the elements of an antitrust case,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, a former senior antitrust official in the Justice Department.</p><p>But the key, Mr. Kimmelman said, would be assembling evidence to show that Facebook conducted an intentional campaign to buy companies regarded as future threats, even if they were fledgling start-ups at the time.

Chris Marangi, Gabelli Funds co-chief investment officer, joining us here in our 11.30 studios.  </p><p>      Chris, should we care about this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, yesterday was a real three-ring circus in Washington between the Kavanaugh hearings, the op-ed and these hearings.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  A normal day.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  A normal day. And this comes on the context of course of Trump going after Google on Twitter and Bernie Sanders introducing the Stop BEZOS Act. So big tech is a, one could say, under siege.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  But it has been for a while.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  It has been.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  I mean is there anything that kind of came out yesterday that really --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  No, I don't think so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  And I think the fact that Google didn't show up and had a little placard on their empty chair was indicative of what they think of these hearings. But I think ultimately, listen, radio was regulated this medium in 1934 --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  -- over the post-World War II era, lots of regulations in place to limit the voice of any particular broadcast television network owner. And we're just catching up now in the internet age.  </p><p>      And so there will be more regulation, more requirements on the part of the internet companies and that's going to have a cause associated with it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Why don't we celebrate in the company as successful as Amazon in this country? Why don't politicians celebrating this? This is a huge success story, the envy of most of the world.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  It is, but it's a big company with a lot of influence and those companies tend to be targeted by politicians. So, interestingly, obviously, that it comes from the left and, you know --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  And the right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  And the right, which is what's makes it interesting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Well, you know, you mentioned Google, you mentioned that little placard and how they felt about the hearings. Google shares were actually down really a percent ahead of the open today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  Facebook and Twitter were actually flat. Do you think that that's significant or is it just sort of noise?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  I think that's noise at this point. You know, currently, Google survived the privacy regulation regime in Europe pretty well. And I think the end game here is that the companies with scale like Google and Facebook and even Twitter are going to be the ones who were best able to put into systems to comply with whatever Washington wants. And they're going to be further entrenched by regulation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Chris, you help run Gabelli Funds, that's a lot of money. When you look at the tech sector right now, is there any reason why you wouldn't allocate capital to that sector based on a risk of regulation somewhere somehow in the future?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, listen, you know, I think it is just one element of the things that we look at. You know, we invest -- we've invested for many, many years, decades in the cable sector. And the biggest risk for the cable sector, the distribution industry has been always will be regulation. And that's just something that you have to digest and see if it's accounted for in the multiples.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABRAMOWICZ</emphasis>:  So right now, given the fact that you have a lot of big analysts saying things look a little hetty (ph) (INAUDIBLE) off the table, what's the biggest opportunity that you see right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes. So, listen, you know, the extended FANG, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft and Apple, are collectively 4.4 trillion, it's like 15% of the S&amp;P, they've accounted for about half of the gains in the S&amp;P so far this year.  </p><p>      You know, those companies I think in aggregate are probably a little bit ahead of themselves. Among them, there are probably better buys like, in my view, Google than say Amazon.  </p><p>      But, you know, beyond that, we have other areas that we look at. We like the cable sector. We think there's going to be consolidation amongst broadcast television networks.

And of course, Chris, to explain this with a value investment proposition of Mario Gabelli and your team, you've always been in media. How much of a value is Cable TV after the Fox, Disney, Comcast soap opera?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Good morning, Tom and Jonathan, great to be here. Yes, the Cable companies Comcast, Charter, amongst others are a bargain today, more of a bargain than they were before, let's say, a counter bit for Fox. These are good catch willing entities (ph) recurring cash or the recurring cash flow to shareholders and that's why we like them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Comcast did that shift from huge build out to use of cash. On the Bloomberg, their five-year dividend growth as a lofty 4.22 percent. I'm assuming they can sustain that, but can they actually deliver double-digit dividend growth as the cash flow that persistent?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes. The return on capital in the cash flow are growing substantially as the business make shifts from video where they're giving up 60 cents in every dollar to the content companies to broadband where they're keeping that money. And have a lot of pricing power (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  What's interesting here folks, as we were talking with Craig Moffett in MoffettNathanson with us, really important work on Comcast recent than Marangi is sort of on what's called the buy side which is he's actually making portfolio decisions in acquiring shares as well. If Comcast and Cable is cheap, what's rich in media?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well you point statistically to the same stocks obviously and there's been sort of saying anti-thing (ph) trade when the (INAUDIBLE) are strong. Some of the traditional media companies tend to be weak. I think that's starting to breakdown a little bit. But, you know, it doesn't mean that Google and Netflix and others don't have outstanding businesses. Netflix, in particularly just, you know, appears to trade at a -- with a minimal margin of safety.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Yes. It thought it was interesting last week, Chris, that the outperformance came from the old economy equities and the underperformance came from the technology stocks. And I just wonder whether that's one off weak or whether we're starting to a transitions where worldwide can build some confidence around what's happening in the global economy as Europe prepares to have stabilized China that appears to be shifting towards the easing then we have that great growth here in the United States in a second quarter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes, I think that's an interesting point, Jonathan. I think the big tech names were viewed as safe havens in some ways as growth elsewhere starting this. So, you know, I think as we see a little bit of stabilization, the trend to value should persist.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Chris, the trend to value has been a right difficult one to buy into --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  It's been a long time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  -- over the last year. And many of our listeners have heard that again and again and again over the last couple of years. Why is it different this time?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well we're hoping it's different this time. And, you know, in the end, we think that value will always went out. And, you know, kind of a -- the good place is to be with maybe a choppy (INAUDIBLE) environment but a stable economic environment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Does that leave financials, Chris?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  It should. You know, every time we watch the curve and what's happening with the funding in the curve, I think that's been a little bit of an issue but, yes, the financials again statistically look for a two-pair.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  It's something that's dominated psychology, is it dominated profitability? And I'm talking about the yield curve here, Chris. Has it dominated profitability because I didn't see it, will it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  No, I think, you know, the banks are able to make money if they're in a better regulatory situation than they have been a long time. They'll return a lot more capital to shareholders. So, you know, I think maybe we're overly focused on the shape of the curve.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK, we're overly focused on the shape of the curve, but it's determinant to some extend forward. What about the shape of nominal GDP? I mean, if this is -- if this GDP is good as it gets in an abs (ph) way, what abs (ph) in the Chris Marangi world, the revenues ab?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes. So, you know, we've been talking about actually margins for years. And, you know, margins just continue to go up as if we continue to defined companies -- continue to define ways to save money. Obviously, where they seem from earnings, the first two weeks has been increased cost, ample (ph) cost, steel, energy, labor freight (ph). And so we're starting to see some of those sciences inflation which may impact margins. But, you know, we could get into another gear where we see an increase in productivity again.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  Well Chris, at this conversation with Jeff Rosenberg of BlackRock on Friday and we kept asking this question, is this good as it gets and it may will be the highest rate of growth for any given quarter for this administration. But I think a bigger question, and this is something that Jeff was pushing ever at BlackRock, is whether we've broken out into a higher trend growth, the way from low twos (ph) and something close to the three. Do you have the confidence that we've done that, Chris?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  You know, we're bottom up guys and we look at individual companies and we have companies that we listen to on these earnings costs and, you know, they see, for the most part, pretty clear skies ahead. You know, absence some of these ample (ph) cost and absence some of the risk of trade wars. But the consumer seems to be in good shape. Housing is OK and, you know, globally, you know, seeing some pick up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>:  It's funny that we've just had a quarter of not 4 percent and I've heard so many people talking about where do we get our recession at some point back in the next year or early 2020. I've heard a lot of people discussed trade wars and then Carapello (ph) come out this morning raises fuller (ph) guidance. Fuller (ph) guidance raise in the quarter that was dominated by discussions about trade wars and tariffs. How do you reconcile these two things, Chris?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, you know, make farmers great again, I guess is the hat that I saw. And, you know, that certainly helps somebody agricultural companies. And, you know, the global demand is there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Jon, I think that's a really important insight.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Great to catch up with you, Chris, of Gabelli Funds, Co-Chief Investment Officer.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXS-GBV1-F15W-H181-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

And Chris, we were just talking about what's happening in Washington and how that's eating up all of the attention, sucking up all the oxygen there. As an investor, we know that when the president tend to get cornered, and it's not just this president, any president, they tend to look for something else, they look for distractions, they look for something to focus their energy on. Do you expect or anticipate unexpected headlines on trade on North Korea that could come out and change the scope of where we are headed?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, administration in turmoil is probably a headline you could've applied in any point in the last 18 months. And what we're focused on is two months from now. Today is September 6, November 6 of the elections in the U.S. So a lot of this is noise, it will focus on the election and I think the expectation at this point is that the Democrats will at least take the House, the Senate is up for grabs and historically divided government has been good for the markets. And so whether it's people inside the administration or other branches of government modulating the impulses of the executive, that's generally viewed positively by the market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  So as an investor, do you look for people within the administration and indeed the President himself to make the decisions that would be good for markets, for the business environment leading up to the midterms because that's where they want to keep the focus on a strong economy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes, that would be smart of the president. I think -- but I think the president will between now and Election Day probably appeal to his base and, yes, I would expect some headlines about trade and immigrations. Somebody -- but on issues on that election.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  But resolutions on those?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  I doubt that anything gets resolved. We have of course also the --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Right, thanks so much --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Go ahead Chris.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes, obviously -- you know, obviously there are other things going on in Washington was a bit of a three ring circus yesterday between the Kavanaugh hearing and the social media hearings.  </p><p>      So, you know, obviously we'll look to resolve the Kavanaugh hearings between now and Election Day or certainly the Senate is looking to do that. But beyond that, I think it's mostly noise.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Chris, thank you, Chris Marangi there of Gabelli funds, he stays with us.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  For Russia, it's sanctions, for Turkey obviously is what happens with monetary policy. Chris Marangi here with us from Gabelli, for Argentina it's what happens with the IMF. When we look at emerging markets, it seems like investors have been pretty careful about making sure they don't lump Turkey and Argentina with the rest of the EM's. For a country like China, where does it fit in? Is China even an E.M. at this point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes, I wouldn't consider it an E.M. Certainly, you know, given their size and their geopolitical influence, it creates its own weather. I mean, it is -- it has its own dynamic. It's certainly much different than Turkey and South Africa and Argentina as you mentioned. So, it's sort of its own thing. The financial sector is not as developed as the west and the rule of laws not as strong as in the west. It's not quite emerged yet, but it's its own asset class.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  And of course there's also the issue with the economy slowing down. Do you not invest in companies that have exposure to China because of that, or because for instance U.S. -- the trade war issues is going to impact those companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  It's certainly a factor. One of our themes is make it here, sell it there. So, one of our larger areas of investment historically has been in the aerospace sector. China is a big customer -- going to be the biggest customer for those companies. So -- but that is a favorite sector somewhat exempt from the tariff issue. But we look companies in China like Tencent which has some of its dynamics, industries that we like and we know that happened to be based in China and have Chinas then in market.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Let's bring Chris Marangi, co-CIO of Gabelli Funds here with me. And, of course, we've been looking very carefully at this. You look at mediate companies overall. When you look at Facebook, when you look at Twitter and they commit to focusing more on cleaning up everything, does that mean more resources spent on profiling, on monitoring. I mean, for Facebook, they have the cash to do that but for company like Twitter, that's not really something to have a lot of.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, the short answer is yes. I mean, putting this in historical context, 1930s you had radio regulated, post-World War II we had television regulated prohibition and owning a newspaper and a broadcast station to say market limit to a national reach equal time, all these things put in place to limit the voice of any particular station owner.  </p><p>      For us today, we have not caught up with the dominant media which is internet, which is social media. And so there's going to be some kind of regulation, I don't know what form that takes, probably enhancement in privacy and enhancement in transparency requirements, but that's going to cost money clearly.  </p><p>      We saw some indication of that in the second quarter results for Facebook when they basically tried to get ahead of this and they're going to spend more money, so that's a short term headwind to earnings growth but long term as you point it out it probably entrenches the large pipelines because they're the ones who have the scale to basically put this things (ph) in place.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right, what's the -- Chris, it's difficult at the moment as you say to see what kind of regulation they would face. But what's the worse kind of regulation that could be imposed on them. And do you really see a lot of these companies being proactive and trying to put something in place that feels better to the consumer before they get flopped with more regulation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes, clearly they are doing that, although interestingly Google did not show at that hearing and they have been targeted specifically by the President for other reasons. But, you know, again, in terms of what's the worse kind of regulation, there have been a number of ideas. One has been to actually make social media companies or all internet companies liable for the content that appears on their sites, so you're bringing the legal system in a kind of unknown costs associated with that into the equation and I don't know if that happens or not.  </p><p>      The tech companies don't have a lot of friends on the Republican side of the aisle at the moment which historically or they could really are -- had favored Democrats historically. We'll see what happens if there's a change in Congress.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right, Chris, thank you so much Chris Marangi there of Gabelli Funds.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  It is now time for single best chart and we are joined of course once again by Chris Marangi, Gabelli Funds co-CIO. And Chris, I pulled up this chart here that shows Citigroup's news implied sentiment indicator which is another way of tracking sentiment on U.S. stocks. And the bars here show, the red bars in particular that there's a lot more bearishness in equities about equities, at least as cited by Bloomberg news stories, while the S&amp;P 500 in white continues moves higher.  </p><p>Citigroup's not the only one that's been sounding the alarm over recent gains in the U.S. stocks. Goldman Sachs do the same, Stifel Nicolaus also made a point out of the Fed raises rates two more times, it could trigger an equity bear market. What do you make of all of this? What do you make of this that people are now piling in on this idea that we're at a tipping point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes, the most hated bull market in history, the lowest bull market in history and we're the second-largest economic expansion on record. And I don't see any reason that won't be the longest. We need to make it to June of 2019 to be the longest and from the bottom up perspective, you know, industrial demand still reasonably strong, consumers in good shape.  </p><p>      You know, we've talked for years and years about green shoots as signs of recovery. Now we're going to talk a little bit about brown leaves and some of the things that could tip us into recession and end this bull market. And those are things like labor market tightening, higher import costs, steel, oil, freight. We're seeing some of that but nothing that worries me too much at the moment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  So if you're putting new money to work right now, where would you put it in the U.S. market? And you probably don't want to go into big tech which you've seen in the line sure of the gains in U.S. stocks overall. Where do you go now for that turning point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Yes, I mean, look, so I think we're bottom up investors. We're not allocating by sector, we're looking company by company and there's still companies within tech, a category which is going to change this month by the way where there's value. We're still finding some bargains.  </p><p>      You know, I think in general the level of marginal safety of the market is narrow certainly than it's been in a couple of years, but M&amp;A is still strong. You're still seeing some strength in some of the industrial companies and there are certain sectors that have to left behind to a degree like for example banking and some of the consumer staples names and even some media names which have been out of favor. Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Chris, we're late cycle in the U.S. at the same time, these tax cuts will come to an end. What is the likelihood of recession in the U.S. in the next 18 months?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, we're certainly going to have another recession in the U.S., again, the question is what's the timing. Again, I don't see anything today from a bottom up perspective which would lead me to believe that it's going to be in the next 18 months, but it will come and --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Not even a trade war?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, certainly the trade war and the political situation spinning out of control are sort of the wildcards. But, you know, I think this expansion in the old-fashioned way with the cycle of rate tightening which, you know, we seem to be on track for.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Well, the Fed do -- I'm sorry, go ahead Francine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Thanks Scarlet, will the Fed do everything it can not to invert the yield curve?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  I'm not sure if that's totally within their power. They face a lot of external forces which are flattening the yield curve. And, you know, obviously everybody talks about the predictive power of the yield curve, but it's not necessary positive so -- but certainly the Fed is aware of that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Francine, I'm sorry for jumping in on you. I'm just so excited to ask Chris. What are you doing then with your funds? How are you positioning yourself right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, we're -- we try to be more or less fully invested and we are at the moment. We're looking for good companies trading and discuss to their private market or intrinsic value where something we think ago right for the moment next two years to three years whether it's a change in a regulation, a change in management, and maybe industry consolidation. So we're certainly seeing lots of various of consolidation media among them as well as some of the consumer names. So, again, we're finding ideas.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  What's the one thing that you think you can do or won't do once we get the midterm elections out of the way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARANGI</emphasis>:  Well, I think we're more or less ignoring the midterm elections in terms of the way we're positioning the portfolios. You know, interestingly I think post the midterms we'll start to focus on 2020 and we'll see what candidates are getting traction in Iowa and, you know, the market will notice if somebody like a Senator Warren or Senator Sanders looks to be the nominee and we'll obviously we'll look and see if somebody's going to challenge Trump on the Republican side.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right, Chris, thank you so much. It's been fun to come back Chris Marangi there of Gabelli Funds.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6W-CCH1-JDPT-T0C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LISA ABRAMOWICZ, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Let's ask someone else.  Chris Marangi,  Gabelli Funds co-chief investment officer, joining us here in our 11.30  studios.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chris, should we care about this?</p><p>CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, GABELLI FUNDS:  Well, yesterday  was a real three-ring circus in Washington between the Kavanaugh hearings,  the op-ed and these hearings.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  A normal day.</p><p>MARANGI:  A normal day.  And this comes on the context of course of Trump  going after Google on Twitter and Bernie Sanders introducing the Stop BEZOS  Act.  So big tech is a, one could say, under siege.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  But it has been for a while.</p><p>MARANGI:  It has been.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  I mean is there anything that kind of came out yesterday that  really --</p><p>MARANGI:  No, I don't think so.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  OK.</p><p>MARANGI:  And I think the fact that Google didn't show up and had a little  placard on their empty chair was indicative of what they think of these  hearings.  But I think ultimately, listen, radio was regulated this medium  in 1934 --</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>MARANGI:  -- over the post-World War II era, lots of regulations in place  to limit the voice of any particular broadcast television network owner.   And we're just catching up now in the internet age.</p><p>And so there will be more regulation, more requirements on the part of the  internet companies and that's going to have a cause associated with it.</p><p>FERRO:  Why don't we celebrate in the company as successful as Amazon in  this country?  Why don't politicians celebrating this?  This is a huge  success story, the envy of most of the world.</p><p>MARANGI:  It is, but it's a big company with a lot of influence and those  companies tend to be targeted by politicians.  So, interestingly,  obviously, that it comes from the left and, you know --</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  And the right.</p><p>MARANGI:  And the right, which is what's makes it interesting.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Well, you know, you mentioned Google, you mentioned that  little placard and how they felt about the hearings.  Google shares were  actually down really a percent ahead of the open today.</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  Facebook and Twitter were actually flat.  Do you think that  that's significant or is it just sort of noise?</p><p>MARANGI:  I think that's noise at this point.  You know, currently, Google  survived the privacy regulation regime in Europe pretty well.  And I think  the end game here is that the companies with scale like Google and Facebook  and even Twitter are going to be the ones who were best able to put into  systems to comply with whatever Washington wants.  And they're going to be  further entrenched by regulation.</p><p>FERRO:  Chris, you help run Gabelli Funds, that's a lot of money.  When you  look at the tech sector right now, is there any reason why you wouldn't  allocate capital to that sector based on a risk of regulation somewhere  somehow in the future?</p><p>MARANGI:  Well, listen, you know, I think it is just one element of the  things that we look at.  You know, we invest -- we've invested for many,  many years, decades in the cable sector.  And the biggest risk for the  cable sector, the distribution industry has been always will be regulation.   And that's just something that you have to digest and see if it's accounted  for in the multiples.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ:  So right now, given the fact that you have a lot of big  analysts saying things look a little hetty (ph) (INAUDIBLE) off the table,  what's the biggest opportunity that you see right now?</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes.  So, listen, you know, the extended FANG, Facebook, Amazon,  Netflix, Google, Microsoft and Apple, are collectively 4.4 trillion, it's  like 15% of the S&amp;P, they've accounted for about half of the gains in the  S&amp;P so far this year.</p><p>You know, those companies I think in aggregate are probably a little bit  ahead of themselves.  Among them, there are probably better buys like, in  my view, Google than say Amazon.</p><p>But, you know, beyond that, we have other areas that we look at.  We like  the cable sector.  We think there's going to be consolidation amongst  broadcast television networks.  That's an interesting area amongst others.</p><p>FERRO:  Chris Marangi, great to catch up with you today.</p><p>MARANGI:  Thank you.</p><p>FERRO:  Thanks for dropping by in the studio.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LISA ABRAMOWICZ, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Let's ask someone else. Chris Marangi, Gabelli Funds co-chief investment officer, joining us here in our 11.30 studios.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chris, should we care about this?</p><p>CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, GABELLI FUNDS: Well, yesterday was a real three-ring circus in Washington between the Kavanaugh hearings, the op-ed and these hearings.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: A normal day.</p><p>MARANGI: A normal day. And this comes on the context of course of Trump going after Google on Twitter and Bernie Sanders introducing the Stop BEZOS Act. So big tech is a, one could say, under siege.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: But it has been for a while.</p><p>MARANGI: It has been.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: I mean is there anything that kind of came out yesterday that really --</p><p>MARANGI: No, I don't think so.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: OK.</p><p>MARANGI: And I think the fact that Google didn't show up and had a little placard on their empty chair was indicative of what they think of these hearings. But I think ultimately, listen, radio was regulated this medium in 1934 --</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>MARANGI: -- over the post-World War II era, lots of regulations in place to limit the voice of any particular broadcast television network owner. And we're just catching up now in the internet age.</p><p>And so there will be more regulation, more requirements on the part of the internet companies and that's going to have a cause associated with it.</p><p>FERRO: Why don't we celebrate in the company as successful as Amazon in this country? Why don't politicians celebrating this? This is a huge success story, the envy of most of the world.</p><p>MARANGI: It is, but it's a big company with a lot of influence and those companies tend to be targeted by politicians. So, interestingly, obviously, that it comes from the left and, you know --</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: And the right.</p><p>MARANGI: And the right, which is what's makes it interesting.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Well, you know, you mentioned Google, you mentioned that little placard and how they felt about the hearings. Google shares were actually down really a percent ahead of the open today.</p><p>MARANGI: Yes.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: Facebook and Twitter were actually flat. Do you think that that's significant or is it just sort of noise?</p><p>MARANGI: I think that's noise at this point. You know, currently, Google survived the privacy regulation regime in Europe pretty well. And I think the end game here is that the companies with scale like Google and Facebook and even Twitter are going to be the ones who were best able to put into systems to comply with whatever Washington wants. And they're going to be further entrenched by regulation.</p><p>FERRO: Chris, you help run Gabelli Funds, that's a lot of money. When you look at the tech sector right now, is there any reason why you wouldn't allocate capital to that sector based on a risk of regulation somewhere somehow in the future?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, listen, you know, I think it is just one element of the things that we look at. You know, we invest -- we've invested for many, many years, decades in the cable sector. And the biggest risk for the cable sector, the distribution industry has been always will be regulation. And that's just something that you have to digest and see if it's accounted for in the multiples.</p><p>ABRAMOWICZ: So right now, given the fact that you have a lot of big analysts saying things look a little hetty (ph) (INAUDIBLE) off the table, what's the biggest opportunity that you see right now?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. So, listen, you know, the extended FANG, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft and Apple, are collectively 4.4 trillion, it's like 15% of the S&amp;P, they've accounted for about half of the gains in the S&amp;P so far this year.</p><p>You know, those companies I think in aggregate are probably a little bit ahead of themselves. Among them, there are probably better buys like, in my view, Google than say Amazon.</p><p>But, you know, beyond that, we have other areas that we look at. We like the cable sector. We think there's going to be consolidation amongst broadcast television networks. That's an interesting area amongst others.</p><p>FERRO: Chris Marangi, great to catch up with you today.</p><p>MARANGI: Thank you.</p><p>FERRO: Thanks for dropping by in the studio.

And this comes on the context of course of Trump  going after Google on Twitter and Bernie Sanders introducing the Stop BEZOS  Act.  So big tech is a, one could say, under siege.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  But it has been for a while.</p><p> MARANGI:  It has been.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  I mean is there anything that kind of came out yesterday that  really --</p><p> MARANGI:  No, I don't think so.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  OK.</p><p> MARANGI:  And I think the fact that Google didn't show up and had a little  placard on their empty chair was indicative of what they think of these  hearings.

And we're just catching up now in the internet age.</p><p> And so there will be more regulation, more requirements on the part of the  internet companies and that's going to have a cause associated with it.</p><p> FERRO:  Why don't we celebrate in the company as successful as Amazon in  this country?  Why don't politicians celebrating this?  This is a huge  success story, the envy of most of the world.</p><p> MARANGI:  It is, but it's a big company with a lot of influence and those  companies tend to be targeted by politicians.  So, interestingly,  obviously, that it comes from the left and, you know --</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  And the right.</p><p> MARANGI:  And the right, which is what's makes it interesting.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Well, you know, you mentioned Google, you mentioned that  little placard and how they felt about the hearings.  Google shares were  actually down really a percent ahead of the open today.</p><p> MARANGI:  Yes.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  Facebook and Twitter were actually flat.  Do you think that  that's significant or is it just sort of noise?</p><p> MARANGI:  I think that's noise at this point.  You know, currently, Google  survived the privacy regulation regime in Europe pretty well.  And I think  the end game here is that the companies with scale like Google and Facebook  and even Twitter are going to be the ones who were best able to put into  systems to comply with whatever Washington wants.  And they're going to be  further entrenched by regulation.</p><p> FERRO:  Chris, you help run Gabelli Funds, that's a lot of money.  When you  look at the tech sector right now, is there any reason why you wouldn't  allocate capital to that sector based on a risk of regulation somewhere  somehow in the future?</p><p> MARANGI:  Well, listen, you know, I think it is just one element of the  things that we look at.  You know, we invest -- we've invested for many,  many years, decades in the cable sector.  And the biggest risk for the  cable sector, the distribution industry has been always will be regulation.   And that's just something that you have to digest and see if it's accounted  for in the multiples.</p><p> ABRAMOWICZ:  So right now, given the fact that you have a lot of big  analysts saying things look a little hetty (ph) (INAUDIBLE) off the table,  what's the biggest opportunity that you see right now?</p><p> MARANGI:  Yes.  So, listen, you know, the extended FANG, Facebook, Amazon,  Netflix, Google, Microsoft and Apple, are collectively 4.4 trillion, it's  like 15% of the S&amp;P, they've accounted for about half of the gains in the  S&amp;P so far this year.</p><p> You know, those companies I think in aggregate are probably a little bit  ahead of themselves.  Among them, there are probably better buys like, in  my view, Google than say Amazon.</p><p> But, you know, beyond that, we have other areas that we look at.  We like  the cable sector.  We think there's going to be consolidation amongst  broadcast television networks.  That's an interesting area amongst others.</p><p> FERRO:  Chris Marangi, great to catch up with you today.</p><p> MARANGI:  Thank you.</p><p> FERRO:  Thanks for dropping by in the studio.

And of course, Chris, to explain this with a value investment proposition of Mario Gabelli and your team, you've always been in media. How much of a value is Cable TV after the Fox, Disney, Comcast soap opera?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS: Good morning, Tom and Jonathan, great to be here. Yes, the Cable companies Comcast, Charter, amongst others are a bargain today, more of a bargain than they were before, let's say, a counter bit for Fox. These are good catch willing entities (ph) recurring cash or the recurring cash flow to shareholders and that's why we like them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KEENE: Comcast did that shift from huge build out to use of cash. On the Bloomberg, their five-year dividend growth as a lofty 4.22 percent. I'm assuming they can sustain that, but can they actually deliver double-digit dividend growth as the cash flow that persistent?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. The return on capital in the cash flow are growing substantially as the business make shifts from video where they're giving up 60 cents in every dollar to the content companies to broadband where they're keeping that money. And have a lot of pricing power (ph).</p><p>KEENE: What's interesting here folks, as we were talking with Craig Moffett in MoffettNathanson with us, really important work on Comcast recent than Marangi is sort of on what's called the buy side which is he's actually making portfolio decisions in acquiring shares as well. If Comcast and Cable is cheap, what's rich in media?</p><p>MARANGI: Well you point statistically to the same stocks obviously and there's been sort of saying anti-thing (ph) trade when the (INAUDIBLE) are strong. Some of the traditional media companies tend to be weak. I think that's starting to breakdown a little bit. But, you know, it doesn't mean that Google and Netflix and others don't have outstanding businesses. Netflix, in particularly just, you know, appears to trade at a -- with a minimal margin of safety.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes. It thought it was interesting last week, Chris, that the outperformance came from the old economy equities and the underperformance came from the technology stocks. And I just wonder whether that's one off weak or whether we're starting to a transitions where worldwide can build some confidence around what's happening in the global economy as Europe prepares to have stabilized China that appears to be shifting towards the easing then we have that great growth here in the United States in a second quarter.</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, I think that's an interesting point, Jonathan. I think the big tech names were viewed as safe havens in some ways as growth elsewhere starting this. So, you know, I think as we see a little bit of stabilization, the trend to value should persist.</p><p>FERRO: Chris, the trend to value has been a right difficult one to buy into --</p><p>MARANGI: It's been a long time.</p><p>FERRO: -- over the last year. And many of our listeners have heard that again and again and again over the last couple of years. Why is it different this time?</p><p>MARANGI: Well we're hoping it's different this time. And, you know, in the end, we think that value will always went out. And, you know, kind of a -- the good place is to be with maybe a choppy (INAUDIBLE) environment but a stable economic environment.</p><p>FERRO: Does that leave financials, Chris?</p><p>MARANGI: It should. You know, every time we watch the curve and what's happening with the funding in the curve, I think that's been a little bit of an issue but, yes, the financials again statistically look for a two- pair.</p><p>FERRO: It's something that's dominated psychology, is it dominated profitability? And I'm talking about the yield curve here, Chris. Has it dominated profitability because I didn't see it, will it?</p><p>MARANGI: No, I think, you know, the banks are able to make money if they're in a better regulatory situation than they have been a long time. They'll return a lot more capital to shareholders. So, you know, I think maybe we're overly focused on the shape of the curve.</p><p>KEENE: OK, we're overly focused on the shape of the curve, but it's determinant to some extend forward. What about the shape of nominal GDP? I mean, if this is -- if this GDP is good as it gets in an abs (ph) way, what abs (ph) in the Chris Marangi world, the revenues ab?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. So, you know, we've been talking about actually margins for years. And, you know, margins just continue to go up as if we continue to defined companies -- continue to define ways to save money. Obviously, where they seem from earnings, the first two weeks has been increased cost, ample (ph) cost, steel, energy, labor freight (ph). And so we're starting to see some of those sciences inflation which may impact margins. But, you know, we could get into another gear where we see an increase in productivity again.</p><p>FERRO: Well Chris, at this conversation with Jeff Rosenberg of BlackRock on Friday and we kept asking this question, is this good as it gets and it may will be the highest rate of growth for any given quarter for this administration. But I think a bigger question, and this is something that Jeff was pushing ever at BlackRock, is whether we've broken out into a higher trend growth, the way from low twos (ph) and something close to the three. Do you have the confidence that we've done that, Chris?</p><p>MARANGI: You know, we're bottom up guys and we look at individual companies and we have companies that we listen to on these earnings costs and, you know, they see, for the most part, pretty clear skies ahead. You know, absence some of these ample (ph) cost and absence some of the risk of trade wars. But the consumer seems to be in good shape. Housing is OK and, you know, globally, you know, seeing some pick up.</p><p>FERRO: It's funny that we've just had a quarter of not 4 percent and I've heard so many people talking about where do we get our recession at some point back in the next year or early 2020. I've heard a lot of people discussed trade wars and then Carapello (ph) come out this morning raises fuller (ph) guidance. Fuller (ph) guidance raise in the quarter that was dominated by discussions about trade wars and tariffs. How do you reconcile these two things, Chris?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, you know, make farmers great again, I guess is the hat that I saw. And, you know, that certainly helps somebody agricultural companies. And, you know, the global demand is there.</p><p>KEENE: Jon, I think that's a really important insight.</p><p>MARANGI: Great to catch up with you, Chris, of Gabelli Funds, Co-Chief Investment Officer.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

You know, every time we watch the curve and what's  happening with the funding in the curve, I think that's been a little bit  of an issue but, yes, the financials again statistically look for a two- pair.</p><p> FERRO:  It's something that's dominated psychology, is it dominated  profitability?  And I'm talking about the yield curve here, Chris.  Has it  dominated profitability because I didn't see it, will it?</p><p> MARANGI:  No, I think, you know, the banks are able to make money if  they're in a better regulatory situation than they have been a long time.   They'll return a lot more capital to shareholders.  So, you know, I think  maybe we're overly focused on the shape of the curve.</p><p> KEENE:  OK, we're overly focused on the shape of the curve, but it's  determinant to some extend forward.  What about the shape of nominal GDP?   I mean, if this is -- if this GDP is good as it gets in an abs (ph) way,  what abs (ph) in the Chris Marangi world, the revenues ab?</p><p> MARANGI:  Yes.  So, you know, we've been talking about actually margins for  years.  And, you know, margins just continue to go up as if we continue to  defined companies -- continue to define ways to save money.  Obviously,  where they seem from earnings, the first two weeks has been increased cost,  ample (ph) cost, steel, energy, labor freight (ph).  And so we're starting  to see some of those sciences inflation which may impact margins.  But, you  know, we could get into another gear where we see an increase in  productivity again.</p><p> FERRO:  Well Chris, at this conversation with Jeff Rosenberg of BlackRock  on Friday and we kept asking this question, is this good as it gets and it  may will be the highest rate of growth for any given quarter for this  administration.  But I think a bigger question, and this is something that  Jeff was pushing ever at BlackRock, is whether we've broken out into a  higher trend growth, the way from low twos (ph) and something close to the  three.  Do you have the confidence that we've done that, Chris?</p><p> MARANGI:  You know, we're bottom up guys and we look at individual  companies and we have companies that we listen to on these earnings costs  and, you know, they see, for the most part, pretty clear skies ahead.  You  know, absence some of these ample (ph) cost and absence some of the risk of  trade wars.  But the consumer seems to be in good shape.  Housing is OK  and, you know, globally, you know, seeing some pick up.</p><p> FERRO:  It's funny that we've just had a quarter of not 4 percent and I've  heard so many people talking about where do we get our recession at some  point back in the next year or early 2020.  I've heard a lot of people  discussed trade wars and then Carapello (ph) come out this morning raises  fuller (ph) guidance.  Fuller (ph) guidance raise in the quarter that was  dominated by discussions about trade wars and tariffs.  How do you  reconcile these two things, Chris?</p><p> MARANGI:  Well, you know, make farmers great again, I guess is the hat that  I saw.  And, you know, that certainly helps somebody agricultural  companies.  And, you know, the global demand is there.</p><p> KEENE:  Jon, I think that's a really important insight.</p><p> MARANGI:  Great to catch up with you, Chris, of Gabelli Funds, Co-Chief  Investment Officer.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

And of course, Chris, to explain this with a value investment proposition of Mario Gabelli and your team, you've always been in media. How much of a value is Cable TV after the Fox, Disney, Comcast soap opera?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS: Good morning, Tom and Jonathan, great to be here. Yes, the Cable companies Comcast, Charter, amongst others are a bargain today, more of a bargain than they were before, let's say, a counter bit for Fox. These are good catch willing entities (ph) recurring cash or the recurring cash flow to shareholders and that's why we like them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KEENE: Comcast did that shift from huge build out to use of cash. On the Bloomberg, their five-year dividend growth as a lofty 4.22 percent. I'm assuming they can sustain that, but can they actually deliver double-digit dividend growth as the cash flow that persistent?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes. The return on capital in the cash flow are growing substantially as the business make shifts from video where they're giving up 60 cents in every dollar to the content companies to broadband where they're keeping that money. And have a lot of pricing power (ph).</p><p>KEENE: What's interesting here folks, as we were talking with Craig Moffett in MoffettNathanson with us, really important work on Comcast recent than Marangi is sort of on what's called the buy side which is he's actually making portfolio decisions in acquiring shares as well. If Comcast and Cable is cheap, what's rich in media?</p><p>MARANGI: Well you point statistically to the same stocks obviously and there's been sort of saying anti-thing (ph) trade when the (INAUDIBLE) are strong. Some of the traditional media companies tend to be weak. I think that's starting to breakdown a little bit. But, you know, it doesn't mean that Google and Netflix and others don't have outstanding businesses. Netflix, in particularly just, you know, appears to trade at a -- with a minimal margin of safety.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes. It thought it was interesting last week, Chris, that the outperformance came from the old economy equities and the underperformance came from the technology stocks. And I just wonder whether that's one off weak or whether we're starting to a transitions where worldwide can build some confidence around what's happening in the global economy as Europe prepares to have stabilized China that appears to be shifting towards the easing then we have that great growth here in the United States in a second quarter.</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, I think that's an interesting point, Jonathan. I think the big tech names were viewed as safe havens in some ways as growth elsewhere starting this. So, you know, I think as we see a little bit of stabilization, the trend to value should persist.</p><p>FERRO: Chris, the trend to value has been a right difficult one to buy into --</p><p>MARANGI: It's been a long time.</p><p>FERRO: -- over the last year. And many of our listeners have heard that again and again and again over the last couple of years. Why is it different this time?</p><p>MARANGI: Well we're hoping it's different this time. And, you know, in the end, we think that value will always went out. And, you know, kind of a -- the good place is to be with maybe a choppy (INAUDIBLE) environment but a stable economic environment.</p><p>FERRO: Does that leave financials, Chris?</p><p>MARANGI: It should. You know, every time we watch the curve and what's happening with the funding in the curve, I think that's been a little bit of an issue but, yes, the financials again statistically look for a two- pair.</p><p>FERRO: It's something that's dominated psychology, is it dominated profitability?

And of course,  Chris, to explain this with a value investment proposition of Mario Gabelli  and your team, you've always been in media.  How much of a value is Cable  TV after the Fox, Disney, Comcast soap opera?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS:  Good morning, Tom and Jonathan,  great to be here.  Yes, the Cable companies Comcast, Charter, amongst  others are a bargain today, more of a bargain than they were before, let's  say, a counter bit for Fox.  These are good catch willing entities (ph)  recurring cash or the recurring cash flow to shareholders and that's why we  like them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KEENE:  Comcast did that shift from huge build out to use of cash.  On the  Bloomberg, their five-year dividend growth as a lofty 4.22 percent.  I'm  assuming they can sustain that, but can they actually deliver double-digit  dividend growth as the cash flow that persistent?</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes.  The return on capital in the cash flow are growing  substantially as the business make shifts from video where they're giving  up 60 cents in every dollar to the content companies to broadband where  they're keeping that money.  And have a lot of pricing power (ph).</p><p>KEENE:  What's interesting here folks, as we were talking with Craig  Moffett in MoffettNathanson with us, really important work on Comcast  recent than Marangi is sort of on what's called the buy side which is he's  actually making portfolio decisions in acquiring shares as well.  If  Comcast and Cable is cheap, what's rich in media?</p><p>MARANGI:  Well you point statistically to the same stocks obviously and  there's been sort of saying anti-thing (ph) trade when the (INAUDIBLE) are  strong.  Some of the traditional media companies tend to be weak.  I think  that's starting to breakdown a little bit.  But, you know, it doesn't mean  that Google and Netflix and others don't have outstanding businesses.   Netflix, in particularly just, you know, appears to trade at a -- with a  minimal margin of safety.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Yes.  It thought it was interesting last  week, Chris, that the outperformance came from the old economy equities and  the underperformance came from the technology stocks.  And I just wonder  whether that's one off weak or whether we're starting to a transitions  where worldwide can build some confidence around what's happening in the  global economy as Europe prepares to have stabilized China that appears to  be shifting towards the easing then we have that great growth here in the  United States in a second quarter.</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes, I think that's an interesting point, Jonathan.  I think the  big tech names were viewed as safe havens in some ways as growth elsewhere  starting this.  So, you know, I think as we see a little bit of  stabilization, the trend to value should persist.</p><p>FERRO:  Chris, the trend to value has been a right difficult one to buy  into --</p><p>MARANGI:  It's been a long time.</p><p>FERRO:  -- over the last year.  And many of our listeners have heard that  again and again and again over the last couple of years.  Why is it  different this time?</p><p>MARANGI:  Well we're hoping it's different this time.  And, you know, in  the end, we think that value will always went out.  And, you know, kind of  a -- the good place is to be with maybe a choppy (INAUDIBLE) environment  but a stable economic environment.</p><p>FERRO:  Does that leave financials, Chris?</p><p>MARANGI:  It should.  You know, every time we watch the curve and what's  happening with the funding in the curve, I think that's been a little bit  of an issue but, yes, the financials again statistically look for a two- pair.</p><p>FERRO:  It's something that's dominated psychology, is it dominated  profitability?  And I'm talking about the yield curve here, Chris.  Has it  dominated profitability because I didn't see it, will it?</p><p>MARANGI:  No, I think, you know, the banks are able to make money if  they're in a better regulatory situation than they have been a long time.   They'll return a lot more capital to shareholders.  So, you know, I think  maybe we're overly focused on the shape of the curve.</p><p>KEENE:  OK, we're overly focused on the shape of the curve, but it's  determinant to some extend forward.  What about the shape of nominal GDP?   I mean, if this is -- if this GDP is good as it gets in an abs (ph) way,  what abs (ph) in the Chris Marangi world, the revenues ab?</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes.  So, you know, we've been talking about actually margins for  years.  And, you know, margins just continue to go up as if we continue to  defined companies -- continue to define ways to save money.  Obviously,  where they seem from earnings, the first two weeks has been increased cost,  ample (ph) cost, steel, energy, labor freight (ph).  And so we're starting  to see some of those sciences inflation which may impact margins.  But, you  know, we could get into another gear where we see an increase in  productivity again.</p><p>FERRO:  Well Chris, at this conversation with Jeff Rosenberg of BlackRock  on Friday and we kept asking this question, is this good as it gets and it  may will be the highest rate of growth for any given quarter for this  administration.  But I think a bigger question, and this is something that  Jeff was pushing ever at BlackRock, is whether we've broken out into a  higher trend growth, the way from low twos (ph) and something close to the  three.  Do you have the confidence that we've done that, Chris?</p><p>MARANGI:  You know, we're bottom up guys and we look at individual  companies and we have companies that we listen to on these earnings costs  and, you know, they see, for the most part, pretty clear skies ahead.  You  know, absence some of these ample (ph) cost and absence some of the risk of  trade wars.  But the consumer seems to be in good shape.  Housing is OK  and, you know, globally, you know, seeing some pick up.</p><p>FERRO:  It's funny that we've just had a quarter of not 4 percent and I've  heard so many people talking about where do we get our recession at some  point back in the next year or early 2020.  I've heard a lot of people  discussed trade wars and then Carapello (ph) come out this morning raises  fuller (ph) guidance.  Fuller (ph) guidance raise in the quarter that was  dominated by discussions about trade wars and tariffs.  How do you  reconcile these two things, Chris?</p><p>MARANGI:  Well, you know, make farmers great again, I guess is the hat that  I saw.  And, you know, that certainly helps somebody agricultural  companies.  And, you know, the global demand is there.</p><p>KEENE:  Jon, I think that's a really important insight.</p><p>MARANGI:  Great to catch up with you, Chris, of Gabelli Funds, Co-Chief  Investment Officer.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Now, joining us here in New York is Chris  Marangi, he is Gabelli Funds Co-CIO.  And Chris, we were just talking about  what's happening in Washington and how that's eating up all of the  attention, sucking up all the oxygen there.  As an investor, we know that  when the president tend to get cornered, and it's not just this president,  any president, they tend to look for something else, they look for  distractions, they look for something to focus their energy on.  Do you  expect or anticipate unexpected headlines on trade on North Korea that  could come out and change the scope of where we are headed?</p><p>CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS:  Well, administration in turmoil is  probably a headline you could've applied in any point in the last 18  months.  And what we're focused on is two months from now.  Today is  September 6, November 6 of the elections in the U.S.  So a lot of this is  noise, it will focus on the election and I think the expectation at this  point is that the Democrats will at least take the House, the Senate is up  for grabs and historically divided government has been good for the  markets.  And so whether it's people inside the administration or other  branches of government modulating the impulses of the executive, that's  generally viewed positively by the market.</p><p>FU:  So as an investor, do you look for people within the administration  and indeed the President himself to make the decisions that would be good  for markets, for the business environment leading up to the midterms  because that's where they want to keep the focus on a strong economy?</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes, that would be smart of the president.  I think -- but I  think the president will between now and Election Day probably appeal to  his base and, yes, I would expect some headlines about trade and  immigrations.  Somebody -- but on issues on that election.</p><p>FU:  But resolutions on those?</p><p>MARANGI:  I doubt that anything gets resolved.  We have of course also the  --</p><p>FU:  Right, thanks so much --</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Go ahead Chris.</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes, obviously -- you know, obviously there are other things  going on in Washington was a bit of a three ring circus yesterday between  the Kavanaugh hearing and the social media hearings.</p><p>So, you know, obviously we'll look to resolve the Kavanaugh hearings  between now and Election Day or certainly the Senate is looking to do that.   But beyond that, I think it's mostly noise.</p><p>LACQUA:  Chris, thank you, Chris Marangi there of Gabelli funds, he stays  with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU:  For Russia, it's sanctions, for Turkey obviously is what happens with  monetary policy.  Chris Marangi here with us from Gabelli, for Argentina  it's what happens with the IMF.  When we look at emerging markets, it seems  like investors have been pretty careful about making sure they don't lump  Turkey and Argentina with the rest of the EM's.  For a country like China,  where does it fit in?  Is China even an E.M. at this point?</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes, I wouldn't consider it an E.M.  Certainly, you know, given  their size and their geopolitical influence, it creates its own weather.  I  mean, it is -- it has its own dynamic.  It's certainly much different than  Turkey and South Africa and Argentina as you mentioned.  So, it's sort of  its own thing.  The financial sector is not as developed as the west and  the rule of laws not as strong as in the west.  It's not quite emerged yet,  but it's its own asset class.</p><p>FU:  And of course there's also the issue with the economy slowing down.   Do you not invest in companies that have exposure to China because of that,  or because for instance U.S. -- the trade war issues is going to impact  those companies?</p><p>MARANGI:  It's certainly a factor.  One of our themes is make it here, sell  it there.  So, one of our larger areas of investment historically has been  in the aerospace sector.  China is a big customer -- going to be the  biggest customer for those companies.  So -- but that is a favorite sector  somewhat exempt from the tariff issue.  But we look companies in China like  Tencent which has some of its dynamics, industries that we like and we know  that happened to be based in China and have Chinas then in market.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU:  Let's bring Chris Marangi, co-CIO of Gabelli Funds here with me.  And,  of course, we've been looking very carefully at this.  You look at mediate  companies overall.  When you look at Facebook, when you look at Twitter and  they commit to focusing more on cleaning up everything, does that mean more  resources spent on profiling, on monitoring.  I mean, for Facebook, they  have the cash to do that but for company like Twitter, that's not really  something to have a lot of.</p><p>MARANGI:  Well, the short answer is yes.  I mean, putting this in  historical context, 1930s you had radio regulated, post-World War II we had  television regulated prohibition and owning a newspaper and a broadcast  station to say market limit to a national reach equal time, all these  things put in place to limit the voice of any particular station owner.</p><p>For us today, we have not caught up with the dominant media which is  internet, which is social media.  And so there's going to be some kind of  regulation, I don't know what form that takes, probably enhancement in  privacy and enhancement in transparency requirements, but that's going to  cost money clearly.</p><p>We saw some indication of that in the second quarter results for Facebook  when they basically tried to get ahead of this and they're going to spend  more money, so that's a short term headwind to earnings growth but long  term as you point it out it probably entrenches the large pipelines because  they're the ones who have the scale to basically put this things (ph) in  place.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, what's the -- Chris, it's difficult at the moment as  you say to see what kind of regulation they would face.  But what's the  worse kind of regulation that could be imposed on them.  And do you really  see a lot of these companies being proactive and trying to put something in  place that feels better to the consumer before they get flopped with more  regulation?</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes, clearly they are doing that, although interestingly Google  did not show at that hearing and they have been targeted specifically by  the President for other reasons.  But, you know, again, in terms of what's  the worse kind of regulation, there have been a number of ideas.  One has  been to actually make social media companies or all internet companies  liable for the content that appears on their sites, so you're bringing the  legal system in a kind of unknown costs associated with that into the  equation and I don't know if that happens or not.</p><p>The tech companies don't have a lot of friends on the Republican side of  the aisle at the moment which historically or they could really are -- had  favored Democrats historically.  We'll see what happens if there's a change  in Congress.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, Chris, thank you so much Chris Marangi there of Gabelli  Funds.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU:  It is now time for single best chart and we are joined of course once  again by Chris Marangi, Gabelli Funds co-CIO.  And Chris, I pulled up this  chart here that shows Citigroup's news implied sentiment indicator which is  another way of tracking sentiment on U.S. stocks.  And the bars here show,  the red bars in particular that there's a lot more bearishness in equities  about equities, at least as cited by Bloomberg news stories, while the S&amp;P  500 in white continues moves higher.</p><p>Citigroup's not the only one that's been sounding the alarm over recent  gains in the U.S. stocks.  Goldman Sachs do the same, Stifel Nicolaus also  made a point out of the Fed raises rates two more times, it could trigger  an equity bear market.  What do you make of all of this?  What do you make  of this that people are now piling in on this idea that we're at a tipping  point?</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes, the most hated bull market in history, the lowest bull  market in history and we're the second-largest economic expansion on  record.  And I don't see any reason that won't be the longest.  We need to  make it to June of 2019 to be the longest and from the bottom up  perspective, you know, industrial demand still reasonably strong, consumers  in good shape.</p><p>You know, we've talked for years and years about green shoots as signs of  recovery.  Now we're going to talk a little bit about brown leaves and some  of the things that could tip us into recession and end this bull market.   And those are things like labor market tightening, higher import costs,  steel, oil, freight.  We're seeing some of that but nothing that worries me  too much at the moment.</p><p>FU:  So if you're putting new money to work right now, where would you put  it in the U.S. market?  And you probably don't want to go into big tech  which you've seen in the line sure of the gains in U.S. stocks overall.   Where do you go now for that turning point?</p><p>MARANGI:  Yes, I mean, look, so I think we're bottom up investors.  We're  not allocating by sector, we're looking company by company and there's  still companies within tech, a category which is going to change this month  by the way where there's value.  We're still finding some bargains.</p><p>You know, I think in general the level of marginal safety of the market is  narrow certainly than it's been in a couple of years, but M&amp;A is still  strong.  You're still seeing some strength in some of the industrial  companies and there are certain sectors that have to left behind to a  degree like for example banking and some of the consumer staples names and  even some media names which have been out of favor.  Yes.</p><p>LACQUA:  Chris, we're late cycle in the U.S. at the same time, these tax  cuts will come to an end.  What is the likelihood of recession in the U.S.  in the next 18 months?</p><p>MARANGI:  Well, we're certainly going to have another recession in the  U.S., again, the question is what's the timing.  Again, I don't see  anything today from a bottom up perspective which would lead me to believe  that it's going to be in the next 18 months, but it will come and --</p><p>LACQUA:  Not even a trade war?</p><p>MARANGI:  Well, certainly the trade war and the political situation  spinning out of control are sort of the wildcards.  But, you know, I think  this expansion in the old-fashioned way with the cycle of rate tightening  which, you know, we seem to be on track for.</p><p>FU:  Well, the Fed do -- I'm sorry, go ahead Francine.</p><p>LACQUA:  Thanks Scarlet, will the Fed do everything it can not to invert  the yield curve?</p><p>MARANGI:  I'm not sure if that's totally within their power.  They face a  lot of external forces which are flattening the yield curve.  And, you  know, obviously everybody talks about the predictive power of the yield  curve, but it's not necessary positive so -- but certainly the Fed is aware  of that.</p><p>FU:  Francine, I'm sorry for jumping in on you.  I'm just so excited to ask  Chris.  What are you doing then with your funds?  How are you positioning  yourself right now?</p><p>MARANGI:  Well, we're -- we try to be more or less fully invested and we  are at the moment.  We're looking for good companies trading and discuss to  their private market or intrinsic value where something we think ago right  for the moment next two years to three years whether it's a change in a  regulation, a change in management, and maybe industry consolidation.  So  we're certainly seeing lots of various of consolidation media among them as  well as some of the consumer names.  So, again, we're finding ideas.</p><p>FU:  What's the one thing that you think you can do or won't do once we get  the midterm elections out of the way.</p><p>MARANGI:  Well, I think we're more or less ignoring the midterm elections  in terms of the way we're positioning the portfolios.  You know,  interestingly I think post the midterms we'll start to focus on 2020 and  we'll see what candidates are getting traction in Iowa and, you know, the  market will notice if somebody like a Senator Warren or Senator Sanders  looks to be the nominee and we'll obviously we'll look and see if  somebody's going to challenge Trump on the Republican side.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, Chris, thank you so much.  It's been fun to come back  Chris Marangi there of Gabelli Funds.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

And Chris, we were just talking about what's happening in Washington and how that's eating up all of the attention, sucking up all the oxygen there. As an investor, we know that when the president tend to get cornered, and it's not just this president, any president, they tend to look for something else, they look for distractions, they look for something to focus their energy on. Do you expect or anticipate unexpected headlines on trade on North Korea that could come out and change the scope of where we are headed?</p><p>CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS: Well, administration in turmoil is probably a headline you could've applied in any point in the last 18 months. And what we're focused on is two months from now. Today is September 6, November 6 of the elections in the U.S. So a lot of this is noise, it will focus on the election and I think the expectation at this point is that the Democrats will at least take the House, the Senate is up for grabs and historically divided government has been good for the markets. And so whether it's people inside the administration or other branches of government modulating the impulses of the executive, that's generally viewed positively by the market.</p><p>FU: So as an investor, do you look for people within the administration and indeed the President himself to make the decisions that would be good for markets, for the business environment leading up to the midterms because that's where they want to keep the focus on a strong economy?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, that would be smart of the president. I think -- but I think the president will between now and Election Day probably appeal to his base and, yes, I would expect some headlines about trade and immigrations. Somebody -- but on issues on that election.</p><p>FU: But resolutions on those?</p><p>MARANGI: I doubt that anything gets resolved. We have of course also the --</p><p>FU: Right, thanks so much --</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Go ahead Chris.</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, obviously -- you know, obviously there are other things going on in Washington was a bit of a three ring circus yesterday between the Kavanaugh hearing and the social media hearings.</p><p>So, you know, obviously we'll look to resolve the Kavanaugh hearings between now and Election Day or certainly the Senate is looking to do that. But beyond that, I think it's mostly noise.</p><p>LACQUA: Chris, thank you, Chris Marangi there of Gabelli funds, he stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: For Russia, it's sanctions, for Turkey obviously is what happens with monetary policy. Chris Marangi here with us from Gabelli, for Argentina it's what happens with the IMF. When we look at emerging markets, it seems like investors have been pretty careful about making sure they don't lump Turkey and Argentina with the rest of the EM's. For a country like China, where does it fit in? Is China even an E.M. at this point?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, I wouldn't consider it an E.M. Certainly, you know, given their size and their geopolitical influence, it creates its own weather. I mean, it is -- it has its own dynamic. It's certainly much different than Turkey and South Africa and Argentina as you mentioned. So, it's sort of its own thing. The financial sector is not as developed as the west and the rule of laws not as strong as in the west. It's not quite emerged yet, but it's its own asset class.</p><p>FU: And of course there's also the issue with the economy slowing down. Do you not invest in companies that have exposure to China because of that, or because for instance U.S. -- the trade war issues is going to impact those companies?</p><p>MARANGI: It's certainly a factor. One of our themes is make it here, sell it there. So, one of our larger areas of investment historically has been in the aerospace sector. China is a big customer -- going to be the biggest customer for those companies. So -- but that is a favorite sector somewhat exempt from the tariff issue. But we look companies in China like Tencent which has some of its dynamics, industries that we like and we know that happened to be based in China and have Chinas then in market.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: Let's bring Chris Marangi, co-CIO of Gabelli Funds here with me. And, of course, we've been looking very carefully at this. You look at mediate companies overall. When you look at Facebook, when you look at Twitter and they commit to focusing more on cleaning up everything, does that mean more resources spent on profiling, on monitoring. I mean, for Facebook, they have the cash to do that but for company like Twitter, that's not really something to have a lot of.</p><p>MARANGI: Well, the short answer is yes. I mean, putting this in historical context, 1930s you had radio regulated, post-World War II we had television regulated prohibition and owning a newspaper and a broadcast station to say market limit to a national reach equal time, all these things put in place to limit the voice of any particular station owner.</p><p>For us today, we have not caught up with the dominant media which is internet, which is social media. And so there's going to be some kind of regulation, I don't know what form that takes, probably enhancement in privacy and enhancement in transparency requirements, but that's going to cost money clearly.</p><p>We saw some indication of that in the second quarter results for Facebook when they basically tried to get ahead of this and they're going to spend more money, so that's a short term headwind to earnings growth but long term as you point it out it probably entrenches the large pipelines because they're the ones who have the scale to basically put this things (ph) in place.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, what's the -- Chris, it's difficult at the moment as you say to see what kind of regulation they would face. But what's the worse kind of regulation that could be imposed on them. And do you really see a lot of these companies being proactive and trying to put something in place that feels better to the consumer before they get flopped with more regulation?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, clearly they are doing that, although interestingly Google did not show at that hearing and they have been targeted specifically by the President for other reasons. But, you know, again, in terms of what's the worse kind of regulation, there have been a number of ideas. One has been to actually make social media companies or all internet companies liable for the content that appears on their sites, so you're bringing the legal system in a kind of unknown costs associated with that into the equation and I don't know if that happens or not.</p><p>The tech companies don't have a lot of friends on the Republican side of the aisle at the moment which historically or they could really are -- had favored Democrats historically. We'll see what happens if there's a change in Congress.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Chris, thank you so much Chris Marangi there of Gabelli Funds.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: It is now time for single best chart and we are joined of course once again by Chris Marangi, Gabelli Funds co-CIO. And Chris, I pulled up this chart here that shows Citigroup's news implied sentiment indicator which is another way of tracking sentiment on U.S. stocks. And the bars here show, the red bars in particular that there's a lot more bearishness in equities about equities, at least as cited by Bloomberg news stories, while the S&amp;P 500 in white continues moves higher.</p><p>Citigroup's not the only one that's been sounding the alarm over recent gains in the U.S. stocks. Goldman Sachs do the same, Stifel Nicolaus also made a point out of the Fed raises rates two more times, it could trigger an equity bear market. What do you make of all of this? What do you make of this that people are now piling in on this idea that we're at a tipping point?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, the most hated bull market in history, the lowest bull market in history and we're the second-largest economic expansion on record. And I don't see any reason that won't be the longest. We need to make it to June of 2019 to be the longest and from the bottom up perspective, you know, industrial demand still reasonably strong, consumers in good shape.</p><p>You know, we've talked for years and years about green shoots as signs of recovery. Now we're going to talk a little bit about brown leaves and some of the things that could tip us into recession and end this bull market. And those are things like labor market tightening, higher import costs, steel, oil, freight. We're seeing some of that but nothing that worries me too much at the moment.</p><p>FU: So if you're putting new money to work right now, where would you put it in the U.S. market? And you probably don't want to go into big tech which you've seen in the line sure of the gains in U.S. stocks overall. Where do you go now for that turning point?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, I mean, look, so I think we're bottom up investors. We're not allocating by sector, we're looking company by company and there's still companies within tech, a category which is going to change this month by the way where there's value. We're still finding some bargains.</p><p>You know, I think in general the level of marginal safety of the market is narrow certainly than it's been in a couple of years, but M&amp;A is still strong. You're still seeing some strength in some of the industrial companies and there are certain sectors that have to left behind to a degree like for example banking and some of the consumer staples names and even some media names which have been out of favor. Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: Chris, we're late cycle in the U.S. at the same time, these tax cuts will come to an end. What is the likelihood of recession in the U.S. in the next 18 months?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, we're certainly going to have another recession in the U.S., again, the question is what's the timing. Again, I don't see anything today from a bottom up perspective which would lead me to believe that it's going to be in the next 18 months, but it will come and --</p><p>LACQUA: Not even a trade war?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, certainly the trade war and the political situation spinning out of control are sort of the wildcards. But, you know, I think this expansion in the old-fashioned way with the cycle of rate tightening which, you know, we seem to be on track for.</p><p>FU: Well, the Fed do -- I'm sorry, go ahead Francine.</p><p>LACQUA: Thanks Scarlet, will the Fed do everything it can not to invert the yield curve?</p><p>MARANGI: I'm not sure if that's totally within their power.

I'm just so excited to ask Chris. What are you doing then with your funds? How are you positioning yourself right now?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, we're -- we try to be more or less fully invested and we are at the moment. We're looking for good companies trading and discuss to their private market or intrinsic value where something we think ago right for the moment next two years to three years whether it's a change in a regulation, a change in management, and maybe industry consolidation. So we're certainly seeing lots of various of consolidation media among them as well as some of the consumer names.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Now, joining us here in New York is Chris Marangi, he is Gabelli Funds Co-CIO. And Chris, we were just talking about what's happening in Washington and how that's eating up all of the attention, sucking up all the oxygen there. As an investor, we know that when the president tend to get cornered, and it's not just this president, any president, they tend to look for something else, they look for distractions, they look for something to focus their energy on. Do you expect or anticipate unexpected headlines on trade on North Korea that could come out and change the scope of where we are headed?</p><p>CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS: Well, administration in turmoil is probably a headline you could've applied in any point in the last 18 months. And what we're focused on is two months from now. Today is September 6, November 6 of the elections in the U.S. So a lot of this is noise, it will focus on the election and I think the expectation at this point is that the Democrats will at least take the House, the Senate is up for grabs and historically divided government has been good for the markets. And so whether it's people inside the administration or other branches of government modulating the impulses of the executive, that's generally viewed positively by the market.</p><p>FU: So as an investor, do you look for people within the administration and indeed the President himself to make the decisions that would be good for markets, for the business environment leading up to the midterms because that's where they want to keep the focus on a strong economy?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, that would be smart of the president. I think -- but I think the president will between now and Election Day probably appeal to his base and, yes, I would expect some headlines about trade and immigrations. Somebody -- but on issues on that election.</p><p>FU: But resolutions on those?</p><p>MARANGI: I doubt that anything gets resolved. We have of course also the --</p><p>FU: Right, thanks so much --</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Go ahead Chris.</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, obviously -- you know, obviously there are other things going on in Washington was a bit of a three ring circus yesterday between the Kavanaugh hearing and the social media hearings.</p><p>So, you know, obviously we'll look to resolve the Kavanaugh hearings between now and Election Day or certainly the Senate is looking to do that. But beyond that, I think it's mostly noise.</p><p>LACQUA: Chris, thank you, Chris Marangi there of Gabelli funds, he stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: For Russia, it's sanctions, for Turkey obviously is what happens with monetary policy. Chris Marangi here with us from Gabelli, for Argentina it's what happens with the IMF. When we look at emerging markets, it seems like investors have been pretty careful about making sure they don't lump Turkey and Argentina with the rest of the EM's. For a country like China, where does it fit in? Is China even an E.M. at this point?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, I wouldn't consider it an E.M. Certainly, you know, given their size and their geopolitical influence, it creates its own weather. I mean, it is -- it has its own dynamic. It's certainly much different than Turkey and South Africa and Argentina as you mentioned. So, it's sort of its own thing. The financial sector is not as developed as the west and the rule of laws not as strong as in the west. It's not quite emerged yet, but it's its own asset class.</p><p>FU: And of course there's also the issue with the economy slowing down. Do you not invest in companies that have exposure to China because of that, or because for instance U.S. -- the trade war issues is going to impact those companies?</p><p>MARANGI: It's certainly a factor. One of our themes is make it here, sell it there. So, one of our larger areas of investment historically has been in the aerospace sector. China is a big customer -- going to be the biggest customer for those companies. So -- but that is a favorite sector somewhat exempt from the tariff issue. But we look companies in China like Tencent which has some of its dynamics, industries that we like and we know that happened to be based in China and have Chinas then in market.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: Let's bring Chris Marangi, co-CIO of Gabelli Funds here with me. And, of course, we've been looking very carefully at this. You look at mediate companies overall. When you look at Facebook, when you look at Twitter and they commit to focusing more on cleaning up everything, does that mean more resources spent on profiling, on monitoring. I mean, for Facebook, they have the cash to do that but for company like Twitter, that's not really something to have a lot of.</p><p>MARANGI: Well, the short answer is yes. I mean, putting this in historical context, 1930s you had radio regulated, post-World War II we had television regulated prohibition and owning a newspaper and a broadcast station to say market limit to a national reach equal time, all these things put in place to limit the voice of any particular station owner.</p><p>For us today, we have not caught up with the dominant media which is internet, which is social media. And so there's going to be some kind of regulation, I don't know what form that takes, probably enhancement in privacy and enhancement in transparency requirements, but that's going to cost money clearly.</p><p>We saw some indication of that in the second quarter results for Facebook when they basically tried to get ahead of this and they're going to spend more money, so that's a short term headwind to earnings growth but long term as you point it out it probably entrenches the large pipelines because they're the ones who have the scale to basically put this things (ph) in place.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, what's the -- Chris, it's difficult at the moment as you say to see what kind of regulation they would face. But what's the worse kind of regulation that could be imposed on them. And do you really see a lot of these companies being proactive and trying to put something in place that feels better to the consumer before they get flopped with more regulation?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, clearly they are doing that, although interestingly Google did not show at that hearing and they have been targeted specifically by the President for other reasons. But, you know, again, in terms of what's the worse kind of regulation, there have been a number of ideas. One has been to actually make social media companies or all internet companies liable for the content that appears on their sites, so you're bringing the legal system in a kind of unknown costs associated with that into the equation and I don't know if that happens or not.</p><p>The tech companies don't have a lot of friends on the Republican side of the aisle at the moment which historically or they could really are -- had favored Democrats historically. We'll see what happens if there's a change in Congress.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Chris, thank you so much Chris Marangi there of Gabelli Funds.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>FU: It is now time for single best chart and we are joined of course once again by Chris Marangi, Gabelli Funds co-CIO. And Chris, I pulled up this chart here that shows Citigroup's news implied sentiment indicator which is another way of tracking sentiment on U.S. stocks. And the bars here show, the red bars in particular that there's a lot more bearishness in equities about equities, at least as cited by Bloomberg news stories, while the S&amp;P 500 in white continues moves higher.</p><p>Citigroup's not the only one that's been sounding the alarm over recent gains in the U.S. stocks. Goldman Sachs do the same, Stifel Nicolaus also made a point out of the Fed raises rates two more times, it could trigger an equity bear market. What do you make of all of this? What do you make of this that people are now piling in on this idea that we're at a tipping point?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, the most hated bull market in history, the lowest bull market in history and we're the second-largest economic expansion on record. And I don't see any reason that won't be the longest. We need to make it to June of 2019 to be the longest and from the bottom up perspective, you know, industrial demand still reasonably strong, consumers in good shape.</p><p>You know, we've talked for years and years about green shoots as signs of recovery. Now we're going to talk a little bit about brown leaves and some of the things that could tip us into recession and end this bull market. And those are things like labor market tightening, higher import costs, steel, oil, freight. We're seeing some of that but nothing that worries me too much at the moment.</p><p>FU: So if you're putting new money to work right now, where would you put it in the U.S. market? And you probably don't want to go into big tech which you've seen in the line sure of the gains in U.S. stocks overall. Where do you go now for that turning point?</p><p>MARANGI: Yes, I mean, look, so I think we're bottom up investors. We're not allocating by sector, we're looking company by company and there's still companies within tech, a category which is going to change this month by the way where there's value. We're still finding some bargains.</p><p>You know, I think in general the level of marginal safety of the market is narrow certainly than it's been in a couple of years, but M&amp;A is still strong. You're still seeing some strength in some of the industrial companies and there are certain sectors that have to left behind to a degree like for example banking and some of the consumer staples names and even some media names which have been out of favor. Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: Chris, we're late cycle in the U.S. at the same time, these tax cuts will come to an end. What is the likelihood of recession in the U.S. in the next 18 months?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, we're certainly going to have another recession in the U.S., again, the question is what's the timing. Again, I don't see anything today from a bottom up perspective which would lead me to believe that it's going to be in the next 18 months, but it will come and --</p><p>LACQUA: Not even a trade war?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, certainly the trade war and the political situation spinning out of control are sort of the wildcards. But, you know, I think this expansion in the old-fashioned way with the cycle of rate tightening which, you know, we seem to be on track for.</p><p>FU: Well, the Fed do -- I'm sorry, go ahead Francine.</p><p>LACQUA: Thanks Scarlet, will the Fed do everything it can not to invert the yield curve?</p><p>MARANGI: I'm not sure if that's totally within their power. They face a lot of external forces which are flattening the yield curve. And, you know, obviously everybody talks about the predictive power of the yield curve, but it's not necessary positive so -- but certainly the Fed is aware of that.</p><p>FU: Francine, I'm sorry for jumping in on you. I'm just so excited to ask Chris. What are you doing then with your funds? How are you positioning yourself right now?</p><p>MARANGI: Well, we're -- we try to be more or less fully invested and we are at the moment. We're looking for good companies trading and discuss to their private market or intrinsic value where something we think ago right for the moment next two years to three years whether it's a change in a regulation, a change in management, and maybe industry consolidation. So we're certainly seeing lots of various of consolidation media among them as well as some of the consumer names. So, again, we're finding ideas.</p><p>FU: What's the one thing that you think you can do or won't do once we get the midterm elections out of the way.</p><p>MARANGI: Well, I think we're more or less ignoring the midterm elections in terms of the way we're positioning the portfolios. You know, interestingly I think post the midterms we'll start to focus on 2020 and we'll see what candidates are getting traction in Iowa and, you know, the market will notice if somebody like a Senator Warren or Senator Sanders looks to be the nominee and we'll obviously we'll look and see if somebody's going to challenge Trump on the Republican side.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Chris, thank you so much. It's been fun to come back Chris Marangi there of Gabelli Funds.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Now, joining us here in New York is Chris  Marangi, he is Gabelli Funds Co-CIO.  And Chris, we were just talking about  what's happening in Washington and how that's eating up all of the  attention, sucking up all the oxygen there.  As an investor, we know that  when the president tend to get cornered, and it's not just this president,  any president, they tend to look for something else, they look for  distractions, they look for something to focus their energy on.  Do you  expect or anticipate unexpected headlines on trade on North Korea that  could come out and change the scope of where we are headed?</p><p> CHRIS MARANGI, CO-CIO, GABELLI FUNDS:  Well, administration in turmoil is  probably a headline you could've applied in any point in the last 18  months.  And what we're focused on is two months from now.  Today is  September 6, November 6 of the elections in the U.S.  So a lot of this is  noise, it will focus on the election and I think the expectation at this  point is that the Democrats will at least take the House, the Senate is up  for grabs and historically divided government has been good for the  markets.  And so whether it's people inside the administration or other  branches of government modulating the impulses of the executive, that's  generally viewed positively by the market.</p><p> FU:  So as an investor, do you look for people within the administration  and indeed the President himself to make the decisions that would be good  for markets, for the business environment leading up to the midterms  because that's where they want to keep the focus on a strong economy?</p><p> MARANGI:  Yes, that would be smart of the president.  I think -- but I  think the president will between now and Election Day probably appeal to  his base and, yes, I would expect some headlines about trade and  immigrations.  Somebody -- but on issues on that election.</p><p> FU:  But resolutions on those?</p><p> MARANGI:  I doubt that anything gets resolved.  We have of course also the  --</p><p> FU:  Right, thanks so much --</p><p> FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Go ahead Chris.</p><p> MARANGI:  Yes, obviously -- you know, obviously there are other things  going on in Washington was a bit of a three ring circus yesterday between  the Kavanaugh hearing and the social media hearings.</p><p> So, you know, obviously we'll look to resolve the Kavanaugh hearings  between now and Election Day or certainly the Senate is looking to do that.   But beyond that, I think it's mostly noise.</p><p> LACQUA:  Chris, thank you, Chris Marangi there of Gabelli funds, he stays  with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FU:  For Russia, it's sanctions, for Turkey obviously is what happens with  monetary policy.  Chris Marangi here with us from Gabelli, for Argentina  it's what happens with the IMF.  When we look at emerging markets, it seems  like investors have been pretty careful about making sure they don't lump  Turkey and Argentina with the rest of the EM's.  For a country like China,  where does it fit in?  Is China even an E.M. at this point?</p><p> MARANGI:  Yes, I wouldn't consider it an E.M.  Certainly, you know, given  their size and their geopolitical influence, it creates its own weather.  I  mean, it is -- it has its own dynamic.  It's certainly much different than  Turkey and South Africa and Argentina as you mentioned.  So, it's sort of  its own thing.  The financial sector is not as developed as the west and  the rule of laws not as strong as in the west.  It's not quite emerged yet,  but it's its own asset class.</p><p> FU:  And of course there's also the issue with the economy slowing down.   Do you not invest in companies that have exposure to China because of that,  or because for instance U.S. -- the trade war issues is going to impact  those companies?</p><p> MARANGI:  It's certainly a factor.  One of our themes is make it here, sell  it there.  So, one of our larger areas of investment historically has been  in the aerospace sector.  China is a big customer -- going to be the  biggest customer for those companies.  So -- but that is a favorite sector  somewhat exempt from the tariff issue.  But we look companies in China like  Tencent which has some of its dynamics, industries that we like and we know  that happened to be based in China and have Chinas then in market.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FU:  Let's bring Chris Marangi, co-CIO of Gabelli Funds here with me.  And,  of course, we've been looking very carefully at this.  You look at mediate  companies overall.  When you look at Facebook, when you look at Twitter and  they commit to focusing more on cleaning up everything, does that mean more  resources spent on profiling, on monitoring.  I mean, for Facebook, they  have the cash to do that but for company like Twitter, that's not really  something to have a lot of.</p><p> MARANGI:  Well, the short answer is yes.  I mean, putting this in  historical context, 1930s you had radio regulated, post-World War II we had  television regulated prohibition and owning a newspaper and a broadcast  station to say market limit to a national reach equal time, all these  things put in place to limit the voice of any particular station owner.</p><p> For us today, we have not caught up with the dominant media which is  internet, which is social media.  And so there's going to be some kind of  regulation, I don't know what form that takes, probably enhancement in  privacy and enhancement in transparency requirements, but that's going to  cost money clearly.</p><p> We saw some indication of that in the second quarter results for Facebook  when they basically tried to get ahead of this and they're going to spend  more money, so that's a short term headwind to earnings growth but long  term as you point it out it probably entrenches the large pipelines because  they're the ones who have the scale to basically put this things (ph) in  place.</p><p> LACQUA:  All right, what's the -- Chris, it's difficult at the moment as  you say to see what kind of regulation they would face.  But what's the  worse kind of regulation that could be imposed on them.  And do you really  see a lot of these companies being proactive and trying to put something in  place that feels better to the consumer before they get flopped with more  regulation?</p><p> MARANGI:  Yes, clearly they are doing that, although interestingly Google  did not show at that hearing and they have been targeted specifically by  the President for other reasons.  But, you know, again, in terms of what's  the worse kind of regulation, there have been a number of ideas.  One has  been to actually make social media companies or all internet companies  liable for the content that appears on their sites, so you're bringing the  legal system in a kind of unknown costs associated with that into the  equation and I don't know if that happens or not.</p><p> The tech companies don't have a lot of friends on the Republican side of  the aisle at the moment which historically or they could really are -- had  favored Democrats historically.  We'll see what happens if there's a change  in Congress.</p><p> LACQUA:  All right, Chris, thank you so much Chris Marangi there of Gabelli  Funds.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> FU:  It is now time for single best chart and we are joined of course once  again by Chris Marangi, Gabelli Funds co-CIO.  And Chris, I pulled up this  chart here that shows Citigroup's news implied sentiment indicator which is  another way of tracking sentiment on U.S. stocks.  And the bars here show,  the red bars in particular that there's a lot more bearishness in equities  about equities, at least as cited by Bloomberg news stories, while the S&amp;P  500 in white continues moves higher.</p><p> Citigroup's not the only one that's been sounding the alarm over recent  gains in the U.S. stocks.  Goldman Sachs do the same, Stifel Nicolaus also  made a point out of the Fed raises rates two more times, it could trigger  an equity bear market.  What do you make of all of this?  What do you make  of this that people are now piling in on this idea that we're at a tipping  point?</p><p> MARANGI:  Yes, the most hated bull market in history, the lowest bull  market in history and we're the second-largest economic expansion on  record.  And I don't see any reason that won't be the longest.  We need to  make it to June of 2019 to be the longest and from the bottom up  perspective, you know, industrial demand still reasonably strong, consumers  in good shape.</p><p> You know, we've talked for years and years about green shoots as signs of  recovery.  Now we're going to talk a little bit about brown leaves and some  of the things that could tip us into recession and end this bull market.   And those are things like labor market tightening, higher import costs,  steel, oil, freight.  We're seeing some of that but nothing that worries me  too much at the moment.</p><p> FU:  So if you're putting new money to work right now, where would you put  it in the U.S. market?  And you probably don't want to go into big tech  which you've seen in the line sure of the gains in U.S. stocks overall.   Where do you go now for that turning point?</p><p> MARANGI:  Yes, I mean, look, so I think we're bottom up investors.  We're  not allocating by sector, we're looking company by company and there's  still companies within tech, a category which is going to change this month  by the way where there's value.  We're still finding some bargains.</p><p> You know, I think in general the level of marginal safety of the market is  narrow certainly than it's been in a couple of years, but M&amp;A is still  strong.  You're still seeing some strength in some of the industrial  companies and there are certain sectors that have to left behind to a  degree like for example banking and some of the consumer staples names and  even some media names which have been out of favor.  Yes.</p><p> LACQUA:  Chris, we're late cycle in the U.S. at the same time, these tax  cuts will come to an end.  What is the likelihood of recession in the U.S.  in the next 18 months?</p><p> MARANGI:  Well, we're certainly going to have another recession in the  U.S., again, the question is what's the timing.  Again, I don't see  anything today from a bottom up perspective which would lead me to believe  that it's going to be in the next 18 months, but it will come and --</p><p> LACQUA:  Not even a trade war?</p><p> MARANGI:  Well, certainly the trade war and the political situation  spinning out of control are sort of the wildcards.  But, you know, I think  this expansion in the old-fashioned way with the cycle of rate tightening  which, you know, we seem to be on track for.</p><p> FU:  Well, the Fed do -- I'm sorry, go ahead Francine.</p><p> LACQUA:  Thanks Scarlet, will the Fed do everything it can not to invert  the yield curve?</p><p> MARANGI:  I'm not sure if that's totally within their power.  They face a  lot of external forces which are flattening the yield curve.  And, you  know, obviously everybody talks about the predictive power of the yield  curve, but it's not necessary positive so -- but certainly the Fed is aware  of that.</p><p> FU:  Francine, I'm sorry for jumping in on you.  I'm just so excited to ask  Chris.  What are you doing then with your funds?  How are you positioning  yourself right now?</p><p> MARANGI:  Well, we're -- we try to be more or less fully invested and we  are at the moment.  We're looking for good companies trading and discuss to  their private market or intrinsic value where something we think ago right  for the moment next two years to three years whether it's a change in a  regulation, a change in management, and maybe industry consolidation.  So  we're certainly seeing lots of various of consolidation media among them as  well as some of the consumer names.  So, again, we're finding ideas.</p><p> FU:  What's the one thing that you think you can do or won't do once we get  the midterm elections out of the way.</p><p> MARANGI:  Well, I think we're more or less ignoring the midterm elections  in terms of the way we're positioning the portfolios.  You know,  interestingly I think post the midterms we'll start to focus on 2020 and  we'll see what candidates are getting traction in Iowa and, you know, the  market will notice if somebody like a Senator Warren or Senator Sanders  looks to be the nominee and we'll obviously we'll look and see if  somebody's going to challenge Trump on the Republican side.</p><p> LACQUA:  All right, Chris, thank you so much.  It's been fun to come back  Chris Marangi there of Gabelli Funds.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Where Facebook, YouTubes&amp;amp;sTwitter\"s response falls short</p><p>Other brands have also acted independently. Kiwibank, ANZ and BNZ have suspended much of their digitial advertising since Friday afternoon after news of the attacks broke.</p><p>This is not the first time New Zealand companies have pulled ads from these platforms.</p><p>Only several weeks ago, Spark pulled all its advertising from YouTube over concerns about paedophilic content targeted at children.</p><p>Spark\"s move was part of an international response, which also saw Disney and Nestle pull ads from the site.</p><p>Spark corporate relations lead Andrew Pirie confirmed to the Herald today that the telco was in talks with other companies, but had not yet finalised details of the action it would take.</p><p>Several years ago, numerous Kiwi brands also pulled their money after it was revealed that their ads appeared alongside extremist content.</p><p>Lessening the flow of money into these companies is the one way in which companies can get an immediate reaction from the big tech companies - as illustrated by YouTube\"s decision to ban all comments on content featuring minors after brands took exception to the unsavoury remarks often made.</p><p>A joint statement today from industry bodies the Association of New Zealand Advertisers (ANZA) and the Commercial Communications Council (Comms Council) called on social media platforms to do more to ensure that such horrors are never again live-streamed.</p><p>ANZA chief executive Lindsay Mouat today told the Herald that New Zealand companies need to consider where they want their advertising money spent.</p><p>He said that in the aftermath of the Christchurch massacres, he had \"a real outpouring of concern\" from senior marketers asking what they could do to help change this.</p><p>Mouat said he believed New Zealand\"s businesses had a role to play in encouraging change.</p><p>\"Perhaps when the dollars start to go, you\"ll get a response,\" he said.</p><p>While Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has indicated her intentions to look into how social media can be better regulated, Mouat noted that this can take time.</p><p>In the meantime, he says, New Zealand\"s brands do have the power to choose where they would like to put their money.</p><p>He stopped short of calling on more companies to pull ads from Facebook or Google, but said businesses need to seriously consider \"if they wish to be associated with social media platforms unable or unwilling to take responsibility for content on those sites.\"</p><p>He took particular exception to live-streaming, which he said poses a massive risk of the same thing happening again.</p><p>Echoing the words of Spark managing director Simon Moutter on Twitter over the weekend, Mouat said he found it really hard to believe that more couldn\"t be done to moderate the content on social media sites.</p><p>\"If the site owners can target consumers with advertising in microseconds, why can\"t the same technology be applied to prevent this kind of content being streamed live?\" he asked.</p><p>Facebook and Google make hundreds of millions of dollars from digital advertising in New Zealand every year.</p><p>The latest figures from the Interactive Advertising Bureau showed that a total of $659.5 million was spent on search-based advertising in 2017.</p><p>Conservative estimates suggest that 90 per cent of that figure can be attributed directly to Google, meaning the company makes well in excess of half a billion dollars from its New Zealand advertising business.</p><p>The IAB figures showed that only $41.96 million goes to the social media category; however, this figure doesn\"t account for all the money spent through bookings directly with Facebook. An industry source suggested the difference is likely hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson said the company had \"nothing to share at the current time,\" while Google is yet to respond to a request for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-12213886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNN-DDF1-JCBG-G17X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001W53</classCode><className>NESTLE SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Speaking to CNBC on Wednesday, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde pointed to the changing business models of commercial banks as evidence that innovations like cryptocurrencies are having a clear impact on financial sector incumbents.'I think the role of the disruptors and anything that is using distributed ledger technology, whether you call it crypto, assets, currencies, or whatever #8230; that is clearly shaking the system,' she said. </p><p>The IMF boss warned that such financial industry changes must be accompanied by regulation. 'We don't want innovation that would shake the system so much that we would lose the stability that is needed,' she said.Start-ups and big tech companies alike are increasingly eyeing the banking sector as a multitrillion-dollar market ripe for disruption. Facebook is reportedly developing its own cryptocurrency and Apple released its own credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs last month. Banks have responded with their own attempts to embrace new technology. JPMorgan is trialing a digital token called 'JPM Coin' that would instantly settle payments between clients and Goldman Sachs is expanding its digital retail bank called Marcus overseas. Lagarde said technology companies entering the banking space 'forcefully' must be subject to regulation. 'They will have to be held accountable so that they can be fully trusted,' she said. Cryptocurrencies are 'clearly shaking the system,' IMF's Lagarde says, CNBC, Apr 11 Source: FxPro MENAFN1104201901560000ID1098375325</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1098375325</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVS-K4S1-JCNX-303B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"286\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

She dedicated part of her remarks, however, to addressing the ECB's policy perspective on digital currencies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ECB chief said that \"given the developments we are seeing, not so much in the bitcoin segment but in the stablecoins projects,\" the ECB needs to be \"ahead of the curve\" because \"there is clearly a demand out there that we have to respond to.\"</p><p>Some blockchain currency specialists, including Tuur Demeester, founding partner of Adamant Capital, said Lagarde's remarks suggest the ECB would make some kind of inroads into the stablecoin market.</p><p>\"Looks like the ECB will be entering the stablecoin business,\" Demeester said in a tweet.</p><p>In her speech, Lagarde referred to a white paper on stablecoins, produced by a Group of Seven (G-7) working group chaired by Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, head of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). The paper sought to examine the challenges, risks, and benefits that global stablecoins may pose.</p><p>\"As a new technology, stablecoins are largely untested, especially on the scale required to run a global payment system,\" C\u0153ur\u00e9 said in a press release that followed a September discussion at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on policy and regulatory issues posed by the emergence of stablecoin initiatives backed by financial institutions and big tech. \"They give rise to a number of serious risks related to public policy priorities. The bar for regulatory approval will be high.\"</p><p>In its report, the working group noted potential benefits of a less volatile digital currency like stablecoin but called for a better understanding of the risks.</p><p>\"Stablecoins, which have many of the features of earlier cryptocurrencies but seek to stabilize the price of the 'coin' by linking its value to that of a pool of assets, have the potential to contribute to the development of more efficient global payment arrangements,\" the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said, introducing the paper.</p><p>\"The working group report finds that stablecoins, regardless of size, have implications ranging from anti-money laundering efforts across jurisdictions to operational resilience (including for cyber security), consumer/investor and data protection, and tax compliance. Global stablecoins may amplify those challenges and could also pose challenges to competition policy, financial stability, monetary policy and, in the extreme, the international monetary system,\" the BIS noted.</p><p>The former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief said the ECB had also set up a task force \" to make significant strides toward establishing and achieving clear objectives for the development of its own digital currency.\" She said the central bank had already conducted experiments and \"pilots here and there\" and that the task force would formulate more strictly defined project objectives for its own digital currency.</p><p>\"Are we trying to reduce cost? Are we trying to cut out the middleman? Are we trying to have inclusive finance at all costs-at no cost? There's a whole range of objectives that can be pursued, so I think we will start by doing that,\" Lagarde said.</p><p>Lagarde said that besides discussions on \"this sort of glamorous central bank digital currency, much talked about and worth exploring,\" the Eurosystem already has in place digital payment systems, which she hoped would be adopted more widely.</p><p>\"So on those digital systems that exist, some of which need a better take-up by some of the members of the system, I will continue to push because I think we have something which is really worth developing and encouraging. I'm talking here about TIPS and PEPS and all those acronyms that I should not be using, but I don't know what they stand for. All I know is that they deliver in digital terms the operations of clearing and settling, sometimes in one single operation,\" Lagarde said.</p><p>EU Finance Ministers Tepid on Stablecoins</p><p>Lagarde's comments on stablecoins and digital currencies come just weeks after European Union finance ministers put a freeze on the launch of stablecoins until the bloc has formulated a strategy to mitigate the risks posed by the technology.</p><p>\"These initiatives should not undermine existing financial and monetary order as well as monetary sovereignty in the European Union,\" the European Council and Commission said in a joint statement.</p><p>The finance ministers added that \"no global 'stablecoin' arrangement should begin operation in the European Union until the legal, regulatory, and oversight challenges and risks have been adequately identified and addressed.\"</p><p>While acknowledging the potential benefits of stablecoins, including cheaper and faster cross-border payments, the ministers said these technologies pose \"multifaceted challenges and risks related, for example, to consumer protection, privacy, taxation, cyber security and operational resilience, money laundering, terrorism financing, market integrity, governance, and legal certainty.\"</p><p>\"When a 'stablecoin' initiative has the potential to reach a global scale, these concerns are likely to be amplified, and new potential risks to monetary sovereignty, monetary policy, the safety and efficiency of payment systems, financial stability, and fair competition can arise,\" they said.</p><p>The ministers called for greater clarity around the legal status of stablecoin arrangements.</p><p>\"Some recent projects of global dimension have provided insufficient information on how precisely they intend to manage risks and operate their business. This lack of adequate information makes it very difficult to reach definitive conclusions on whether and how the existing EU regulatory framework applies,\" they said.</p><p>Saga Launches Stablecoin to Rival Facebook's Libra</p><p>Recently, a blockchain firm advised by Myron Scholes, co-creator of the famed BlackScholes model of derivative valuation for which he won the Nobel prize, launched a new stablecoin that the company hopes will revolutionize cross-border exchange and become a global currency.</p><p>Saga said in a press release that its brand of cryptocurrency is different from volatile blockchain-based currencies like Bitcoin because it resembles central bank-issued money and so would be useful as a more stable asset for storage of value and crossborder exchange.</p><p>\"SGA is the first digital currency that replicates the mechanics of central bank national currencies and applies them on a global scale,\" the company said, adding that its stablecoin \"acts as a bridge bringing digital currencies into the mainstream.\"</p><p>\"Saga has been designed with the global economy in mind and to overcome the challenge of buying globally whilst only being able to pay nationally,\" said Liquid, a cryptocurrency exchange that has just announced that it would list the stablecoin on its platform for secondary trading. \"Saga has developed a system that means a truly global currency can come into existence-away from national or political tensions.\"</p><p>Saga's currency is similar to Facebook's Libra in that it is pegged to a basket of fiat currencies. Unlike Libra, which is based on a set of currencies of Facebook's own designation-including the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and the Singapore dollar-Saga's stablecoin would be pegged to the IMF's Special Drawing Right (SDR). This is an international reserve asset composed of a basket of five currencies-the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, and the British pound sterling.</p><p>\"This acts as a stabilizing mechanism to reduce volatility,\" Saga said in the release, explaining the rationale of pegging to the SDR.</p><p>\"The SDR was initially defined as equivalent to 0.888671 grams of fine goldwhich, at the time, was also equivalent to one U.S. dollar,\" the IMF said. \"After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the SDR was redefined as a basket of currencies.\"</p><p>The IMF said that while SDRs are neither a currency nor a claim on the IMF, they act as a \"potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members\" and so can be exchanged for these currencies.</p><p>The downside of most cryptocurrencies is their extreme volatility, which, while attractive to speculators, can constrain their usefulness as a medium of exchange and store of value. Saga, like Libra, seeks to address this gap in the market.</p><p>\"Hyper-volatile currencies, which lack a monetary p olicy, are usually anonymous,\" said Saga founder Ido Sadeh Man, according to TechCrunch. \"Stablecoins are pegged to other assets, thus preventing their organic growth, and major players in this space are opaque concerning their funds. Saga's economy model is designed to allow growth. Participants are obliged to undergo a Know Your Customer process, assuring Saga's economy is compatible with traditional financial institutions.\"</p><p>With ambitions to serve as a global currency, Saga claims to have built \"a robust monetary model and effective system of governance.\"</p><p>\"The proceeds of issuing new SGA tokens are kept in a reserve, held in regulated banks, and stored in liquid assets that replicate the currency composition of the SDR,\" the company said.</p><p>Are we trying to reduce cost? Are we trying to cut out the middleman? Are we trying to have inclusive finance at all costs-at no cost? There's a whole range of objectives that can be pursued, so I think we will start by doing that.</p><p>Christine Lagarde, president,

It's just gone 6:00 in the morning here in Berlin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Max Foster with the very latest on the manhunt for the driver of a truck which plowed into a Christmas market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: I'm John Vause, live in Los Angeles where it's 9:00 Tuesday night. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also this hour, an explosion at a fireworks market in Mexico left dozens dead. We'll have much more on that story in just a moment.</p><p>But first, Germany is on alert as police search for the driver of a truck which slammed into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin. One man was arrested not far from the scene Monday night but was later released because of a lack of evidence.</p><p>One official has warned there may be more than one armed and dangerous suspect on the run. And ISIS claims it inspired the market attack which left 12 people dead and 48 wounded.</p><p>Now to Max in Berlin with the very latest on the investigation -- Max.</p><p>FOSTER: John, ISIS isn't giving any more detail beyond that. Not proving that this person was a soldier in any way, and the German security services not providing any evidence either about who they're chasing, whether it's one person or indeed a group.</p><p>So there is a manhunt under way but any more than that we don't know much more about. And the huge amount of concern here in the city, of course, that the idea that someone very dangerous could be on the run.</p><p>Here is Fred Pleitgen with the very latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A massive manhunt under way across Germany after the horrific truck attack on a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin; ISIS now claiming to have inspired the attack. The suspect or suspects still at large and armed and considered dangerous as investigators release the man arrested after the attack. Captured on cell phone video, the immediate aftermath of the attack that left 12 dead and more than 45 injured. A truck with Polish registration and loaded with 25 tons of steel plowing into the outdoor market, dragging some pedestrians 50 to 80 meters, stopping only after knocking over a Christmas tree.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The truck just jumped the curb and took a wrong turn and barreled through the crowd.</p><p>PLEITGEN: Inside the truck, the body of the truck's Polish driver. Berlin police say he was not at the wheel during the attack and appeared to have been shot to death. The truck company's owner says his driver appeared to have fought with the attackers.</p><p>Within an hour of the attack, police arrested a 23-year-old Pakistani immigrant.</p><p>And a somber chancellor Angela Merkel, addressing a stunned nation, seized on the suspect's nationality.</p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR: We must assume that this was a terrorist attack. I know that would be especially hard to bear for us if it was to be confirmed that the person who committed this act was given protection and asylum in Germany. This would be especially disgusting.</p><p>PLEITGEN: But police released the Pakistani man after prosecutors could not link him to the truck or the scene. Merkel is facing a political backlash after Germany has taken in nearly 900,000 immigrants this year even as terror attacks are on the rise.</p><p>Now investigators are in a race against time, fearful that whoever is on the run could launch another attack.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen, CNN -- Berlin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FOSTER: Angela Merkel under political pressure -- John. Also the security service is under a huge amount of pressure because they're very much on the back foot. They thought they had their man. They had him for hours. And then they let him go. In the meantime, the real attacker is someone out there.</p><p>VAUSE: And Max -- how is this attack now expected to impact Germany's domestic security? Also its open door policy on refugees?</p><p>FOSTER: Well, that's the big debate. We've got a presidential election here next year. And certainly the far right, which has been growing in strength since Angela Merkel's policy of allowing so many refugees into the country has now got even more evidence to play into its narrative, which is that Angela Merkel has made Germany dangerous by having this open door policy.</p><p>[00:05:04] The far right suggesting that the victims here as a result of this terrorist attack are Angela Merkel's victims. And she has created a huge amount of danger in the country by allowing refugees in.</p><p>Of course there was a part of that now playing out yesterday when we heard that a Pakistani refugee had been the main suspect. We don't know now who the main suspect is or whether or not he is a refugee or if they are refugees. So we're trying to find out more than.</p><p>But it certainly plays into the narrative of the growing far right into this country that Angela Merkel is exposing the country to danger by allowing refugees in.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok, Max -- thank you. Max Foster -- we will catch up with you later this hour.</p><p>Joining me here in Los Angeles is CNN law enforcement contributor Steve Moore. Steve is also a retired special agent with the FBI. Steve -- thank you for coming in.</p><p>STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>VAUSE: Detaining and then releasing the wrong man. It's a pretty big slip-up by the German authorities there. How big of an impact will this have on the manhunt right now? What did not get done when they thought they had the right guy?</p><p>MOORE: Think of evidence like sushi. It doesn't last very long. You don't want four-hour-old sushi. You don't want four-hour-old evidence. So while they were interrogating this person, evidence was spoiling. Evidence was going away. Evidence was dispersing. So that cost them.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. So if you're looking for this driver right now, where do you focus the search? Could he still be in Germany? Could he have left the country? Are all these options on the table?</p><p>MOORE: Yes. All the options are on the table. This is what is concerning. For me as an investigator, I wouldn't know really where to center it.</p><p>But you know that this driver was Polish, and that he was dead inside the truck. So you might be looking clear over to Poland. And what you're going to want to do is follow that truck. There is going to be cameras. There is going to be stops it would have to make for regulatory reasons. You're going to look at the cameras and see who was driving.</p><p>And at one point you're going say he was driving either at the German border or he wasn't. You're going to have to find him somewhere between Poland and Germany.</p><p>VAUSE: Work your way back, essentially.</p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: They say they're going through all the CCTV footage right now. They're also asking for anyone who has cell phone video from the scene to bring it forward. MOORE: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: This is painstaking work, but it has been effective. In the past, they did this in Boston after the Boston bombing. Isn't that how they identified the Tsarnaev brothers?</p><p>MOORE: I believe that's the case. And I've done this where you get this film. And it is agonizing. It is painstaking. People say well, you know, how long will that take? Well, you may have for every street corner you might have ten cameras on it. So to look at an hour is going to take ten hours because you have to look at each one. So it takes forever to do that.</p><p>VAUSE: In the meantime, would you suspect that the driver of the truck, would he have gone to ground somewhere? Would he have a support network in Germany? There is also suspicion that he may not be alone.</p><p>MOORE: My hunch, and it's only a hunch. But I'm at CNN to give you my thoughts.</p><p>VAUSE: Sure -- exactly. That's why we have you here.</p><p>MOORE: My hunch is that this isn't one person. One person gets their own truck or their own car. Several people would be needed to overpower a driver, stop him somewhere, find a way to get it, and get it on the first time. Because we don't hear any other drivers saying somebody tried to hijack you. They got it the first time.</p><p>So I'm guessing that there are several people involved in this. And whatever country you see this happening in where the truck was taken over, I would start looking there. That's where your cell, at least most likely, is.</p><p>VAUSE: We know there are, you know, these jihadi cells in France, there's jihadi cells especially in Brussels, is there the same degree of jihadi infiltration across Germany as there is in these other countries?</p><p>MOORE: I really don't want to make a political statement here. But you, wherever you were going to get large amounts of refugees that are unvetted, you are going to be bringing in at least a percentage of people who are as radicalized and as cellular and as organized as the people in Brussels. I'm not advocating against letting people in, but I am saying that this is going to be a fact. And we can't put our heads in the sand.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. Let's get to the claim of not necessarily responsibility, but inspiration, if you will --</p><p>MOORE: Inspired, yes.</p><p>VAUSE: -- by ISIS. Is it possible to know if that's just an opportunistic claim because they haven't really put any evidence forward to back it up? MOORE: Because they don't have any evidence. I mean ISIS whenever there is an attack, ISIS is watching CNN. They're trying to figure out did somebody do that in our name? And they're going to look, they're going to see what they've done in that area, see what kind of information they pushed out.</p><p>[00:10:03] I mean lately they've been pushing out information on truck attacks. They looked at it. They probably are saying on the basis of everything we know this was probably us or people doing this in our name. Therefore we're going to consider it inspired by us.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok, Steve. Good to speak with you. Thanks so much.</p><p>MOORE: Good to talk with you.</p><p>VAUSE: Now to Mexico where an explosion has ripped through a huge fireworks market and sent people running for their lives.</p><p>Tuesday's blast killed at least 29 people and injured dozens in Tultepec, north of Mexico City. Investigators are looking into whether the blast was deliberate.</p><p>CNN's Rafael Romo joins us now with more. So Rafael -- the last report we had from emergency crews, they had no other choice but to just let the unexploded fireworks simply go off. What is the latest right now?</p><p>RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, what I can tell you right now, John, is that the fire is now under control. It's been several hours now. And yes, you're absolutely right. There was very little firefighters could do because there were so many stalls selling fireworks at that market that there was very little they could do in terms of trying to put the fire out.</p><p>And it happened just before 3:00 local time. First it was an explosion, then a series of explosions. And you could see from miles and miles away the column of smoke going up in the air. And there are some reports that say that people in neighboring towns could hear the loud explosions and could feel the ground tremble -- just to give you an idea about how big the explosions were. Again, 29 people dead, 72 injured.</p><p>Also, to add to that, John, there are reports of at least three minors whose burns were so bad that they're going to have to be transferred to a hospital in Texas, a burn center where they're going to be treated.</p><p>And the tragic part of this, John, is that it's not the first time something like this happened in the very same location, Tultepec. It's a town about 40 kilometers or 25 miles north of Mexico City.</p><p>I was taking a look at the history of this town and what it has done. And specifically, the San Pablito market, that's the name of the market where this happened. And there had been similar explosions, in -- listen to this, John -- 1988, 1998, the year 2002, and as recently as 2005. Now there was an explosion in a different part of Mexico, but also in the central region back in 1999 where 56 people died and about 350 were injured all as a result of fireworks explosions -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: You mention these past explosions at this particular market in Mexico. Back in August, the head of Mexico's Pyrotechnic Institute actually said this, that the market was the safest in Latin America with perfectly designed posts and sufficient space so that a spark will not cause a chain conflagration. Clearly he was wrong.</p><p>The question now will be how could something like this happen in the same place for the third time in a decade?</p><p>ROMO: What many people are wondering, John, is why would you have a market with so many stalls selling fireworks all at the same time, instead of having one building with very strict fire code. Because if you go to these markets -- and I've been to a few of them -- the reality is that no matter what kind of safety precautions you can have, they're all in densely populated areas with stalls right next to each other.</p><p>So it only takes one fire to create the kind of catastrophe that we saw today in Mexico. And this time of the year, just before Christmas, is peak season for fireworks in Mexico.</p><p>I remember myself growing up in Mexico that it would be more or less like the fourth of July is in the United States where all the children want fireworks. And you have a lot of people going to the markets. You have a lot of workers there, it's very densely populated. And you have the results now, John, that we're talking about 29 people dead and 72 injured.</p><p>VAUSE: Just looking at some of the images. It looks like a mushroom cloud in the distance from those explosions.</p><p>Rafael -- thank you. Rafael Romo with the very latest details on the explosion at a fireworks market in Mexico.</p><p>We will take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, we're learning more about the police officer who assassinated Russia's ambassador to Turkey.</p><p>Also, Donald Trump is being forced to confront some tough foreign policy charges. Some are asking is the President-elect up to the job.</p><p>You're watching CNN live all around the world.</p><p>[00:15:10] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FOSTER: Here in Germany, people are mourning after a terrible attack on the Christmas market just behind me here. And Russia is also mourning the assassination of its ambassador to Turkey. The body of Ambassador Andrei Karlov has arrived in Moscow.</p><p>Our Nic Robertson spoke with a photographer who captured the horrific shooting. We have to warn you, though, his report does contain some very graphic images.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: New video shows an apparent stunning security lapse. Ambassador Andrei Karlov's killer standing behind him, unchallenged for several minutes before he pulls his gun.</p><p>BURHAN OZBILICI, ASSOCIATED PRESS PHOTOGRAPHER: In my two very first photos, the man, gunman was standing behind the ambassador, like he was part of ambassador's staff or somebody from the art gallery but he was very calm.</p><p>ROBERTSON: That's Ozbilici moments before the attack, taking photos of the ambassador. Seconds later, this -- Ambassador Karlov dying on the floor.</p><p>[00:20:07] The gunman shouting defiantly \"God is greatest\" and \"Do not forget Aleppo, do not forget Syria\" but chose not to shoot anyone else.</p><p>OZBILICI: People are screaming, crying. He asked people to go away and people were obeying. They were rolling in panic.</p><p>ROBERTSON: According to Turkey's interior minister the lone gunman is a 22-year-old police officer born in Turkey. State-run Andalu (ph) news agency reported his parents, sister and other relatives and some close friends have been detained. And state media is also reporting that he had books on al Qaeda and the group the government blames for last summer's coup at his apartment.</p><p>Russian investigators accompanied by their Turkish counterparts visiting the murder scene to check evidence for themselves. Meanwhile, Ambassador Karlov's body driven to Ankara airport for a brief ceremony before repatriation to Russia -- his assassination unprecedented in recent Turkish history.</p><p>Leaders of Turkey and Russia are uniting, calling it a provocative terrorist attack.</p><p>RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator): I described this attack on Russia's embassy as an attack to Turkey, Turkey's state and nation. After the incident, during the talk with Mr. Putin, we agreed this is a provocation, and there isn't any dispute.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Nevertheless, the Kremlin spokesman says it's Turkey's responsibility to protect Russian diplomats and they want more guarantees going forward. Even so Russia's foreign minister hosted his Turkish and Iranian counterparts in Moscow to discuss the conflict in Syria -- unthinkable a year ago when Russian-Turkey relations were at boiling point on opposite sides of the Syrian civil war.</p><p>For now it seems Russia and Turkey have their eyes far down the road. As outrageous and regrettable as the assassination of the ambassador undoubtedly is, they are joining forces to freeze the conflict in Syria and lock in gains for themselves. Nic Robertson, CNN -- Ankara, Turkey.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FOSTER: Our CNN contributor, former Moscow bureau chief, Jill Dougherty joins me now from Seattle in Washington. It's very interesting to watch the diplomacy around this, isn't it, because it's actually bringing the two sides together very closely?</p><p>JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: It is. And I think, you know, when it comes to Russia, it's really solidifying their role in the Middle East. I mean this is very interesting because you note who is not at that meeting and that's the United States. It's Iran, Russia, and Turkey, not the United States. And that's very significant.</p><p>So they're moving forward. They have -- they're putting up a united front that is Turkey and Russia. And they're making it -- the Russians are making it very clear that they don't feel that they need the Americans or maybe even want the Americans and are just moving forward on some type of resolution. What that will be precisely is not clear.</p><p>But you're right, Max. I mean the diplomacy is moving fast. And the Russians solidifying whatever means they have.</p><p>FOSTER: And how are the Americans viewing this? Is it a move away from, you know, or distancing perhaps from the United States, and moving more closely with the longer term relationship with Russia?</p><p>DOUGHERTY: You know, there is not a lot that I think that the United States can do right now? President Obama has made it clear. And he only has now, you know, a few weeks left in office that he is not going take any type of major action in Syria. And you have a new president coming in who has, this is Mr. Trump, who has made clear that he feels that he could possibly work with Russia and possibly even work with President Bashar al Assad, which seems unthinkable. Of course, when you talk about unthinkable things, that certainly is that the United States or this president incoming would think of working with Bashar al Assad to fight terrorism.</p><p>And that's the way Donald Trump looks at it -- very black and white. He feels that the Russians have taken the fight to the terrorists. He wants to fight with the terrorists and defeat them. And that means that he can ally himself with Russia.</p><p>Now, when he comes into office, the details of that, how that would be done and precisely what would happen, would Russia be leading the charge? Would the Americans be following? None of those details are clear. But the overall picture seems to be that, you know, Russians defining pretty much what is going on in Syria.</p><p>[00:25:00] FOSTER: And does Donald Trump in a way, with his sort of overtures to Russia, open the way for countries like Turkey to have closer relationships and build bridges with Russia?</p><p>DOUGHERTY: Well, yes. Although I think that this rapprochement between Turkey and Russia really was in train before Donald Trump entered the picture. But certainly if the American president is friendly with Russia, then it gives encouragement to other countries who see which way the wind is blowing to move in that direction.</p><p>I think you might see it Max, most significantly on the issue of sanctions, economic sanctions against Russia, which were introduced by the United States and by Europe as a reaction to what Russia did in Ukraine and also the annexation of Crimea.</p><p>And so if, let's say, Donald Trump decided not to uphold the sanctions, to weaken them or to even get rid of them, that would give free rein to any other country, especially some of the Europeans, who wouldn't mind doing that to simply go along.</p><p>So his relationship with Russia could be kind of a bellwether for other nations. This is not something traditional American foreign policy would necessarily accept. But this is the way it is with Mr. Trump.</p><p>FOSTER: Really awesome shifts going on in international diplomacy, aren't they? Thank you very much indeed -- Jill Dougherty for joining me on that.</p><p>Donald Trump tweeting about the attacks here in Germany and in Turkey; why some are concerned, though, about conducting foreign policy on social media.</p><p>[00:26:51] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[00:30:00] JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back, everybody. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles, where it's just gone 9:30 on a Tuesday night. I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour.</p><p>At least 29 people have been killed, dozens injured in an explosion at a fireworks market north of Mexico City. Authorities are investigating if the blast was deliberate. It's the third big explosion at the same market since 2005.</p><p>The body of Russia's ambassador to Turkey has arrived in Moscow a day after he was assassinated at an art gallery in Ankara. A Turkish police officer shot Andrey Karlov several times in the back. The gunman was later killed. Police are questioning several people, including the shooter's relatives.</p><p>ISIS claims a soldier of the Islamic State carried out the deadly truck attack at a Berlin Christmas market. Police are now searching for the driver who plowed into the crowd killing a dozen people. The suspect was released on Monday because of a lack of evidence.</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Donald Trump won't be inaugurated as U.S. president for another month. But his response to this week's attacks here in Germany and in Turkey is a telling sign of how he might handle global crises.</p><p>CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr reports on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The quick detention of a suspect in the Berlin Christmas market attack had all the hallmarks of terrorism. Soon after, Donald Trump issuing the statement blaming Islamist terrorists saying, \"Their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated.\"</p><p>Trump reacting to the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey and an attack on a mosque in Switzerland, tweeting \"It is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking.\"</p><p>SEAN SPICER, RNC CHIEF STRATEGIST &amp; COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Mr. Trump has made it very, very clear he understands the threat that radical Islamic terrorism poses to our nation and, frankly, to our friends and neighbors around the globe. And that we've got to be able to call it what it is and then root it out.</p><p>STARR: But hot spots facing Trump may only grow. And there are questions if he is ready for it. Trump's spokesman says he is getting briefed by his, quote, \"national security team,\" but will not say if he has agreed to start briefings from government intelligence officials.</p><p>ROBERT BAER, CNN INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY ANALYST: This is not the business world. And, you know, he is going to get that call at 3:00 in the morning with a crisis and he is going to have to act. He is the president of the United States.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Allahu Akbar!</p><p>STARR: Trump now getting a sense of what it means to deal with the Taliban. On a disturbing new video, an American woman and her Canadian husband held hostage by the group since 2012 appear with their children, begging both Trump and President Obama to free them.</p><p>Some say as threats grow, the president-elect needs to consider turning down his rhetoric because terrorists can appear to win with little effort.</p><p>JON ALTERMAN, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: The fact is there is nothing the United States can do to prevent one guy from getting in one truck once a year and trying to kill people.</p><p>STARR (on-camera): And in another potential hot spot, China now returning that drone to the U.S. Navy that it took out of the water several days ago. Many analysts we are talking to say they believe China is still sending a message to Donald Trump that it will remain a player on the world stage and a power broker in the South China Sea, despite Trump raising the prospect of changing the long-standing U.S. One China policy.</p><p>Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FOSTER: John, life getting back up and running here in Berlin this morning as the sun starts to come up and people start going off to work. We'll bring you the very latest on the manhunt here as soon as we have it.</p><p>Back to you in Los Angeles.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, Max, thank you. We'll catch up with you again next hour.</p><p>Joining me here now in Los Angeles, Hernan Molina, a Democratic political analyst and Shawn Steele who is with the California Republican National Committee.</p><p>Thank you both for coming in.</p><p>Let's talk about foreign policy and the president-elect, soon-to-be the president. Right now, you know, the United States and Europe are facing probably one of the most complex terror threats the world has ever seen.</p><p>And, Shawn, the criticism of the president-elect is that he is framing everything right now in very over simplistic terms. He doesn't have a handle on the nuance and the complexity which is in front of him.</p><p>SHAWN STEEL, CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: I think that's part of the problem thinking that it's nuance and complex. And it's pretty clear cut. I think most people are intuitively correct and I think Trump is correct. We've got a worldwide terrorist issue. Pretty much we know the bad players are. We know what the organizations are. We know the kind of tactics they employ. It's not very complicated. The bad guys seem to have a pretty clear vision about what is going on. But we're having a -- non-Islamic populations are targeted.</p><p>[00:35:06] In the Middle East, it's a terrible ongoing vicious civil war. It's been going on relatively speaking for 1400 years. So it's not a great deal of -- I think that's part of what the American public understood. Obama made it so complex, so hard to understand and so nuanced that he got nothing done. And now we have a very chaotic situation. We haven't had a clear leadership that the rest of the world would be inspired to do something about. Trump offers that. Obama didn't and look what Trump is inheriting.</p><p>VAUSE: They did say that your Obama gave you, you know, the thought and the complexity and the nuance, but he didn't give you the passion or the decisiveness. With Trump at least you have decisiveness.</p><p>HERNAN MOLINA, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you can also be a bully. You can also be an elephant inside a China shop. And I don't know that that's necessarily what diplomacy is all about.</p><p>It's hard to measure what we are talking about in terms of accomplishing the -- some achievements in the war on terror because you never know what could have been worse. And truly, a lot of people who are talking, including myself and Shawn and you, we don't really know what's happening inside the national security circles because all of these undercover operations are really being covert operations.</p><p>But I actually take issue with what Shawn just said, that one thing is to be blunt and direct, which I think Obama has been. George W. Bush also has been. But there is also the lack of experience which is very glaringly apparent on Donald Trump.</p><p>He is obviously a business person. He has no experience in government, which obviously work well for him, because people were voting for an outsider, but that does not necessarily covered well in governing. Governing is a very different story.</p><p>And he is not just governing -- going to govern United States. He is going to be one of the world leaders, perhaps the most important, in a coalition with someone like Angela Merkel in Germany, who is facing re-election, who opened the doors to a million plus immigrants. And now this is -- in a way, this new narrative is backfiring because in a way, some of the refugees could be also the culprits of these attacks.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. So let me play for you what Republican Chris Collins said. He was the first member of Congress to back Donald Trump. He essentially explained the Trump doctrine when it comes to ISIS.</p><p>Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS COLLINS, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: This president is going to take the attack to ISIS unlike President Obama and he is not going to hesitate. So in calling them out, putting them on notice that we're going to take it to it and I think America appreciates that he is going to take the fight to them and not just sit back and wait for the next attack.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Shawn, that criticism of Obama is a little unfair, especially when it comes to ISIS. You know, this administration has taken off 75 percent of the fighters on the battlefield. They're winding it up in Iraq, since wind it up in Raqqah and Syria as well.</p><p>STEELE: I don't think it's too unfair. We never heard of a concept of Christian genocide in our lifetimes. We haven't heard that concept in hundreds of years. Now in Obama's term, that's become a serious problem in the Middle East.</p><p>But more than that in Aleppo and the tremendous carnage and the hundreds of thousands that have been killed in Syria, again, on Obama's watch. And these are two objective facts.</p><p>The idea that Trump is going to wave a magic wand and things are going to be solved, he has a difficult culture and appreciation of the U.S. military. Obama really did a great deal to take out the warrior generals and take out the effective leaders that understood war, that didn't like war, but they were warriors. He brought in political generals.</p><p>Well, Trump understands that that's a very bad way to do business. He has brought in some much different class of people that are recognized world class generals. That's where he is going to get the intelligence from. He is certainly going to redo the CIA. He doesn't trust them innately. So it's a different kind of approach.</p><p>VAUSE: To that point, you have to admit that things around the world are in disarray right now. Maybe a different set of eyes or different approach might just work.</p><p>MOLINA: Absolutely. And it's undeniable that Obama has had a different style. But at the same time, I think you need to realize, and I also take again a little bit of issue with what Shawn just said.</p><p>Obama inherited a situation that George W. Bush unfortunately took us to a war that was a war of choice and things really unravelled. I think that by trying to -- having these John Wayne kind of cowboy style, which in a way George W. Bush was accused of, of having that type of attitude is only going to further perpetrate this narrative and situation that we have worldwide with global terrorism.</p><p>So certainly it's not going help us. Diplomacy is important. I think the middle approach is exactly what we need to find. I find it hard to believe that Trump will get there in a timely manner.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Come back next hour, because we have a lot more to get to. Hernan and Shawn, thanks for being with us.</p><p>MOLINA: Thank you.</p><p>VAUSE: I appreciate it.</p><p>We'll take you to a break. When we come back, families of terror victims are seeking justice for their loved ones. We'll tell you why they're going after some of the biggest names on the Internet in just a moment.</p><p>[00:43:15] VAUSE: The families of victims from the Orlando nightclub shooting are suing some big tech companies accusing Twitter, Facebook and Google of providing material support to ISIS.</p><p>For more on this, Internet security analyst Hemu Nigam and criminal defense attorney Brian Claypool.</p><p>Thank you both for being here.</p><p>Let's look at the legal holes here, first, Brian. The Communications Decency Act essentially shields computer services from liability for content. So how does that work? And that's a pretty big hill to climb in this case, right? BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, I would like to say it's insurmountable. I mean, when I first heard about a lawsuit being filed as a result of the Orlando nightclub shooting, I thought that these families were going to be suing maybe law enforcement for not going in more quickly to get -- to shoot at Omar Mateen, or possibly even the gun shop owner, or even possibly the FBI for not investigating.</p><p>When I heard that they were suing Internet companies, I thought of one thing, the Titanic.</p><p>VAUSE: Right.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Because these cases are sinking fast.</p><p>VAUSE: But this law essentially gives a free pass to social media. Social media sites.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Yes. There was a law enacted, federal law in the United States enacted in 1996 -- to make it easy for you and the viewers, basically, it says if somebody else posts information on the Internet, the Internet provider is not responsible for that data.</p><p>VAUSE: Right.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: And they cannot be sued and be held civilly liable for that. One exception is where there is criminal activity. And I think that's what these families are trying to do. They're trying to say, they're trying to say that the Internet providers were materially supporting ISIS.</p><p>VAUSE: Right. And with that, this is the twist in the case because the lawsuit is talking about matching user content with targeted advertising. Somehow the social media site is providing its own novel content.</p><p>So Hemu explain, you know, the take on the last piece of this.</p><p>[00:45:05] HEMU NIGAM, FOUNDER AND CEO, SSP BLUE: Yes. And I have to first say, I mean, all our hearts go out to the families. We all feel that way, but that doesn't mean a lawsuit is going to solve that problem.</p><p>And I think what Google -- Google is actually taking the lead on this. What they are doing is they are saying, look, if you are looking for ISIS content, maybe you're somebody who might get recruited, there is advertising that comes up that takes you to places that you can get help or at least even, for example, see content of what happens when ISIS attacks, such as what happened in the Berlin Christmas incident just two days ago, yesterday.</p><p>So Google is doing that. Twitter is actually doing a lot of things. And the companies are getting together and saying we're going to band forces and try to solve this problem not by ourselves but together and working with law enforcement. VAUSE: But right now, the families are saying that those searches be it on Google or Facebook or whatever is what is essentially bringing all of this together, which it seems to be a noble legal approach, Brian.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Yes. And the only way I think these families can prevail in this case is if they've got some information. For example, that Twitter or Facebook was aware of some really nefarious postings that might incite terrorism and then they didn't do anything to remove those because then you're possibly facilitating this.</p><p>You're on notice. Bear in mind these Internet providers don't have a duty to canvas the Internet to find these postings.</p><p>VAUSE: With that in mind, this lawsuit is also alleging that the tech companies did not do enough to shut down Jihadist groups. They used this example of an ISIS-linked Twitter account. This is part of the suit.</p><p>\"When its account @TurMedia333 was shut down, it started @TurMedia334. When that was shut down, it started @TurMedia335. This 'naming convention adding one digit to a new account after the last one is suspended. Does not seem as if it would require artificial intelligence to spot. Each of the accounts also used the same user photograph of a bearded man's face over and over and over again.\"</p><p>So Hemu from a technical point of view, would it be easy for Twitter to simply stop these accounts from springing up again?</p><p>NIGAM: Well, here's a reality. First, let's give kudos to Twitter for deleting 360,000 accounts in the first place, knowing that these ISIS folks are going to try to come back and create renewed accounts and do kind of a cat and mouse game.</p><p>But that said, there is a new initiative happening right now between Google, Microsoft and Twitter where they're going to be fingerprinting indicia of an ISIS account and then using it by sharing it amongst themselves in a database and saying here is a new account coming up. It looks very much like this. It has the fingerprints of these other accounts. And I think you're going see those accounts even disappearing now.</p><p>VAUSE: So just to be very careful, is there a legal responsibility here for these companies, not just to, you know, sort of to mow the weeds, but to pull the roots as well?</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Well, that's exactly right. I mean, if they're notified of some of these accounts that might be inciting mass terrorism, then they have a duty to remove those accounts.</p><p>But, John, really, I think the point that I'm troubled with here is, is this really the cause of a guy like Omar Mateen going into a nightclub and shooting up people? I think people in the United States need to be paying attention more to red flags. He went out and got a gun at place where he shouldn't have gotten a gun. So I think that, to me, is the bigger issue. VAUSE: Sure. OK, but I think, just because, you know, Omar Mateen may have seen these videos, this Jihadi content online, it doesn't actually mean he was influenced by it, doesn't it?</p><p>NIGAM: No, not at all. He could be talking to 10,000 other people in off settings. A lot of times what ISIS recruiters do is they may do target one individual and then immediately go into an app conversation, a cell phone conversation, all these other kinds of things they're doing.</p><p>So this is one of those where making the causal connection is never going to happen.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: That's exactly right.</p><p>VAUSE: That's right.</p><p>NIGAM: And I think at the end of the day what I think the world needs to know is you've got lawyers here who are filing lawsuit, giving false hope to families who have already been tragically hurt. And now they're going to say wait a minute, nothing is going to happen? Well, that's because you went down the wrong path.</p><p>VAUSE: Do you think it is false hope?</p><p>CLAYPOOL: I think it is false hope. You guys just hit the nail on the head. You've got to prove causation. Did this -- was this a substantial factor in causing Omar Mateen to do what he did? I doubt it.</p><p>VAUSE: Guys, thanks so much. I appreciate it.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: You bet.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: A short break. When we come back, a two-time Wimbledon champion says she is fortunate to be alive after surviving a knife attack. But will her tennis career ever be the same?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2016122117CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MFM-38R1-DXH2-62J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 21, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Terrorism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

I'm John Vause, live in Los Angeles. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR:  And I'm Max Foster, live in Berlin with the very latest on the investigation on the terror attack.  In the space behind me, the truck's been taken away but an intense search very much under way for the person who drove a truck into that crowded Christmas market.  Police had arrested a man near the scene on Monday night but later released him for lack of evidence.   Twelve people were killed and dozens more were injured.  German chancellor Angela Merkel visited the site and attended a memorial here. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, the attack has other cities on alert.  New York stepped up security at its holiday markets.  And Italy's interior minister ordered reinforced security at Christmas events in other crowded public spaces.  Now, Germany remains on alert as police search for those suspects.  Fred Pleitgen has the very latest details for you. </p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  A massive manhunt under way across Germany after the horrific truck attack on a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin.  ISIS now claiming to have inspired the attack.  The suspect or suspects still at large and armed and considered dangerous, as investigators released the man arrested after the attack. </p><p>Captured on cell phone video, the immediate aftermath of the attack that left 12 dead and more than 45 injured.  A truck with Polish registration and loaded with 25 tons of steel plowing into the outdoor market, dragging some pedestrians 50 to 80 meters, stopping only after knocking over a Christmas tree. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The truck just jumped the curb and took a wrong turn and barreled through the crowd. </p><p>PLEITGEN:  Inside the truck, the body of the trucks Polish driver. Berlin police say he was not at the wheel during the attack and appeared to have been shot to death.  The truck company's owner says his driver appeared to have fought with the attackers.  Within an hour of the attack police arrested a 23-year-old Pakistani immigrant.  And a somber Chancellor Angela Merkel addressing a stunned nation seized on the suspect's nationality. </p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (Interpreted):  We must assume that this was a terrorist attack.  I know that would be especially hard to bear for us if it was to be confirmed that the person who committed this act was given protection and asylum in Germany.  This would be especially disgusting. </p><p>PLEITGEN:  But police released the Pakistani man after prosecutors could not link him to the truck or the scene.  Merkel is facing a political backlash after Germany has taken in nearly 900,000 immigrants this year even as terror attacks are on the rise.  Now, investigators are in a race against time, fearful that whoever is on the run could launch another attack. </p><p>Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  All right, Guy Chazan is Berlin correspondent for the \"Financial Times.\"  He joins me via Skype.  Obviously, there must be a massive operation going on in Berlin and around Germany and in possibly Poland as well right now.  But we're not hearing anything, are we, from the security services? </p><p>GUY CHAZAN, FINANCIAL TIMES BERLIN CORRESPONDENT:  No.  I mean, there were interviews with police officials yesterday on German television. They were saying basically that they're quite confident that they can make some breakthroughs in this investigation because there is a lot of evidence.  They have loads of witness statements.  They have fingerprints from inside the cab.  They have DNA evidence from the truck.  They also have evidence from the GPS system of the vehicle as it was traveling between Poland and Germany. </p><p>So there is a lot to work with.  So they're pretty confident that they can sort of -- they can make progress on this investigation, but it could be also like finding a needle in a haystack.  I mean, the guy just slipped away and, you know, obviously all the attention was focused on the Pakistani man that was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the incident and now he's been released. </p><p>FOSTER:  And so they're on the back foot, aren't they, because whilst they're sitting in there interviewing him for hours and hours and hours they thought they had their man, it's pretty clear from Angela Merkel's press conference yesterday as well that she -- the information she had seemed to indicate that this Pakistani asylum seeker was the man as well and they were just sitting there whilst the guy got away.  I mean, there will be operational reasons for them being very quiet right now but perhaps they've learned their lesson about saying too much too soon yesterday. </p><p>[02:05:11] CHAZAN:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I think there was a sort of a lot of embarrassment yesterday I think in, in the press conferences of the various security officials and police officers as they sort of really admitted that they got the wrong man.  So I think they are on the back foot at the moment. One of the problems that they're encountering now is the fact that there's so little video surveillance in Berlin.  So there's really not much CCTV footage that they can work with.  Germany is not like Britain for example where there are CCTV cameras almost on every street corner.  Germany just lacks that kind of tradition.  There's been a lot of calls to toughen the rules on video monitoring since the terrorist attacks that we saw in Bavaria over the summer.  And those calls will now I think intensify. </p><p>And of course we're going to see a bit of a political backlash now against Angela Merkel and her refugee policy.  I think that's now going to creep back to the top of the political agenda after being in abeyance for a few months.  And she's going to have a lot of explaining to do. </p><p>But of course it is still early days.  We don't even know whether this was carried out by a refugee or, you know, someone -- or perhaps it was someone who actually, you know, lived and was born and grew up in Germany.  Who knows?  At this stage, it's just too early to tell. </p><p>FOSTER:  Well, ISIS claiming responsibility.  But they provided no evidence have they that this was a soldier of ISIS, whether directed by ISIS or just inspired by ISIS?  So they could just be being opportunistic on this one. </p><p>CHAZAN:  Exactly.  And officials have made the point that there's so far no video confession.  Normally when ISIS claim responsibility they also release a video which shows the terrorist admitting it and making a final, a final video sort of appeal.  But we haven't seen anything like that yet.  So as you say, this could be entirely opportunistic. I mean, again, after Nice we saw that it's wrong to jump to conclusions about these, these ISIS' statements.  So, so we'll see, we'll see how the investigation goes.  But so far officials are not ascribing too much importance to that statement from ISIS. </p><p>FOSTER:  The other thing that we often have when it's a very -- when there's military-style operations is that, the security services across Europe go into high alert and they just feels a higher level of tension across the, across the continent.  We don't really have that. It feels more low key than we've had before. </p><p>CHAZAN:  Yes.  That's definitely the case although it does appear that intelligence services in Germany and elsewhere in Europe are cooperating on this.  German media reports suggest that there is a high degree of cooperation on this particular case.  I supposes because, you know, Germany's borders are open and the perpetrator could easily have slipped across into one of the neighboring countries.  So Germany is definitely going to be needing help and cooperation from the intelligence services in other parts of the E.U. </p><p>FOSTER:  OK.  Thank you very much indeed for joining us Guy Chazan. We're following every step of this of course John.  We're just hoping that the fact the security services are being very quiet at this moment and not giving us any information is that they're on to something and they are being quiet for operational reasons. VAUSE: OK, and Max, thank you.  Max Foster, we'll catch up with you later this hour.  Joining me here in Los Angeles is CNN Law Enforcement Contributor Steve Moore.  Steve's also a retired special agent with the FBI.  And Steve, thank you for coming in. </p><p>STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>VAUSE:  Detaining and then releasing the wrong man.  It's a pretty big slip up by the German authorities there.  How big of an impact will this have on the manhunt right now?  What did not get done when they thought they had the right guy? </p><p>MOORE:  Think of evidence like sushi.  It doesn't last very long.  You don't want four-hour-old sushi.  You don't want four-hour-old evidence.  So while they were interrogating this person, evidence was spoiling, evidence was going away, evidence was dispersing.  So that cost them. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  So if you were look for this driver right now, where do you focus the search?  Could he still be in Germany?  Could he have left the country?  Are all these options on the table? </p><p>[02:10:03] MOORE:  Yeah.  All the options are on the table.  This is what's concerning for -- for me as an investigator, I wouldn't know really where to center it.  But you know that this driver was Polish and that he was, that he was dead inside the truck.  So you might be looking clear over to Poland.  And what you're going to want to do is follow that truck.  There's going to be cameras, there's going to be stops it would have to make for regulatory reasons.  You're going to look at the cameras and see who was driving it.  And at one point you're going to say he was driving either at the German border or he wasn't.  You're going to have to find him somewhere between Poland and Germany. </p><p>VAUSE:  Switch your way back essentially. </p><p>MOORE:  Yes. </p><p>VAUSE:  They're saying they're going through all the CCTV footage right now.  They're also asking for anyone who has cell phone video from the scene to bring it forward. </p><p>MOORE:  Yes. </p><p>VAUSE:  This is painstaking work but it has been effective.  In the past they did this in Boston after the Boston bombing.  Isn't that how they identified the Tsarnaev brothers? </p><p>MOORE:  I believe that's the case and I've done this, where you get this film, and it is agonizing.  It is painstaking.  And people say, well, you know, how long will that take?  Well, you may have, you know, for every, for every street corner, you might have 10 cameras on it.  So to look at an hour is going to take 10 hours because you have to look at each one.  So it takes forever to do that. </p><p>VAUSE:  In the meantime, would you suspect that the driver of the truck, would he have gone to ground somewhere?  Would he have a support network in Germany?  I mean, there's also a suspicion that he may not be alone. </p><p>MOORE:  My hunch, and it's only a hunch, but I'm at CNN to give you my thoughts. </p><p>VAUSE:  Exactly, that's why we have you here. </p><p>MOORE:  The -- my hunch is that this isn't one person.  One person gets their own truck or their own car.  Several people would be needed to overpower a driver, stop him somewhere, find a way to get it, and get it on the first time because we don't hear any other drivers saying somebody tried to hijack you.  They got it the first time.  So I'm guessing that there are several people involved in this and wherever -- whatever country you see this happening in where the truck was taken over, I would start looking there that's where your cell at least most likely is. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK, let's get to the claim of not necessarily responsibility but inspiration by ISIS.  Is it possible to know if that's just an opportunistic claim because they haven't really put any evidence forward to back it up? </p><p>MOORE:  Because they don't have any evidence.  I mean, ISIS -- whenever there's an attack, ISIS is watching CNN.  They are trying to figure out, oh, did somebody do that in our name?  And they're going to look, they're going to see what they've done in that area, see what kind of information they pushed out.  I mean, lately they've been pushing out information on truck attacks.  They looked at it, they probably are saying on the basis of everything we know this is probably us or people doing this in our name, therefore we're going to consider it inspired by us. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK, Steve, good to speak with you.  Thanks so much. </p><p>MOORE:  Good to talk with you. </p><p>VAUSE:  Twelve minutes past 11:00 here on the West Coast.  Time for a break.  When we come back, we are learning more about the police officer who assassinated Russia's ambassador to Turkey. </p><p>Also, the deadly fireworks explosion in Mexico.  Investigators are looking at whether the blast was deliberately set. You're watching CNN. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[02:15:05] DON RIDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR:  I'm Don Ridell with your CNN World Sport headlines.  The tennis star Petra Kvitova is recovering from a very serious knife attack at her home in the Czech Republic.  According to a police spokesman, a man was masquerading as a maintenance man when the attack occurred.  And in trying to protect herself the left-handed player suffered cuts to all five fingers on her left hand, also sustaining damage to nerves and tendons.  Late on Tuesday night, Petra's management team released an update, saying she's recovering from a three hour and 45-minute surgery as well as company expected considering the damage. </p><p>In football news, struggling premier league champions Leicester City will be without their striker Jamie Vardy for the next three games. That's after the football association upheld his red card against Stoke City.  Vardy was prolific in Leicester's title run last season and he was returning to form but he'll now miss the games against Everton, West Ham, and Middlesbrough. </p><p>In Germany, the mood is understandably tense after the terror attack in Berlin on Monday which saw a truck crash through a Christmas market killing 12 people.  But this week's Bundesliga games have gone ahead as scheduled.  Moments of silence were held before all four games on Tuesday.  And they will be held ahead of the top of the table clash between Bayern Munich and Leipzig on Wednesday. </p><p>That is a quick look at your sports headlines.  I'm Don Riddell. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>VAUSE:  Welcome back everybody.  A huge fireworks market in Mexico has been reduced to rubble.  A series of explosions tore through the crowded market on Tuesday, causing a frantic dash as people ran for their lives. CNN's Ed Lavandera reports. </p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The video images of the fireworks explosion in the town of Tultepec, Mexico which is just north of Mexico City, are simply staggering and horrifying to watch.  The video images showing the area where these explosions, these series of explosions went on and on, nearly three dozen people killed, more than 70 others injured. </p><p>The governor of the state where this town is tell CNN that three young children will be transported by plane to a hospital in Texas where they will be treated for their extreme burns.  So you can imagine that many of the other victims still grappling and dealing with these same types of wounds as well.  The burns could be a very serious issue for many of the victims and survivors of these explosions. </p><p>But the video images really capturing the drama and the intensity of the moment as people rushed to the scene to try to help what they could.  Video images from the ground also showing the scorched fireworks stand.  This is an open air market in the town of Tultepec and a town that is basically known as the fireworks capital of Mexico. </p><p>This is a huge industry in this town, and extremely popular especially this time of year as you head into the holiday season and New Year's festivities and that sort of thing.  So it will be very common for thousands of people to be walking through this open air market to see all of the elaborate fireworks displays and fireworks pyrotechnics that were on display. </p><p>The governor of that state also tells CNN that they are looking to determine whether or not this was deliberately set.  The exact cause has not been determined as emergency crews are still trying to sift through the scene looking for any kind of survivors and perhaps more victims of this, this explosion that's just seemed to go on and on, a horrifying scene in Mexico. </p><p>Ed Lavandera, CNN, Dallas. </p><p>VAUSE:  A Colombian cargo plane crashed minutes after takeoff killing five crew members.  Video shows the plane plowing through fences and scraping the ground moments before bursting into flames.  No word yet on what caused the crash.  The plane's flight technician survived. </p><p>Nineteen minutes past 11:00 here on Tuesday night.  Let's go back now to Max Foster in Berlin. </p><p>FOSTER:  Yeah, Wednesday morning here.  Following the attack on the Christmas market behind me.  They're hoping to reopen it as soon as possible, possibly today in a show of defiance against that terrorism. But we are also learning more about another attack.  And that's the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey.  The body of Ambassador Andrey Karlov has arrived in Moscow.  Seven people have been detained for questioning including the shooter's relatives and friends. </p><p>[02:20:04] Russian investigators are now in Turkey and Turkey State Media say books on Al Qaeda and a Gulen movement were found in the shooter's home.  Turkey blames the Gulen movement for July's coup attempt and now according to state-run media they say the Gulen group is behind the assassination.  Fethulla Gulen is condemning the attack however.  Our Nic Robertson spoke with a photographer who captured the horrific shooting.  We have to warn you his report contains graphic images. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURHAN OZBILICI, ASSOCIATED PRESS PHOTOGRAPHER:  I heard shots very loud.  Bam, bam, bam.  I said this is terrible (inaudible). </p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  What did you do? </p><p>OZBILICI:  Horrible.  So, the people standing in front, they disappeared.  They throw them on the floor.  Then, they try -- they were trying to hide them to take shelter. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Were you afraid? </p><p>OZBILICI:  I was shocked but -- I'm afraid but not much, not that panic. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Were you not afraid taken it?  You've got a camera, he's got a gun. </p><p>OZBILICI:  Well, I'm very sensitive and in difficult situation. I'm calm.  I said I have a responsibility to record this event.  And the ambassador was lying on the ground, not moving.  And guy was making some politically motivated speech but I could not understand.  I said, maybe he's speaking Russian, in Russian.  Some people were screaming and crying so, I could not hear well.  Then, he turned around the body and from very close range he shot one more time. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  On the ambassador? </p><p>OZBILICI:  Yes. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Just to make sure he was dead? </p><p>OZBILICI:  I think so.  When I learned that the guy was killed, I was very shocked.  Why they killed him?  He did nothing to take anybody hostage.  He was alone.  They have to capture him alive. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  They could have done. </p><p>OZBILICI:  I don't know, I don't know what is the reason -- motive behind. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  An incredible moment there.  Nic Robertson there, interviewing the photographer who captured those chilling images. Well, despite the ambassador's assassination, the three countries with the most influence in Syria met in Moscow.  The foreign ministers from Russia, Turkey, and Iran said they will work on finding a political solution to the brutal Syrian civil war.  They pledged to first secure a wider cease fire so that aid can be delivered.  Russia's foreigner minister says their plans will be most effective in dealing with the crisis. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (Interpreted):  I am sure that as we reach success in fighting terrorism, as we start the political process between Syrians with our help, as we reach success at these directions.  We will be able to formulate our common approach which will definitely be based on declared goals.  To win over terrorism, to restore territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence, and unity of Syria Arab republics.  We are united in that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  Turkey says meanwhile evacuations from Aleppo will be completed by Wednesday and that around 37,000 people have been rescued so far.  Earlier, I spoke to CNN Contributor and Former Moscow Bureau Chief Jill Dougherty about the foreign ministers meeting over there in Moscow. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  And when it comes to Russia, it's really solidifying their role in the Middle East.  I mean, this is, this very interesting because you know who's not at that meeting and that's the United States.  It's Iran, Russia, and Turkey, not the United States.  And that's very significant. </p><p>So, they're moving forward.  They have -- they're putting up a united front that is Turkey and Russia.  And they're making it -- the Russians are making it very clear that they don't feel that they need the Americans or maybe even want the Americans.  And are just moving forward on some type of resolution, what that will be precisely is not clear.  But you're right, Max -- I mean, the diplomacy is moving fast, and the Russians solidifying whatever gains they have. </p><p>FOSTER:  And how are the Americans viewing this?  As they move away from -- or, you know, distancing perhaps from the United States and moving more closely with a longer term relationship with Russia. </p><p>DOUGHERTY:  You know, there's not a lot I think that the United States can do right now.  President Obama has made it clear.  And he only has now, you know, a few weeks left in office.  That he is not going to take any type of major action in Syria.  And you have a new president coming in who has -- this is Mr. Trump, who's made clear that he feels that he could possibly work with Russia and possibly even work with President Bashar Al-Assad which seems unthinkable for us when you talk about unthinkable things, that certainly is that the United States or this president incoming would think of working with Bashar Al-Assad to fight terrorism. </p><p>[02:25:03] And that's the way Donald Trump looks at it, very black and white.  He feels that the Russians have taken the fight to the terrorists.  He wants to fight with the terrorists and defeat them. And that means that he can ally himself with Russia. </p><p>Now, when he comes into office, the details of that, how that would be done, and precisely what would happen, would Russia be leading the charge, would the Americans be following, none of those details are clear.  But the overall picture seems to be that, you know, Russians defining pretty much what's going on in Syria. </p><p>FOSTER:  And there's Donald Trump in a way with his sort of overtures to Russia, open the way for countries like Turkey to have closer relationships and build bridges with Russia? </p><p>DOUGHERTY:  Well, yes.  Although, I think that, you know, this rapprochement between Turkey and Russia really was entrained before Donald Trump entered the picture.  But certainly if the American president is friendly with Russia then it gives encouragement to other countries who see which way the wind is blowing to move in that direction. </p><p>I think you might see it Max, mostly significantly on the issue of sanctions, economic sanctions against Russia which were introduced by the United States and by Europe as a reaction to what Russia did in Ukraine and also the annexation of Korea -- of Crimea.  And so, if -- let's say, Donald Trump decided not to uphold the sanctions to weaken them or even get rid of them, that would give free rein to any other country especially some of the Europeans who wouldn't mind doing that, to simply go along.  So, his relationship with Russia could be kind of a bellwether for other nations.  This is not something traditional American foreign policy would necessarily accept, but this is the way it is with Mr. Trump. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  Jill Dougherty following the attack in Turkey. Still ahead though here, the German chancellor horrified and saddened by Monday's Berlin attack.  Now, her fellow citizens are trying to come to terms with the deadly rampage. </p><p>[02:27:23] Plus, U.S. President Barack Obama moves to cement his legacy ahead of the Trump administration. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[02:30:42] FOSTER: Well, a huge manhunt is under way here in Germany for the driver of that truck that barreled into a crowded Christmas market, and police arresting a man near the scene in Berlin on Monday night. But he was later released for lack of evidence. And official says there could be more than one suspect at large. </p><p>Twelve people were killed and dozens more were injured. Thousands of people attended a memorial for the victims of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. ISIS claiming it inspired the attack. Shocked Germans still trying to make sense of Monday's horrific attack, Erin McLaughlin has more on that. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPODENT: At the scene of unimaginable horror, a 25-ton tool of terror is slowly driven away, leaving behind unanswered questions and a country in shock. Nearby a makeshift memorial grows by the hour. Young and old, people of all faith, gather to mourn. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All over of 2016, we heard of all the terrible attacks that happened all over the world. And yesterday was a black day for human history. It's just depressing. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, and people go here to have a good evening. To have -- they drink wine and eat something and stay here, and with friends or family. And then they're dead after five minutes. It's shocking. Yes, it is. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: What remains of the Christmas market is eerily quiet. Children's rides stand still, and there's a heavy police presence. </p><p>Normally this Christmas market would be full of shoppers drinking spiced wine and looking for gifts but as you can see these kiosks are closed. As authorities look for answers and Berliners mourn their dead. </p><p>In the capital, a show of solidarity. At the memorial church, people gather to honor the dead. And officials prepared the country for the worst. </p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (Translator): I know that would be especially hard to bear for us. If it was to be confirmed that the person committed this act was given protection and asylum in Germany. This would be especially disgusting. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: German officials set free the asylum seeker they first arrested. No longer suspecting he perpetrated the attack. Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the church Tuesday, visibly shocked. It is Christmas week and the country has been shaken, and with it her political future. Erin Mclaughlin, CNN, Berlin. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER: We don't know whether it was an asylum seeker. We don't know anything about this attacker. ISIS claimed responsibility, but no evidence provided by them as to who their soldier is in their words. And nothing from the Security Services either. Presumably because they are look at this as an operational matter and they don't want to give anything away about their investigations, John. </p><p>JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Yeah Max, all they know is that he is out there, he is on the run, he could be dangerous and he might not be alone. </p><p>A Trump spokesman says the president-elect is closely monitoring the aftermath of the attacks about Germany and Turkey. But his team will not say if he is receiving regular intelligence briefings. Vice President-elect Mike Pence is taking the daily briefings. And the transition team says Trump will response forcefully to any attacks when he is president. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO-CLIP) </p><p>SEAN SPICER, CHIEF STRATEGIST AND COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, RNC: I think it's going to be swift and fierce. Mr. Trump has made it very, very clear he understands the threat that Radical Islamic terrorism poses to our nation and frankly to our friends and neighbors around the globe, and that we've got to be able to call it what it is and then root it out by its very -- by the bottom. We cannot be being politically correct. We've got to understand the threat that we face and attack it straight on. </p><p>(END VIDEO-CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE: Western couple held hostage by the Taliban since 2012 are begging President Obama and Donald Trump to help free them. Caitlin Coleman is American, her husband Joshua Boyle is Canadian. A new proof of life video which the Taliban says it released shows them with their two young children. They say their captors will retaliate against them if certain Afghan prisoners as being held in Kabul are punished. </p><p>Barack Obama has less than a month left in office, and it seems he's spending the final days trying to defend as much of his legacy as possible, while the incoming president has promised to dismantle as much as he can. CNN's Athena Jones has details. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[02:35:04] ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Obama moving to secure his legacy on the environment and beyond, before he hands the presidency to Donald Trump. Tonight new measures to bar offshore drilling indefinitely in the parts of the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean, in part to prevent environmental disasters like the B.P. Oil Spill. BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT: I share people's concerns about offshore drilling. I remember the B.P. Spill in the Gulf of Mexico all too well. </p><p>JONES: It's an issue that has been front and center for the president, who sees climate change as the greatest threat facing future generations. And believes the U.S. and the world must do more to combat it. </p><p>OBAMA: We're not moving fast enough. And for the sake of our kids we've got to keep going. America has to lead the world in transitioning to a clean energy economy. </p><p>JONES: President Obama's last-minute move is based on a 64-year-old law. Not an easily reversible executive order, creating a legal hurdle for the incoming president, a climate change skeptic, who has vowed to pull out of the Paris climate accords and to increase domestic energy production. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: Every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country, often, foreign countries not very friendly to us. </p><p>JONES: And the president isn't just taking action on the environment. He's also preparing to transfer an additional 17 or 18 inmates from the U.S. Prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to other countries, according to the \"New York Times\", slashing the remaining population there by nearly a third, though, stopping short of fulfilling his 2008 campaign promise to close the prison. </p><p>OBAMA: They will be judged harshly by history. And I will continue to do all that I can to remove this blot on our national honor. </p><p>JONES: President-elect Trump has promised to not only keep the prison open but to fill it up with quote, \"Some bad dudes.\" Obama also, this week granting clemency to 231 people, mostly drug offenders. The most ever in one day, bringing the total number to a new record for any presidency, the White House signaling there are more acts of clemency to come. All part of a broader criminal justice reform effort. These final moves aimed at solidifying his agenda. </p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: They're all issues that he's talked about a lot and that he's attempted to get action on but all three are issues where he has been extraordinarily frustrated and unable to really move congress. </p><p>JONES: The president running through the tape and presenting a series of direct challenges to Trump. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE: Thanks to CNN Correspondent Athena Jones for that report. It is 22 minutes before the top of the hour. We'll take a short break here. When we come back, the gunman behind the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history pledged allegiance to ISIS. Has some victims' families are blaming social media for the massacre, and they're taking it to court. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[02:41:17] VAUSE: The families of the victims from the Orlando nightclub shooting are suing some big tech companies accusing Twitter, Facebook and Google of providing material support to ISIS. For more on this, CNN Security Analyst Hemu Nigam and Criminal Defense Attorney Brian Claypool, thank you both for being here. </p><p>Let's look at the legal hurdles here first, Brian. The Communications Decency Act, essentially shields computer services from liability for content. So how does that work, and that's a pretty big hill to climb in this case, right? </p><p>BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINIAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, I would like to say it its insurmountable. I mean, when I first heard about a lawsuit, being filed as a result of the Orlando nightclub shooting, I thought that these families were going to be suing maybe law enforcement for not going in more quickly to get -- to shoot at Omar Mateen or possibly even the gun shop owner, or even possibly the FBI for not investigating. When I heard that they were suing internet companies, I thought of one thing, the Titanic, because these cases are sinking fast. </p><p>VAUSE: OK. But this law essentially gives a free pass to social media. I mean especially the site. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Yeah, but there was a law enact. A federal law ... </p><p>VAUSE: Yeah. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: ... in the United States enacted in 1996, to make it easy for you and the viewers, basically it says if somebody else posts information on the internet. The internet provider is not responsible ... </p><p>VAUSE: Right. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: ... for that data and that cannot be sued and be held civilly liable for that. One exception is if where there's Federal criminal activity. And I think that's what these families are trying to do. And they're trying to say that the internet providers were materially supporting ISIS. </p><p>VAUSE: And with that this is the twist of the case because the lawsuit is arguing by matching user content with targeted advertising. Somehow the social media site is providing its own novel content. So Hemu, explain, you know, the technical aspects to this. </p><p>HEMU NIGAM, INTERNET SECURITY ANALYST: Yeah, and I have to first say you mean, all our hearts go out to the families. We all feel that way. But that doesn't mean a lawsuit's going to solve that problem. And I think what Google -- Google is actually taking the lead on this. What they're doing is they're saying look, if you are looking for ISIS content, maybe you're somebody who might get recruited. There is advertising that comes up that takes you to places that you can get help or at least even for example see content of what happens when ISIS attacks such as what happened in the Berlin Christmas incident just two days ago, or yesterday. So Google is doing that. Twitter is actually doing a lot of things. And the companies are getting together and saying we're going to band forces and try to solve this problem not by ourselves but together and working with law enforcement. </p><p>VAUSE: But that right now the families are saying that there are researches, be it on Google, Facebook, or whatever, is what is essentially bringing all of this together, which it seems to be a novel legal approach, Brian. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Yeah. I mean, the only way I think these families can prevail in this case is if they've got some information, for example, that Twitter or Facebook was aware of some really nefarious postings that might incite terrorism and then they didn't do anything to remove those. Because then you're possibly facilitating this, you're on notice. Bear in mind, these internet providers don't have a duty to canvass the internet to find these postings. </p><p>VAUSE: OK, with that in mind, this lawsuit is also alleging that the tech companies should not do enough to shut down Jihadist groups. They use this example of an ISIS linked Twitter Account. This is for the suit, \"When its account @TurMedia332 was shut down, it started @TurMedia 334. When that was shutdown it started @TurMedia335. This naming convention adding one digit to a new account of the last one is suspended, does not seem as if it would require artificial intelligence to spot. Each of these accounts also uses and used the photograph of the bearded man's face over and over and over again\". </p><p>So, Henry, from a technical point it wouldn't be easy to Twitter. To simply stop this accounts from springing out over and over again? </p><p>[02:45:03] NIGAM: Well, here is the reality. First let's give Kudos to Twitter for deleting 360,000 accounts ... </p><p>VAUSE: Right. </p><p>NIGAM: ... in the first place. Knowing that these ISIS folks are going to try to come back and create denude accounts and do kind of a cat and mouse game. But that said, there's a new initiative happening right now between Google, Microsoft, and Twitter where they're going to be fingerprinting indicia of an ISIS account and then using it by sharing it amongst themselves in the data base and saying here's a new account coming up, it looks very much like, this has the fingerprints of these other accounts, and I think you're going to see those accounts even disappearing. </p><p>VAUSE: So just to be very clear. These are legal responsibility here for these companies not just to, you know, sort of mow the weeds but to pull the roots as well? </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Well, that's exactly right. I mean, well if they're notified of some of these accounts that might be inciting mass terrorism then they have a duty to remove those accounts. But John, really I think the point that I'm troubled with here is, is this really the cause of a guy like Omar Mateen going into a nightclub and shooting up people? I think people in the United States need to be paying attention more to red flags. That he went out and got a gun at a place where he shouldn't have gotten a gun. So I think that to me is the bigger issue. </p><p>VAUSE: But, you know, just because, you know, Mateen -- Omar Mateen may have seen these videos of this Jihadi content online, doesn't mean he was influenced by it. </p><p>NIGAM: No, not at all. He could be talking to 10,000 other people in off settings. A lot of times what ISIS recruiters do is, they may target one individual and then immediately go into an app conversation, a cell phone conversation, all these other kinds of things they're doing. So this is one of those where making the causal connection is never going to happen. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: That's exactly right. </p><p>NIGAM: And I think at the end of the day what I think the world needs to know is you've got lawyers here who are filing lawsuits, giving false hope to families who have already been tragically hurt. And now they're going to say wait a minute, nothing's going to happen? Well that's because you went down the wrong path. </p><p>VAUSE: Do you think it is false hope? </p><p>CLAYPOOL: I think it is false hope. You guys just hit the nail on the head. You've got to prove causation that this -- was this a substantial factor in causing Omar Mateen to do what he did? I doubt it. </p><p>VAUSE: Guys, thanks so much. Appreciate it. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Thanks, John. </p><p>NIGAM: Thanks, John. </p><p>VAUSE: Well, four officials linked to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan are now facing criminal charges. The state's attorney general has announced emergency services and water plan officials will face felony charges. It's alleged they misused millions of dollars in state funds and conspired to run the city's water treatment plant for more than a year when it wasn't safe for Flint residents to drink. Many residents later tested positive for lead poisoning, blamed on the contaminated water. </p><p>Well, still to come here, Czech Tennis Star Petra Kvitova shaken but lucky to be alive after surviving a knife attack, details just ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: This is CNN Weather Watch. I'm meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Will the cold air finally going to retreat for some folks in the U.S. It's going to begin to retreat. So areas of the northeast and the mid-Atlantic will actually find the start to get some temperatures back up a little bit compared to where they have been. [02:50:10] Now, that system that moved to through portions of Southern Canada into the northern plain of the U.S. and into the Midwest not a big snow maker and it's already starting to finish most of its track and continue off to the east. What we're really paying attention to is this next system that is like to have started to make way into the southwestern region of the United States, bringing some much-needed rain to areas of Southern California and also into Arizona. </p><p>Now, here is a look at the forecast. Cloudy conditions for Los Angeles. High temperature right around 21 already starting to see those clouds building in from the next system. New York, high temperature of six, mostly cloudy skies but as we talked about the warming trend maybe they're getting back close to double digits by the time we approached the weekend. Dallas, a high of 19 degrees with mostly sunny skies, likely to maintain relatively nice weather, even into Thursday and Friday, Kingston looking at mostly sunny skies, high temperature right around 30 degrees. Mexico City nice partly cloudy with a high temperature right into the low to mid 20s where it will remain through the week. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>VAUSE: A two-time Wimbledon Champion has a long road to recovery ahead. Petra Kvitova was stabbed during a robbery in her apartment. The tennis star has now undergone hours of surgery on her main playing hand. World Sport's Anchor Don Riddell has details. </p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, but the sounds of it Petra Kvitova is very lucky to be alive but it remains to be seen how this will affect her ability to continue playing the game she loves. Kvitova is one of the best players in the world. She's one of the most respected athletes on the tour. And echoing the left-handed style of her compatriot Martina Navratilova, Kvitova was the Wimbledon champion in 2011 and 2014. But on Tuesday morning she was eating breakfast at home when a man tricked his way into her apartment. </p><p>According to a police spokesman, this man was masquerading as a maintenance man but then once inside he went on the attack. Kvitova suffered cuts to all five fingers on her left hand, also sustaining damage to her tendons and nerves. Her assailant fled the scene. Remarkably, Kvitova was able to update her condition on social media, saying \"In my attempt to defend myself, I was badly injured on my left hand. I'm shaken but fortunate to be alive. The injury is severe, and I will need to see specialists, but if you know anything about me, I'm strong, and I will fight this. Thank you all again for your love and support\". </p><p>Well, late on Tuesday night, Petra's management team released an update on her surgery. And the details frankly are pretty sobering. It reads, \"Petra has undergone surgery for three hours and 45 minutes. Considering the extent of the damage, the surgery went very well. Doctors repaired damage to tendons in all five digits of the left hand as well as two nerves. Petra will wear a cast on her hand for six to eight weeks and will be unable to bear weight for three months. </p><p>The circumstances are very different but it is hard not to think about Monica Seles right now. She was in the prime of her career when she was brutally knifed in the back during a match in Germany. Seles recovered two years later and in fact she won another major title. But honestly she was never the same again. Today's news really has sent shock waves through the tennis community. Martina Navratilova who Kvitova idolize, she's wrote on twitter \"Just finding out about Petra Kvitova and the awful stabbing and injury to her hand. Pulling for you, Petra.\" And Caroline Wozniacki said, \"Just heard what happened. All my thoughts are with her today. So scary. One of the nicest people I know.\" For sure the tennis community and sports fans worldwide are spending their best wishes to Petra Kvitova. It remains to be seen just how serious this is going to be. But we do wish her the very best. Back to you. </p><p>[02:55:10] VAUSE: Don Riddell, thank you. And tributes are being left around Berlin to honor the victims of Monday's attack. The Brandenburg Gate, one of Berlin's iconic landmarks lit up with colors of the German flag. In one vigil dozens held hands to form a human chain. And near the scene of the attack mourners left candles and flowers at makeshift memorials along with messages of support and condolence. </p><p>Much more from Berlin with my colleague Max Foster in just a few moments. I'm John Vause. Thank you for watching \"CNN NEWSROOM\", live from Los Angeles. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>FOSTER: Manhunt.

I'm John Vause, live in Los Angeles. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR:  And I'm Max Foster, live in Berlin with the very latest on the investigation on the terror attack.  In the space behind me, the truck's been taken away but an intense search very much under way for the person who drove a truck into that crowded Christmas market.  Police had arrested a man near the scene on Monday night but later released him for lack of evidence.   Twelve people were killed and dozens more were injured.  German chancellor Angela Merkel visited the site and attended a memorial here. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, the attack has other cities on alert.  New York stepped up security at its holiday markets.  And Italy's interior minister ordered reinforced security at Christmas events in other crowded public spaces.  Now, Germany remains on alert as police search for those suspects.  Fred Pleitgen has the very latest details for you. </p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  A massive manhunt under way across Germany after the horrific truck attack on a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin.  ISIS now claiming to have inspired the attack.  The suspect or suspects still at large and armed and considered dangerous, as investigators released the man arrested after the attack. </p><p>Captured on cell phone video, the immediate aftermath of the attack that left 12 dead and more than 45 injured.  A truck with Polish registration and loaded with 25 tons of steel plowing into the outdoor market, dragging some pedestrians 50 to 80 meters, stopping only after knocking over a Christmas tree. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The truck just jumped the curb and took a wrong turn and barreled through the crowd. </p><p>PLEITGEN:  Inside the truck, the body of the trucks Polish driver. Berlin police say he was not at the wheel during the attack and appeared to have been shot to death.  The truck company's owner says his driver appeared to have fought with the attackers.  Within an hour of the attack police arrested a 23-year-old Pakistani immigrant.  And a somber Chancellor Angela Merkel addressing a stunned nation seized on the suspect's nationality. </p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (Interpreted):  We must assume that this was a terrorist attack.  I know that would be especially hard to bear for us if it was to be confirmed that the person who committed this act was given protection and asylum in Germany.  This would be especially disgusting. </p><p>PLEITGEN:  But police released the Pakistani man after prosecutors could not link him to the truck or the scene.  Merkel is facing a political backlash after Germany has taken in nearly 900,000 immigrants this year even as terror attacks are on the rise.  Now, investigators are in a race against time, fearful that whoever is on the run could launch another attack. </p><p>Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  All right, Guy Chazan is Berlin correspondent for the \"Financial Times.\"  He joins me via Skype.  Obviously, there must be a massive operation going on in Berlin and around Germany and in possibly Poland as well right now.  But we're not hearing anything, are we, from the security services? </p><p>GUY CHAZAN, FINANCIAL TIMES BERLIN CORRESPONDENT:  No.  I mean, there were interviews with police officials yesterday on German television. They were saying basically that they're quite confident that they can make some breakthroughs in this investigation because there is a lot of evidence.  They have loads of witness statements.  They have fingerprints from inside the cab.  They have DNA evidence from the truck.  They also have evidence from the GPS system of the vehicle as it was traveling between Poland and Germany. </p><p>So there is a lot to work with.  So they're pretty confident that they can sort of -- they can make progress on this investigation, but it could be also like finding a needle in a haystack.  I mean, the guy just slipped away and, you know, obviously all the attention was focused on the Pakistani man that was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the incident and now he's been released. </p><p>FOSTER:  And so they're on the back foot, aren't they, because whilst they're sitting in there interviewing him for hours and hours and hours they thought they had their man, it's pretty clear from Angela Merkel's press conference yesterday as well that she -- the information she had seemed to indicate that this Pakistani asylum seeker was the man as well and they were just sitting there whilst the guy got away.  I mean, there will be operational reasons for them being very quiet right now but perhaps they've learned their lesson about saying too much too soon yesterday. </p><p>[02:05:11] CHAZAN:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I think there was a sort of a lot of embarrassment yesterday I think in, in the press conferences of the various security officials and police officers as they sort of really admitted that they got the wrong man.  So I think they are on the back foot at the moment. One of the problems that they're encountering now is the fact that there's so little video surveillance in Berlin.  So there's really not much CCTV footage that they can work with.  Germany is not like Britain for example where there are CCTV cameras almost on every street corner.  Germany just lacks that kind of tradition.  There's been a lot of calls to toughen the rules on video monitoring since the terrorist attacks that we saw in Bavaria over the summer.  And those calls will now I think intensify. </p><p>And of course we're going to see a bit of a political backlash now against Angela Merkel and her refugee policy.  I think that's now going to creep back to the top of the political agenda after being in abeyance for a few months.  And she's going to have a lot of explaining to do. </p><p>But of course it is still early days.  We don't even know whether this was carried out by a refugee or, you know, someone -- or perhaps it was someone who actually, you know, lived and was born and grew up in Germany.  Who knows?  At this stage, it's just too early to tell. </p><p>FOSTER:  Well, ISIS claiming responsibility.  But they provided no evidence have they that this was a soldier of ISIS, whether directed by ISIS or just inspired by ISIS?  So they could just be being opportunistic on this one. </p><p>CHAZAN:  Exactly.  And officials have made the point that there's so far no video confession.  Normally when ISIS claim responsibility they also release a video which shows the terrorist admitting it and making a final, a final video sort of appeal.  But we haven't seen anything like that yet.  So as you say, this could be entirely opportunistic. I mean, again, after Nice we saw that it's wrong to jump to conclusions about these, these ISIS' statements.  So, so we'll see, we'll see how the investigation goes.  But so far officials are not ascribing too much importance to that statement from ISIS. </p><p>FOSTER:  The other thing that we often have when it's a very -- when there's military-style operations is that, the security services across Europe go into high alert and they just feels a higher level of tension across the, across the continent.  We don't really have that. It feels more low key than we've had before. </p><p>CHAZAN:  Yes.  That's definitely the case although it does appear that intelligence services in Germany and elsewhere in Europe are cooperating on this.  German media reports suggest that there is a high degree of cooperation on this particular case.  I supposes because, you know, Germany's borders are open and the perpetrator could easily have slipped across into one of the neighboring countries.  So Germany is definitely going to be needing help and cooperation from the intelligence services in other parts of the E.U. </p><p>FOSTER:  OK.  Thank you very much indeed for joining us Guy Chazan. We're following every step of this of course John.  We're just hoping that the fact the security services are being very quiet at this moment and not giving us any information is that they're on to something and they are being quiet for operational reasons. VAUSE: OK, and Max, thank you.  Max Foster, we'll catch up with you later this hour.  Joining me here in Los Angeles is CNN Law Enforcement Contributor Steve Moore.  Steve's also a retired special agent with the FBI.  And Steve, thank you for coming in. </p><p>STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>VAUSE:  Detaining and then releasing the wrong man.  It's a pretty big slip up by the German authorities there.  How big of an impact will this have on the manhunt right now?  What did not get done when they thought they had the right guy? </p><p>MOORE:  Think of evidence like sushi.  It doesn't last very long.  You don't want four-hour-old sushi.  You don't want four-hour-old evidence.  So while they were interrogating this person, evidence was spoiling, evidence was going away, evidence was dispersing.  So that cost them. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  So if you were look for this driver right now, where do you focus the search?  Could he still be in Germany?  Could he have left the country?  Are all these options on the table? </p><p>[02:10:03] MOORE:  Yeah.  All the options are on the table.  This is what's concerning for -- for me as an investigator, I wouldn't know really where to center it.  But you know that this driver was Polish and that he was, that he was dead inside the truck.  So you might be looking clear over to Poland.  And what you're going to want to do is follow that truck.  There's going to be cameras, there's going to be stops it would have to make for regulatory reasons.  You're going to look at the cameras and see who was driving it.  And at one point you're going to say he was driving either at the German border or he wasn't.  You're going to have to find him somewhere between Poland and Germany. </p><p>VAUSE:  Switch your way back essentially. </p><p>MOORE:  Yes. </p><p>VAUSE:  They're saying they're going through all the CCTV footage right now.  They're also asking for anyone who has cell phone video from the scene to bring it forward. </p><p>MOORE:  Yes. </p><p>VAUSE:  This is painstaking work but it has been effective.  In the past they did this in Boston after the Boston bombing.  Isn't that how they identified the Tsarnaev brothers? </p><p>MOORE:  I believe that's the case and I've done this, where you get this film, and it is agonizing.  It is painstaking.  And people say, well, you know, how long will that take?  Well, you may have, you know, for every, for every street corner, you might have 10 cameras on it.  So to look at an hour is going to take 10 hours because you have to look at each one.  So it takes forever to do that. </p><p>VAUSE:  In the meantime, would you suspect that the driver of the truck, would he have gone to ground somewhere?  Would he have a support network in Germany?  I mean, there's also a suspicion that he may not be alone. </p><p>MOORE:  My hunch, and it's only a hunch, but I'm at CNN to give you my thoughts. </p><p>VAUSE:  Exactly, that's why we have you here. </p><p>MOORE:  The -- my hunch is that this isn't one person.  One person gets their own truck or their own car.  Several people would be needed to overpower a driver, stop him somewhere, find a way to get it, and get it on the first time because we don't hear any other drivers saying somebody tried to hijack you.  They got it the first time.  So I'm guessing that there are several people involved in this and wherever -- whatever country you see this happening in where the truck was taken over, I would start looking there that's where your cell at least most likely is. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK, let's get to the claim of not necessarily responsibility but inspiration by ISIS.  Is it possible to know if that's just an opportunistic claim because they haven't really put any evidence forward to back it up? </p><p>MOORE:  Because they don't have any evidence.  I mean, ISIS -- whenever there's an attack, ISIS is watching CNN.  They are trying to figure out, oh, did somebody do that in our name?  And they're going to look, they're going to see what they've done in that area, see what kind of information they pushed out.  I mean, lately they've been pushing out information on truck attacks.  They looked at it, they probably are saying on the basis of everything we know this is probably us or people doing this in our name, therefore we're going to consider it inspired by us. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK, Steve, good to speak with you.  Thanks so much. </p><p>MOORE:  Good to talk with you. </p><p>VAUSE:  Twelve minutes past 11:00 here on the West Coast.  Time for a break.  When we come back, we are learning more about the police officer who assassinated Russia's ambassador to Turkey. </p><p>Also, the deadly fireworks explosion in Mexico.  Investigators are looking at whether the blast was deliberately set. You're watching CNN. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[02:15:05] DON RIDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR:  I'm Don Ridell with your CNN World Sport headlines.  The tennis star Petra Kvitova is recovering from a very serious knife attack at her home in the Czech Republic.  According to a police spokesman, a man was masquerading as a maintenance man when the attack occurred.  And in trying to protect herself the left-handed player suffered cuts to all five fingers on her left hand, also sustaining damage to nerves and tendons.  Late on Tuesday night, Petra's management team released an update, saying she's recovering from a three hour and 45-minute surgery as well as company expected considering the damage. </p><p>In football news, struggling premier league champions Leicester City will be without their striker Jamie Vardy for the next three games. That's after the football association upheld his red card against Stoke City.  Vardy was prolific in Leicester's title run last season and he was returning to form but he'll now miss the games against Everton, West Ham, and Middlesbrough. </p><p>In Germany, the mood is understandably tense after the terror attack in Berlin on Monday which saw a truck crash through a Christmas market killing 12 people.  But this week's Bundesliga games have gone ahead as scheduled.  Moments of silence were held before all four games on Tuesday.  And they will be held ahead of the top of the table clash between Bayern Munich and Leipzig on Wednesday. </p><p>That is a quick look at your sports headlines.  I'm Don Riddell. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>VAUSE:  Welcome back everybody.  A huge fireworks market in Mexico has been reduced to rubble.  A series of explosions tore through the crowded market on Tuesday, causing a frantic dash as people ran for their lives. CNN's Ed Lavandera reports. </p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The video images of the fireworks explosion in the town of Tultepec, Mexico which is just north of Mexico City, are simply staggering and horrifying to watch.  The video images showing the area where these explosions, these series of explosions went on and on, nearly three dozen people killed, more than 70 others injured. </p><p>The governor of the state where this town is tell CNN that three young children will be transported by plane to a hospital in Texas where they will be treated for their extreme burns.  So you can imagine that many of the other victims still grappling and dealing with these same types of wounds as well.  The burns could be a very serious issue for many of the victims and survivors of these explosions. </p><p>But the video images really capturing the drama and the intensity of the moment as people rushed to the scene to try to help what they could.  Video images from the ground also showing the scorched fireworks stand.  This is an open air market in the town of Tultepec and a town that is basically known as the fireworks capital of Mexico. </p><p>This is a huge industry in this town, and extremely popular especially this time of year as you head into the holiday season and New Year's festivities and that sort of thing.  So it will be very common for thousands of people to be walking through this open air market to see all of the elaborate fireworks displays and fireworks pyrotechnics that were on display. </p><p>The governor of that state also tells CNN that they are looking to determine whether or not this was deliberately set.  The exact cause has not been determined as emergency crews are still trying to sift through the scene looking for any kind of survivors and perhaps more victims of this, this explosion that's just seemed to go on and on, a horrifying scene in Mexico. </p><p>Ed Lavandera, CNN, Dallas. </p><p>VAUSE:  A Colombian cargo plane crashed minutes after takeoff killing five crew members.  Video shows the plane plowing through fences and scraping the ground moments before bursting into flames.  No word yet on what caused the crash.  The plane's flight technician survived. </p><p>Nineteen minutes past 11:00 here on Tuesday night.  Let's go back now to Max Foster in Berlin. </p><p>FOSTER:  Yeah, Wednesday morning here.  Following the attack on the Christmas market behind me.  They're hoping to reopen it as soon as possible, possibly today in a show of defiance against that terrorism. But we are also learning more about another attack.  And that's the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey.  The body of Ambassador Andrey Karlov has arrived in Moscow.  Seven people have been detained for questioning including the shooter's relatives and friends. </p><p>[02:20:04] Russian investigators are now in Turkey and Turkey State Media say books on Al Qaeda and a Gulen movement were found in the shooter's home.  Turkey blames the Gulen movement for July's coup attempt and now according to state-run media they say the Gulen group is behind the assassination.  Fethulla Gulen is condemning the attack however.  Our Nic Robertson spoke with a photographer who captured the horrific shooting.  We have to warn you his report contains graphic images. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURHAN OZBILICI, ASSOCIATED PRESS PHOTOGRAPHER:  I heard shots very loud.  Bam, bam, bam.  I said this is terrible (inaudible). </p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  What did you do? </p><p>OZBILICI:  Horrible.  So, the people standing in front, they disappeared.  They throw them on the floor.  Then, they try -- they were trying to hide them to take shelter. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Were you afraid? </p><p>OZBILICI:  I was shocked but -- I'm afraid but not much, not that panic. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Were you not afraid taken it?  You've got a camera, he's got a gun. </p><p>OZBILICI:  Well, I'm very sensitive and in difficult situation. I'm calm.  I said I have a responsibility to record this event.  And the ambassador was lying on the ground, not moving.  And guy was making some politically motivated speech but I could not understand.  I said, maybe he's speaking Russian, in Russian.  Some people were screaming and crying so, I could not hear well.  Then, he turned around the body and from very close range he shot one more time. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  On the ambassador? </p><p>OZBILICI:  Yes. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Just to make sure he was dead? </p><p>OZBILICI:  I think so.  When I learned that the guy was killed, I was very shocked.  Why they killed him?  He did nothing to take anybody hostage.  He was alone.  They have to capture him alive. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  They could have done. </p><p>OZBILICI:  I don't know, I don't know what is the reason -- motive behind. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  An incredible moment there.  Nic Robertson there, interviewing the photographer who captured those chilling images. Well, despite the ambassador's assassination, the three countries with the most influence in Syria met in Moscow.  The foreign ministers from Russia, Turkey, and Iran said they will work on finding a political solution to the brutal Syrian civil war.  They pledged to first secure a wider cease fire so that aid can be delivered.  Russia's foreigner minister says their plans will be most effective in dealing with the crisis. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (Interpreted):  I am sure that as we reach success in fighting terrorism, as we start the political process between Syrians with our help, as we reach success at these directions.  We will be able to formulate our common approach which will definitely be based on declared goals.  To win over terrorism, to restore territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence, and unity of Syria Arab republics.  We are united in that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  Turkey says meanwhile evacuations from Aleppo will be completed by Wednesday and that around 37,000 people have been rescued so far.  Earlier, I spoke to CNN Contributor and Former Moscow Bureau Chief Jill Dougherty about the foreign ministers meeting over there in Moscow. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  And when it comes to Russia, it's really solidifying their role in the Middle East.  I mean, this is, this very interesting because you know who's not at that meeting and that's the United States.  It's Iran, Russia, and Turkey, not the United States.  And that's very significant. </p><p>So, they're moving forward.  They have -- they're putting up a united front that is Turkey and Russia.  And they're making it -- the Russians are making it very clear that they don't feel that they need the Americans or maybe even want the Americans.  And are just moving forward on some type of resolution, what that will be precisely is not clear.  But you're right, Max -- I mean, the diplomacy is moving fast, and the Russians solidifying whatever gains they have. </p><p>FOSTER:  And how are the Americans viewing this?  As they move away from -- or, you know, distancing perhaps from the United States and moving more closely with a longer term relationship with Russia. </p><p>DOUGHERTY:  You know, there's not a lot I think that the United States can do right now.  President Obama has made it clear.  And he only has now, you know, a few weeks left in office.  That he is not going to take any type of major action in Syria.  And you have a new president coming in who has -- this is Mr. Trump, who's made clear that he feels that he could possibly work with Russia and possibly even work with President Bashar Al-Assad which seems unthinkable for us when you talk about unthinkable things, that certainly is that the United States or this president incoming would think of working with Bashar Al-Assad to fight terrorism. </p><p>[02:25:03] And that's the way Donald Trump looks at it, very black and white.  He feels that the Russians have taken the fight to the terrorists.  He wants to fight with the terrorists and defeat them. And that means that he can ally himself with Russia. </p><p>Now, when he comes into office, the details of that, how that would be done, and precisely what would happen, would Russia be leading the charge, would the Americans be following, none of those details are clear.  But the overall picture seems to be that, you know, Russians defining pretty much what's going on in Syria. </p><p>FOSTER:  And there's Donald Trump in a way with his sort of overtures to Russia, open the way for countries like Turkey to have closer relationships and build bridges with Russia? </p><p>DOUGHERTY:  Well, yes.  Although, I think that, you know, this rapprochement between Turkey and Russia really was entrained before Donald Trump entered the picture.  But certainly if the American president is friendly with Russia then it gives encouragement to other countries who see which way the wind is blowing to move in that direction. </p><p>I think you might see it Max, mostly significantly on the issue of sanctions, economic sanctions against Russia which were introduced by the United States and by Europe as a reaction to what Russia did in Ukraine and also the annexation of Korea -- of Crimea.  And so, if -- let's say, Donald Trump decided not to uphold the sanctions to weaken them or even get rid of them, that would give free rein to any other country especially some of the Europeans who wouldn't mind doing that, to simply go along.  So, his relationship with Russia could be kind of a bellwether for other nations.  This is not something traditional American foreign policy would necessarily accept, but this is the way it is with Mr. Trump. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  Jill Dougherty following the attack in Turkey. Still ahead though here, the German chancellor horrified and saddened by Monday's Berlin attack.  Now, her fellow citizens are trying to come to terms with the deadly rampage. </p><p>[02:27:23] Plus, U.S. President Barack Obama moves to cement his legacy ahead of the Trump administration. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[02:30:42] FOSTER: Well, a huge manhunt is under way here in Germany for the driver of that truck that barreled into a crowded Christmas market, and police arresting a man near the scene in Berlin on Monday night. But he was later released for lack of evidence. And official says there could be more than one suspect at large. </p><p>Twelve people were killed and dozens more were injured. Thousands of people attended a memorial for the victims of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. ISIS claiming it inspired the attack. Shocked Germans still trying to make sense of Monday's horrific attack, Erin McLaughlin has more on that. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPODENT: At the scene of unimaginable horror, a 25-ton tool of terror is slowly driven away, leaving behind unanswered questions and a country in shock. Nearby a makeshift memorial grows by the hour. Young and old, people of all faith, gather to mourn. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All over of 2016, we heard of all the terrible attacks that happened all over the world. And yesterday was a black day for human history. It's just depressing. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, and people go here to have a good evening. To have -- they drink wine and eat something and stay here, and with friends or family. And then they're dead after five minutes. It's shocking. Yes, it is. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: What remains of the Christmas market is eerily quiet. Children's rides stand still, and there's a heavy police presence. </p><p>Normally this Christmas market would be full of shoppers drinking spiced wine and looking for gifts but as you can see these kiosks are closed. As authorities look for answers and Berliners mourn their dead. </p><p>In the capital, a show of solidarity. At the memorial church, people gather to honor the dead. And officials prepared the country for the worst. </p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (Translator): I know that would be especially hard to bear for us. If it was to be confirmed that the person committed this act was given protection and asylum in Germany. This would be especially disgusting. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: German officials set free the asylum seeker they first arrested. No longer suspecting he perpetrated the attack. Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the church Tuesday, visibly shocked. It is Christmas week and the country has been shaken, and with it her political future. Erin Mclaughlin, CNN, Berlin. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER: We don't know whether it was an asylum seeker. We don't know anything about this attacker. ISIS claimed responsibility, but no evidence provided by them as to who their soldier is in their words. And nothing from the Security Services either. Presumably because they are look at this as an operational matter and they don't want to give anything away about their investigations, John. </p><p>JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Yeah Max, all they know is that he is out there, he is on the run, he could be dangerous and he might not be alone. </p><p>A Trump spokesman says the president-elect is closely monitoring the aftermath of the attacks about Germany and Turkey. But his team will not say if he is receiving regular intelligence briefings. Vice President-elect Mike Pence is taking the daily briefings. And the transition team says Trump will response forcefully to any attacks when he is president. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO-CLIP) </p><p>SEAN SPICER, CHIEF STRATEGIST AND COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, RNC: I think it's going to be swift and fierce. Mr. Trump has made it very, very clear he understands the threat that Radical Islamic terrorism poses to our nation and frankly to our friends and neighbors around the globe, and that we've got to be able to call it what it is and then root it out by its very -- by the bottom. We cannot be being politically correct. We've got to understand the threat that we face and attack it straight on. </p><p>(END VIDEO-CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE: Western couple held hostage by the Taliban since 2012 are begging President Obama and Donald Trump to help free them. Caitlin Coleman is American, her husband Joshua Boyle is Canadian. A new proof of life video which the Taliban says it released shows them with their two young children. They say their captors will retaliate against them if certain Afghan prisoners as being held in Kabul are punished. </p><p>Barack Obama has less than a month left in office, and it seems he's spending the final days trying to defend as much of his legacy as possible, while the incoming president has promised to dismantle as much as he can. CNN's Athena Jones has details. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[02:35:04] ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Obama moving to secure his legacy on the environment and beyond, before he hands the presidency to Donald Trump. Tonight new measures to bar offshore drilling indefinitely in the parts of the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean, in part to prevent environmental disasters like the B.P. Oil Spill. BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT: I share people's concerns about offshore drilling. I remember the B.P. Spill in the Gulf of Mexico all too well. </p><p>JONES: It's an issue that has been front and center for the president, who sees climate change as the greatest threat facing future generations. And believes the U.S. and the world must do more to combat it. </p><p>OBAMA: We're not moving fast enough. And for the sake of our kids we've got to keep going. America has to lead the world in transitioning to a clean energy economy. </p><p>JONES: President Obama's last-minute move is based on a 64-year-old law. Not an easily reversible executive order, creating a legal hurdle for the incoming president, a climate change skeptic, who has vowed to pull out of the Paris climate accords and to increase domestic energy production. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: Every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country, often, foreign countries not very friendly to us. </p><p>JONES: And the president isn't just taking action on the environment. He's also preparing to transfer an additional 17 or 18 inmates from the U.S. Prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to other countries, according to the \"New York Times\", slashing the remaining population there by nearly a third, though, stopping short of fulfilling his 2008 campaign promise to close the prison. </p><p>OBAMA: They will be judged harshly by history. And I will continue to do all that I can to remove this blot on our national honor. </p><p>JONES: President-elect Trump has promised to not only keep the prison open but to fill it up with quote, \"Some bad dudes.\" Obama also, this week granting clemency to 231 people, mostly drug offenders. The most ever in one day, bringing the total number to a new record for any presidency, the White House signaling there are more acts of clemency to come. All part of a broader criminal justice reform effort. These final moves aimed at solidifying his agenda. </p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: They're all issues that he's talked about a lot and that he's attempted to get action on but all three are issues where he has been extraordinarily frustrated and unable to really move congress. </p><p>JONES: The president running through the tape and presenting a series of direct challenges to Trump. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE: Thanks to CNN Correspondent Athena Jones for that report. It is 22 minutes before the top of the hour. We'll take a short break here. When we come back, the gunman behind the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history pledged allegiance to ISIS. Has some victims' families are blaming social media for the massacre, and they're taking it to court. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[02:41:17] VAUSE: The families of the victims from the Orlando nightclub shooting are suing some big tech companies accusing Twitter, Facebook and Google of providing material support to ISIS. For more on this, CNN Security Analyst Hemu Nigam and Criminal Defense Attorney Brian Claypool, thank you both for being here. </p><p>Let's look at the legal hurdles here first, Brian. The Communications Decency Act, essentially shields computer services from liability for content. So how does that work, and that's a pretty big hill to climb in this case, right? </p><p>BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINIAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, I would like to say it its insurmountable. I mean, when I first heard about a lawsuit, being filed as a result of the Orlando nightclub shooting, I thought that these families were going to be suing maybe law enforcement for not going in more quickly to get -- to shoot at Omar Mateen or possibly even the gun shop owner, or even possibly the FBI for not investigating. When I heard that they were suing internet companies, I thought of one thing, the Titanic, because these cases are sinking fast. </p><p>VAUSE: OK. But this law essentially gives a free pass to social media. I mean especially the site. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Yeah, but there was a law enact. A federal law ... </p><p>VAUSE: Yeah. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: ... in the United States enacted in 1996, to make it easy for you and the viewers, basically it says if somebody else posts information on the internet. The internet provider is not responsible ... </p><p>VAUSE: Right. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: ... for that data and that cannot be sued and be held civilly liable for that. One exception is if where there's Federal criminal activity. And I think that's what these families are trying to do. And they're trying to say that the internet providers were materially supporting ISIS. </p><p>VAUSE: And with that this is the twist of the case because the lawsuit is arguing by matching user content with targeted advertising. Somehow the social media site is providing its own novel content. So Hemu, explain, you know, the technical aspects to this. </p><p>HEMU NIGAM, INTERNET SECURITY ANALYST: Yeah, and I have to first say you mean, all our hearts go out to the families. We all feel that way. But that doesn't mean a lawsuit's going to solve that problem. And I think what Google -- Google is actually taking the lead on this. What they're doing is they're saying look, if you are looking for ISIS content, maybe you're somebody who might get recruited. There is advertising that comes up that takes you to places that you can get help or at least even for example see content of what happens when ISIS attacks such as what happened in the Berlin Christmas incident just two days ago, or yesterday. So Google is doing that. Twitter is actually doing a lot of things. And the companies are getting together and saying we're going to band forces and try to solve this problem not by ourselves but together and working with law enforcement. </p><p>VAUSE: But that right now the families are saying that there are researches, be it on Google, Facebook, or whatever, is what is essentially bringing all of this together, which it seems to be a novel legal approach, Brian. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Yeah. I mean, the only way I think these families can prevail in this case is if they've got some information, for example, that Twitter or Facebook was aware of some really nefarious postings that might incite terrorism and then they didn't do anything to remove those. Because then you're possibly facilitating this, you're on notice. Bear in mind, these internet providers don't have a duty to canvass the internet to find these postings. </p><p>VAUSE: OK, with that in mind, this lawsuit is also alleging that the tech companies should not do enough to shut down Jihadist groups. They use this example of an ISIS linked Twitter Account. This is for the suit, \"When its account @TurMedia332 was shut down, it started @TurMedia 334. When that was shutdown it started @TurMedia335. This naming convention adding one digit to a new account of the last one is suspended, does not seem as if it would require artificial intelligence to spot. Each of these accounts also uses and used the photograph of the bearded man's face over and over and over again\". </p><p>So, Henry, from a technical point it wouldn't be easy to Twitter. To simply stop this accounts from springing out over and over again? </p><p>[02:45:03] NIGAM: Well, here is the reality. First let's give Kudos to Twitter for deleting 360,000 accounts ... </p><p>VAUSE: Right. </p><p>NIGAM: ... in the first place. Knowing that these ISIS folks are going to try to come back and create denude accounts and do kind of a cat and mouse game. But that said, there's a new initiative happening right now between Google, Microsoft, and Twitter where they're going to be fingerprinting indicia of an ISIS account and then using it by sharing it amongst themselves in the data base and saying here's a new account coming up, it looks very much like, this has the fingerprints of these other accounts, and I think you're going to see those accounts even disappearing. </p><p>VAUSE: So just to be very clear. These are legal responsibility here for these companies not just to, you know, sort of mow the weeds but to pull the roots as well? </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Well, that's exactly right. I mean, well if they're notified of some of these accounts that might be inciting mass terrorism then they have a duty to remove those accounts. But John, really I think the point that I'm troubled with here is, is this really the cause of a guy like Omar Mateen going into a nightclub and shooting up people? I think people in the United States need to be paying attention more to red flags. That he went out and got a gun at a place where he shouldn't have gotten a gun. So I think that to me is the bigger issue. </p><p>VAUSE: But, you know, just because, you know, Mateen -- Omar Mateen may have seen these videos of this Jihadi content online, doesn't mean he was influenced by it. </p><p>NIGAM: No, not at all. He could be talking to 10,000 other people in off settings. A lot of times what ISIS recruiters do is, they may target one individual and then immediately go into an app conversation, a cell phone conversation, all these other kinds of things they're doing. So this is one of those where making the causal connection is never going to happen. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: That's exactly right. </p><p>NIGAM: And I think at the end of the day what I think the world needs to know is you've got lawyers here who are filing lawsuits, giving false hope to families who have already been tragically hurt. And now they're going to say wait a minute, nothing's going to happen? Well that's because you went down the wrong path. </p><p>VAUSE: Do you think it is false hope? </p><p>CLAYPOOL: I think it is false hope. You guys just hit the nail on the head. You've got to prove causation that this -- was this a substantial factor in causing Omar Mateen to do what he did? I doubt it. </p><p>VAUSE: Guys, thanks so much. Appreciate it. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Thanks, John. </p><p>NIGAM: Thanks, John. </p><p>VAUSE: Well, four officials linked to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan are now facing criminal charges. The state's attorney general has announced emergency services and water plan officials will face felony charges. It's alleged they misused millions of dollars in state funds and conspired to run the city's water treatment plant for more than a year when it wasn't safe for Flint residents to drink. Many residents later tested positive for lead poisoning, blamed on the contaminated water. </p><p>Well, still to come here, Czech Tennis Star Petra Kvitova shaken but lucky to be alive after surviving a knife attack, details just ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: This is CNN Weather Watch. I'm meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Will the cold air finally going to retreat for some folks in the U.S. It's going to begin to retreat. So areas of the northeast and the mid-Atlantic will actually find the start to get some temperatures back up a little bit compared to where they have been. [02:50:10] Now, that system that moved to through portions of Southern Canada into the northern plain of the U.S. and into the Midwest not a big snow maker and it's already starting to finish most of its track and continue off to the east. What we're really paying attention to is this next system that is like to have started to make way into the southwestern region of the United States, bringing some much-needed rain to areas of Southern California and also into Arizona. </p><p>Now, here is a look at the forecast. Cloudy conditions for Los Angeles. High temperature right around 21 already starting to see those clouds building in from the next system. New York, high temperature of six, mostly cloudy skies but as we talked about the warming trend maybe they're getting back close to double digits by the time we approached the weekend. Dallas, a high of 19 degrees with mostly sunny skies, likely to maintain relatively nice weather, even into Thursday and Friday, Kingston looking at mostly sunny skies, high temperature right around 30 degrees. Mexico City nice partly cloudy with a high temperature right into the low to mid 20s where it will remain through the week. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>VAUSE: A two-time Wimbledon Champion has a long road to recovery ahead. Petra Kvitova was stabbed during a robbery in her apartment. The tennis star has now undergone hours of surgery on her main playing hand. World Sport's Anchor Don Riddell has details. </p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, but the sounds of it Petra Kvitova is very lucky to be alive but it remains to be seen how this will affect her ability to continue playing the game she loves. Kvitova is one of the best players in the world. She's one of the most respected athletes on the tour. And echoing the left-handed style of her compatriot Martina Navratilova, Kvitova was the Wimbledon champion in 2011 and 2014. But on Tuesday morning she was eating breakfast at home when a man tricked his way into her apartment. </p><p>According to a police spokesman, this man was masquerading as a maintenance man but then once inside he went on the attack. Kvitova suffered cuts to all five fingers on her left hand, also sustaining damage to her tendons and nerves. Her assailant fled the scene. Remarkably, Kvitova was able to update her condition on social media, saying \"In my attempt to defend myself, I was badly injured on my left hand. I'm shaken but fortunate to be alive. The injury is severe, and I will need to see specialists, but if you know anything about me, I'm strong, and I will fight this. Thank you all again for your love and support\". </p><p>Well, late on Tuesday night, Petra's management team released an update on her surgery. And the details frankly are pretty sobering. It reads, \"Petra has undergone surgery for three hours and 45 minutes. Considering the extent of the damage, the surgery went very well. Doctors repaired damage to tendons in all five digits of the left hand as well as two nerves. Petra will wear a cast on her hand for six to eight weeks and will be unable to bear weight for three months. </p><p>The circumstances are very different but it is hard not to think about Monica Seles right now. She was in the prime of her career when she was brutally knifed in the back during a match in Germany. Seles recovered two years later and in fact she won another major title. But honestly she was never the same again. Today's news really has sent shock waves through the tennis community. Martina Navratilova who Kvitova idolize, she's wrote on twitter \"Just finding out about Petra Kvitova and the awful stabbing and injury to her hand. Pulling for you, Petra.\" And Caroline Wozniacki said, \"Just heard what happened. All my thoughts are with her today. So scary. One of the nicest people I know.\" For sure the tennis community and sports fans worldwide are spending their best wishes to Petra Kvitova. It remains to be seen just how serious this is going to be.

I'm John Vause, live in Los Angeles. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR:  And I'm Max Foster, live in Berlin with the very latest on the investigation on the terror attack.  In the space behind me, the truck's been taken away but an intense search very much under way for the person who drove a truck into that crowded Christmas market.  Police had arrested a man near the scene on Monday night but later released him for lack of evidence.   Twelve people were killed and dozens more were injured.  German chancellor Angela Merkel visited the site and attended a memorial here. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, the attack has other cities on alert.  New York stepped up security at its holiday markets.  And Italy's interior minister ordered reinforced security at Christmas events in other crowded public spaces.  Now, Germany remains on alert as police search for those suspects.  Fred Pleitgen has the very latest details for you. </p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  A massive manhunt under way across Germany after the horrific truck attack on a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin.  ISIS now claiming to have inspired the attack.  The suspect or suspects still at large and armed and considered dangerous, as investigators released the man arrested after the attack. </p><p>Captured on cell phone video, the immediate aftermath of the attack that left 12 dead and more than 45 injured.  A truck with Polish registration and loaded with 25 tons of steel plowing into the outdoor market, dragging some pedestrians 50 to 80 meters, stopping only after knocking over a Christmas tree. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The truck just jumped the curb and took a wrong turn and barreled through the crowd. </p><p>PLEITGEN:  Inside the truck, the body of the trucks Polish driver. Berlin police say he was not at the wheel during the attack and appeared to have been shot to death.  The truck company's owner says his driver appeared to have fought with the attackers.  Within an hour of the attack police arrested a 23-year-old Pakistani immigrant.  And a somber Chancellor Angela Merkel addressing a stunned nation seized on the suspect's nationality. </p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (Interpreted):  We must assume that this was a terrorist attack.  I know that would be especially hard to bear for us if it was to be confirmed that the person who committed this act was given protection and asylum in Germany.  This would be especially disgusting. </p><p>PLEITGEN:  But police released the Pakistani man after prosecutors could not link him to the truck or the scene.  Merkel is facing a political backlash after Germany has taken in nearly 900,000 immigrants this year even as terror attacks are on the rise.  Now, investigators are in a race against time, fearful that whoever is on the run could launch another attack. </p><p>Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  All right, Guy Chazan is Berlin correspondent for the \"Financial Times.\"  He joins me via Skype.  Obviously, there must be a massive operation going on in Berlin and around Germany and in possibly Poland as well right now.  But we're not hearing anything, are we, from the security services? </p><p>GUY CHAZAN, FINANCIAL TIMES BERLIN CORRESPONDENT:  No.  I mean, there were interviews with police officials yesterday on German television. They were saying basically that they're quite confident that they can make some breakthroughs in this investigation because there is a lot of evidence.  They have loads of witness statements.  They have fingerprints from inside the cab.  They have DNA evidence from the truck.  They also have evidence from the GPS system of the vehicle as it was traveling between Poland and Germany. </p><p>So there is a lot to work with.  So they're pretty confident that they can sort of -- they can make progress on this investigation, but it could be also like finding a needle in a haystack.  I mean, the guy just slipped away and, you know, obviously all the attention was focused on the Pakistani man that was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the incident and now he's been released. </p><p>FOSTER:  And so they're on the back foot, aren't they, because whilst they're sitting in there interviewing him for hours and hours and hours they thought they had their man, it's pretty clear from Angela Merkel's press conference yesterday as well that she -- the information she had seemed to indicate that this Pakistani asylum seeker was the man as well and they were just sitting there whilst the guy got away.  I mean, there will be operational reasons for them being very quiet right now but perhaps they've learned their lesson about saying too much too soon yesterday. </p><p>[02:05:11] CHAZAN:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I think there was a sort of a lot of embarrassment yesterday I think in, in the press conferences of the various security officials and police officers as they sort of really admitted that they got the wrong man.  So I think they are on the back foot at the moment. One of the problems that they're encountering now is the fact that there's so little video surveillance in Berlin.  So there's really not much CCTV footage that they can work with.  Germany is not like Britain for example where there are CCTV cameras almost on every street corner.  Germany just lacks that kind of tradition.  There's been a lot of calls to toughen the rules on video monitoring since the terrorist attacks that we saw in Bavaria over the summer.  And those calls will now I think intensify. </p><p>And of course we're going to see a bit of a political backlash now against Angela Merkel and her refugee policy.  I think that's now going to creep back to the top of the political agenda after being in abeyance for a few months.  And she's going to have a lot of explaining to do. </p><p>But of course it is still early days.  We don't even know whether this was carried out by a refugee or, you know, someone -- or perhaps it was someone who actually, you know, lived and was born and grew up in Germany.  Who knows?  At this stage, it's just too early to tell. </p><p>FOSTER:  Well, ISIS claiming responsibility.  But they provided no evidence have they that this was a soldier of ISIS, whether directed by ISIS or just inspired by ISIS?  So they could just be being opportunistic on this one. </p><p>CHAZAN:  Exactly.  And officials have made the point that there's so far no video confession.  Normally when ISIS claim responsibility they also release a video which shows the terrorist admitting it and making a final, a final video sort of appeal.  But we haven't seen anything like that yet.  So as you say, this could be entirely opportunistic. I mean, again, after Nice we saw that it's wrong to jump to conclusions about these, these ISIS' statements.  So, so we'll see, we'll see how the investigation goes.  But so far officials are not ascribing too much importance to that statement from ISIS. </p><p>FOSTER:  The other thing that we often have when it's a very -- when there's military-style operations is that, the security services across Europe go into high alert and they just feels a higher level of tension across the, across the continent.  We don't really have that. It feels more low key than we've had before. </p><p>CHAZAN:  Yes.  That's definitely the case although it does appear that intelligence services in Germany and elsewhere in Europe are cooperating on this.  German media reports suggest that there is a high degree of cooperation on this particular case.  I supposes because, you know, Germany's borders are open and the perpetrator could easily have slipped across into one of the neighboring countries.  So Germany is definitely going to be needing help and cooperation from the intelligence services in other parts of the E.U. </p><p>FOSTER:  OK.  Thank you very much indeed for joining us Guy Chazan. We're following every step of this of course John.  We're just hoping that the fact the security services are being very quiet at this moment and not giving us any information is that they're on to something and they are being quiet for operational reasons. VAUSE: OK, and Max, thank you.  Max Foster, we'll catch up with you later this hour.  Joining me here in Los Angeles is CNN Law Enforcement Contributor Steve Moore.  Steve's also a retired special agent with the FBI.  And Steve, thank you for coming in. </p><p>STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>VAUSE:  Detaining and then releasing the wrong man.  It's a pretty big slip up by the German authorities there.  How big of an impact will this have on the manhunt right now?  What did not get done when they thought they had the right guy? </p><p>MOORE:  Think of evidence like sushi.  It doesn't last very long.  You don't want four-hour-old sushi.  You don't want four-hour-old evidence.  So while they were interrogating this person, evidence was spoiling, evidence was going away, evidence was dispersing.  So that cost them. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  So if you were look for this driver right now, where do you focus the search?  Could he still be in Germany?  Could he have left the country?  Are all these options on the table? </p><p>[02:10:03] MOORE:  Yeah.  All the options are on the table.  This is what's concerning for -- for me as an investigator, I wouldn't know really where to center it.  But you know that this driver was Polish and that he was, that he was dead inside the truck.  So you might be looking clear over to Poland.  And what you're going to want to do is follow that truck.  There's going to be cameras, there's going to be stops it would have to make for regulatory reasons.  You're going to look at the cameras and see who was driving it.  And at one point you're going to say he was driving either at the German border or he wasn't.  You're going to have to find him somewhere between Poland and Germany. </p><p>VAUSE:  Switch your way back essentially. </p><p>MOORE:  Yes. </p><p>VAUSE:  They're saying they're going through all the CCTV footage right now.  They're also asking for anyone who has cell phone video from the scene to bring it forward. </p><p>MOORE:  Yes. </p><p>VAUSE:  This is painstaking work but it has been effective.  In the past they did this in Boston after the Boston bombing.  Isn't that how they identified the Tsarnaev brothers? </p><p>MOORE:  I believe that's the case and I've done this, where you get this film, and it is agonizing.  It is painstaking.  And people say, well, you know, how long will that take?  Well, you may have, you know, for every, for every street corner, you might have 10 cameras on it.  So to look at an hour is going to take 10 hours because you have to look at each one.  So it takes forever to do that. </p><p>VAUSE:  In the meantime, would you suspect that the driver of the truck, would he have gone to ground somewhere?  Would he have a support network in Germany?  I mean, there's also a suspicion that he may not be alone. </p><p>MOORE:  My hunch, and it's only a hunch, but I'm at CNN to give you my thoughts. </p><p>VAUSE:  Exactly, that's why we have you here. </p><p>MOORE:  The -- my hunch is that this isn't one person.  One person gets their own truck or their own car.  Several people would be needed to overpower a driver, stop him somewhere, find a way to get it, and get it on the first time because we don't hear any other drivers saying somebody tried to hijack you.  They got it the first time.  So I'm guessing that there are several people involved in this and wherever -- whatever country you see this happening in where the truck was taken over, I would start looking there that's where your cell at least most likely is. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK, let's get to the claim of not necessarily responsibility but inspiration by ISIS.  Is it possible to know if that's just an opportunistic claim because they haven't really put any evidence forward to back it up? </p><p>MOORE:  Because they don't have any evidence.  I mean, ISIS -- whenever there's an attack, ISIS is watching CNN.  They are trying to figure out, oh, did somebody do that in our name?  And they're going to look, they're going to see what they've done in that area, see what kind of information they pushed out.  I mean, lately they've been pushing out information on truck attacks.  They looked at it, they probably are saying on the basis of everything we know this is probably us or people doing this in our name, therefore we're going to consider it inspired by us. </p><p>VAUSE:  OK, Steve, good to speak with you.  Thanks so much. </p><p>MOORE:  Good to talk with you. </p><p>VAUSE:  Twelve minutes past 11:00 here on the West Coast.  Time for a break.  When we come back, we are learning more about the police officer who assassinated Russia's ambassador to Turkey. </p><p>Also, the deadly fireworks explosion in Mexico.  Investigators are looking at whether the blast was deliberately set. You're watching CNN. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[02:15:05] DON RIDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR:  I'm Don Ridell with your CNN World Sport headlines.  The tennis star Petra Kvitova is recovering from a very serious knife attack at her home in the Czech Republic.  According to a police spokesman, a man was masquerading as a maintenance man when the attack occurred.  And in trying to protect herself the left-handed player suffered cuts to all five fingers on her left hand, also sustaining damage to nerves and tendons.  Late on Tuesday night, Petra's management team released an update, saying she's recovering from a three hour and 45-minute surgery as well as company expected considering the damage. </p><p>In football news, struggling premier league champions Leicester City will be without their striker Jamie Vardy for the next three games. That's after the football association upheld his red card against Stoke City.  Vardy was prolific in Leicester's title run last season and he was returning to form but he'll now miss the games against Everton, West Ham, and Middlesbrough. </p><p>In Germany, the mood is understandably tense after the terror attack in Berlin on Monday which saw a truck crash through a Christmas market killing 12 people.  But this week's Bundesliga games have gone ahead as scheduled.  Moments of silence were held before all four games on Tuesday.  And they will be held ahead of the top of the table clash between Bayern Munich and Leipzig on Wednesday. </p><p>That is a quick look at your sports headlines.  I'm Don Riddell. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>VAUSE:  Welcome back everybody.  A huge fireworks market in Mexico has been reduced to rubble.  A series of explosions tore through the crowded market on Tuesday, causing a frantic dash as people ran for their lives. CNN's Ed Lavandera reports. </p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The video images of the fireworks explosion in the town of Tultepec, Mexico which is just north of Mexico City, are simply staggering and horrifying to watch.  The video images showing the area where these explosions, these series of explosions went on and on, nearly three dozen people killed, more than 70 others injured. </p><p>The governor of the state where this town is tell CNN that three young children will be transported by plane to a hospital in Texas where they will be treated for their extreme burns.  So you can imagine that many of the other victims still grappling and dealing with these same types of wounds as well.  The burns could be a very serious issue for many of the victims and survivors of these explosions. </p><p>But the video images really capturing the drama and the intensity of the moment as people rushed to the scene to try to help what they could.  Video images from the ground also showing the scorched fireworks stand.  This is an open air market in the town of Tultepec and a town that is basically known as the fireworks capital of Mexico. </p><p>This is a huge industry in this town, and extremely popular especially this time of year as you head into the holiday season and New Year's festivities and that sort of thing.  So it will be very common for thousands of people to be walking through this open air market to see all of the elaborate fireworks displays and fireworks pyrotechnics that were on display. </p><p>The governor of that state also tells CNN that they are looking to determine whether or not this was deliberately set.  The exact cause has not been determined as emergency crews are still trying to sift through the scene looking for any kind of survivors and perhaps more victims of this, this explosion that's just seemed to go on and on, a horrifying scene in Mexico. </p><p>Ed Lavandera, CNN, Dallas. </p><p>VAUSE:  A Colombian cargo plane crashed minutes after takeoff killing five crew members.  Video shows the plane plowing through fences and scraping the ground moments before bursting into flames.  No word yet on what caused the crash.  The plane's flight technician survived. </p><p>Nineteen minutes past 11:00 here on Tuesday night.  Let's go back now to Max Foster in Berlin. </p><p>FOSTER:  Yeah, Wednesday morning here.  Following the attack on the Christmas market behind me.  They're hoping to reopen it as soon as possible, possibly today in a show of defiance against that terrorism. But we are also learning more about another attack.  And that's the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey.  The body of Ambassador Andrey Karlov has arrived in Moscow.  Seven people have been detained for questioning including the shooter's relatives and friends. </p><p>[02:20:04] Russian investigators are now in Turkey and Turkey State Media say books on Al Qaeda and a Gulen movement were found in the shooter's home.  Turkey blames the Gulen movement for July's coup attempt and now according to state-run media they say the Gulen group is behind the assassination.  Fethulla Gulen is condemning the attack however.  Our Nic Robertson spoke with a photographer who captured the horrific shooting.  We have to warn you his report contains graphic images. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURHAN OZBILICI, ASSOCIATED PRESS PHOTOGRAPHER:  I heard shots very loud.  Bam, bam, bam.  I said this is terrible (inaudible). </p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  What did you do? </p><p>OZBILICI:  Horrible.  So, the people standing in front, they disappeared.  They throw them on the floor.  Then, they try -- they were trying to hide them to take shelter. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Were you afraid? </p><p>OZBILICI:  I was shocked but -- I'm afraid but not much, not that panic. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Were you not afraid taken it?  You've got a camera, he's got a gun. </p><p>OZBILICI:  Well, I'm very sensitive and in difficult situation. I'm calm.  I said I have a responsibility to record this event.  And the ambassador was lying on the ground, not moving.  And guy was making some politically motivated speech but I could not understand.  I said, maybe he's speaking Russian, in Russian.  Some people were screaming and crying so, I could not hear well.  Then, he turned around the body and from very close range he shot one more time. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  On the ambassador? </p><p>OZBILICI:  Yes. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Just to make sure he was dead? </p><p>OZBILICI:  I think so.  When I learned that the guy was killed, I was very shocked.  Why they killed him?  He did nothing to take anybody hostage.  He was alone.  They have to capture him alive. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  They could have done. </p><p>OZBILICI:  I don't know, I don't know what is the reason -- motive behind. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  An incredible moment there.  Nic Robertson there, interviewing the photographer who captured those chilling images. Well, despite the ambassador's assassination, the three countries with the most influence in Syria met in Moscow.  The foreign ministers from Russia, Turkey, and Iran said they will work on finding a political solution to the brutal Syrian civil war.  They pledged to first secure a wider cease fire so that aid can be delivered.  Russia's foreigner minister says their plans will be most effective in dealing with the crisis. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (Interpreted):  I am sure that as we reach success in fighting terrorism, as we start the political process between Syrians with our help, as we reach success at these directions.  We will be able to formulate our common approach which will definitely be based on declared goals.  To win over terrorism, to restore territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence, and unity of Syria Arab republics.  We are united in that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  Turkey says meanwhile evacuations from Aleppo will be completed by Wednesday and that around 37,000 people have been rescued so far.  Earlier, I spoke to CNN Contributor and Former Moscow Bureau Chief Jill Dougherty about the foreign ministers meeting over there in Moscow. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  And when it comes to Russia, it's really solidifying their role in the Middle East.  I mean, this is, this very interesting because you know who's not at that meeting and that's the United States.  It's Iran, Russia, and Turkey, not the United States.  And that's very significant. </p><p>So, they're moving forward.  They have -- they're putting up a united front that is Turkey and Russia.  And they're making it -- the Russians are making it very clear that they don't feel that they need the Americans or maybe even want the Americans.  And are just moving forward on some type of resolution, what that will be precisely is not clear.  But you're right, Max -- I mean, the diplomacy is moving fast, and the Russians solidifying whatever gains they have. </p><p>FOSTER:  And how are the Americans viewing this?  As they move away from -- or, you know, distancing perhaps from the United States and moving more closely with a longer term relationship with Russia. </p><p>DOUGHERTY:  You know, there's not a lot I think that the United States can do right now.  President Obama has made it clear.  And he only has now, you know, a few weeks left in office.  That he is not going to take any type of major action in Syria.  And you have a new president coming in who has -- this is Mr. Trump, who's made clear that he feels that he could possibly work with Russia and possibly even work with President Bashar Al-Assad which seems unthinkable for us when you talk about unthinkable things, that certainly is that the United States or this president incoming would think of working with Bashar Al-Assad to fight terrorism. </p><p>[02:25:03] And that's the way Donald Trump looks at it, very black and white.  He feels that the Russians have taken the fight to the terrorists.  He wants to fight with the terrorists and defeat them. And that means that he can ally himself with Russia. </p><p>Now, when he comes into office, the details of that, how that would be done, and precisely what would happen, would Russia be leading the charge, would the Americans be following, none of those details are clear.  But the overall picture seems to be that, you know, Russians defining pretty much what's going on in Syria. </p><p>FOSTER:  And there's Donald Trump in a way with his sort of overtures to Russia, open the way for countries like Turkey to have closer relationships and build bridges with Russia? </p><p>DOUGHERTY:  Well, yes.  Although, I think that, you know, this rapprochement between Turkey and Russia really was entrained before Donald Trump entered the picture.  But certainly if the American president is friendly with Russia then it gives encouragement to other countries who see which way the wind is blowing to move in that direction. </p><p>I think you might see it Max, mostly significantly on the issue of sanctions, economic sanctions against Russia which were introduced by the United States and by Europe as a reaction to what Russia did in Ukraine and also the annexation of Korea -- of Crimea.  And so, if -- let's say, Donald Trump decided not to uphold the sanctions to weaken them or even get rid of them, that would give free rein to any other country especially some of the Europeans who wouldn't mind doing that, to simply go along.  So, his relationship with Russia could be kind of a bellwether for other nations.  This is not something traditional American foreign policy would necessarily accept, but this is the way it is with Mr. Trump. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER:  Jill Dougherty following the attack in Turkey. Still ahead though here, the German chancellor horrified and saddened by Monday's Berlin attack.  Now, her fellow citizens are trying to come to terms with the deadly rampage. </p><p>[02:27:23] Plus, U.S. President Barack Obama moves to cement his legacy ahead of the Trump administration. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[02:30:42] FOSTER: Well, a huge manhunt is under way here in Germany for the driver of that truck that barreled into a crowded Christmas market, and police arresting a man near the scene in Berlin on Monday night. But he was later released for lack of evidence. And official says there could be more than one suspect at large. </p><p>Twelve people were killed and dozens more were injured. Thousands of people attended a memorial for the victims of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. ISIS claiming it inspired the attack. Shocked Germans still trying to make sense of Monday's horrific attack, Erin McLaughlin has more on that. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPODENT: At the scene of unimaginable horror, a 25-ton tool of terror is slowly driven away, leaving behind unanswered questions and a country in shock. Nearby a makeshift memorial grows by the hour. Young and old, people of all faith, gather to mourn. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All over of 2016, we heard of all the terrible attacks that happened all over the world. And yesterday was a black day for human history. It's just depressing. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, and people go here to have a good evening. To have -- they drink wine and eat something and stay here, and with friends or family. And then they're dead after five minutes. It's shocking. Yes, it is. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: What remains of the Christmas market is eerily quiet. Children's rides stand still, and there's a heavy police presence. </p><p>Normally this Christmas market would be full of shoppers drinking spiced wine and looking for gifts but as you can see these kiosks are closed. As authorities look for answers and Berliners mourn their dead. </p><p>In the capital, a show of solidarity. At the memorial church, people gather to honor the dead. And officials prepared the country for the worst. </p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (Translator): I know that would be especially hard to bear for us. If it was to be confirmed that the person committed this act was given protection and asylum in Germany. This would be especially disgusting. </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: German officials set free the asylum seeker they first arrested. No longer suspecting he perpetrated the attack. Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the church Tuesday, visibly shocked. It is Christmas week and the country has been shaken, and with it her political future. Erin Mclaughlin, CNN, Berlin. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FOSTER: We don't know whether it was an asylum seeker. We don't know anything about this attacker. ISIS claimed responsibility, but no evidence provided by them as to who their soldier is in their words. And nothing from the Security Services either. Presumably because they are look at this as an operational matter and they don't want to give anything away about their investigations, John. </p><p>JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Yeah Max, all they know is that he is out there, he is on the run, he could be dangerous and he might not be alone. </p><p>A Trump spokesman says the president-elect is closely monitoring the aftermath of the attacks about Germany and Turkey. But his team will not say if he is receiving regular intelligence briefings. Vice President-elect Mike Pence is taking the daily briefings. And the transition team says Trump will response forcefully to any attacks when he is president. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO-CLIP) </p><p>SEAN SPICER, CHIEF STRATEGIST AND COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, RNC: I think it's going to be swift and fierce. Mr. Trump has made it very, very clear he understands the threat that Radical Islamic terrorism poses to our nation and frankly to our friends and neighbors around the globe, and that we've got to be able to call it what it is and then root it out by its very -- by the bottom. We cannot be being politically correct. We've got to understand the threat that we face and attack it straight on. </p><p>(END VIDEO-CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE: Western couple held hostage by the Taliban since 2012 are begging President Obama and Donald Trump to help free them. Caitlin Coleman is American, her husband Joshua Boyle is Canadian. A new proof of life video which the Taliban says it released shows them with their two young children. They say their captors will retaliate against them if certain Afghan prisoners as being held in Kabul are punished. </p><p>Barack Obama has less than a month left in office, and it seems he's spending the final days trying to defend as much of his legacy as possible, while the incoming president has promised to dismantle as much as he can. CNN's Athena Jones has details. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[02:35:04] ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Obama moving to secure his legacy on the environment and beyond, before he hands the presidency to Donald Trump. Tonight new measures to bar offshore drilling indefinitely in the parts of the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean, in part to prevent environmental disasters like the B.P. Oil Spill. BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT: I share people's concerns about offshore drilling. I remember the B.P. Spill in the Gulf of Mexico all too well. </p><p>JONES: It's an issue that has been front and center for the president, who sees climate change as the greatest threat facing future generations. And believes the U.S. and the world must do more to combat it. </p><p>OBAMA: We're not moving fast enough. And for the sake of our kids we've got to keep going. America has to lead the world in transitioning to a clean energy economy. </p><p>JONES: President Obama's last-minute move is based on a 64-year-old law. Not an easily reversible executive order, creating a legal hurdle for the incoming president, a climate change skeptic, who has vowed to pull out of the Paris climate accords and to increase domestic energy production. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: Every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country, often, foreign countries not very friendly to us. </p><p>JONES: And the president isn't just taking action on the environment. He's also preparing to transfer an additional 17 or 18 inmates from the U.S. Prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to other countries, according to the \"New York Times\", slashing the remaining population there by nearly a third, though, stopping short of fulfilling his 2008 campaign promise to close the prison. </p><p>OBAMA: They will be judged harshly by history. And I will continue to do all that I can to remove this blot on our national honor. </p><p>JONES: President-elect Trump has promised to not only keep the prison open but to fill it up with quote, \"Some bad dudes.\" Obama also, this week granting clemency to 231 people, mostly drug offenders. The most ever in one day, bringing the total number to a new record for any presidency, the White House signaling there are more acts of clemency to come. All part of a broader criminal justice reform effort. These final moves aimed at solidifying his agenda. </p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: They're all issues that he's talked about a lot and that he's attempted to get action on but all three are issues where he has been extraordinarily frustrated and unable to really move congress. </p><p>JONES: The president running through the tape and presenting a series of direct challenges to Trump. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE: Thanks to CNN Correspondent Athena Jones for that report. It is 22 minutes before the top of the hour. We'll take a short break here. When we come back, the gunman behind the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history pledged allegiance to ISIS. Has some victims' families are blaming social media for the massacre, and they're taking it to court. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[02:41:17] VAUSE: The families of the victims from the Orlando nightclub shooting are suing some big tech companies accusing Twitter, Facebook and Google of providing material support to ISIS. For more on this, CNN Security Analyst Hemu Nigam and Criminal Defense Attorney Brian Claypool, thank you both for being here. </p><p>Let's look at the legal hurdles here first, Brian. The Communications Decency Act, essentially shields computer services from liability for content. So how does that work, and that's a pretty big hill to climb in this case, right? </p><p>BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINIAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, I would like to say it its insurmountable. I mean, when I first heard about a lawsuit, being filed as a result of the Orlando nightclub shooting, I thought that these families were going to be suing maybe law enforcement for not going in more quickly to get -- to shoot at Omar Mateen or possibly even the gun shop owner, or even possibly the FBI for not investigating. When I heard that they were suing internet companies, I thought of one thing, the Titanic, because these cases are sinking fast. </p><p>VAUSE: OK. But this law essentially gives a free pass to social media. I mean especially the site. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Yeah, but there was a law enact. A federal law ... </p><p>VAUSE: Yeah. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: ... in the United States enacted in 1996, to make it easy for you and the viewers, basically it says if somebody else posts information on the internet. The internet provider is not responsible ... </p><p>VAUSE: Right. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: ... for that data and that cannot be sued and be held civilly liable for that. One exception is if where there's Federal criminal activity. And I think that's what these families are trying to do. And they're trying to say that the internet providers were materially supporting ISIS. </p><p>VAUSE: And with that this is the twist of the case because the lawsuit is arguing by matching user content with targeted advertising. Somehow the social media site is providing its own novel content. So Hemu, explain, you know, the technical aspects to this. </p><p>HEMU NIGAM, INTERNET SECURITY ANALYST: Yeah, and I have to first say you mean, all our hearts go out to the families. We all feel that way. But that doesn't mean a lawsuit's going to solve that problem. And I think what Google -- Google is actually taking the lead on this. What they're doing is they're saying look, if you are looking for ISIS content, maybe you're somebody who might get recruited. There is advertising that comes up that takes you to places that you can get help or at least even for example see content of what happens when ISIS attacks such as what happened in the Berlin Christmas incident just two days ago, or yesterday. So Google is doing that. Twitter is actually doing a lot of things. And the companies are getting together and saying we're going to band forces and try to solve this problem not by ourselves but together and working with law enforcement. </p><p>VAUSE: But that right now the families are saying that there are researches, be it on Google, Facebook, or whatever, is what is essentially bringing all of this together, which it seems to be a novel legal approach, Brian. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Yeah. I mean, the only way I think these families can prevail in this case is if they've got some information, for example, that Twitter or Facebook was aware of some really nefarious postings that might incite terrorism and then they didn't do anything to remove those. Because then you're possibly facilitating this, you're on notice. Bear in mind, these internet providers don't have a duty to canvass the internet to find these postings. </p><p>VAUSE: OK, with that in mind, this lawsuit is also alleging that the tech companies should not do enough to shut down Jihadist groups. They use this example of an ISIS linked Twitter Account. This is for the suit, \"When its account @TurMedia332 was shut down, it started @TurMedia 334. When that was shutdown it started @TurMedia335. This naming convention adding one digit to a new account of the last one is suspended, does not seem as if it would require artificial intelligence to spot. Each of these accounts also uses and used the photograph of the bearded man's face over and over and over again\". </p><p>So, Henry, from a technical point it wouldn't be easy to Twitter. To simply stop this accounts from springing out over and over again? </p><p>[02:45:03] NIGAM: Well, here is the reality. First let's give Kudos to Twitter for deleting 360,000 accounts ... </p><p>VAUSE: Right. </p><p>NIGAM: ... in the first place. Knowing that these ISIS folks are going to try to come back and create denude accounts and do kind of a cat and mouse game. But that said, there's a new initiative happening right now between Google, Microsoft, and Twitter where they're going to be fingerprinting indicia of an ISIS account and then using it by sharing it amongst themselves in the data base and saying here's a new account coming up, it looks very much like, this has the fingerprints of these other accounts, and I think you're going to see those accounts even disappearing. </p><p>VAUSE: So just to be very clear. These are legal responsibility here for these companies not just to, you know, sort of mow the weeds but to pull the roots as well? </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Well, that's exactly right. I mean, well if they're notified of some of these accounts that might be inciting mass terrorism then they have a duty to remove those accounts. But John, really I think the point that I'm troubled with here is, is this really the cause of a guy like Omar Mateen going into a nightclub and shooting up people? I think people in the United States need to be paying attention more to red flags. That he went out and got a gun at a place where he shouldn't have gotten a gun. So I think that to me is the bigger issue. </p><p>VAUSE: But, you know, just because, you know, Mateen -- Omar Mateen may have seen these videos of this Jihadi content online, doesn't mean he was influenced by it. </p><p>NIGAM: No, not at all. He could be talking to 10,000 other people in off settings. A lot of times what ISIS recruiters do is, they may target one individual and then immediately go into an app conversation, a cell phone conversation, all these other kinds of things they're doing. So this is one of those where making the causal connection is never going to happen. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: That's exactly right. </p><p>NIGAM: And I think at the end of the day what I think the world needs to know is you've got lawyers here who are filing lawsuits, giving false hope to families who have already been tragically hurt. And now they're going to say wait a minute, nothing's going to happen? Well that's because you went down the wrong path. </p><p>VAUSE: Do you think it is false hope? </p><p>CLAYPOOL: I think it is false hope. You guys just hit the nail on the head. You've got to prove causation that this -- was this a substantial factor in causing Omar Mateen to do what he did? I doubt it. </p><p>VAUSE: Guys, thanks so much. Appreciate it. </p><p>CLAYPOOL: Thanks, John. </p><p>NIGAM: Thanks, John. </p><p>VAUSE: Well, four officials linked to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan are now facing criminal charges. The state's attorney general has announced emergency services and water plan officials will face felony charges. It's alleged they misused millions of dollars in state funds and conspired to run the city's water treatment plant for more than a year when it wasn't safe for Flint residents to drink. Many residents later tested positive for lead poisoning, blamed on the contaminated water. </p><p>Well, still to come here, Czech Tennis Star Petra Kvitova shaken but lucky to be alive after surviving a knife attack, details just ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: This is CNN Weather Watch. I'm meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Will the cold air finally going to retreat for some folks in the U.S. It's going to begin to retreat. So areas of the northeast and the mid-Atlantic will actually find the start to get some temperatures back up a little bit compared to where they have been. [02:50:10] Now, that system that moved to through portions of Southern Canada into the northern plain of the U.S. and into the Midwest not a big snow maker and it's already starting to finish most of its track and continue off to the east. What we're really paying attention to is this next system that is like to have started to make way into the southwestern region of the United States, bringing some much-needed rain to areas of Southern California and also into Arizona. </p><p>Now, here is a look at the forecast. Cloudy conditions for Los Angeles. High temperature right around 21 already starting to see those clouds building in from the next system. New York, high temperature of six, mostly cloudy skies but as we talked about the warming trend maybe they're getting back close to double digits by the time we approached the weekend. Dallas, a high of 19 degrees with mostly sunny skies, likely to maintain relatively nice weather, even into Thursday and Friday, Kingston looking at mostly sunny skies, high temperature right around 30 degrees. Mexico City nice partly cloudy with a high temperature right into the low to mid 20s where it will remain through the week. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>VAUSE: A two-time Wimbledon Champion has a long road to recovery ahead. Petra Kvitova was stabbed during a robbery in her apartment. The tennis star has now undergone hours of surgery on her main playing hand. World Sport's Anchor Don Riddell has details. </p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, but the sounds of it Petra Kvitova is very lucky to be alive but it remains to be seen how this will affect her ability to continue playing the game she loves. Kvitova is one of the best players in the world. She's one of the most respected athletes on the tour. And echoing the left-handed style of her compatriot Martina Navratilova, Kvitova was the Wimbledon champion in 2011 and 2014. But on Tuesday morning she was eating breakfast at home when a man tricked his way into her apartment. </p><p>According to a police spokesman, this man was masquerading as a maintenance man but then once inside he went on the attack. Kvitova suffered cuts to all five fingers on her left hand, also sustaining damage to her tendons and nerves. Her assailant fled the scene. Remarkably, Kvitova was able to update her condition on social media, saying \"In my attempt to defend myself, I was badly injured on my left hand. I'm shaken but fortunate to be alive. The injury is severe, and I will need to see specialists, but if you know anything about me, I'm strong, and I will fight this. Thank you all again for your love and support\". </p><p>Well, late on Tuesday night, Petra's management team released an update on her surgery. And the details frankly are pretty sobering. It reads, \"Petra has undergone surgery for three hours and 45 minutes. Considering the extent of the damage, the surgery went very well. Doctors repaired damage to tendons in all five digits of the left hand as well as two nerves. Petra will wear a cast on her hand for six to eight weeks and will be unable to bear weight for three months. </p><p>The circumstances are very different but it is hard not to think about Monica Seles right now. She was in the prime of her career when she was brutally knifed in the back during a match in Germany. Seles recovered two years later and in fact she won another major title. But honestly she was never the same again. Today's news really has sent shock waves through the tennis community. Martina Navratilova who Kvitova idolize, she's wrote on twitter \"Just finding out about Petra Kvitova and the awful stabbing and injury to her hand. Pulling for you, Petra.\" And Caroline Wozniacki said, \"Just heard what happened. All my thoughts are with her today. So scary. One of the nicest people I know.\" For sure the tennis community and sports fans worldwide are spending their best wishes to Petra Kvitova. It remains to be seen just how serious this is going to be. But we do wish her the very best. Back to you. </p><p>[02:55:10] VAUSE: Don Riddell, thank you. And tributes are being left around Berlin to honor the victims of Monday's attack. The Brandenburg Gate, one of Berlin's iconic landmarks lit up with colors of the German flag. In one vigil dozens held hands to form a human chain. And near the scene of the attack mourners left candles and flowers at makeshift memorials along with messages of support and condolence. </p><p>Much more from Berlin with my colleague Max Foster in just a few moments.

In the space behind me, the truck's been taken away but an intense search very much under way for the person who drove a truck into that crowded Christmas market. Police had arrested a man near the scene on Monday night but later released him for lack of evidence. Twelve people were killed and dozens more were injured. German chancellor <person><nameText>Angela Merkel </nameText></person>visited the site and attended a memorial here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, the attack has other cities on alert. New York stepped up security at its holiday markets. And Italy's interior minister ordered reinforced security at Christmas events in other crowded public spaces. Now, Germany remains on alert as police search for those suspects. Fred Pleitgen has the very latest details for you.</p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A massive manhunt under way across Germany after the horrific truck attack on a Christmas market in the heart of Berlin. ISIS now claiming to have inspired the attack. The suspect or suspects still at large and armed and considered dangerous, as investigators released the man arrested after the attack.</p><p>Captured on cell phone video, the immediate aftermath of the attack that left 12 dead and more than 45 injured. A truck with Polish registration and loaded with 25 tons of steel plowing into the outdoor market, dragging some pedestrians 50 to 80 meters, stopping only after knocking over a Christmas tree.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The truck just jumped the curb and took a wrong turn and barreled through the crowd.</p><p>PLEITGEN: Inside the truck, the body of the trucks Polish driver. Berlin police say he was not at the wheel during the attack and appeared to have been shot to death. The truck company's owner says his driver appeared to have fought with the attackers. Within an hour of the attack police arrested a 23-year-old Pakistani immigrant. And a somber Chancellor <person><nameText>Angela Merkel </nameText></person>addressing a stunned nation seized on the suspect's nationality.</p><p><person><nameText>ANGELA MERKEL, </nameText></person>GERMAN CHANCELLOR (Interpreted): We must assume that this was a terrorist attack. I know that would be especially hard to bear for us if it was to be confirmed that the person who committed this act was given protection and asylum in Germany. This would be especially disgusting.</p><p>PLEITGEN: But police released the Pakistani man after prosecutors could not link him to the truck or the scene. Merkel is facing a political backlash after Germany has taken in nearly 900,000 immigrants this year even as terror attacks are on the rise. Now, investigators are in a race against time, fearful that whoever is on the run could launch another attack.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOSTER: All right, Guy Chazan is Berlin correspondent for the \"Financial Times.\" He joins me via Skype. Obviously, there must be a massive operation going on in Berlin and around Germany and in possibly Poland as well right now. But we're not hearing anything, are we, from the security services?</p><p>GUY CHAZAN, FINANCIAL TIMES BERLIN CORRESPONDENT: No. I mean, there were interviews with police officials yesterday on German television. They were saying basically that they're quite confident that they can make some breakthroughs in this investigation because there is a lot of evidence. They have loads of witness statements. They have fingerprints from inside the cab. They have DNA evidence from the truck. They also have evidence from the GPS system of the vehicle as it was traveling between Poland and Germany.</p><p>So there is a lot to work with. So they're pretty confident that they can sort of -- they can make progress on this investigation, but it could be also like finding a needle in a haystack. I mean, the guy just slipped away and, you know, obviously all the attention was focused on the Pakistani man that was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the incident and now he's been released.</p><p>FOSTER: And so they're on the back foot, aren't they, because whilst they're sitting in there interviewing him for hours and hours and hours they thought they had their man, it's pretty clear from <person><nameText>Angela Merkel's </nameText></person>press conference yesterday as well that she -- the information she had seemed to indicate that this Pakistani asylum seeker was the man as well and they were just sitting there whilst the guy got away. I mean, there will be operational reasons for them being very quiet right now but perhaps they've learned their lesson about saying too much too soon yesterday.</p><p>[02:05:11] CHAZAN: Yeah, exactly. I mean, I think there was a sort of a lot of embarrassment yesterday I think in, in the press conferences of the various security officials and police officers as they sort of really admitted that they got the wrong man. So I think they are on the back foot at the moment. One of the problems that they're encountering now is the fact that there's so little video surveillance in Berlin. So there's really not much CCTV footage that they can work with. Germany is not like Britain for example where there are CCTV cameras almost on every street corner. Germany just lacks that kind of tradition. There's been a lot of calls to toughen the rules on video monitoring since the terrorist attacks that we saw in Bavaria over the summer. And those calls will now I think intensify.</p><p>And of course we're going to see a bit of a political backlash now against <person><nameText>Angela Merkel </nameText></person>and her refugee policy. I think that's now going to creep back to the top of the political agenda after being in abeyance for a few months. And she's going to have a lot of explaining to do.</p><p>But of course it is still early days. We don't even know whether this was carried out by a refugee or, you know, someone -- or perhaps it was someone who actually, you know, lived and was born and grew up in Germany. Who knows? At this stage, it's just too early to tell.</p><p>FOSTER: Well, ISIS claiming responsibility. But they provided no evidence have they that this was a soldier of ISIS, whether directed by ISIS or just inspired by ISIS? So they could just be being opportunistic on this one.</p><p>CHAZAN: Exactly. And officials have made the point that there's so far no video confession. Normally when ISIS claim responsibility they also release a video which shows the terrorist admitting it and making a final, a final video sort of appeal. But we haven't seen anything like that yet. So as you say, this could be entirely opportunistic. I mean, again, after Nice we saw that it's wrong to jump to conclusions about these, these ISIS' statements. So, so we'll see, we'll see how the investigation goes. But so far officials are not ascribing too much importance to that statement from ISIS.</p><p>FOSTER: The other thing that we often have when it's a very -- when there's military-style operations is that, the security services across Europe go into high alert and they just feels a higher level of tension across the, across the continent. We don't really have that. It feels more low key than we've had before.</p><p>CHAZAN: Yes. That's definitely the case although it does appear that intelligence services in Germany and elsewhere in Europe are cooperating on this. German media reports suggest that there is a high degree of cooperation on this particular case. I supposes because, you know, Germany's borders are open and the perpetrator could easily have slipped across into one of the neighboring countries. So Germany is definitely going to be needing help and cooperation from the intelligence services in other parts of the E.U.</p><p>FOSTER: OK. Thank you very much indeed for joining us Guy Chazan. We're following every step of this of course John. We're just hoping that the fact the security services are being very quiet at this moment and not giving us any information is that they're on to something and they are being quiet for operational reasons. VAUSE: OK, and Max, thank you. Max Foster, we'll catch up with you later this hour. Joining me here in Los Angeles is CNN Law Enforcement Contributor Steve Moore. Steve's also a retired special agent with the FBI. And Steve, thank you for coming in.</p><p>STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>VAUSE: Detaining and then releasing the wrong man. It's a pretty big slip up by the German authorities there. How big of an impact will this have on the manhunt right now? What did not get done when they thought they had the right guy?</p><p>MOORE: Think of evidence like sushi. It doesn't last very long. You don't want four-hour-old sushi. You don't want four-hour-old evidence. So while they were interrogating this person, evidence was spoiling, evidence was going away, evidence was dispersing. So that cost them.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. So if you were look for this driver right now, where do you focus the search? Could he still be in Germany? Could he have left the country? Are all these options on the table?</p><p>[02:10:03] MOORE: Yeah. All the options are on the table. This is what's concerning for -- for me as an investigator, I wouldn't know really where to center it. But you know that this driver was Polish and that he was, that he was dead inside the truck. So you might be looking clear over to Poland. And what you're going to want to do is follow that truck. There's going to be cameras, there's going to be stops it would have to make for regulatory reasons. You're going to look at the cameras and see who was driving it. And at one point you're going to say he was driving either at the German border or he wasn't. You're going to have to find him somewhere between Poland and Germany.</p><p>VAUSE: Switch your way back essentially.</p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: They're saying they're going through all the CCTV footage right now. They're also asking for anyone who has cell phone video from the scene to bring it forward.</p><p>MOORE: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: This is painstaking work but it has been effective. In the past they did this in Boston after the Boston bombing. Isn't that how they identified the Tsarnaev brothers?</p><p>MOORE: I believe that's the case and I've done this, where you get this film, and it is agonizing. It is painstaking. And people say, well, you know, how long will that take? Well, you may have, you know, for every, for every street corner, you might have 10 cameras on it. So to look at an hour is going to take 10 hours because you have to look at each one. So it takes forever to do that.</p><p>VAUSE: In the meantime, would you suspect that the driver of the truck, would he have gone to ground somewhere? Would he have a support network in Germany? I mean, there's also a suspicion that he may not be alone.</p><p>MOORE: My hunch, and it's only a hunch, but I'm at CNN to give you my thoughts.</p><p>VAUSE: Exactly, that's why we have you here.</p><p>MOORE: The -- my hunch is that this isn't one person. One person gets their own truck or their own car. Several people would be needed to overpower a driver, stop him somewhere, find a way to get it, and get it on the first time because we don't hear any other drivers saying somebody tried to hijack you. They got it the first time. So I'm guessing that there are several people involved in this and wherever -- whatever country you see this happening in where the truck was taken over, I would start looking there that's where your cell at least most likely is.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, let's get to the claim of not necessarily responsibility but inspiration by ISIS. Is it possible to know if that's just an opportunistic claim because they haven't really put any evidence forward to back it up?</p><p>MOORE: Because they don't have any evidence. I mean, ISIS -- whenever there's an attack, ISIS is watching CNN. They are trying to figure out, oh, did somebody do that in our name? And they're going to look, they're going to see what they've done in that area, see what kind of information they pushed out. I mean, lately they've been pushing out information on truck attacks. They looked at it, they probably are saying on the basis of everything we know this is probably us or people doing this in our name, therefore we're going to consider it inspired by us.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, Steve, good to speak with you. Thanks so much.</p><p>MOORE: Good to talk with you.</p><p>VAUSE: Twelve minutes past 11:00 here on the West Coast. Time for a break. When we come back, we are learning more about the police officer who assassinated Russia's ambassador to Turkey.</p><p>Also, the deadly fireworks explosion in Mexico. Investigators are looking at whether the blast was deliberately set. You're watching CNN.</p><p>[02:15:05] DON RIDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: I'm Don Ridell with your CNN World Sport headlines. The tennis star Petra Kvitova is recovering from a very serious knife attack at her home in the Czech Republic. According to a police spokesman, a man was masquerading as a maintenance man when the attack occurred. And in trying to protect herself the left-handed player suffered cuts to all five fingers on her left hand, also sustaining damage to nerves and tendons. Late on Tuesday night, Petra's management team released an update, saying she's recovering from a three hour and 45-minute surgery as well as company expected considering the damage.</p><p>In football news, struggling premier league champions Leicester City will be without their striker Jamie Vardy for the next three games. That's after the football association upheld his red card against Stoke City.

But this week's Bundesliga games have gone ahead as scheduled. Moments of silence were held before all four games on Tuesday. And they will be held ahead of the top of the table clash between Bayern Munich and Leipzig on Wednesday.</p><p>That is a quick look at your sports headlines. I'm Don Riddell.</p><p>VAUSE: Welcome back everybody. A huge fireworks market in Mexico has been reduced to rubble. A series of explosions tore through the crowded market on Tuesday, causing a frantic dash as people ran for their lives. CNN's Ed Lavandera reports.</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The video images of the fireworks explosion in the town of Tultepec, Mexico which is just north of Mexico City, are simply staggering and horrifying to watch. The video images showing the area where these explosions, these series of explosions went on and on, nearly three dozen people killed, more than 70 others injured.</p><p>The governor of the state where this town is tell CNN that three young children will be transported by plane to a hospital in Texas where they will be treated for their extreme burns. So you can imagine that many of the other victims still grappling and dealing with these same types of wounds as well. The burns could be a very serious issue for many of the victims and survivors of these explosions.</p><p>But the video images really capturing the drama and the intensity of the moment as people rushed to the scene to try to help what they could. Video images from the ground also showing the scorched fireworks stand. This is an open air market in the town of Tultepec and a town that is basically known as the fireworks capital of Mexico.</p><p>This is a huge industry in this town, and extremely popular especially this time of year as you head into the holiday season and New Year's festivities and that sort of thing. So it will be very common for thousands of people to be walking through this open air market to see all of the elaborate fireworks displays and fireworks pyrotechnics that were on display.</p><p>The governor of that state also tells CNN that they are looking to determine whether or not this was deliberately set. The exact cause has not been determined as emergency crews are still trying to sift through the scene looking for any kind of survivors and perhaps more victims of this, this explosion that's just seemed to go on and on, a horrifying scene in Mexico.</p><p>Ed Lavandera, CNN, Dallas.</p><p>VAUSE: A Colombian cargo plane crashed minutes after takeoff killing five crew members. Video shows the plane plowing through fences and scraping the ground moments before bursting into flames. No word yet on what caused the crash. The plane's flight technician survived.</p><p>Nineteen minutes past 11:00 here on Tuesday night. Let's go back now to Max Foster in Berlin.</p><p>FOSTER: Yeah, Wednesday morning here. Following the attack on the Christmas market behind me. They're hoping to reopen it as soon as possible, possibly today in a show of defiance against that terrorism. But we are also learning more about another attack. And that's the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey. The body of Ambassador Andrey Karlov has arrived in Moscow. Seven people have been detained for questioning including the shooter's relatives and friends.</p><p>[02:20:04] Russian investigators are now in Turkey and Turkey State Media say books on Al Qaeda and a Gulen movement were found in the shooter's home. Turkey blames the Gulen movement for July's coup attempt and now according to state-run media they say the Gulen group is behind the assassination. Fethulla Gulen is condemning the attack however. Our Nic Robertson spoke with a photographer who captured the horrific shooting. We have to warn you his report contains graphic images.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURHAN OZBILICI, ASSOCIATED PRESS PHOTOGRAPHER: I heard shots very loud. Bam, bam, bam. I said this is terrible (inaudible).</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: What did you do?</p><p>OZBILICI: Horrible. So, the people standing in front, they disappeared. They throw them on the floor. Then, they try -- they were trying to hide them to take shelter.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Were you afraid?</p><p>OZBILICI: I was shocked but -- I'm afraid but not much, not that panic.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Were you not afraid taken it? You've got a camera, he's got a gun.</p><p>OZBILICI: Well, I'm very sensitive and in difficult situation. I'm calm. I said I have a responsibility to record this event. And the ambassador was lying on the ground, not moving. And guy was making some politically motivated speech but I could not understand. I said, maybe he's speaking Russian, in Russian. Some people were screaming and crying so, I could not hear well. Then, he turned around the body and from very close range he shot one more time.</p><p>ROBERTSON: On the ambassador?</p><p>OZBILICI: Yes.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Just to make sure he was dead?</p><p>OZBILICI: I think so. When I learned that the guy was killed, I was very shocked. Why they killed him? He did nothing to take anybody hostage. He was alone. They have to capture him alive.</p><p>ROBERTSON: They could have done.</p><p>OZBILICI: I don't know, I don't know what is the reason -- motive behind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOSTER: An incredible moment there. Nic Robertson there, interviewing the photographer who captured those chilling images. Well, despite the ambassador's assassination, the three countries with the most influence in Syria met in Moscow. The foreign ministers from Russia, Turkey, and Iran said they will work on finding a political solution to the brutal Syrian civil war. They pledged to first secure a wider cease fire so that aid can be delivered. Russia's foreigner minister says their plans will be most effective in dealing with the crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (Interpreted): I am sure that as we reach success in fighting terrorism, as we start the political process between Syrians with our help, as we reach success at these directions. We will be able to formulate our common approach which will definitely be based on declared goals. To win over terrorism, to restore territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence, and unity of Syria Arab republics. We are united in that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOSTER: Turkey says meanwhile evacuations from Aleppo will be completed by Wednesday and that around 37,000 people have been rescued so far. Earlier, I spoke to CNN Contributor and Former Moscow Bureau Chief Jill Dougherty about the foreign ministers meeting over there in Moscow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: And when it comes to Russia, it's really solidifying their role in the Middle East. I mean, this is, this very interesting because you know who's not at that meeting and that's the United States. It's Iran, Russia, and Turkey, not the United States. And that's very significant.</p><p>So, they're moving forward. They have -- they're putting up a united front that is Turkey and Russia. And they're making it -- the Russians are making it very clear that they don't feel that they need the Americans or maybe even want the Americans. And are just moving forward on some type of resolution, what that will be precisely is not clear. But you're right, Max -- I mean, the diplomacy is moving fast, and the Russians solidifying whatever gains they have.</p><p>FOSTER: And how are the Americans viewing this? As they move away from -- or, you know, distancing perhaps from the United States and moving more closely with a longer term relationship with Russia.</p><p>DOUGHERTY: You know, there's not a lot I think that the United States can do right now. President Obama has made it clear. And he only has now, you know, a few weeks left in office. That he is not going to take any type of major action in Syria. And you have a new president coming in who has -- this is Mr. Trump, who's made clear that he feels that he could possibly work with Russia and possibly even work with President Bashar Al-Assad which seems unthinkable for us when you talk about unthinkable things, that certainly is that the United States or this president incoming would think of working with Bashar Al-Assad to fight terrorism.</p><p>[02:25:03] And that's the way Donald Trump looks at it, very black and white. He feels that the Russians have taken the fight to the terrorists. He wants to fight with the terrorists and defeat them. And that means that he can ally himself with Russia.</p><p>Now, when he comes into office, the details of that, how that would be done, and precisely what would happen, would Russia be leading the charge, would the Americans be following, none of those details are clear. But the overall picture seems to be that, you know, Russians defining pretty much what's going on in Syria.</p><p>FOSTER: And there's Donald Trump in a way with his sort of overtures to Russia, open the way for countries like Turkey to have closer relationships and build bridges with Russia?</p><p>DOUGHERTY: Well, yes. Although, I think that, you know, this rapprochement between Turkey and Russia really was entrained before Donald Trump entered the picture. But certainly if the American president is friendly with Russia then it gives encouragement to other countries who see which way the wind is blowing to move in that direction.</p><p>I think you might see it Max, mostly significantly on the issue of sanctions, economic sanctions against Russia which were introduced by the United States and by Europe as a reaction to what Russia did in Ukraine and also the annexation of Korea -- of Crimea. And so, if -- let's say, Donald Trump decided not to uphold the sanctions to weaken them or even get rid of them, that would give free rein to any other country especially some of the Europeans who wouldn't mind doing that, to simply go along. So, his relationship with Russia could be kind of a bellwether for other nations. This is not something traditional American foreign policy would necessarily accept, but this is the way it is with Mr. Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOSTER: Jill Dougherty following the attack in Turkey. Still ahead though here, the German chancellor horrified and saddened by Monday's Berlin attack.

To have -- they drink wine and eat something and stay here, and with friends or family. And then they're dead after five minutes. It's shocking. Yes, it is.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: What remains of the Christmas market is eerily quiet. Children's rides stand still, and there's a heavy police presence.</p><p>Normally this Christmas market would be full of shoppers drinking spiced wine and looking for gifts but as you can see these kiosks are closed. As authorities look for answers and Berliners mourn their dead.</p><p>In the capital, a show of solidarity. At the memorial church, people gather to honor the dead. And officials prepared the country for the worst.</p><p><person><nameText>ANGELA MERKEL, </nameText></person>GERMAN CHANCELLOR (Translator): I know that would be especially hard to bear for us.

Chancellor <person><nameText>Angela Merkel </nameText></person>visited the church Tuesday, visibly shocked. It is Christmas week and the country has been shaken, and with it her political future. Erin Mclaughlin, CNN, Berlin.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOSTER: We don't know whether it was an asylum seeker. We don't know anything about this attacker. ISIS claimed responsibility, but no evidence provided by them as to who their soldier is in their words. And nothing from the Security Services either. Presumably because they are look at this as an operational matter and they don't want to give anything away about their investigations, John.</p><p>JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Yeah Max, all they know is that he is out there, he is on the run, he could be dangerous and he might not be alone.</p><p>A Trump spokesman says the president-elect is closely monitoring the aftermath of the attacks about Germany and Turkey.

Mr. Trump has made it very, very clear he understands the threat that Radical Islamic terrorism poses to our nation and frankly to our friends and neighbors around the globe, and that we've got to be able to call it what it is and then root it out by its very -- by the bottom.

CNN's Athena Jones has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[02:35:04] ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Obama moving to secure his legacy on the environment and beyond, before he hands the presidency to Donald Trump. Tonight new measures to bar offshore drilling indefinitely in the parts of the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean, in part to prevent environmental disasters like the B.P. Oil Spill. BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT: I share people's concerns about offshore drilling. I remember the B.P. Spill in the Gulf of Mexico all too well.</p><p>JONES: It's an issue that has been front and center for the president, who sees climate change as the greatest threat facing future generations. And believes the U.S. and the world must do more to combat it.</p><p>OBAMA: We're not moving fast enough. And for the sake of our kids we've got to keep going. America has to lead the world in transitioning to a clean energy economy.</p><p>JONES: President Obama's last-minute move is based on a 64-year-old law. Not an easily reversible executive order, creating a legal hurdle for the incoming president, a climate change skeptic, who has vowed to pull out of the Paris climate accords and to increase domestic energy production.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: Every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country, often, foreign countries not very friendly to us.</p><p>JONES: And the president isn't just taking action on the environment. He's also preparing to transfer an additional 17 or 18 inmates from the U.S. Prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to other countries, according to the \"New York Times\", slashing the remaining population there by nearly a third, though, stopping short of fulfilling his 2008 campaign promise to close the prison.</p><p>OBAMA: They will be judged harshly by history. And I will continue to do all that I can to remove this blot on our national honor.</p><p>JONES: President-elect Trump has promised to not only keep the prison open but to fill it up with quote, \"Some bad dudes.\" Obama also, this week granting clemency to 231 people, mostly drug offenders. The most ever in one day, bringing the total number to a new record for any presidency, the White House signaling there are more acts of clemency to come. All part of a broader criminal justice reform effort. These final moves aimed at solidifying his agenda.</p><p>JULIAN ZELIZER, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: They're all issues that he's talked about a lot and that he's attempted to get action on but all three are issues where he has been extraordinarily frustrated and unable to really move congress.</p><p>JONES: The president running through the tape and presenting a series of direct challenges to Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Thanks to CNN Correspondent Athena Jones for that report. It is 22 minutes before the top of the hour. We'll take a short break here. When we come back, the gunman behind the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history pledged allegiance to ISIS. Has some victims' families are blaming social media for the massacre, and they're taking it to court.</p><p>[02:41:17] VAUSE: The families of the victims from the Orlando nightclub shooting are suing some big tech companies accusing Twitter, Facebook and Google of providing material support to ISIS. For more on this, CNN Security Analyst Hemu Nigam and Criminal Defense Attorney Brian Claypool, thank you both for being here.</p><p>Let's look at the legal hurdles here first, Brian. The Communications Decency Act, essentially shields computer services from liability for content. So how does that work, and that's a pretty big hill to climb in this case, right?</p><p>BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINIAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, I would like to say it its insurmountable. I mean, when I first heard about a lawsuit, being filed as a result of the Orlando nightclub shooting, I thought that these families were going to be suing maybe law enforcement for not going in more quickly to get -- to shoot at Omar Mateen or possibly even the gun shop owner, or even possibly the FBI for not investigating. When I heard that they were suing internet companies, I thought of one thing, the Titanic, because these cases are sinking fast.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. But this law essentially gives a free pass to social media. I mean especially the site.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Yeah, but there was a law enact. A federal law ...</p><p>VAUSE: Yeah.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: ... in the United States enacted in 1996, to make it easy for you and the viewers, basically it says if somebody else posts information on the internet. The internet provider is not responsible ...</p><p>VAUSE: Right.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: ... for that data and that cannot be sued and be held civilly liable for that. One exception is if where there's Federal criminal activity. And I think that's what these families are trying to do. And they're trying to say that the internet providers were materially supporting ISIS.</p><p>VAUSE: And with that this is the twist of the case because the lawsuit is arguing by matching user content with targeted advertising. Somehow the social media site is providing its own novel content. So Hemu, explain, you know, the technical aspects to this.</p><p>HEMU NIGAM, INTERNET SECURITY ANALYST: Yeah, and I have to first say you mean, all our hearts go out to the families. We all feel that way. But that doesn't mean a lawsuit's going to solve that problem. And I think what Google -- Google is actually taking the lead on this. What they're doing is they're saying look, if you are looking for ISIS content, maybe you're somebody who might get recruited. There is advertising that comes up that takes you to places that you can get help or at least even for example see content of what happens when ISIS attacks such as what happened in the Berlin Christmas incident just two days ago, or yesterday. So Google is doing that. Twitter is actually doing a lot of things. And the companies are getting together and saying we're going to band forces and try to solve this problem not by ourselves but together and working with law enforcement.</p><p>VAUSE: But that right now the families are saying that there are researches, be it on Google, Facebook, or whatever, is what is essentially bringing all of this together, which it seems to be a novel legal approach, Brian.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Yeah. I mean, the only way I think these families can prevail in this case is if they've got some information, for example, that Twitter or Facebook was aware of some really nefarious postings that might incite terrorism and then they didn't do anything to remove those. Because then you're possibly facilitating this, you're on notice. Bear in mind, these internet providers don't have a duty to canvass the internet to find these postings.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, with that in mind, this lawsuit is also alleging that the tech companies should not do enough to shut down Jihadist groups. They use this example of an ISIS linked Twitter Account. This is for the suit, \"When its account @TurMedia332 was shut down, it started @TurMedia 334. When that was shutdown it started @TurMedia335. This naming convention adding one digit to a new account of the last one is suspended, does not seem as if it would require artificial intelligence to spot. Each of these accounts also uses and used the photograph of the bearded man's face over and over and over again\".</p><p>So, Henry, from a technical point it wouldn't be easy to Twitter. To simply stop this accounts from springing out over and over again?</p><p>[02:45:03] NIGAM: Well, here is the reality. First let's give Kudos to Twitter for deleting 360,000 accounts ...</p><p>VAUSE: Right.</p><p>NIGAM: ... in the first place. Knowing that these ISIS folks are going to try to come back and create denude accounts and do kind of a cat and mouse game. But that said, there's a new initiative happening right now between Google, Microsoft, and Twitter where they're going to be fingerprinting indicia of an ISIS account and then using it by sharing it amongst themselves in the data base and saying here's a new account coming up, it looks very much like, this has the fingerprints of these other accounts, and I think you're going to see those accounts even disappearing.</p><p>VAUSE: So just to be very clear. These are legal responsibility here for these companies not just to, you know, sort of mow the weeds but to pull the roots as well?</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Well, that's exactly right. I mean, well if they're notified of some of these accounts that might be inciting mass terrorism then they have a duty to remove those accounts. But John, really I think the point that I'm troubled with here is, is this really the cause of a guy like Omar Mateen going into a nightclub and shooting up people? I think people in the United States need to be paying attention more to red flags. That he went out and got a gun at a place where he shouldn't have gotten a gun. So I think that to me is the bigger issue.</p><p>VAUSE: But, you know, just because, you know, Mateen -- Omar Mateen may have seen these videos of this Jihadi content online, doesn't mean he was influenced by it.</p><p>NIGAM: No, not at all. He could be talking to 10,000 other people in off settings. A lot of times what ISIS recruiters do is, they may target one individual and then immediately go into an app conversation, a cell phone conversation, all these other kinds of things they're doing. So this is one of those where making the causal connection is never going to happen.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: That's exactly right.</p><p>NIGAM: And I think at the end of the day what I think the world needs to know is you've got lawyers here who are filing lawsuits, giving false hope to families who have already been tragically hurt. And now they're going to say wait a minute, nothing's going to happen? Well that's because you went down the wrong path.</p><p>VAUSE: Do you think it is false hope?</p><p>CLAYPOOL: I think it is false hope. You guys just hit the nail on the head. You've got to prove causation that this -- was this a substantial factor in causing Omar Mateen to do what he did? I doubt it.</p><p>VAUSE: Guys, thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>CLAYPOOL: Thanks, John.</p><p>NIGAM: Thanks, John.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, four officials linked to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan are now facing criminal charges. The state's attorney general has announced emergency services and water plan officials will face felony charges. It's alleged they misused millions of dollars in state funds and conspired to run the city's water treatment plant for more than a year when it wasn't safe for Flint residents to drink. Many residents later tested positive for lead poisoning, blamed on the contaminated water.</p><p>Well, still to come here, Czech Tennis Star Petra Kvitova shaken but lucky to be alive after surviving a knife attack, details just ahead.</p><p>ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: This is CNN Weather Watch. I'm meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Will the cold air finally going to retreat for some folks in the U.S. It's going to begin to retreat. So areas of the northeast and the mid-Atlantic will actually find the start to get some temperatures back up a little bit compared to where they have been. [02:50:10] Now, that system that moved to through portions of Southern Canada into the northern plain of the U.S. and into the Midwest not a big snow maker and it's already starting to finish most of its track and continue off to the east. What we're really paying attention to is this next system that is like to have started to make way into the southwestern region of the United States, bringing some much-needed rain to areas of Southern California and also into Arizona.</p><p>Now, here is a look at the forecast. Cloudy conditions for Los Angeles. High temperature right around 21 already starting to see those clouds building in from the next system. New York, high temperature of six, mostly cloudy skies but as we talked about the warming trend maybe they're getting back close to double digits by the time we approached the weekend. Dallas, a high of 19 degrees with mostly sunny skies, likely to maintain relatively nice weather, even into Thursday and Friday, Kingston looking at mostly sunny skies, high temperature right around 30 degrees. Mexico City nice partly cloudy with a high temperature right into the low to mid 20s where it will remain through the week.</p><p>VAUSE: A two-time Wimbledon Champion has a long road to recovery ahead. Petra Kvitova was stabbed during a robbery in her apartment. The tennis star has now undergone hours of surgery on her main playing hand. World Sport's Anchor Don Riddell has details.</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah, but the sounds of it Petra Kvitova is very lucky to be alive but it remains to be seen how this will affect her ability to continue playing the game she loves. Kvitova is one of the best players in the world. She's one of the most respected athletes on the tour. And echoing the left-handed style of her compatriot Martina Navratilova, Kvitova was the Wimbledon champion in 2011 and 2014. But on Tuesday morning she was eating breakfast at home when a man tricked his way into her apartment.</p><p>According to a police spokesman, this man was masquerading as a maintenance man but then once inside he went on the attack. Kvitova suffered cuts to all five fingers on her left hand, also sustaining damage to her tendons and nerves. Her assailant fled the scene. Remarkably, Kvitova was able to update her condition on social media, saying \"In my attempt to defend myself, I was badly injured on my left hand. I'm shaken but fortunate to be alive. The injury is severe, and I will need to see specialists, but if you know anything about me, I'm strong, and I will fight this. Thank you all again for your love and support\".</p><p>Well, late on Tuesday night, Petra's management team released an update on her surgery. And the details frankly are pretty sobering. It reads, \"Petra has undergone surgery for three hours and 45 minutes. Considering the extent of the damage, the surgery went very well. Doctors repaired damage to tendons in all five digits of the left hand as well as two nerves. Petra will wear a cast on her hand for six to eight weeks and will be unable to bear weight for three months.</p><p>The circumstances are very different but it is hard not to think about Monica Seles right now. She was in the prime of her career when she was brutally knifed in the back during a match in Germany. Seles recovered two years later and in fact she won another major title. But honestly she was never the same again. Today's news really has sent shock waves through the tennis community. Martina Navratilova who Kvitova idolize, she's wrote on twitter \"Just finding out about Petra Kvitova and the awful stabbing and injury to her hand. Pulling for you, Petra.\" And Caroline Wozniacki said, \"Just heard what happened. All my thoughts are with her today. So scary. One of the nicest people I know.\" For sure the tennis community and sports fans worldwide are spending their best wishes to Petra Kvitova. It remains to be seen just how serious this is going to be. But we do wish her the very best. Back to you.</p><p>[02:55:10] VAUSE: Don Riddell, thank you. And tributes are being left around Berlin to honor the victims of Monday's attack. The Brandenburg Gate, one of Berlin's iconic landmarks lit up with colors of the German flag. In one vigil dozens held hands to form a human chain. And near the scene of the attack mourners left candles and flowers at makeshift memorials along with messages of support and condolence.</p><p>Much more from Berlin with my colleague Max Foster in just a few moments. I'm John Vause. Thank you for watching \"CNN NEWSROOM\", live from Los Angeles.</p><p>FOSTER: Manhunt. Police in Berlin search for the driver behind the deadly attack on a Christmas market as ISIS says it played a role in the attack.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2016122119CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MFM-38R1-DXH2-62J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7346\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 21, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It has become a central focus of Warren's campaign, which has caused business leaders like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to voice concern, and the fight over big tech within the Democratic Party presidential primaries has bled into the courts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In all of this, Andrew Yang has emerged as a reasoned voice against breaking up these companies. In a recent op-ed, he noted that \"Breaking up Facebook or Apple sounds good, but it wouldn't address this issue.\" His alternative, however, is not a practical solution either. Instead of breaking tech companies up, Yang proposes a Department of the Attention Economy that will implement regulations that curb what he sees as \"the negative effects of smartphones and social media.\"</p><p> Both the history and current reality of the Internet suggest that Yang's proposal has little chance of alleviating the addictive qualities or mental health effects that he says social media and big tech are having on Americans, young people in particular. It might only serve to make things worse.</p><p> We don't have to guess what a regulated internet will look like. For most of its history, in fact, the Internet was a tightly controlled platform called the ARPAnet, which served as the academic research network that preceded today's Internet. It was a platform in which norms and behavior were dictated to users by the federal government. Here is an excerpt of MIT's 1982 guide for new users of ARPAnet explained how it should be used:</p><p> \"It is considered illegal to use the ARPAnet for anything which is not in direct support of Government business. At the Al lab, we use the network to talk to other researchers about all kinds of things. For example, personal messages to other ARPAnet subscribers (for example, to arrange a get-together or check and say a friendly hello) are generally not considered harmful. This is one of the ways in which we adapt the network environment to our community. It is very clear that without that sort of freedom, the network could not have evolved to its current point of technical and social sophistication.</p><p> \"Sending electronic mail over the ARPAnet for commercial profit or political purposes is both antisocial and illegal. By sending such messages, you can offend many people, and it is possible to get MIT in serious trouble with the Government agencies which manage the ARPAnet.\"</p><p> You see, as a platform tightly controlled by the federal government, ARPAnet was regulated in an effort to stave off the perceived negative or \"antisocial\" effects of the commercial or political use of the platform. And while some are now arguing today that perhaps those same standards should be reinstated (just look at Twitter's ban of political advertising), it is hard to argue that the ARPAnet as conceived in 1982 would have changed the world in the way that the successive version of the commercial internet has.</p><p> But many, including Yang and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), argue in favor of heavily and specifically regulating social media in the name of curbing \"social media addiction.\" And while we still have much to learn about whether or not this \"addiction\" is a serious problem, it ignores why people use the Internet, to begin with.

It has become a central focus of Warren's campaign, which has caused business leaders like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to voice concern, and the fight over big tech within the Democratic Party presidential primaries has bled into the courts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In all of this, Andrew Yang has emerged as a reasoned voice against breaking up these companies. In a recent op-ed, he noted that \"Breaking up Facebook or Apple sounds good, but it wouldn't address this issue.\" His alternative, however, is not a practical solution either. Instead of breaking tech companies up, Yang proposes a Department of the Attention Economy that will implement regulations that curb what he sees as \"the negative effects of smartphones and social media.\"</p><p> Both the history and current reality of the Internet suggest that Yang's proposal has little chance of alleviating the addictive qualities or mental health effects that he says social media and big tech are having on Americans, young people in particular. It might only serve to make things worse.</p><p> We don't have to guess what a regulated internet will look like. For most of its history, in fact, the Internet was a tightly controlled platform called the ARPAnet, which served as the academic research network that preceded today's Internet. It was a platform in which norms and behavior were dictated to users by the federal government. Here is an excerpt of MIT's 1982 guide for new users of ARPAnet explained how it should be used:</p><p> \"It is considered illegal to use the ARPAnet for anything which is not in direct support of Government business. At the Al lab, we use the network to talk to other researchers about all kinds of things. For example, personal messages to other ARPAnet subscribers (for example, to arrange a get-together or check and say a friendly hello) are generally not considered harmful. This is one of the ways in which we adapt the network environment to our community. It is very clear that without that sort of freedom, the network could not have evolved to its current point of technical and social sophistication.</p><p> \"Sending electronic mail over the ARPAnet for commercial profit or political purposes is both antisocial and illegal. By sending such messages, you can offend many people, and it is possible to get MIT in serious trouble with the Government agencies which manage the ARPAnet.\"</p><p> You see, as a platform tightly controlled by the federal government, ARPAnet was regulated in an effort to stave off the perceived negative or \"antisocial\" effects of the commercial or political use of the platform. And while some are now arguing today that perhaps those same standards should be reinstated (just look at Twitter's ban of political advertising), it is hard to argue that the ARPAnet as conceived in 1982 would have changed the world in the way that the successive version of the commercial internet has.</p><p> But many, including Yang and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), argue in favor of heavily and specifically regulating social media in the name of curbing \"social media addiction.\" And while we still have much to learn about whether or not this \"addiction\" is a serious problem, it ignores why people use the Internet, to begin with. Yang's effort to create a federal agency focused on \"curbing design features that maximize screen time\" and discourage \"Design features that encourage social validation\" assumes that people are merely tricked and manipulated into using today's most popular Internet platforms. The data, however, suggests that it is not true at all.</p><p> Why do people seem so \"addicted\" to the Internet? It may be passion, not addiction, driving users. A recent survey of Internet users found that approximately 80 million - 38.15% - of U.S. adults use the Internet to pursue hobbies and passion projects. And out of those 80 million, nearly 35% of them say that the internet is essential to that pursuit. This means that there are just short of 30 million Americans that can only pursue their passion projects with the Internet. Looking back at the limited acceptable applications of the Internet of the early 80s, it is hard to explain why taking us back in time will make millions of Americans better off.</p><p> Putting a federal agency in a position to determine acceptable and unacceptable behavior on the internet should not be a thought experiment played out by presidential hopefuls. Instead, we should look at the history of the internet in order to understand more clearly what that world would really be like. And while \"big tech\" has become the target of frustration and focus of the Democratic primaries, taking us back 30 years will only serve to undermine the greatest platform we have today, to connect millions of Americans with their passions and help them find more meaning in their lives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-bee654e7c184c694a64e88da994e88135c1e01</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2896DB8468F092 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR3-3GY1-DXVP-V552-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Wylie said his Facebook account was disabled on Sunday, \"for blowing the whistle, on something they have known privately for two years.\" Facebook says it is suspending Wylie's Facebook account, despite his role as a whistleblower, as it carries out its investigation on Cambridge Analytica.Christopher Wylie, the 28-year-old man who both founded and blew the whistle on Cambridge Analytica, the data-analytics firm that played an important role in Trump's 2016 campaign and the Brexit Leave campaign, had his Facebook account disabled on Sunday.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/975335430043389952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Suspended by @facebook[1]. For blowing the whistle. </p><p>On something they have known privately for 2 years. pic.twitter.com/iSu6VwqUdG[2];Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform[3] on Friday, amid multiple revealing stories published in The New York Times[4] and The Guardian[5] over the weekend that included interviews with Wylie, who oversaw the conception and realization of Cambridge Analytica's tool that harvested millions of Facebook profiles illegitimately, to be used for various political campaigns in both the US and UK. In an interview published in The Guardian[6] on Sunday, Wylie detailed how Cambridge Analytica harvested data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles between June and August 2014, even sharing a 2016 letter from Facebook's own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica \"had acquired the data illegitimately,\" and asking Wylie to delete the data. Perhaps most troubling is that, according to Wylie, Facebook never followed up in the two years since that letter to see if he had, in fact, deleted the stolen data.

And probably for the best. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/hvibNfqSRL\">https://t.co/hvibNfqSRL</url>[7]Despite reportedly having evidence that Cambridge Analytica had illegitimately collected user data, Facebook did not suspend Cambridge Analytica until Friday \u2014 more than two years after the alleged data breach from Cambridge Analytica was first reported, and four days after The Guardian reportedly sought comment[8] from Facebook about the story. Facebook, for its part, doesn't call the incident a \"breach.\"[9] A spokesperson told The Guardian: \"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it's a serious abuse of our rules.\" So, why did Facebook suspend Wylie's account? Business Insider reached out for comment, and Facebook was not immediately available to respond. Facebook did say on Friday that it would suspend Wylie's account \u2014 as well as the accounts of Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, and Strategic Communication Laboratories, Cambridge Analytica's parent company \u2014 while it carried out its investigation. It's unclear if Wylie's account would be restored after the investigation ends. The full stories about Wylie, Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, and the roles they played in the 2016 presidential election are truly incredible and worth reading \u2014 The New York Times story[10], as well as The Guardian's interview with Wylie[11] and its story on the harvested Facebook profiles[12].

GEN. H.R. MCMASTER, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road.  </p><p>      NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  I have no problem kicking it to General Mattis because I think he has plenty of options.  </p><p>      WALLACE (voice-over):  We'll discuss foreign hot spot and preview the president's message at the international community on North Korea, Iran and terror with national security advisor, General H.R. McMaster. </p><p>      Then, does President Trump have an immigration deal with Chuck and Nancy or not?  </p><p>      SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  We have reached an understanding on this issue.  We have to work out details.  </p><p>      REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER:  We have an agreement to move forward.  </p><p>      DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The wall to me is vital.

And this week, President Trump goes to New York to join other world leaders there for the first time.  With plenty of hot spots to discuss, what will the president focus on and what action will he seek?  </p><p>      Joining us live here in Washington, the president's national security advisor, General H.R. McMaster.  </p><p>      General, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Thanks, Chris, great to be here.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  As we say, President Trump speaks to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, his first time on that stage.  How important does he think the speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his doctrine of America First?  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really three things.  First is to protect the American people, the second is to promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote accountability and sovereignty.  And in those three things will allow him to communicate his vision for America's role in the world, but also what his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  Well, let's unpack that and let's start with issue number one.  And that, of course, is North Korea.  The president tweeted about that this morning.  Let's put it up on the screen.  </p><p>      The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night, asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.</p><p>      Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from the president before or is that a new one?  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, that's a new one and I think maybe for the president, but it reminds me of a cover of the \"Economist\" a few years ago, portraying him as Rocket Man.  But, of course, that's where the rockets are coming from.  Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  All right.  But let me --  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global problem.        WALLACE:  Let's pick up on that, here's what you had to say on Friday.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      MCMASTER:  We've been kicking the can down the road and we're out of road.  And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of a military option, there is a military option.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      WALLACE:  General, what does that mean, out of road?  The fact is you want to get sanctions more time.  You're not about to go to war.  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have.  We're out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long, drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks.  </p><p>      And what that agreement does, though, that's particularly dangerous oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo as the new normal.  And this regime is so close now to threatening the United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing, if necessary, a military option.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  So, how do you draw that line?  How do you decide we've reached the point that we have to move to a military option now?  How long do you get sanctions?  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this.  So, we can't really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are coming to.  </p><p>      But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies and partners to be as effective as we can.  And what we recognize is not really much time.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  All right.  The administration -- I want to pick up on one part of that.  The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea's trading partners.  </p><p>      Here's Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will use economic sanctions to bring North Korea to the table.  </p><p>      BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST:  You're saying stopping trade with China?  </p><p>      MNUCHIN:  Stopping trade with anybody.  Nobody would be off the table.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      WALLACE:  But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China. They're our single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for export of goods.  </p><p>      General, we're not about to cut off trade with China.  It would crater our economy.  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, this is an indication, isn't it, of how serious this problem is with North Korea, and why it's in all of our interest to work together to resolve it.  So, of course, we China to help as much as they can.  You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over North Korea.  And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it's in their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  But, I mean, let's be serious here.  We're not going to cut off all trade with China.  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own people.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn't it possible -- in fact, isn't it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key to his survival is to have a nuclear capability?  He talked this week about having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there's nothing that can be done diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him from pursuing that effort.  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more vulnerable and makes him less and less secure.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject.  The president is also going to talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations. But this week, he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal.  He didn't do that.</p><p>      So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement.  I know he has to recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn't he going to live with it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts?  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, we have to see what live with it means, right? Live with can't be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability.  And so, a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that agreement.  It is under-enforced now.  We know Iran has already violated parts of the agreement by -- </p><p>      WALLACE:  But the IAEA says that they're complying with it, sir.      MCMASTER:  Well, the IAEA has identified and we've identified some of these breaches that Iran has then corrected.  But what does that tell you about Iranian behavior?  They're not just walking up to the line on the agreement.  They're crossing the line at times.  </p><p>      So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal.  It is -- as the president said -- it is the worst deal.  It gave all these benefits to the Iranian regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East.  </p><p>      This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad regime in Syria are Iranian proxies.  </p><p>      And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian destabilizing behavior and we can't allow this deal to enable that.  Their missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian network with more and more destructive capability that places all their neighbors at risk.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is terror.  The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to continue its war on terror.  Here's what he had to say this week.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      TRUMP:  We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the previous eight years against ISIS.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      WALLACE:  But, I don't have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London subway this week.  That's the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just this year.  And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S.</p><p>      MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental things very effectively.  </p><p>      The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks against us and against our allies.  </p><p>      The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they resource these kinds of operations.  </p><p>      And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology.  And this has a lot to do with some of Prime Minister May's top priorities, which is to constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other.        And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and defeat them.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  There is a report this weekend, I'm sure you read, that says that President Trump has decided he's not going to pull out of the Paris climate accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions but he's going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a reduced commitment.</p><p>      Is that true, sir?  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  No, it's false.  That's a false report.  The president decided to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American people and because it was a bad deal for the environment. It gave the worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon without significantly reducing those levels.  </p><p>      The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and globally.  And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively within this flawed agreement.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  So, he's out of the Paris Climate Accord?  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  He's out of the Paris Climate Accord.  What he said, the door is open.  If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws -- </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      WALLACE:  But the allies said they're not going to renegotiate.  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, the president's ears are open, though, if at some point they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the president's very legitimate concerns about Paris.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  OK.  One final area.  It's widely known in Washington that you and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world. One of the first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a regular official member of the NSC.  </p><p>      He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as globalists.  He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to double down in Afghanistan.  </p><p>      Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the White House?  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with multiple options.  And then, based on his decisions, to help the president implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the interests of the American people.  </p><p>      And so, what's important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda.  You know, we're advancing the president's agenda and we are advancing policies and strategies that are for the American people.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker.  Are you saying that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and advance his own agenda?  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the president well in bringing him multiple options.  There were some who try to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that didn't serve the president well.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir?  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  I think this has been too hyped on one individual.  I mean, these reports of feuding, this really didn't even happen.  I mean, we had our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council, and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  General McMaster, thank you.  Thanks for your time. You're a busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes.  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  It's always a pleasure, Chris.  Thank you.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  Thank you.  And we'll be watching the president's speech, of course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir.  </p><p>      MCMASTER:  Thank you.</p><p>      WALLACE:  Up next, we'll talk with two leading senators about the president's move to cut deals with Democrats.  How long will it affect the Trump agenda and how long will it last?</p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>      WALLACE:  President Trump had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters worried.  So, where do we stand on DACA and whose driving the agenda now here in Washington?  </p><p>      Joining us from Chicago, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.  And here in Washington, Republican Senator Roy Blunt.  </p><p>      Well, gentlemen, let's start with the big question here in Washington.  The most immediate question, does President Trump have a deal with speaker -- former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to DACA or not?  </p><p>      And here's part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The wall is going to be built, and it will be funded a little bit later.  </p><p>      SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  It was a very, very positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall.  </p><p>      TRUMP:  They cannot obstruct the wall.  The wall, to me, is vital.  If I don't get the wall, then we will become the obstruction.</p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points. Is there a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall? And is there a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship?  </p><p>      SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, there's a basic understanding.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President Thursday night.  They came to a basic understanding, without the details, without the obvious negotiations that have to follow. And then, Chuck and Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a press release, so it's clear on both sides what we've agreed to.  They did exactly that.  </p><p>      There was great pushback from the right.  They didn't like the parameters of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since.  But we are going forward.  We are going forward with the understanding that we can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection.  Those are the two pillars of this understanding.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night?  </p><p>      DURBIN:  Yes.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  That's pretty brief.  </p><p>      OK.  Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday.  Let's take a look at that.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      TRUMP:  We're not talking about amnesty at all.  We have not talked about amnesty.  There will be no amnesty.  We're not talking about that as part of the transaction.        (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      WALLACE:  So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there's genuine confusion here in Washington.  Do you believe that there is a deal on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could support?  </p><p>      SEN. ROY BLUNT (R), MISSOURI:  Well, I think there's a desire to come to a conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border security as part of the understanding, but the details haven't been worked out, another thing that he mentioned.  </p><p>      Well, the details here matter.  You know, it's always been three separate questions in my view.  One is, how do you secure the border? Two is, what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country?  And three, what you do with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the DREAMers, were brought to the country illegally?  </p><p>      I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here.  If you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally.  </p><p>      But you're not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point in the future say the border is now operationally secure.  That allows everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris.  </p><p>      CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border, does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for DREAMers?  </p><p>      BLUNT:  It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it doesn't have to include the wall at this point I don't think. There are a lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn't have to take the test that everybody else takes?  How long would you have to be here under the DREAM Act (ph)?  There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  All right.  Let's turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or not President Trump is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats at the expense of Republicans.  Here is what the president had to say about that on Air Force One.  </p><p>      (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>      TRUMP:  If the Republicans don't stick together then I'm going to have to do more work.  If they are unable to stick together, then I'm going to have to get a little help from the Democrats and I've got that, I'll tell you.        (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>      WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass Obamacare repeal and replace, isn't it wise for this president to go to Democrats and look for some votes?  </p><p>      BLUNT:  Well, I think the minority can't abuse the rules of the Senate.  But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work with you to get most things done.  The tenures -- I was either the chief deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10 years that didn't have Democrats vote for them. That's part of the work -- that's how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else to move forward.  </p><p>      So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it impossible to get your work done because you've lost your own side is not part of that either.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a real -- not permanent, but working alliance between President Trump and congressional Democrats?  And what you say to those members -- folks on the left who don't trust this president and don't trust making deals with him?  </p><p>      SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  Well, of course, there will be people on the right and left who will be critical.  But Senator Roy Blunt and I are good examples of how this can work.  I have joined him and applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in the United States on a bipartisan basis.  Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray joined us.  </p><p>      Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn't shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we'll do it on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President. That's what American wants.  And the president said, I'll take it.  </p><p>      We did it.  And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another, respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a goal.  Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate.  It can be done.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  But there are some differences.  I mean, you talked for instance about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending.  </p><p>      And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax reform.  The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate tax, Democrats opposed both.  The president talks about paying for tax cuts based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that.        Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences, fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform?  </p><p>      DURBIN:  Chris, there will be differences, but that's what the Senate is all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to some degree.  That's where you get the best legislation and that's where you get something the American people can trust.  </p><p>      Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to achieve it.  We proved that with repeal and replace.  That did not achieve what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018 midterm elections?  You have the president out on the stump recently with North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp.  This is somebody who was a vulnerable Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in 2018.  The president is saying nice things about her.  </p><p>      When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his basic campaign pledges, couldn't this hurt Republicans in 2018?  </p><p>      BLUNT:  Well, on the tax front, it's very important we get something done -- increases take-home pay for working families, that we're almost into a decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home pay.  A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where we should be headed.  </p><p>      We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that. But, you know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we'd be glad to work with you as long as you don't do these three things that you think are important parts of the tax package.  That's not a good way to start.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight.  People angry about the acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the death of a drug -- black drug suspect.  I know everyone opposes the violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the shooting and appalled by the verdict.  </p><p>      So, what's your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a lot of people in the African-American community?  </p><p>      BLUNT:  Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in what the chiefs are doing.  I also talked to a number of community leaders and African-American pastors.  I do think this is a place where we have to figure out how to come together.  You do have to accept what the judge who has the obligation to look at this case determined.  </p><p>      But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson. This happened before that happened.  And we just need to continue to watch this.  </p><p>      The division in the country whether it's St. Louis or Baltimore is not a good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work.  </p><p>      WALLACE:  Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both.  We'll stay on top of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out in Congress.  Thank you all, gentlemen.  </p><p>      Coming up, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President Trump's new search for votes on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p>      Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's potential deal to protect DREAMers without getting funding for the border wall?  </p><p>      Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>      WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump reaching across the aisle on tax reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      TRUMP:  I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty much where they are.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      WALLACE:  We'll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax reform.</p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: He likes us. He likes me anyway. </p><p>      I said, Mr. President, you're much better off if you can sometimes step right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction you're boxed.</p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to President Trump to deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. </p><p>      And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of townhall.com. </p><p>      Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he wasn't doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what President Trump is doing here, and will it work? </p><p>      NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better dealmaker. I think that's -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston, terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal. </p><p>      And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe we'll do a little more.</p><p>      Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may be smaller than people would like. But I think it's perfectly reasonable. I -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base.</p><p>      WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said, on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there's such big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with the Democrats? </p><p>      JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think you have to put this in context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan. With McConnell in particular, there's just not much of a relationship there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the president sees that McConnell just can't get it over the finish line, there's not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on the Capitol. </p><p>      And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he's been hearing from people like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like Trump, who isn't particularly ideological, who doesn't have deep roots to the conservative movement or Republican ideology. </p><p>      WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well, maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes.</p><p>      PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you've seen the president multiple times when he's had a chance to go to the mat over the wall and say, I'm going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I'm going to veto it over this wall. He's backed off. And I think that for his base, that's going to continue to be a frustration, but he's certainly shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit. </p><p>      WALLACE:  We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let's put some of it up.</p><p>      Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he rally his base? </p><p>      And Rick Conner posted this on FaceBook, how do you think amnesty for these illegals will square with the president's campaign promises to the contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall and all? </p><p>      Guy, how do you answer them?</p><p>      GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's what everyone is trying to figure out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the future. Unclear. </p><p>      But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40 billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of fencing. That's a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in the so-called \"border surge.\" So there's a chance that while the wall might be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or framed as a wall or a physical barrier. </p><p>      WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it's crazy to ask you what's the base going to do, but I'm going to ask you, what do you think the reaction of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on DACA that includes citizenship and doesn't include a wall as it had been commonly thought to exist?       BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But, overall, there was a sense that they trust President Trump, that they think that he's three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he's got their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board for most of his supporters. So that's what I would guess would be the case, unless it is egregiously bad. </p><p>      WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the prospects for a deal on tax reform? </p><p>      RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership. You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and they see this. They say he knows our interests, he's going to do what is best for us.</p><p>      There's a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you that. </p><p>      For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership who were saying that they don't understand why he took the wall off the table to begin with. It's the number one bargaining chip, they said, in terms of negotiating a deal. If you're going to take it off the table with Democrats, you should get something for it. So they're going to try to push him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that is possible that conservatives could vote for it.</p><p>      WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two senators, they're so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, on whether or not it's going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is a guess whether or not it's going to happen. </p><p>      BADE: Yes, I don't mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift we're seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill, Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn, they've all been writing a Republican bill and they're about to unveil it. </p><p>      Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a tax bill. So there's a fear that he's overstepping right now in terms of reaching out to Democrats and they're concerned that this is going to undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what he wants to do. </p><p>      WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker? </p><p>      GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions Schumer most wanted. And --</p><p>      WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can keep the debt ceiling going till March. </p><p>      GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn't break -- he couldn't say no. So we're a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that's the way I'd drive it. I'd say these people are so ideological they'd rather sacrifice the dreamers. </p><p>      WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington. </p><p>      All right, panel, we have to take a break here. </p><p>      When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley, powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We'll bring back the panel to discuss Congress' new scrutiny of big tech. </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we're still at the tip of the iceberg. The fact is, I don't think FaceBook has put the resources, the time. My understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads. </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after FaceBook admitted it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller. </p><p>      And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>      Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see the end of Washington's hands-off approach to big tech and especially these huge Internet companies?       GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age, they have enormous power. And I don't think you, in a free society, you can't have power that's hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of billionaires.</p><p>      WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy himself before he went into politics, said, that it's the wild, wild west there. Now, some people would say that's one of the reasons it succeed. Are you saying put government clamps on it? </p><p>      GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that there's some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company and wipe -- I mean they can be anti- conservative, they can be anti-liberal, they can do all sorts of things, and there's been almost no supervision, just to surface (ph) the information. </p><p>      WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you'd agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet companies, like FaceBook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet behemoths? </p><p>      BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now. Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia-linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people's private information being gathered and what happens if they're hacked. And so those are all concerns.</p><p>      So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington and they're typically anti-regulation. But it's safe to say that this sort of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else. </p><p>      WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but with some guardrails? </p><p>      BADE: I think that's the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow, that influences everyone's life so much? Look, there's a test case that's going on right now on Capitol Hill. There's going to be some hearings coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet. Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the Internet. </p><p>      So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can't -- if they're not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason to regulate, then it's safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power. </p><p>      WALLACE: It's funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies has just skyrocketed in the last few years. </p><p>      Julie, where are President Trump and his administration on this? You talk about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating FaceBook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation. </p><p>      PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So, look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon's and FaceBooks and presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are growing strong and are dominating on the global stage. </p><p>      Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don't think you can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that. But he's also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos's role in owning \"The Washington Post,\" he's taken on Amazon on his Twitter account. </p><p>      I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president's populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant like Amazon. </p><p>      WALLACE: Yes. There's also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy, about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don't have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on main street does have to pay taxes. </p><p>      PACE: And that's when you've see him go after Amazon in particular for. He's done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package. </p><p>      WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn't it?</p><p>      PACE: Yes (ph).      WALLACE:  That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because, Guy, there's another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and that's growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p>      You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley. </p><p>      BENSON: That's right. So you'll have Democrats, in particular I think, focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in Silicon Valley. And then you'll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of Google. </p><p>      Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying, uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on both sides, rather, start to dig in. </p><p>      WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich, because there's no question that these companies have been engines of huge economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington -- obviously there's a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington getting more involved in regulation of the Internet? </p><p>      BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn't exist as it does today if the government's clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one. And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from D.C., I'm just not sure that works out well. </p><p>      WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker. </p><p>      GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged by government. And that's overall been good for protecting our liberty. </p><p>      WALLACE: All right. We'll continue this debate. </p><p>      This is an important subject and we'll keep talking about it. </p><p>      Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>      Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" The doctor who keeps both the Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in pro sports. </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>      WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of derailing those hopes, which brings us to our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>      DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine, people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better. </p><p>      WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the time she's the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she's the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington Nationals. </p><p>      WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL? </p><p>      WEST: I don't even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my mind. I -- I never think of myself as different. </p><p>      WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle. </p><p>      West told us how different injuries are in the two sports. </p><p>      WEST: It's over use typically in baseball. We're dealing with a lot of shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it's a lot of traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage quickly. </p><p>      WALLACE: That's another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out of the game. But in football -- </p><p>      WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I'm examining the kid, is he going to play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly. </p><p>      WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision.</p><p>      WEST: I'm the players' doctor, right? So it's -- I want the best for the player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don't work for the team, I -- I want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players' best interests. </p><p>      WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to doing your job? </p><p>      WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they are very trusting, I think. </p><p>      WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries, but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the field. </p><p>      WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he's a mental fortress. But yet I have another player who's coming to me and saying, I'm just -- I'm so depressed.  I'm not around my team. I -- and they're coming to me and they're asking me for help on the mental side. </p><p>      WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body. Her mom noticed. </p><p>      WEST: When I was five, she got me a \"Gray's Anatomy\" book for Christmas. </p><p>      WALLACE (on camera): Why?</p><p>      WEST: That was my present. I don't know. I just was fascinated by it.</p><p>      WALLACE:  Now the big concern is brain injuries, but she says the NFL has developed a much stricter policy on concussions. </p><p>      WEST: I think football's the safest it's ever been. </p><p>      WALLACE: Before Washington, West was an assistant team doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers and got two Super Bowl rings. Her dream now, to win championships in both football and baseball. </p><p>      WEST: That's our goal, right? That's everyone's goal on the team is to keep the players healthy and to be as successful as we can. It's a pentacle, and you can't get any better than that. </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>      WALLACE: Dr. West says the Redskins have 15 medical professionals at each game on the field and up in the stands watching to see if any player gets hurt and relaying that information to her. </p><p>      And that's it for today.

We respect the motive and passion of each side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If the decision on Prop. 24 were merely about the concept \u2014 stopping companies from collecting and exploiting personal information about us without our permission or often without our knowledge \u2014 it would be an easy call. But this is a complex, legalistic 52-page initiative crafted behind the scenes, including participation of the companies that are the supposed targets of regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It should be evaluated on its details, not merely its good intentions.</p><p> The Electronic Frontier Foundation, one of the nation's most aggressive and authoritative champions of privacy rights, has taken a neutral position on Prop. 24. \"It is a mixed bag of partial steps backwards and forwards.\"</p><p> That in itself should give voters pause. But several prominent consumer advocacy groups and the American Civil Liberties Union are emphatic in their opposition, arguing that it would weaken state law in some meaningful ways.</p><p> To be sure, Prop. 24 has prominent privacy advocates on its side, including Common Sense Media, whose CEO Jim Steyer argues that its creation of the California Privacy Protection Agency (funded with at least $10 million annually) would finally put teeth in the law.</p><p> Steyer also likes the provisions that would toughen protections (with triple fines on violations) for consumers under age 16.</p><p> Here's how the issue reached the Nov. 3 ballot:</p><p>   Alastair Mactaggart, a wealthy San Francisco real estate developer, alarmed at learning of the scale of privacy intrusion, was bankrolling a ballot initiative for the November 2018 ballot. He ended up withdrawing the initiative after the California Legislature passed a less sweeping but nevertheless landmark bill known as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that year.</p><p>   The CCPA then encountered intense lobbying from consumer advocates who wanted to strengthen it and businesses that found it too burdensome or difficult to comply with. It survived basically intact and took full effect in July.</p><p>   Even before the law took effect, Mactaggart worked with Sen. Bob Hertzberg, a Los Angeles Democrat and one of the Capitol's ace deal makers, to forge an initiative that would lock in the CCPA's privacy protections. Mactaggart had seen Big Tech's intensive lobbying in Sacramento and was convinced his brainchild \"will not survive in the Legislature without an initiative,\" which could be undermined only through another statewide vote. Hertzberg said it was the target of a \"feeding frenzy of powerful interest groups.\"</p><p> The basic framework of Prop. 24 is solid: give consumers the right to prevent businesses from sharing personal information and the ability to correct errors; prohibit businesses from keeping personal information for longer than necessary; limit the use of especially sensitive information such as race, religion, precise geolocation, union membership, sexual orientation or genetics or health data.</p><p> Yet the devil is in the details when it comes to regulating such a dynamic and deep-pocketed sector as the social media and tech giants who are trafficking in personal information.</p><p> Analyses by Consumer Reports and the Electronic Frontier Foundation \u2014 each neutral on Prop. 24 \u2014 characterize it as a missed opportunity to switch the burden from consumers to businesses by requiring the later to obtain permission before scooping, sharing or monetizing personal information, a standard known as \"opt in.\" The initiative maintains an \"opt out\" standard: keeping the onus on you to protect your personal information.</p><p> Another major concern of the privacy advocates opposed to Prop. 24 is that it leaves the door open for \"pay for privacy\" schemes in which a business could charge users more if they opt out of sharing personal information. Robert Herrell, executive director of the Consumer Federation of California, suggested a few steps forward in the measure are \"dwarfed by a number of exemptions and special carveouts.\"</p><p> Few voters will sift through the 52 pages of fine print to determine which side is right. The fact that savvy lawyers on each side of Prop. 24 have done so and come to contrasting conclusions makes one thing clear: Litigation would be certain to follow its passage. Count on this: The companies that are monetizing our personal information in insidious ways would rush to court with their lawyers, and their interpretations, ready to argue that their practices are unaffected by the initiative's language.</p><p> And here is one more thing for voters to consider: If Prop. 24 really were as restrictive and airtight as advertised, is there any doubt that those who are exploiting our personal information as a commodity would be pouring tens of millions into defeating it? Their silence is telling.</p><p> A good guiding principle for approaching these complicated initiatives is: When in doubt, vote no. It goes against a Californian's instincts to reject what is advertised as a privacy protection initiative, but some objects on the ballot are smaller than they appear. There are no advancements to law in this initiative that could not be enacted by the California Legislature, after public hearings and vetting to assure they actually achieve their intended purpose and the ability to course correct for unintended consequences that emerge.</p><p> There is sufficient doubt about Prop. 24 to make the decision clear. Vote no.</p><p> This commentary is from The Chronicle's editorial board. We invite you to express your views in a letter to the editor.

The Journal reporting Sheila  Bair and the FDIC want a change and it could include CEO Vikram Pandit.   Who might be tapped to replace him?  And what do the people at Citigroup  think?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And the SEC charges Mozilo federal regulators charge Countrywide cofounder  Angelo Mozilo with insider trading and securities fraud.  What will happen  to him next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We're serving these stories and much more this morning on MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.</p><p> Good morning and happy Friday.  Welcome to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm Alexis  Glick.</p><p> Coming up this morning, much more on the latest on GM Saturn sale and that  possible shakeup at Citigroup.</p><p> Plus the smart phone war is heating up as Palm gets ready to release its  new device; it's called the Pre.  And it goes public later today.  We'll  get a preview of that phone.</p><p> And all this as reports that Steve Jobs is ready to return to the helm  after a six-month medical hiatus.  Could Apple be making a big announcement  as early as next week?</p><p> Plus, the May unemployment numbers are due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.   All eyes are on this number.  Expectations are for a loss of another  520,000 jobs; unemployment to reach 9.2 percent.  We'll see in just  moments.</p><p> Roger Ballou, CDI Core President and CEO and Representative Joe Sestak from  Pennsylvania are both going to join me to break down those numbers when  they come out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p> We'll also have a terrific roundtable discussion on where the jobs are  being created in the state and local municipalities.  Is the fiscal  stimulus package actually helping create enough jobs?</p><p> Let's take a look at the futures right now as we get started.  As you can  see across the board we're in the green; right now the DOW up 36; S&amp;P up  four; NASDAQ up three.  So across the board we're up just fractionally.</p><p> Let's get directly to the markets.  Fox Business contributor Gavin Gray is  in for Mr. Ashley Webster in London.  And Connell McShane is here with us  right now.  Let's get started with Connell here in New York -- Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning Alexis.  Yes we're  certainly watching those markets closely, you showed us the futures moving  a little bit higher indicating we might get a higher open at the final  trading day of the week.</p><p> But all of that can change of course; 8:30 a.m. Eastern time will be the  big number on jobs.  Now, speaking of jobs in a different -- speaking of it  in a different way, Steve Jobs is making big news at Apple.</p><p> The \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning reporting he is on pace to take back  the CEO position to come back on to the job as planned and with that said,  from medical leave, the stock is getting a nice boost this morning.</p><p> All of that kind of plays into what Alexis was talking about a little while  ago, the back and forth between Apple and Palm; Palm coming out over the  weekend with its Pre.  Not only might jobs come back as planned here but  the idea is maybe he comes back a little earlier than planned.</p><p> There's a big developer's conference next week and the thinking is maybe  Jobs comes back for that, announces a new iPhone.  We'll see that getting a  little bit ahead of ourselves but the \"Journal\" starting that speculation  this morning.</p><p> Investors seem to like it.  The Apple stock price as you see there up to  147 in change pre-market trading.</p><p> Ok, let's see what the European markets are up to this morning as we do now  head over to Gavin Gray in London -- Gavin.</p><p> GAVIN GRAY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Connell thanks very much indeed.  Let's first  of all have a look at the markets over here; all really waiting on  particularly in Europe and Britain waiting really for the results of the  cabinet reshuffle.</p><p> But let's kick off in London with the FTSE.  That is currently up 67 points  leading the way at 4,454; the CAC-40 now gaining of a bit of strength as  well, up 28 points.  And the DAX really hasn't moved much all morning.   Just up 21 points or 0.4 of a percent.</p><p> As really as I said, eyes looking at Downing Street, waiting for this  Cabinet reshuffle.  We haven't had it confirmed yet but we do believe that  the Alistair Darling who is the current Chancellor -- the moneyman is going  to keep his position.  It's rumored he told Gordon Brown I either have this  job or I don't have a job in your cabinet.  We do think that he is going to  remain as Chancellor.  One or two other movements, we believe a fourth  Minister has resigned.  That is the fourth in just four days.</p><p> And also a report that U.K. inflation continues to fall.  A sign about that  the Office of National Statistics says the price of manufactured goods has  come down just 0.3 percent year on year,  largely because of the oil price  coming down in that last year, but of course oil is coming back up.  But  that is the biggest annual decline since June 2002.</p><p> Alexis back to you.</p><p> GLICK:  All right, Gavin thank you very much.</p><p> Well, auto news now.  It is a hot topic.</p><p> Breaking news this morning the \"Wall Street Journal\" says auto dealer Roger  Penske will reportedly buy the Saturn brand from General Motors.  Sources  say, Penske would buy vehicles from GM and Renault then sell them under the  Saturn brand.  No word yet on how much Penske is paying.  An official  announcement is to be made later today.</p><p> And the deal to sell Hummer to a Chinese company may have hit a bump in the  road.  Some experts say regulators in Beijing may block it because the  Hummer brand goes against China's focus on fuel efficient vehicles.</p><p> And GM will finance a huge part of a private equity firm's buyout of parts  maker Delphi.  GM will provide $2.5 billion of the $3.6 billion -- that  specific $3.6 billion price tag.  In return GM buys back four Delphi  plants.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AL PACINO, ACTOR:  Something really wrong is going on here.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You are out of order.</p><p> PACINO:  You're out of order, you're out of order.  The whole trial is out  of order.  They are out of order.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GLICK:  And there you have it.  That was Al Pacino.  I'm not sure if you  remember in the courtroom black comedy \"And Justice For All\" which details  chaos in the court system.  And some think that's precisely what's going on  today with the Chrysler bankruptcy hearing.</p><p> A judge in New York will hear arguments from a group trying to block the  deal with Fiat.  Opponents include a group of Indiana state pension funds  and a dozen other parties.</p><p> Speaking of which, for more on what we can expect today, let's go directly  down to lower Manhattan to our own Adam Shapiro who is standing outside the  U.S. Court of Appeals.</p><p> And Adam I'm not sure it's quite Al Pacino style but it seems like it's  getting pretty close.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it could be close, but the Indiana - - the lawyers for the Indiana State Treasurer Richard Murdock are going to  be arguing on behalf of 100,000 Indiana pensioners, police officers as well  as teachers that the sale to Fiat violates all kinds of bankruptcy law as  well as the TARP law -- the law which created the Trouble Asset Relief  Program.  That's the argument they're going to make in court.</p><p> First, that senior secured lenders like the pensioners are being given a  secondary position in this bankruptcy which is counter to Bankruptcy Law.   Second, that the TARP was originally created to help financial institutions  not automobile companies and that's a violation of the Troubled Asset  Relief Program that was set up last year.</p><p> And that third, this is just a deal that is not good for the U.S.  taxpayers.  That's the argument they're going to make in court.  And that  argument lost.  They didn't gain any ground with that argument when they  presented it to Judge Arthur Gonzalez at the Bankruptcy Court.</p><p> They've also argued that this was a private plan agreed to before, they  called it a Sub-Rosa plan, before Chrysler filed for bankruptcy, but again,  Arthur Gonzalez said no that's just not the case.  That's what the  Appellate panel is going to hear; the three judges on the Appellate Court.</p><p> They're also going to be considering Chrysler's motion to certify the sale.   If that happens, if the Indiana pensioners lose and Chrysler wins and the  sale is certified, you can expect that sale to close almost immediately  because Chrysler says it has to close the deal with Fiat by the 15th of  June or else Fiat has the option to walk away from the table and worse it  walks away with $35 million from Chrysler as a penalty for failing to close  the deal.</p><p> So there's a lot riding on this decision today, Alexis.</p><p> One other thing in regards to that Hummer sale and the report that the  Chinese are making perhaps a problem as to closing that deal because  Hummers aren't fuel efficient.  Hummer dealers will tell you that the H-3  which is the smaller Hummer -- it's built on the Chevy Colorado platform --  they'll tell you it gets better gas mileage on the highway than some of the  import SUVs like the Lexus.  So that's an argument that they are probably  ready to fight.</p><p> Back to you.</p><p> GLICK:  All right, Adam.  I was just going to ask you about that, I  appreciate it.  All right, we'll check in with you a little later outside  the court.</p><p> All right, well Chrysler is fighting two courtroom battles which Adam just  talked about in its push to exit bankruptcy and merge with Fiat.  In  addition to today's hearing with the group of those Indiana state pensions  and investment funds that are looking to block the deal.  Close to 800 of  the Chrysler's dealers are making their case in court.  They made it  yesterday to put the breaks on the plan.</p><p> For a closer look at the impact of the courtroom battles, Laurie Moncrieff  is the president of Schmald Tool &amp; Die, an auto parts supplier that did  business for Chrysler, and joining us on the phone Jim Anderer, the owner  of Island Jeep in Long Island who is fighting in court to keep his business  open.</p><p> Laurie, don't worry about the people behind you.  I saw you telling people  to keep quiet.  Believe me I do that every single day.  All right Laurie,  tell me first of all, what does this delay mean to you and your business?</p><p> LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE:  The manufacturers have  been feeling the effects of what's been happening in the auto industry for  quite some time.  So quite frankly we're ready to get on with business.</p><p> The markets up here have been largely frozen because of what's going on in  our economy in Michigan with the Detroit three.  So in our opinion, we feel  that moving forward quickly with the bankruptcy would be a help to the  manufacturers.</p><p> GLICK:  And Laurie, explain specifically what it is that you guys do and  sort of where you fit into the food chain here in terms of how this impacts  your business.</p><p> MONCRIEFF:  We do precision machining and make dyes for the auto industry  as well as many other industries.  And quite frankly, all this upheaval is  affecting a lot of industries besides just the auto industry.</p><p> GLICK:  Great point.</p><p> Jim, I know you're joining us by phone.  You've been kind enough to be here  on several occasions.  You're fighting to keep your dealership alive.  You  are one of those who received a pink slip.  Tell me why the delay of this  judgment of this decision could actually help you.</p><p> JIM ANDERER, PRESIDENT, ISLAND JEEP (via telephone):  Hi, Alexis.  Well,  thanks for having me.</p><p> The delay helps me only in regard that it can possibly nix this deal.  This  is a bad deal for the American taxpayer.  It's a bad deal for pretty much  everybody involved, in my opinion.</p><p> I know that the vendor on the other line, you know, has her own agenda, and  I'm sympathetic to that.  But in my personal opinion this is a tragedy  that's taking place in the American marketplace.  It's putting 100,000  people out of work.  It's really devastating to our economy right now.  And  I would like to see it nixed to be honest with you.  I don't think it's a  good deal... </p><p> GLICK:  Ok, so Jim... </p><p> ANDERER:  I think that Fiat is coming into this deal with no cash.  And  it's wrought with a lot of problems.</p><p> GLICK:  Jim, you and I have talked about this before, and you have been in  the courtroom.  In fact you were in the courtroom yesterday speaking on  behalf of those dealers who are being forced to shut down.</p><p> What convinces you that if the deal were not to go through with Fiat, that  a liquidation of Chrysler would put you in a better position than if this  deal were to go through?</p><p> ANDERER:  Very simply that the market forces that would take place is  exactly what should take place.  The market forces would seek their own  level which is the way it should be.</p><p> Ok, what's going on with this taxpayer bailout and all this other stuff?  I  mean, you know, give me a break.  If -- whatever these particular brands  are worth when they're in liquidation would be sold for what they are  worth.</p><p> Ok I'm a stand-alone Jeep store.  Jeep is never going to go away.  It is  going to be picked up by somebody.  And whoever that is, is going to make a  real go of it.  But there's a false propping up of these brands is  insanity.  This is just not the way things should be done in a free  marketplace.</p><p> GLICK:  Laurie, let me switch to you for a moment.  You actually feel that  if they can make it through bankruptcy, that as suppliers, your position  will be that much safer and more secure.  Explain to people why that is.</p><p> LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE:  Well, it's always a lot  more risky to do business with a company prior to bankruptcy than after  bankruptcy so we felt a huge disruption, and quite frankly in the tool and  die industry, we felt a huge disruption for many, many years and we've seen  this coming for many years.</p><p> We've known there's been instability in the market for many years.  We were  somewhat of the canary in the mines frankly in this economy and have been  discussing the problems in tooling and in manufacturing since the early  2000 because we could feel that it was very unstable, and that the economy  was not doing well quite frankly in the early 2002, 2003.</p><p> There were a lot of discussions about the problems in the market.  So while  many of the dealers and other segments of the auto industry quite frankly  probably weren't even aware of the problems we were very much aware of it  in our industry.  </p><p> GLICK:  So Laurie when you look at the current environment, I mean look,  you live in Flint, Michigan.  We're actually going to talk to Virg Bernero  a little bit later on this morning.</p><p> What are people doing right now to either make sure that companies like you  are diversifying your risk or finding other viable job opportunities  because I imagine everything is tightened up in Michigan?  </p><p> MONCRIEFF:  Everything's not only tightened up.  It's frozen in the market  right now.  And it's not just the auto industry, it's the financial markets  are really playing a huge role.  The state of Michigan has been basically  red lined by a lot of banks so lines of credit are being pulled, very much  a big problem with getting financing to operate your business.</p><p> And then even in other industries when you diversify, we're feeling a lot  of difficulty in a lot of other industries that are not even part of the  auto industry because the financial market up in Michigan is frozen, as I  said.  So we're very anxious for the market to be unfrozen, whatever it  takes to do that.</p><p> We need financing.  We need money to start flowing to survive.  That's  basically what we're doing up here in Flint is working very, very hard to  survive this right now.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Well, Laurie, we wish you the very best.  And Jim, you  too.  Thank you guys so much for taking the time to join us this morning.  </p><p> ANDERER:  Thanks, Alexis.  </p><p> MONCRIEFF:  Thank you.  </p><p> GLICK:  Coming up, Countrywide's cofounder Angelo Mozilo charged with fraud  by the SEC.  The Judge is going to join us with his take.  </p><p> And later the Palm Pre hits stores tomorrow.  Will it take a bite out of  Apple's iPhone?  There's a lot of buzz about this.  We're going to tell you  about it in just a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  In court now, two executives from a defunct Seattle investment  management firm are charged with running what prosecutors call one of the  largest tax fraud schemes ever uncovered in the country.  Quellos founder,  Matthew Krane and CEO Jeffrey Greenstein and two others are charged with  fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.  Prosecutors say they created more  than $1.3 billion in fraudulent losses for clients.  Quellos used to be one  of the world's biggest managers of mutual funds.</p><p> A jury not a judge will hear claims in a case between American  International Group, AIG and Star International, the company controlled by  Maurice Greenberg AIG's former CEO.  The trial will now start June 15th.   There are several lawsuits outstanding between AIG and Mr. Greenberg and  sure wants Star to return AIG stocks and proceeds from stock sales.  AIG  received billions of dollars in federal bailout funds.</p><p> And the Securities and Exchange Commission charges former Countrywide CEO  Angelo Mozilo with fraud and insider trading.  Prosecutors say Mozilo and  two other former executives misled investors about risky lending practices.   The SEC also says Mozilo unloaded $140 million in Countrywide stock using  insider information.  It is the first case against a high-profile executive  stemming from the sub prime mortgage meltdown.  Mozilo has denied any  wrongdoing and his lawyer calls the SEC's allegations baseless.</p><p> Our fox news senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us right  now for a look at the case.  The judge is in the house and he's going to  give us some explanations here.  Judge, good to see you.</p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning  Alexis.  Good to see you.</p><p> GLICK:  surprised by this announcement?  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  I'm surprised by this announcement.  I expected -- and that  would be standard operating procedure in a case like this -- an indictment  rather than a civil lawsuit.  This is a civil lawsuit the Securities and  Exchange Commission says you didn't tell your opinion of your own products  to your shareholders, and that caused them to acquire shares ignorant of  what you thought of the products.</p><p> What did he think of them?  Well the SEC got some e-mails, and in that he  referred to his own products as toxic and poison.  Now, that's the bad news  that he said that in these e-mails.  The good news for him is he was not  indicted.  He was not charged with a crime.  The feds may still be  investigating for that purpose.</p><p> But standard operating procedure in cases of fraud and insider trading is  to indict and convict first and then to sue civilly.  So the fact that they  are suing him civilly, they are just looking for money and an order from a  judge that he can never run a public company again.  They are not looking  to take away his freedom, tells me they don't have enough evidence to  indict him or convict him.</p><p> GLICK:  It's interesting because involved in this case also being charged  with this as well is his chief operating officer and the CFO.  All three of  which are saying that number one, it's baseless.  That they did divulge the  proper information throughout the entire reporting process, and they say  look the fact of the matter is the SEC has not done anything right in  years, and they are using them as the poster child for what the SEC should  have done over the past five years.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well, the SEC's failures is a political argument that the  court will not allow them to make to a jury.  But the court will let them  say this, \"Look, you have accused us of failing to share our opinions with  everyone.  You haven't us accused of failing to share facts.\"</p><p> This is not Enron or WorldCom where inaccurate data was given out.  This is  just a case where an opinion like toxic and poison wasn't shared with the  public.</p><p> GLICK:  Ok, but what is the chance, though, that when you read what the SEC  is suggesting here, that this is brought on to suggest that it is very much  like an Enron case, where they were not divulging material public  information that could have affected decisions of shareholders, investors,  etc.?  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  It is a question of law for the court to decide.  Is it  material information what the CEO's personal opinion is of his products?   These are not facts now.  They didn't hide numbers.  They didn't cook  books.  They just held back these words like toxic and poison.</p><p> Flip side of this is, if this was really insider trading, they would have  indicted him.  But because they haven't indicted him, what it is, is using  insider knowledge to sell; knowledge that anyone else could have gotten had  they looked into the books.  </p><p> GLICK:  Let's bring up one of those e-mails dating back to 2006 because I  want people to hear specifically what he said.  \"In all my years in the  business, I have never seen a more toxic product.\"  That was one e-mail.</p><p> He also sent another e-mail regarding a certain kind of sub prime loan.   And he said \"it is the most dangerous product in existence, and there can  be nothing more toxic.  Loans had been originated through our channels with  disregard for process and compliance with guidelines.\"  This is where he's  talking about the fact that the procedure for getting loans was just way  too simple.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  You know what the defense is?  \"The government wanted us to do  this and Fannie and Freddie took them off our backs and the shareholders  are no longer at risk.\"  That's the defense that he'll make and that's  true.</p><p> The government did want those subprime loans given out and Fannie and  Freddie did take them off the backs of Countrywide and others.  That is  inappropriate in my view believing in a free market.  That's what the  government did and that's why we have this crisis.</p><p> GLICK:  Let's talk about one of the domino effects here.  There's no doubt  in my mind that Senator Christopher Dodd is climbing in a shell, perhaps in  a bunker, as a result of this.  He was one of those on the sort of Mozilo  list of getting what some argue is a better mortgage.  What do you make of  this for Dodd?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  This is very bad news for Chris Dodd who already is suffering  politically in Connecticut as a result of this.  He's up for reelection in  2010.</p><p> Just as Angelo Mozilo kept from shareholders his opinion of his own  product, Chris Dodd kept from voters the fact that Angelo Mozilo gave him  an absolute sweetheart deal.</p><p> What's the relationship between Chris Dodd and Angelo Mozilo?  Chris Dodd  is the chairman of the senate banking committee which regulates these  things and writes the laws to control them.  And he's accepting an enormous  benefit that the public could never get from the CEO of one of the biggest  companies he's writing the laws to regulate.  The voters of Connecticut  will have their say on this one, Alexis.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes, this is ugly.  And then that whole issue with the AIG, the  wording of the bonuses and the fiscal stimulus package.  Oh my goodness.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Senator Dodd's also deep into that one.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  Judge, thank you very much.  Great seeing you.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Happy Friday.  Have a great weekend.  </p><p> GLICK:  Happy Friday.</p><p> Also again I do want to say Mozilo has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer  David Siegel calls the SEC allegations baseless.  As for the other  defendants, they attorney for David Sambol called this \"a baseless  complaint that is a result of the political pressure the SEC is facing for  the well-publicized enforcement failures.\"</p><p> And Eric Sieracki's attorney meanwhile says the SEC's case is \"without  merit.  Countrywide's stock performance was tied to the fortunes of the  real estate and secondary markets for loans.  Something all investors knew  about.\"</p><p> I just wanted to clear up some statements from their attorneys.</p><p> Coming up, Charles Payne offers up his stock choices.</p><p> And President Obama meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel today; the  president reassured the Europeans about the U.S. economy.  We will tell you  what he had to say when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GAVIN GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.   I'm Gavin Gray with a look at this morning's top news stories.</p><p> President Obama is meeting with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel today  after bilateral meeting addressed in castle (ph), President Obama held a  joint press conference with the German chancellor.  The president reassured  the Europeans about the U.S. economy.

France's Transportation Minister says  French forces have found no evidence of an Airbus A-330 airplane that  vanished over the Atlantic.  He's urging extreme prudence about suspected  debris fished from the ocean.  The French Transportation Minister says he  regrets an announcement by Brazilian teams that they had recovered plane  debris from Air France flight 447.  The jetliner was flying from Rio de  Janeiro to Paris; 228 people were on board.  </p><p> AFP is reporting that former vice president Al Gore may be sent to North  Korea to negotiate the release of two American journalists.  Laura Ling and  Euna Lee were arrested on March 17th near the North Korean border on  charges they entered the country illegally and were engaged in hostile  acts.  Both women are reporters for Gore's California-based Current TV.   They each could be sentenced to ten years in a labor camp.</p><p> You are up-to-date on the Fox Business Network.</p><p> Now back to New York and Charles Payne for a look at the stocks he's  watching -- Charles, I'm listening.</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you so much Gavin really  appreciate it.  Well folks it's going to be an exciting day today.   Hopefully we will be to the upside.</p><p> A couple of stocks three stocks we're looking at.  Manitowoc is one.  This  is one of these real hot equipment making stocks that obviously because of  the economy has gotten hit real good.  I think your risk reward now is  really, really nice.  Right here is where it broke the trend line recently.   Now we're looking at a little resistance right around $7.80.</p><p> A break out there and I think you are pretty good.  That takes you right  here, that would be north of 10 buck; a huge percentage play.  I love the  fact that the risk reward is pretty good.  In the March quarter they beat  the street by almost 30 percent.  Maybe that business is turning around.   Certainly, the chart is attractive here.</p><p> Sina, I've probably mentioned this one now at least five times in the last  year.  As you can see, it is really starting to come on here to the point  where it looks extremely, extremely attractive.  This stock is breaking key  resistance.  I love the volume on it.  I think if you don't have any China  stocks, Baidu is my favorite.  A lot of people are afraid to buy a stock  that's almost $300 a share.  This one might have room all the way up to $47  a share.  It is one to take a look at.  It is a reiteration.</p><p> And finally the stock that caught my eye more than any other yesterday.  A  company called Flir.  The chart isn't so hot necessarily, it's been going  down for a long time but I think it's hit a bottom and I think it's on the  cusp of a major breakout.</p><p> By the way, this company has beaten the Street in each of the last four  quarters and each time they beat by a larger margin.  They make imaging  systems for the military and of course for commercial use.  I think the  stock has room to $32 that would be almost 50 percent gain.  I love the way  it looked yesterday.</p><p> By the way, I have one pick on the Web that you have to go and take a look  at today.  Fox Business.com/moneyforbreakfast. </p><p> GLICK:  All right, Mr. Payne, I look forward to it.</p><p> PAYNE:  I'm pumped up about today, I'm hoping under 500,000.  Keep our  fingers crossed.</p><p> GLICK:  Let's hope it is not too bad.  Thank you very much Charles.</p><p> Coming up, we're going to go live to London for a look on how the overseas  markets are trading.  And Palm looking to take a bite out of Apple's bottom  line with its new smart phone called the Pre.  We're going to get a real  live demonstration right here in studio and tell you why there's a lot of  buzz about it.  That's coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, and welcome back to MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.  I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>        Coming up: More on a report this morning from \"The Wall Street  Journal\" that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's top  management, including CEO Vikram Pandit.  We're going to see who was  mentioned as a possible replacement.</p><p>        And Palm gets ready to release its Pre device tomorrow, looking to  steal some of the success from Apple's iPhone.  We're going to preview it  in just a couple of minutes.</p><p>        And what movie could possibly take down Pixar's \"Up\" from the top  spot?  Well, Universal and Warner Brothers have new releases.  We're going  to get those expectations both coming out today.</p><p>        And we have the May employment report due out at 8:30.  The  expectation is for a loss of 520,000 jobs.  We'll be live at the Labor  Department.</p><p>        And then, coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL\" at 9:35 a.m., I will be  speaking with Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and get her reaction on the First  on FOX to those job numbers.</p><p>        All right.  Let's take a look at the futures.  We've been in the  green throughout the morning.  Let's see, are we still in the green?  We  are.  OK, good news.</p><p>        We're actually a little bit higher earlier this morning.  The Dow up  41, S&amp;P up 5, NASDAQ up 5 as well.  So, looking pretty good.</p><p>        Let's get directly to financial news though -- we got a lot of that  news.  The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in  its boardroom.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be  bounced out.  \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S.  Bancorp CEO, Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job.  The Feds own 34  percent of Citigroup.</p><p>        And the FDIC is putting its program to rid the nation's banks of  toxic assets on hold.  The Legacy Loans Program was supposed to begin with  trial sale this month, the FDIC says banks have proven they can raise  private capital without cleansing their balance sheets.  The FDIC says the  program could come back in a different form.</p><p>        And the FDIC is very busy today, also shutting down Silverton Bank.   The troubled bank did attract investors from interest or from private  equity guys.  The FDIC says it had to do was cheapest for the insurance  fund and shutting it down was cheaper.  Silverton was not a retail bank.   Most of its customers were actually other banks.</p><p>        All right.  Well, we've all been waiting for the big preview.  The  forefather of handheld phone is taking a run at Apple's iPhone to reclaim  the spot as the king of the smartphone on the hill.  Well, Palm will  release its touch-screen Pre device tomorrow, exclusively on the Sprint  network.  And the phone offers a whole slew of slick new features.</p><p>        With a look at it in some real details and whether or not it is  going to be the necessary thing to boost Palm -- joining us right now is  Lance Ulanoff.  He's the editor-in-chief of PCMag.com.  And FOX Business  contributor Charles Payne, also WStreet.com founder is here with us as well  to talk about the implications for the stocks of Palm and Apple.</p><p>        All right.  Lance, you've got the phone right in front of you.  I'm  very excited about this.  How does it stack up?  What are the things about  the device that look so good?</p><p>        LANCE ULANOFF, PC MAGAZINE EDITOR IN CHIEF:  It stacks up pretty  well.  It is Sprint's best smartphone, bar none.  It is gorgeous.  It has  many features you find on iPhone.  It has a touch-screen, so I can add and  drag around applications.</p><p>        It has something the iPhone doesn't have, multitasking.  So, if you  are looking at the screen right now, I'm actually going through a bunch of  different things that are running at once.  So, it's a $199 phone after  rebate.  So, it starts at $299.</p><p>        But it has something that the -- well, the iPhone doesn't have which  is a QWERTY keyboard.  So, this is one of the things that makes it so  exciting.  And you can use that QWERTY keyboard to do ubiquitous search,  meaning the minute you start to type, it just starts to find whatever is on  the phone.</p><p>        One of the ways that it does that is it brings together all of your  contacts from Google, Facebook, Exchange.  It can search there.  It can  search throughout all of that.</p><p>        It has a 3-megapixel camera.  It plays video.  And yes, it does have  an accelerometer and what that means is you're going to be able to turn it  to its side and you basically can play -- you can play videos in landscape  mode.</p><p>        GLICK:  It looks really -- </p><p>        ULANOFF:  It is.</p><p>        GLICK:  I'm entrenched.  I'm watching -- </p><p>        ULANOFF:  Oh, and, by the way -- and, by the way, it's got a really  loud speaker.</p><p>        GLICK:  Wow.  It's really awesome.</p><p>        OK.  So, let's talk about the big issue, which is the number of  applications on the phone because I know I happen to have an iPhone.</p><p>        ULANOFF:  Right.</p><p>        GLICK:  And my kids adore it because it has so many different games  on it.  What are the applications like on this?</p><p>        ULANOFF:  Unfortunately, they are not coming out of the gate with a  ton of applications.  Right now, the iPhone has about 40,000 applications.   This is going to start with about 20 or so.  So, it's a -- it is far fewer  and they are not really pushing the capabilities of this phone.</p><p>        I've got Connect 4 up here, which is a lot of fun to play.  I can  drop in.  I'm going to lose by the way.  But I can drop in my checkers.   But, except for touching it, you can't really shake it.  You can't turn it  over, shake out the chips, or anything like that.</p><p>        There's Fandango.  There's AP News.  There's a NASCAR app, but not a  NASCAR app where you drive a car, you just going to learn about what's  going on if you are interested in NASCAR.</p><p>        So, for somebody who's trying to decide between the iPhone and the  Pre, well then, if you care about apps, there might not be much of a  competition -- at least for now.  But we do expect Palm to add in its app  catalog a ton more apps very quickly.</p><p>        GLICK:  We are putting if here, Charles, the sort of what we're  calling the tale of the tape here, which is the Palm Pre versus the Apple  iPhone, walking through the carriers, the size of the memory, the screen,  the applications, the cost -- all those things combined.</p><p>        A lot of people believe, Charles, that this is do-or-die for Palm.   This is their last opportunity to get out there and dazzle the community.</p><p>        How important is it for them, and do you think they are doing what  they need to do?</p><p>        CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, there's no doubt that this is  do-or-die.  This is the bottom of 9th, two -- you know, two men out, two  strikes against you, and you got to hit a home run.  You can't hit a base.   You can't bunt this thing.</p><p>        The one thing, though, is that Wall Street has bid this stock up  tremendously.  Look at this chart.  It's a mind-boggling move.</p><p>        GLICK:  Well, because the buzz on this phone has been very hot.</p><p>        PAYNE:  The buzz is hot but it's not like the buzz on the iPhone,  where we saw people standing at midnight at the Apple Store waiting around  in a line.  I mean, this -- when the stock goes from like a buck to 13  bucks, that's huge, you know?  So, ironically, of course, Apple's stock  hasn't suffered too much.</p><p>        And that's what I think you got going on here, too, a couple of  things from the market's point of view.  Maybe the smartphone category is  big enough and is growing enough for there to be more than one winner.  And  maybe this won't be an iPhone killer, but perhaps, it will do well enough - - although the stock though, at this point, has had one heck of a move.   And, you know, Wall Street, we get -- </p><p>        GLICK:  The Palm's stock or Apple stock?</p><p>        PAYNE:  Palm stock.</p><p>        GLICK:  OK.</p><p>        PAYNE:  Palm stock.  Apple stock is still down from its high,  although it's made a heck of a move recently from the lows of 88, 87.  But  still, I think on Wall Street, we tend to get extremely excited about  things like this and we pump up these stocks.  And I don't know that Palm  can live up -- Palm Pre can live to the hype, at least not initially out of  the gate.</p><p>        GLICK:  Lance, you made a facial expression when Charles talked  about demand for the Pre.  I hear that they are not releasing that many,  and so, they think demand will be really hot.</p><p>        ULANOFF:  Well, I've heard that too.  The CEO came out and said they  might not be a lot of them out there.  But I've also heard that there will  be people waiting on lines, that there already is some guy waiting out  there.  And there are people who are telling me they are going to try and  get it on Saturday because they are afraid there won't be enough at each  store.  But I have to say, Sprint has been working on this a long time.   I'd be shocked if there aren't enough of these Pres to go around.</p><p>        GLICK:  Yes, I mean, it's interesting Walter Mossberg, you know,  from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he wrote a whole piece on it as well, and  it was interesting to hear some of his points of view because a lot of  people are looking to next week with Apple -- to see whether or not they  are going to come out with a new iPhone.  They are going to dazzle us,  because a lot of their initial two-year contracts are set to expire coming  up this summer.  So, if they come out with one, this could be perfectly  timed.</p><p>        How crucial is it -- and, Lance, will Steve Jobs show up?</p><p>        ULANOFF:  We're all talking about that.  You know, Wozniak, his  former co-founder said he looked robust which is great news.  We always  expect surprises from Apple at every one of these major events.  But I  think this is going to be unique, because the third thing -- Steve Jobs has  this habit in these events of going one more thing and he pulls it out of  his back pocket.</p><p>        I think the one more thing at this event is Steve Jobs.  You have  announcement, announcement -- Steve Jobs walks out with whatever the new  iPhone is.  I really think that could happen because he is a showman.  He  knows how to pull something like this thing off.</p><p>        GLICK:  Yes.</p><p>        ULANOFF:  And there's going to be hot product out there.  I don't  know what it is, but it doesn't diminish what Palm has accomplished with  the Pre, because I have to tell you -- this is a home run.</p><p>        GLICK:  You know, Charles, Tim Cook had done a terrific job in the  role ... </p><p>        PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>        GLICK:  ... of Steve Jobs obviously left in terms of running day-to- day operations.  The stock is up 68 percent versus NASDAQ, which is up a  little bit over 20 percent since left due to health concerns in January.</p><p>        What will this mean if he does come back for Apple's stock?</p><p>        PAYNE:  Oh, it's a cherry on top of it.  But more than that -- you  know, listen, I don't think there's a CEO that's so identified with this  company as Steven Jobs is with Apple.  And listen, Apple already, early  this morning, is indicating it's going to be up 3 or 4 points at the open  today.  And this is ahead of the Pre coming out tomorrow.</p><p>        So, there's a lot of excitement about Steve Jobs coming in and doing  something spectacular.</p><p>        GLICK:  We didn't even get to Sprint and AT&amp;T and Verizon.  There's  too much to talk about.  But it looks so cool.  It really does.</p><p>        PAYNE:  By the way, I think this is more important -- it might be as  equally as important for Sprint as it is ... </p><p>        GLICK:  As it is for Palm.</p><p>        PAYNE:  Palm -- absolutely.</p><p>        GLICK:  Great point.  Lance, thank you very much for breaking it in.</p><p>        ULANOFF:  It's a pleasure.</p><p>        GLICK:  You must be having fun with that.</p><p>        ULANOFF:  I am.</p><p>        (CROSSTALK)</p><p>        GLICK:  He is grinning from ear to ear with this phone.</p><p>        ULANOFF:  I still want to keep it.</p><p>        GLICK:  OK.  The control room would like you to go visit them  because there are several purchasers, including my executive producer, who  wants to buy that immediately.</p><p>        ULANOFF:  I'm taking bids.</p><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p>        GLICK:  OK.</p><p>        All right.  Coming up: We'll check the latest news headlines.  And  Warner Brothers is looking to cash in on a major hangover this weekend.   We're going to preview the weekend box-office when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  returns.</p><p>        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>        GAVIN GREY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.  I'm Gavin Grey in London with a look at this morning's top news  stories.</p><p>House Republican leaders are suggesting more than $23 billion in  budget cuts.  Overall, the proposal includes cuts in no less than 37  programs.  One example is eliminating transportation enhancements and this  measure alone would save $833 million a year.  It would take place over the  next five years.  The plan has been sent now to the White House.</p><p>        And the State Supreme Court in South Carolina is ordering the  state's governor to accept federal bailout money.  Mark Sanford had refused  to take the money designated to South Carolina over the next two years.   But this court decision ends months of wrangling with legislators who  accused him of playing politics with people's lives.  Sanford says he will  not appeal the decision and plans to sign the paperwork on Monday.</p><p>        You are up-to-date on the FOX Business Network.  Now, let's get back  to New York and Alexis Glick.</p><p>        GLICK:  All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>        My favorite topic, let's get right to sports business right now.   Star architect Frank Gehry won't be working on the $4 billion Atlantic  Yards project in Brooklyn, New York, anymore.  Developer brace Ratner is  trying to trim $200 million in costs.  Ellerbe Becket will take his place.</p><p>        Ratner is blaming the economic downturn and litigation being brought  on by project opponents.  Ratner hopes to have the new arena opened for the  New Jersey Nets by 2010, 2011.</p><p>        The Big Unit joins baseball 300-win club.  Pitcher Randy Johnson  becoming only the 24th pitcher in history to win 300 games as the San  Francisco Giants beat the Washington Nationals five to one.  Johnson who is  45 years old has pitched for 16 in a 22-year career.  Incredible.</p><p>        And Charles Hayward, the president and CEO of the New York Racing  Association said the absence of Rachel Alexandra would likely cost the  Belmont Stakes significantly in attendance.  With Rachel Alexandra in the  race, Hayward estimated a crowd of between 80,000 to 90,000.  Without her,  he believes the crowd will be 50,000 to 60,000.  Last year, when Big Brown  was going for the Triple Crown, the attendance was 94,476.</p><p>        Speaking of which, here now with a little preview of Belmont Stakes  is FOX News reporter Rick Leventhal, who is live in Belmont Park.</p><p>        Rick, pretty cool thing to be doing.  I'm jealous.  What's it  looking like for tomorrow?</p><p>        RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, don't be too jealous  because we're getting rained on right now.  Attendance is near zero by the  way because there's no races going on.  However, Chip Woolley, the trainer  of Mine That Bird you probably recognize from the Kentucky Derby is kind  enough to join us for an exclusive one-on-one.</p><p>        Now, they are saying attendance may be done because Rachel Alexandra  who won the Preakness isn't running this race.  You said that you believe  that's possible?</p><p>        CHIP WOOLLEY, MINE THAT BIRD TRAINER:  Sure, she's a great filly and  it would be good for in racing in general if she was here.  But, in this  game, you have to do what's best for the horse.  And if they didn't feel  like it was a best thing for her, it's better they don't run her.</p><p>        And that, you know, racing -- racing will take care of itself.  But  we have to -- the horses have to come first.</p><p>        LEVENTHAL:  Mine That Bird finished at close second to Rachel  Alexandra.  Are you disappointed that you didn't have a chance at a rematch  on this longer track?</p><p>        WOOLLEY:  You know, a little bit disappointed I suppose.  Really, I  mean, it's -- for me, it's better she's not in here because that's one less  horse you have to beat.  And let's face it.  If you don't have to beat  them, you don't want to, you know?  You want to limit the field to who you  run at.  So, I don't mind her not being here.</p><p>        She's a great filly and you got to respect her a lot.  So, really,  for me, it's probably better she's not in for the racing game.  It might be  better that she would be here.</p><p>        LEVENTHAL:  Your horse was on the track.  It still is, I believe, on  the track?</p><p>        WOOLLEY:  It just went off.</p><p>        LEVENTHAL:  It just went off.  So, you just watched the horse  working out in these conditions, which hopefully tomorrow, it will be sunny  and drier.  But how -- but how does Mine That Bird look today?</p><p>        WOOLLEY:  He looked great this morning.  Just got over the ground  really, really well.  So we're real happy with where we're at.  It looks  like we got in here in good shape.  And we're looking forward to running.</p><p>        LEVENTHAL:  You said he looked like a million bucks.</p><p>        WOOLLEY:  At least a million.</p><p>        LEVENTHAL:  That's the purse.</p><p>        WOOLLEY:  Yes, sir.  Hopefully, we can get some of it, and  hopefully, he'll have his best race in him tomorrow.</p><p>        LEVENTHAL:  So, Chip, if I were a betting man -- which I might be,  by the way -- would you suggest I put money on your horse?</p><p>        WOOLLEY:  I will never make a suggestion like that.</p><p>        (LAUGHTER)</p><p>        LEVENTHAL:  Chip Woolley, the trainer of Mine That Bird -- thanks so  much for being with us.  And get well soon.</p><p>        WOOLLEY:  Nice to meet you.</p><p>        LEVENTHAL:  All right.  Nice to meet you, too.  So, that's the  story.</p><p>        And here's another look at Belmont Park and the track, which is very  muddy.  But again, they are expecting sunshine tomorrow.  And if you were  on the fence about whether to come here or not, I'm told there will be  sunny skies and it should be a great day for racing.</p><p>        GLICK:  If you were a betting man, is that the cat calling the  kettle black or what?</p><p>        LEVENTHAL:  I didn't want to come out and say it, but, you know, I  might put a couple dollars on the race.</p><p>        GLICK:  All right.  Rick, I'll e-mail you later to do the same for  me.  Great interview.  Thanks so much for seeing you.</p><p>        LEVENTHAL:  OK.  I look forward to it.  Thank you.</p><p>        GLICK:  All right.

Movies -- coming up next.</p><p>        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>        GLICK:  This weekend, Will Ferrell is going to be battling  dinosaurs, bugs and one massive headache.  The PG-13 time travel comedy,  \"Land of the Lost\" from General Electric's Universal Pictures is going  against Warner Brothers \"The Hangover,\" an R-rated bachelor party that  shows what happens in Las Vegas may leave you with a tiger, a baby, and a  missing groom.  Yes, that's right.</p><p>        Here to tell us how the films will do and if either of them can  capture the upward mobility of Walt Disney's-Pixar's \"Up,\" joining me right  now is Bradley Jacobs.  He is the senior editor of \"Us Weekly.\"</p><p>        Good morning, Bradley.  Good to see you.</p><p>        BRADLEY JACOBS, US WEEKLY SENIOR EDITOR:  Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>        GLICK:  No, wait a second.  Is \"Hangover\" PG-13 or R?</p><p>        JACOBS:  That's definitely R-rated.</p><p>        GLICK:  OK.</p><p>        JACOBS:  R-rated movie.</p><p>        GLICK:  Yes, because -- OK, because I heard there's a lot of  profanity.  I just wasn't sure if it was -- OK.  Anyhow, I was saying to  you before that I was at the movies yesterday evening, and I came out and  there were these massive lines down the block.  I understand there were  midnight showings of \"Hangover.\"  What's the buzz?</p><p>        JACOBS:  It had some of the best buzz of the year.  You know, for a  movie with no big stars, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, the concept is really  key here.  Four guys, a bachelor party that goes wrong, a missing groom,  there's a baby in the mix.  There's a stripper in the mix.</p><p>        I saw it a couple of weeks ago.  I really loved it.  I think it is  going to be hugely successful.  R-rated summer movies are kind of the rare  thing.  So, you got -- you got the college students, you got -- </p><p>        GLICK:  That's why I said, \"Are you sure it's R, are you sure it's  not PG-13\"?</p><p>        JACOBS:  I am absolutely sure.</p><p>        GLICK:  Are you sure?</p><p>        JACOBS:  I am doubly sure that \"Land of the Lost\" is PG-13, and  that's more of a kids' movie although it's PG-13.  So, it's not really for  4-year-olds, it's not really for 6-year-olds.  It's sort of, you know, for  people in the PG-13 era, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds.</p><p>        I think the battle between these two is really interesting.</p><p>        GLICK:  Yes, it is interesting.  I do want to bring in Harry Medved,  also from Fandango.com.</p><p>        Because, Harry, I know you've been looking at \"The Land of the Lost\"  pre-sales (ph) and there are just completely non-existent.  Bradley was  telling me the reviews are just horrific.</p><p>        You tell me, Harry, what did they get wrong with \"Land of the Lost\"?   Will anybody go see it?</p><p>        HARRY MEDVED, FANDANGO.COM:  Well, you know, people are saying on  Fandango, the user reviews are saying it's perfect for 13 year olds of all  ages, especially if you're for bathroom humor, because it is PG-13.  But  there's plenty of dinosaur manure, dinosaur urine, masturbation jokes and  frequent uses of the S-word for any 13-year-old to wallow in.</p><p>        Now, parents may not be too excited about it.  But at least it's not  the R-rated comedy of \"The Hangover\" that Bradley was just talking about.</p><p>        GLICK:  But, Bradley, look, this is box-office projections for these  movies that are coming out of here.  And \"Land of the Lost\" is getting  some, you know, at least some decent -- I mean, not great, but decent  projections.  Is that because of Will Ferrell, you know, you just -- </p><p>        JACOBS:  Will Ferrell is a huge star.  They run commercials  everywhere, marketing everywhere for this film.  They just want to get  butts in seats in the first few days before the word really spreads about  it.</p><p>        But I actually think those productions may be wrong and you could  see \"Hangover\" end up number two this weekend.</p><p>        GLICK:  Yes.  I mean, I was saying to you ... </p><p>        JACOBS:  I do, too.</p><p>        GLICK:  I was saying to you before, like, oh, my God, I had never  seen a movie marketed more than this one, oh my goodness.  OK.  How does  this stack up against up, against \"Star Trek\"?  You know, we had some big  blockbusters last summer.  You know, who turns out to be the big ones this  summer?</p><p>        JACOBS:  Well, \"Up\" had a huge weekend last weekend, and I wouldn't  be surprised if \"Up\" were number one again this weekend.  It would be the  first time in more than a year that an animated movie has been number one  two weekends in a row.  But \"Up,\" you have that magic thing where the  critics love it and audiences love it -- which is very rare.</p><p>        I saw it here in 3-D last weekend.  I want to see it again.  And I  think that there is incredible word of mouth for that film, because it's  one of those things where you can take your family.  You can take kids.   You can take teenagers.  You can take your friend.</p><p>        You know, it's really in that magical place.  So, I think that will  be number one.</p><p>        MEDVED:  You know -- </p><p>        GLICK:  Yes, Harry, go quickly.</p><p>        MEDVED:  I'm not sure you want to take kids under 6 years old,  because there are some terrifying elements to \"Up.\"  Now, on Fandango,  that's the place where people buy advanced tickets, we are seeing that \"Up\"  is leading the way for ticketing this weekend, it's about 42 percent of all  tickets sold on Fandango.</p><p>        GLICK:  Wow.</p><p>        MEDVED:  But \"The Hangover\" is gaining momentum.  There was a surge  of tickets last night.  Those people you saw online last night, Alexis,  they're all across the country.  Thursday midnight shows were sold out last  night.</p><p>        I went to one last night and people came out of the theater saying,  \"I want to see 'The Hangover' again.\"</p><p>        GLICK:  Wow.</p><p>        MEDVED:  So, I think you will be surprised.  \"Hangover\" will not be  number two.  I think it will be number one.</p><p>        GLICK:  I have to leave it there, Harry and Bradley.  I know what  I'm doing this weekend if only I could get a baby-sitter.  Gentlemen, thank  you very much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>        JACOBS:  Thank you.</p><p>        GLICK:  We'll be right back.  We're going to do a roundtable on jobs  as jobs numbers are due out in half hour.  Stay with us.</p><p>        (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>        GLICK: Good morning and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm  Alexis Glick.  </p><p> We're about 30 minutes way from the release of the May employment report.   Expectations are for a loss of another 520,000 jobs, sending the  unemployment rate to 9.2 percent.  We are live at the U.S. Labor Department  in Washington, D.C., to break down those numbers.  </p><p> Also, Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is going to join us for his  analysis on those numbers.  And Roger Ballou, the CDI Corp. CEO, is going  to join me to break it all down.  </p><p> And news this morning that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's  top management, including perhaps CEO Vikram Pandit.  We're going to get  into those details in just a moment.</p><p> And on the jobs front, speaking of which, I will be talking to the labor  secretary coming up later this morning on \"The Opening Bell\" at just about  9:35 a.m. Eastern Time.  We'll get Hilda Solis' point of view on the jobs.  </p><p> Let's look at the markets, though.  We're in the green.  We're at the highs  of the morning.  Dow up 45.  S&amp;P up 5.  Nasdaq up 5 as well.  So across the  board we're up about 0.5 percent.</p><p> All right, let's get a look at the markets.  We have business contributor  Gavin Gray and Connell McShane.  Let's start with Connell.  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Alexis, thanks very much.</p><p> As you said, we are trading higher ahead of the open this morning and  ahead, more importantly, of the jobs report because when you think about  it, all things can change here half an hour from now.  So, you know, and  that's all we're going to be talking about a half an hour from now.  So let  me give you a couple of stocks individually to watch.  Either way, no  matter what the jobs report comes out at, these are going to be stocks to  watch.  </p><p>Apple, right behind me, is definitely one of them.  There's a report in  \"The Wall Street Journal\" about Steve Jobs this morning.  Look at it going  from below $144 to almost $147 in pre-market trading.  So a nice little  boost.  The report in \"The Journal\" is Jobs is on track to come back on the  job as the CEO there after taking medical leave by the end of the month.   And there's even some speculation in that \"Journal\" article that he comes  back earlier.  </p><p> The big developer's conference next week.  The Palm Pre coming out over the  weekend.  The speculation, and again this might be getting ahead of  ourselves, is that Jobs maybe comes back ahead of schedule in order to  announce a new iPhone.  Either way, a lot of optimism about Apple.  </p><p> One other quick stock to watch, a company called Quanta Services.  PWR is  the ticker on it.  It is going to take the place of Ingersoll Rand in the  S&amp;P 500.  So Quanta, again, a power company that -- the index fund managers  are going to have to buy this stock.  It was up after hours. Ingersoll, by  the way, is reincorporates itself.  It's going to have its base in Ireland.   With a name like Connell McShane, there's not (ph) any problem with having  your base in Ireland.  But the S&amp;P doesn't like that because you're  supposed to be based in the United States.  They make the exception for  Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, which is where Quanta -- where Ingersoll was  based before that.  So they were allowed to be in the S&amp;P.  Now they're  leaving.  Quanta takes its place.  There you have it.  </p><p> Gavin Gray over in Europe with a look at those overseas markets for us now.</p><p> Gavin, take it away.  </p><p> GAVIN GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Connell, thanks very much indeed.  I'm sure  they'll make an exception for you, as you say.</p><p> Looking at the European markets, in Asia it was a 1 percent club today.  It  is in Europe as well pretty much.  Starting off with the FTSE here in  London.  All waiting on announcements about Gordon Brown and his reshuffle.   But up 1.5 percent at 67 points, 4,454.  The CAC 40 in Paris, 3,347, up 35  points.  The DAX hardly shifting at all today.  Up just 33 points or 0.65  percent.</p><p> And despite that reshuffle in the U.K. cabinet, today we're getting details  coming through in bits and pieces.  Gordon Brown's position as prime  minister really does remain in jeopardy.  Some of the newspaper headlines  today really damaging.  Comes after four cabinet members have resigned in  just four days, causing many politicians to question whether Mr. Brown has  enough authority to continue at the head of the British government.  </p><p> One thing we now believe is really pretty certain is the chancellor, the  money man, the treasurer, Alistair Darling.  He has apparently told Gordon  Brown, I say as chancellor or I'm out.  And we do think that he is going to  stay as chancellor.  </p><p> All this political uncertainty has been weighing heavily on the British  pound.  It slid against the dollar in recent days.  Today it is down  against both the dollar and the euro.  And $1.61 will buy you one pound.   And the dollar against the euro, though, is down, and $1.41 will buy you a  euro.</p><p> Alexis, back to you.  </p><p> GLICK: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.  </p><p> Well, we could see the unemployment rate climb to 9.2 percent this morning  with the release of the Labor Department's May employment report.  Now  while that rate may be up, job cuts may be down for the second month in a  row with an estimated 520,000 job losses last month versus 539,000 lost in  April.  March, 699,000.  Now, states are getting their hands on some of the  $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help create  employment opportunities.  Is that enough?  And what are state and local  leaders doing right now with that money to create jobs? </p><p> Here's my take.  Number one, we need to basically stem the tide on the job  front and figure out what we're doing to address private sector jobs,  particularly those that are created by small businesses.  Number two, will  the work -- will the work programs -- will they ultimately work to retain  enough people?  Those worker training programs.  And number three, concern  that the stimulus package is ultimately not enough to help the jobs  situation.  Perhaps time is the only cure.  But keep in mind that the  underemployed numbers are much more disconcerting and you've got to make  sure you look at the big picture, not just the unemployed.  </p><p> Joining me right now is Mayor Virg Bernero of Lansing, Michigan, Mayor R.T.  Rybak of Minneapolis, and Steve Crowley, the host of \"American Scene\" radio  program and the financial TV program \"Wall Street Cast.\"</p><p> Good morning, everybody.  Good to see you guys.  </p><p> STEVE CROWLEY, \"AMERICAN SCENE\" RADIO HOST: Thank you, Alexis.  Thanks very  much.  This is great (ph).</p><p> GLICK: All right, Mayor Bernero, let me start with you.  Let me walk  through some of the numbers here.  The unemployment rate, as you know, in  Michigan, the highest in the country, 12.9 percent.  I understand you can  get a little less than $4 billion in the stimulus.  Is it enough to help  create and save jobs?  What are you doing? </p><p> MAYOR VIRG BERNERO, (D) LANCING, MICHIGAN: Well, look, a lot of it is going  into infrastructure.  It's going into roads.  It's going into retraining of  workers.  We're trying to get a business incubator up and going to generate  new ideas and for business startups.  </p><p> But, look, we've talked about this for months.  The best stimulus is a  stimulating job.  People need jobs.  They want long-term security.  And so  the temporary help is great.  We appreciate that.  But we need to restore  health in the economy.  </p><p> And, you know, Lansing dodged a bullet.  We were very fortunate not to have  any plant closures with GM.  In fact, our factories may get a little more  work.  But still, in the long run, we need a healthy auto industry.  We  need to make sure that we're making the cars of the future in places like  Lansing, Michigan.  </p><p> And I think the economy, in terms of people starting to buy again, I mean  they want that long-term future.  And when you talk about retraining, I'm  all for the retraining, but I've got e-mails from people all over the  country that say, you know, I've been retrained two or three times and the  job is eliminated.  And so what are we going to retrain them in? </p><p> And you and I have talked about this.  We need to have manufacturing.  I'm  not giving up.  I don't think we can be a post manufacturing society.  I  think we have to find a way that we have manufacturing in this country,  advanced manufacturing, and that means leveling the playing field on trade.   Until we do that, we're not going to have a permanent recovery.  </p><p> GLICK: Yes, I mean, Mayor Rybak, I'm concerned about the training efforts  too.  I mean that's what I keep hearing as one of the cures to solve the  problem here.  And I'm concerned that it's not really going to truly impact  job creation.  It's great to learn a lot of other, you know, things to do  and skills to have, but at the end of the day, it's not a job.  </p><p> MAYOR R.T. RYBAK, (D) MINNEAPOLIS: Well, I totally agree with your point.   I will say that in the middle of a recession, education and training is --  if you're ever going to do it, it's a good time to do it.  </p><p> But first and foremost, we didn't just wake up to the retraining issue when  the economy went south.  We've been doing it for a number of years.  When I  took office, unemployment was 1 percent higher in the city than in the  suburbs.  Today it's lower in the city than the rest of the region.  Very  few cities can say that.  The reason is because we've been in an ongoing  training effort for hard to employ people.  </p><p> Now when you hit a period of time like this, it's a big challenge.  You  have two things.  You have, one, the fact that there are a lot of people  who are out of work.  So, for instance, some of the key construction  trades, up to half the people will be sitting on the bench.  </p><p> Meanwhile, we know that coming up is going to be a new economy that's going  to be based a lot on clean energy, including some of the weatherization  work that really takes skilled workers.  So we have this tough problem of  needing workers in the future, but if you train them for trades where  there's high unemployment, you have a problem.  I spent all yesterday  morning meeting with trades and other folks trying to talk about that tough  issue.  </p><p> We do, however, have to say, you've got to create a job at the end of it.   So we've put a lot of our stimulus dollars into creating those new clean  energy jobs.  We've put some significant investment into solar, trying to  make sure that works.  We are training people to do solar installation.   We're training them to do green roof installation and are putting  incentives in it to create more green roofs.  </p><p> Now those are not going to bring back the manufacturing base of America.   And I agree with the mayor very much so.  I'm not giving up on making  things in America.  </p><p> I just got back from China.  And part of what we need to do as well is to  tap into a global economy.  We brought a Danish med tech firm into  Minneapolis and it's now moved into its headquarters here, 600 new jobs.   That's part of it too.  </p><p> But you have to home grow the economy.  You have to be part of global  economy.  And you have to have trained workers.  There's no one easy fix.  </p><p> GLICK: Right.</p><p> Steve, you talk to people every single day . . .</p><p> CROWLEY: We do.  </p><p> GLICK: Nationally syndicated radio show.  What are people saying to you  about the jobs environment? </p><p> CROWLEY: Well, sometimes you can't get a job in your local area.  Sometimes  people have to move.  We talked to one person who was a CPA/MBA, couldn't  get a job in south Florida.  If they would move to Houston, there's plenty  of jobs.  There's a shortage of CPA/MBAs.  So sometimes you do have to  retrain, go back to school.  People that learn Chinese right now can get a  job, I guarantee you.  </p><p> GLICK: So, you know, Steve, you've been doing this for a very long time.   Have you ever seen anything like this? </p><p> CROWLEY: No.  No one has really seen anything like this.  You have to go  back to the '30s, you know, to really see something like this.  This is an  unbelievable time in American history.  But I think it's getting a lot  better.  I think 12 to 18 months from now the market is predicting that the  jobs market is going to be better.  </p><p> GLICK: You know . . .</p><p> BERNERO: Let me say, Alexis, what's happened is the . . .</p><p> GLICK: Yes, Mayor Bernero, go ahead.</p><p> BERNERO: The chickens have come home to roost on this free trade.  We've  had unfettered free trade.  It's unilateral, economic disarmament.  And the  last speaker, you know, I appreciate -- I hope he's right that things turn  around, but there's a complete disconnect between the stock market, between  Wall Street and main street, because most of the production in this country  has been shipped overseas.  We've taken the P out of GDP, Gross Domestic  Product.  We've replaced it with a C.  We have Gross Domestic Consumption.  </p><p> And we have move so much with these unfair trade policies.  We've moved so  much of our production overseas that what you can see is the stock market  can recover, I think, because the production, most of it's overseas.  And  when you ship it to Malaysia and China and you can pollute the environment  and exploit the workers and pay a lot less, I guess Wall Street can make  more, but main street is hurting.  And I don't see that turning around  until we find a way to bring these jobs back to the United States.  </p><p> And it's not that these jobs evaporated.  That's a myth that these  manufacturing jobs just evaporated into the air because of technology.  Not  at all.  We have these jobs here in Lansing.  The new factories are  wonderful.  They are robotic.  And we have workers in them.  </p><p> But more and more of these high-tech, high-advanced manufacturing jobs are  going to places like Mexico and China.  And we've got to find a way to  reverse that and have fair trade that favors American workers, that allows  American workers to compete fairly.  </p><p> GLICK: Mayor Rybak, he raise as very important point.  Several states are  doing what they can to incentivize overseas operations to move here to the  United States, or incentivize U.S. companies who garner the lions share of  their revenues from international operations to stay in the United States.   But does that then raise a question of protectionism? </p><p> RYBAK: Well, I don't think the issue is protectionism as much as trying to  home grow an economy.  I mean, look, there are ways to ship jobs from  overseas.  But the thing Americans have always done is they've created the  job in the first place.  We're an incubator of innovation.  And if we  continue to incubate, then we can have not only the ideas, but the  manufacturing here.  </p><p> Now an example is, we're putting some of our stimulus dollars into helping  a company called Ken Kay Solar (ph).  It's a new approach to doing solar  that will hopefully make it cheaper to put it into homes.  So that's a  brain power idea.  But we need to also make sure that the person power  that's making it is done here as well.  </p><p> I think there's a really important moment when American ingenuity then  creates a product.  We do that well and will continue to do that well.  The  point is, is once that product is ready to be made, that we have to make it  here at home.  </p><p> I think the mayor made a good point in this whole issue of the unfair  competition of labor costs.  As I say, I was in China.  They're doing some  wonderful things.  But I sure as heck don't want my cousin or my  constituent getting some of the wages that are being paid over there.  </p><p> GLICK: Yes, right.  </p><p> RYBAK: So I think we need to certainly level the playing field, but also  recognize, hey, look, this is America.  We're not on our knees.  We know  what we're doing.  And we've done great things.  And we're going to do them  again.  Let's just get back to the basics of invention, incubation and  manufacturing.  We can do this.  </p><p> GLICK: You know, we heard yesterday some bright spots.  We heard about Wal- Mart hiring 22,000 people.  </p><p> CROWLEY: That's right.</p><p> GLICK: We've heard a couple of other companies start to say that they're  beginning to hire again.  That they're beginning to spend again.  You and I  yesterday talked about, you know, the ordering of jets and things of that  nature.  </p><p> CROWLEY: Right.  </p><p> GLICK: Are we starting to see those signs of life?  Are they starting to  suggest perhaps a bottom? </p><p> CROWLEY: I think it will all start with a good glimmer of hope, don't you?   But I -- you know, I really believe the small businesses, the nation's job  maker, net/net, Alexis, all new jobs are created by small business.  Apple  Computer and Microsoft started as small businesses and now employ a lot of  people.  </p><p> But a lot of companies that employ fewer than 50 people are now starting to  see the light.  We're getting reports back that the CEOs of these smaller  companies are saying, yes, business is picking up.  We're starting to bring  in our old employees that we let go.  And people who we cut down to 20, 30  hours a week, we're bringing back to 40 hours a week.  </p><p> So I think that's where the new jobs are going to be created.  And even  like cities like Lansing, which is a small business community too, I think  that's where the real job generation is going to happen.  </p><p> GLICK: Yes, you know, Mayor Bernero, I'm going to talk to the labor  secretary coming up in the next hour and the thing that worries me is that  the small business community, as Steve points out, which is something I  talked in one of my talking points, is essential for private sector jobs.   And what we saw in the last report is private sector jobs got hit so  tremendously.  Are we doing enough to help small businesses? </p><p> BERNERO: Look, look, number one, I mean, I just want to say, with all due  respect, you know, you help prove my point with the Wal-Mart.  I mean GM  lays off 20,000 high-paying, top of the line, top of the food chain  manufacturing jobs.  Twenty thousand.  Wal-Mart's hiring 20,000.  </p><p> It's the Wal-Martization of our economy and that's part of what's killing  us.  I mean that's great that Wal-Mart's hiring, that will give some hope,  but you're taking basically $26, $28 an hour jobs and going down to I don't  know what Wal-Mart pays, you know, $10 maybe if you're lucky.  So this is  part of the problem.  </p><p> Now as far as small business goes, one problem is the banking.  We've  helped banks at the top.  OK.  And, look, I'm not bashing Obama here.  I  mean the guy has inherited a mess and he's doing an admirable job with it.  </p><p> But we've helped banks at the top.  It hasn't trickled down to the  community banks.  The community banks, Steve's right, the small businesses  where the growth is, we all know that, there can't be any growth because  nobody can get a loan.  The community banks have been shut out.  While the  banks in Wall Street are getting help, the community banks, you know what  they're getting?  More regulation from FDIC.  They're getting tighter  regulations, tighter standards.  They're not getting any help.  And the  community banks weren't even part of the problem.  </p><p> So this has got to be addressed by the administration.  The community banks  are being strangle held and they're the ones that are -- that know the  people, that know the communities and know where the money should be given.   And they didn't do anything wrong.  They weren't involved in all the  chicanery that Wall Street was, but they're getting punished by the FDIC.   So this insanity has got to stop.  We need our community banks help.  </p><p> But the other thing, I want to just tell you, the small businesses are  hurting.  I've got e-mails and I've got people in my community, the small - - I can show you letters from union presidents and company presidents,  small business presidents, that sound just the same.  Main street America  is hurting.  Because when you wipe out manufacturing, you wipe out a lot of  the small businesses.  When I hear people say we're a service economy, what  are we going to service?  These small businesses are hurting because as so  much manufacturing has left, the small businesses -- of course we're in  Michigan.  I mean a lot of our small businesses were auto related, tool and  dye and this sort of thing.  </p><p> GLICK: Yes.  </p><p> BERNERO: They're hurting.  And I think this is true all across the country,  though.  You've had furniture makers and all sorts of small businesses that  are struggling to survive.  Again, I hate to sound like a one-note Nelly  (ph), but with that foreign competition.  </p><p> GLICK: You are incredible.  </p><p> Mayor Rybak, I just have to ask you the last question.  Are you going to  run for governor? </p><p> RYBAK: Oh, I -- we'll figure that out tomorrow.  But I want to say that  going back to the point of . . .</p><p> GLICK: Oh, we'll figure it out tomorrow.  You're -- the governor of your  state is saying that he's going to run -- he's going to go for the White  House.  </p><p> RYBAK: Well, he's going to get his butt kicked by Barack Obama, but that's  another thing.  </p><p> The point of the matter is . . .</p><p> GLICK: Wow.</p><p> RYBAK: I want to talk about jobs here.  </p><p> The point of the matter is, I absolutely strongly agree with the point that  was just being made about make things in America.  I do want to say,  though, that when you hear that a retail company is adding jobs, we don't  just want people behind the cash register, but speaking from the  headquarters of Target and Best Buy here in Minneapolis, some phenomenal  jobs are in that sector.  </p><p> But the other thing that happens in the economy in a period of time like  this is that as people go into transition, as sadly people leave a job and  try to figure out what to do next, you do have innovation.  And I think  that's one of the things we've got to work with, with the lending  community, and that is where sometimes the public sector needs to spur  innovation.  Someone leaves a company.  They get fired.  They get laid off.   They start to think about it.  They talk with their friend about what  they've always wanted to do.  This is when the new American jobs get  created.  </p><p> Now we can't be in la-la land about this.  They've got to make things too.   But I think innovation will help us at this point.  </p><p> GLICK: All right, sounds like the role of governor looks appealing.</p><p> All right, Mayor Rybak, thank you so much.  Mayor Bernero, and Steve,  gentlemen, thank you very much.  </p><p> All right, guys, we're going to take a quick break.  We've got the jobs  data coming out in just about 12 minutes.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK: Checking financial news now.</p><p> The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in its  boardroom.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be  bounced out.  \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S.  Bancorp CEO Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job.  The feds, of  course, own 34 percent of Citigroup.  </p><p> And the FDIC putting its program to rid the nation's banks of toxic assets  on hold.  The legacy loans program was supposed to begin with a trial sale  this month.  The FDIC says banks have proven they can raise private capital  without cleansing their balance sheets.  Therefore, the FDIC says the  program could come back later on in different form.  </p><p> And the FDIC is very busy today.  Also shutting down Silverton Bank.  The  troubled bank did attract interest from private equity folks, but the FDIC  said it had to do what was cheapest for the insurance fund and ultimately  shutting it down was cheaper.  Silverton was not a retail bank. Most of its  customers were actually other banks.  </p><p> All right.  Let's go over to Charles Payne and take a look at the Fox 50.  </p><p> Charles.</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, thanks a lot, Alexis.  </p><p> Well, as you said, Citigroup, Apple, and Intel, they're all Fox 50 stocks  and they're all making news this morning.  Former Barclay's (ph) capital  investment manager and financial analyst Vn Man (ph), he joins us now to  break them all down.</p><p> And let's talk about this Citi thing because I don't think it's news that a  lot of people want to see Vikram Pandit go.  The bigger story here seems to  be Sheila Bair versus Timothy Geithner and the FDIC not only saying we want  to be in this game, we actually want more power.</p><p> VN MAN, FMR. BARCLAY'S CAPITAL INVESTMENT MANAGER: Yes, absolutely.  I mean  the -- what's going on here is the FDIC is essentially trying to get more  power than the comptroller.  But, you know, not since the days of Howard  Stern fighting the FCC have we seen government versus the private sector.   I mean this is really turning into a soap opera.  </p><p> On one hand you've got Sheila Bair and she interrupted kind of Citigroup's  ideas in the past.  I don't know if you recall when she actually -- when  Citigroup was trying to buy Wachovia and then Wells Fargo swept in there  and bought Wachovia instead.  And Sheila Bair backed Wells Fargo.  And so,  you know, there's kind of this struggle between . . .</p><p> PAYNE: There's definitely a power struggle going on there.  </p><p> Let's talk about Apple here.  </p><p> MAN: OK.</p><p> PAYNE: Big, big news.  Obviously tomorrow the Pre comes out.  But the  bigger news for folks on the Apple stock is that Steve Jobs is coming back.   And it always feels like Caesar returning to Rome.  So much excitement.   The stock is indicating it will open higher here.  What do you think is  going to happen?</p><p> MANN: You know, everybody -- me included -- everybody wants to know they  work for the best and the brightest.  And Steve Jobs, he's not just a  maverick.  You know, he's a hero to the people he works for and a hero to  the investors.  So people want to know that he's coming back.</p><p> But what's interesting is, over the last five months, since he left in  January, the stock has appreciated over 68 percent.  So the market believes  that Apple can continue to be successful, even without Steve Jobs there on  a daily basis.  </p><p> PAYNE: Right.  And we do have the bid ask.  It's up.  Indicating up almost  3 points here at the open.  </p><p> Having said that and the fact that you pointed out it's already up, as an  investor, if an investor came to you this morning and said, should I buy  this stock, what would you tell them? </p><p> MAN: You know, I love this stock.  I mean I actually have my own iPhone.   I'm a huge fan of the iPhone.  And the new one is coming out supposedly.   That's what we're hearing rumors is that it's going to come out at the  worldwide development conference.  </p><p> PAYNE: Let's talk about another big tech name.</p><p> MAN: Yes.  Yes.</p><p> PAYNE: Intel made a rare acquisition yesterday.  A company called Wind  River Systems.  What does that tell you that Intel is starting to make some  of these acquisitions? </p><p> MAN: You know, Intel has -- obviously they control the PC market, the  server market in terms of their chips.</p><p> PAYNE: But it's sort of like a one trick pony.  </p><p> MAN: Well, what this is doing, it's giving them access to customers.  I  mean who are the customers of Wind River?  The customers are Apple.  The  customers are Sony, Panasonic.  And this gives them access to those  customers.  So I think it's a good move.  </p><p> PAYNE: Quickly before I take it back to Alexis.  The stock closed at  $11.70.  The bid is $11.50. Does that tell you there could be another bid  coming for this company? </p><p> MAN: Yes.  I mean if they're making an offer of $11.50 and already, you  know, since Wednesday you see it's trading up to $11.70 that means there's  potentially somebody else or the market thinks that somebody else is going  to step in there and offer something -- you know, a higher number.  </p><p> PAYNE: Thanks a lot.  We really appreciate it.  That's fantastic.  </p><p> MAN: Thank you.  Thanks.</p><p> PAYNE: All right, Alexis, back over to you.</p><p> GLICK: All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p> Coming up, Chrysler is back in court today.  Adam Shapiro is there live  with the very latest.  </p><p> And we are just minutes away from the May employment number.  We're going  to have that for you as it happens and a full break down.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK: We've got some breaking auto news now.  Dow Jones Newswire is  reporting there will be no Opel launch in the United States due to a future  Magna deal.  </p><p> Chrysler heads backed to court today where the judge will hear from a group  trying to block its deal with Fiat.  Our own Fox Business' Adam Shapiro is  live outside the courthouse with the details on both of these developments.  </p><p> Adam.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the latest, let's start with Opel  real quick.  There are Opels in the United States now.  They actually build  cars for Saturn and the Saturn Astra is one of them.  With the news that  Saturn may be sold to Penske Auto Group out of Detroit, you might still  have some kind of contractual agreement where Opel would manufacture cars  and be sold under the Saturn brand.  So to say Opel won't be launched in  the U.S. is accurate, but you can still get an Opel, it would just have a  different name.  </p><p> Now to Chrysler.</p><p> The appellate court, the three judge panel, will hear arguments starting at  2:00 as to why the deal with Fiat should be delayed.  Keep in mind, it was  Chrysler which asked for this emergency hearing.  They're trying to get the  panel to certify the sale so the deal can close before July 15th. But the  Indiana state treasurer, along with 12 other parties, are trying to stop  the deal and they've also petitioned to get the stay in place which now  exists.  They say, this is the exact quote, \"that the Indiana retirees and  Indiana taxpayers have suffered losses because of unprecedented and illegal  acts of the federal government.\"</p><p> Sources close to all of this say they expect a decision from the three- panel judges by late tonight, possibly early Saturday morning.  So  everybody will be watching to see if Chrysler and Fiat get the go ahead to  close their deal or if it will be delayed.  And if it's delayed past that  July 15th date where they say they have to close, Fiat has the option to  walk.  And if they do walk, Chrysler has to come up with $35 million as a  penalty for not closing many time.  </p><p> Alexis.</p><p> GLICK: OK.  Before I let you go, Adam, just to confirm here, the deadline  is June 15th, right, not July 15th.  </p><p> SHAPIRO: June 15th, not July.  June 15th.  I miss spoke.  June 15th.  </p><p> GLICK: OK, good.  I just wanted to confirm.  I want to confirm that.  </p><p> The other thing here is, is if, in fact, Fiat were to walk, what happens  with the role of the Treasury and the U.S. government in backstopping this  debtor in possession financing?  </p><p> SHAPIRO: That's a very good question.  We'll try and get that one answered.   But most people are not even addressing it.  They expect it to close.  But  it would throw the entire deal with Chrysler up in the air because the U.S.  government has said, without Fiat, there is no future for Chrysler.  </p><p> GLICK: All right.  Adam Shapiro, we will continue to keep a close eye on  these developments throughout the morning.  Thank you very much, Adam.  </p><p> Well, we are just about a minute away from the jobs data.  I want to bring  up the futures right now as we take a look at this here.  Expectations  right now for unemployment to rise to 9.2 percent.  It was 8.9 percent in  April.  Expectations are also for 520,000 job losses.  We did lose 539,000  jobs last month. </p><p> Now keep in mind, though, we have seen upward revisions time and time  again.  And those jobs numbers, January, February, March, were well north  of 600.  In fact, back in January, 740,000 job losses.  At this point, if  we lose about 500,000, we will have lost 6.2 million job since the start of  the recession according to the NABE.  That was December of 2007.  </p><p> As you can see, the futures are in the green.  So we're looking up to be in  positive territory here. But if we get something in the 500s, low 500s, the  anticipation is that the market will rally on the news that perhaps job  losses are beginning to subside.  </p><p> Let's go to Rich Edson.  He is at the Labor Department with the number.  </p><p> RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: 345,000 jobs lost.  345,000 jobs lost.   We've got an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent.  That's the highest since  1983.  There are 14.5 unemployed people in this country.  That is the  highest ever.  </p><p> Again, 345,000 jobs lost last month.  We had 539,000 jobs lost initially  last month, April, excuse me.  That number is now 504,000.  In March, the  initial number, 699,000 jobs lost.  That is now 652,000 jobs lost. </p><p> Since the recession began in December of 2007, the unemployment rate has  increased 4.5 percent and six million jobs have been lost.</p><p> Let's take a look at the private sector -- 338,000 jobs lost.  Government  fell 7,000 jobs.  The federal government dropped 15,000 jobs.</p><p> Leisure and hospitality, get this, up 3,000 jobs.  That's the first  increase since December of 2007 when the recession began.  Eight thousands  of those jobs are food and drinking services.</p><p> Education and health services up 44,000 jobs.  And credit intermediation,  if you are looking for those refinance jobs, down 6,000.  Those are people  who do refis if you are looking for an indication of that.  </p><p> Let's take a look at construction jobs, a little bit better than had been.   Manufacturing jobs, 156,000.  Let's start with that, 156,000 jobs lost for  manufacturing.  Motor vehicles and parts down 30,000.  </p><p> And since December of 2007, there have been 1.8 million jobs lost because  of manufacturing.  That accounts for three-tenths of all jobs lost since  there.  Construction employment down 59,000.  And believe it or not, that's  about half the average of the previous six months.  </p><p> Household wages averaging $18.54.  That is up .1 percent, year over year up  3.1 percent.  </p><p> Also, government was up 92,000 last month.  It was originally thought to be  up 72,000 -- excuse me, that's for the month of April.  The month of April  up 92,000, originally thought to be 72,000. </p><p> Alexis, we'll leave it there.  Back to you.</p><p> GLICK:  All right.  So, before I let you go, Rich, just to review this here  right now, the 14.5 million people that are unemployed is the highest on  which record?  From what date?  </p><p> EDSON:  That was when record keeping began back in 1948.  So it's the  highest ever taken when they started all the way back in 1948.</p><p> GLICK:  All right, terrific.  And just before I let you go, any revisions?   No revisions to unemployment rate, revisions downward for April and March  in terms of non-farm payrolls?  </p><p> EDSON:  That's right.  We lost fewer jobs in April and March.  Originally,  it was thought in April that we'd lost 539,000 jobs.  That's now been  revised to 504,000 jobs, so a difference of 35,000 jobs on the good side.  </p><p> March, originally thought to be nearly 700,000, 699,000, we are now at  652,000 for the month of March.  That is a change to the good side of  47,000.</p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Rich Edison, what a surprise.  Thank you very much.  </p><p> Let's break down the numbers.  </p><p> Democratic Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is with us; Roger Ballou,  the president and CEO of the professional service company CDI; and John  Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Investor Services.  </p><p> Gentlemen, I'm in a little bit of shock, a little surprised.  </p><p> John, let me start with you.  You're my resident economist here.  </p><p> Why would the unemployment rate tick up from 8.9 percent to 9.4 percent and  yet in non-farm payrolls we lost a little less than 350,000?  </p><p> JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES:  Well, you know,  we first have to consider that these job estimates are taken from two  separate different surveys.  The unemployment rate is taken from a  household survey.  The count of jobs, number of jobs is taken from a survey  of employers.  </p><p> That being said, you know, one of the defining characteristics of this  recession has been the record length of unemployment.  So while fewer  people are losing their jobs -- and we pick that up from the recent decline  if first time jobless claims -- we still find that the number of people  that are out of work or collecting state unemployment benefits continues to  grow.  This is a recession where it was very damaging to have lost your job  because of the unusually long period of time it's taken to secure new  employment if you are that lucky.</p><p> GLICK:  All right.  </p><p> Let me go to Congressman Sestak.  </p><p> Are you surprised by the numbers?  </p><p> REP. JOE SESTAK (D), PENNSYLVANIA:  Actually, I am.  I had expected them to  be in the low 500,000s.  In fact, when we ran the models several months  ago, if we had gotten to the low 500,000s or just below it by July, we  would have assumed everything was going according to script -- still  intense, but not intensifying.  What this data shows is that as compared to  past recessions, employers laid off employees much more rapidly when you  look at the data, which means that this stopping of the cratering of our  economy may come to a halt a bit more rapidly.  </p><p> I had expected unemployment to be about 9.2 percent.  And he is right,  overall, people who don't have any jobs and aren't seeking is about 16  percent.  But think about what else is now happening.  </p><p> The yields in the financial market have really come down.  We also see that  the housing market is beginning to see the bottom of housing prices  falling.  We also are seeing here that consumer spending is actually  beginning to increase as the rebates come back.  </p><p> In fact, if you compare May of this year, when our rebates came out from  the stimulus bill, to a year ago, it's hard to compare, because remember,  Alexis, a year ago in May, we also had a stimulus bill.  But when you see  the two, comparison, it appears as though consumer confidence is beginning  to come back.  We'll get to about 10 percent unemployment by the end of the  year, but I don't think we're going to go above it, and then we're out of  here, as Mr. Bernanke pointed out recently, and our economy begins to go  again.</p><p> GLICK:  You know, Roger, you are an outsourcing firm.  You deal with part- time and full-time workforce.  Have you been seeing improving trends, or is  this data a surprise to you?  </p><p> ROGER BALLOU, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CDI:  Actually, this data is confirmatory  of what we have been seeing throughout our business, our MRINetwork offices  across he country and our CDI professional staffing organizations, where,  if you look at it, there have been a lot of bright areas in the economy in  spite of the losses of jobs.  </p><p> For example, rural economies have continued to perform better than urban  economies, where they are driven by more commodities, agriculture, things  like that.  Secondly, the service sector, if you look at health care, has  actually been experiencing growth through this.  </p><p> We saw what appeared to be the beginning of the end of the recession at the  end of the first quarter in our numbers.  We saw it confirmed in April.  We  see it confirmed again here in May.  </p><p> So what we're seeing in this national data is confirmation of what our  MRINetwork offices and our professional organizations that we serve have  been seeing over the last two or three months.  So the actual exact number  I couldn't have predicted, but we did predict that it was beginning of the  end of the recession occurring in this last part of the first quarter,  first part of the second quarter.</p><p> GLICK:  Gentlemen, I want to bring up for just a moment what the market is  doing in reaction to this, because the market is reacting pretty favorably  -- that would be putting it lightly -- to this news.  </p><p> The market was up about 40 beforehand.  The Dow now up 135 points.  So  we're up 1.5 percent.  The S&amp;P right now is up 1.7 percent and Nasdaq up a  percent.  So we've rallied a full one percent in reaction to this.  </p><p> Two points.  </p><p> Congressman Sestak, let me first start with you on the president's fiscal  stimulus package.  He has tried to demonstrate in several speeches recently  that the fiscal stimulus is starting to work its way into the economy.   Money is being spent.  I think he recently said about 100,000 jobs have  been saved or created.  </p><p> Is this proof in the pudding that in fact it is starting to work, and it  was the necessary fuel that we needed to get everybody off the sidelines?  </p><p> SESTAK:  Yes, I believe it was one of the necessary tools.  We also have to  give a lot of credit to the TARP program and the TALF program, the second  one, as you well know, to the Federal Reserve, because they have gotten the  mother milk of our economy, credit, flowing again.  And so there's a lot  more confidence in the markets also.</p><p> But without a doubt, this economic stimulus bill intended to get money out  there so people would spend it.  A lot of it on retailing has started to  work.  Now what you are going to see is later this year, the construction  money -- only about six percent of it has been spent thus far -- is really  going to kick in just as the recession seems to be coming to a halt and is  ready to come up.  I think it's been well played.</p><p> GLICK:  You know, John, it's interesting.  I was speaking to Jim Rohr, the  chairman and CEO of PNC, and the other day he said, \"Alexis, one of the  greatest stimulus in this economy has been what the Fed has done because  those who have been able to refinance on average has saved about $300 on  monthly payments.\"  </p><p> I wonder, is that stimulus generated by refi activity enough to offset the  fact that as we sit here right now, oil is breaking above $70 a barrel,  it's at a seven-month high, and so what was perceived as a tax credit  because of declining gasoline and oil prices is now going to be a tax on  consumers?  </p><p> LONSKI:  You know, we have to keep our eye on energy prices, but I believe  that when consumers look at energy prices, they take a longer-term view.   And they didn't believe that oil was going to stay at $40 to $50 per  gallon.  </p><p> Consumer spending proceeds on the assumption the price of crude oil will be  in a range of $60 to $70 per barrel.  So we are hitting the upper end of  this range beyond which consumer spending might indeed suffer.  And so it  would behoove the administration to take any action necessary to prevent a  replay of what happened in the first half of 2008, when the price of crude  oil soared up to nearly $150 per barrel.  If that happens again, then the  wait for the next economic recovery will be longer than we currently  anticipate.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes.</p><p> I mean, Roger, there's a lot of confluences of events right now that are  beginning to signal that perhaps the global economy is starting to heal.   The concern is -- and John brings up some great points -- is that  inflation, things of that nature become a bigger concern and act as a tax  on consumers or cause interest rates to rise.</p><p> What impact, if any, will all this have on the corporations that you talk  to on a daily basis who are looking to slowly but surely begin to bring new  employees into the fold?</p><p> BALLOU:  Well, I think two things.</p><p> Congressman Sestak commented earlier that -- I think what you saw this time  is a steeper quicker reduction in employment and inventories than we have  ever seen before.  I think that the information systems companies now used  to control their inventories and their production capacity led them to  react much, much more quickly.  What I think that's going to lead to is a  slower sustained recovery coming out of this, so it's going to be like a  reverse hockey stick, where you saw a quicker downtick, but a gradual  uptick that will come.  </p><p> I also agree that I think the financial programs are the key driver of the  uptick here.  I don't think that much of the stimulus has kicked in yet, so  I suspect that the bigger stimulus effect here has been the credit markets  opening up, and that leading to enhanced consumer confidence and business  confidence.  </p><p> The other thing that's gone on is the global economy, where you see the  Indian economy continuing to grow very, very strongly.  You see the Chinese  economy in resurgence based on their stimulus programs.  So I think those  things are contributing significantly to the uptick as well.  </p><p> So, it is an interconnected global economy.  In our case, I think the  financial programs have been very, very critical to it.  I also think the  president himself has been instilling confidence through his communication,  through his demeanor, through the programs that he's launched.  And this is  a very -- you know, people's psyches are fragile, but they also can move in  a positive direction, very, very quickly, and I think you are beginning to  see that occurring.</p><p> GLICK:  Congressman Sestak, I'm going to give you the last word.  </p><p> One of the things about the data shows that number of hours worked have  dropped.  Productivity, as we just saw yesterday, is rising.  </p><p> One material concern out there is that we will see declining wages, that  we've seen declining wages, but that it will be a bigger issue that the  consumer will still remain fairly tapped out.  And because we've figured  out how to accomplish more with less workers, that some of those jobs may  not come back.  </p><p> How important is it to find those future jobs that will perhaps replace a  lot of the millions of jobs of the six million that we have seen since the  recession began?  </p><p> SESTAK:  This is an excellent point you make.  </p><p> We have lost about a trillion dollars in our GDP as compared to our 2007  GDP high peak.  And if we just have an economy, as was just mentioned, that  grows slowly, and let's just say it grows at 2.5 percent, which was the  average between 2001 and 2007, it will take us three years to soak up that  $1 trillion of lost GDP capacity.  Which means if we don't grow more  rapidly, we won't be creating these jobs that you spoke about.  </p><p> That's why the president's budget is absolutely critical.  If he is -- and  I believe he is -- intent upon in succeeding in retooling the economy in  the types of jobs, the green energy jobs, the ability to reform our health  care system, those parts of this budget will be absolutely critical.  </p><p> Second, I go back that we have to do more in the entrepreneur incentives by  the right tax incentives to get that extra bump to our economy above 2.5  percent growth in the next few years to come, or we won't create those  jobs.</p><p> GLICK:  Right.  Good point.</p><p> SESTAK:  Because China is growing this year 6.8 percent as we lose about  five or six percent.  So that's why this is important, your point.</p><p> GLICK:  All right, guys.  We are going to leave it there.  Terrific,  terrific discussion.  </p><p> I'm glad to see we've seen some relief in the numbers, but remember still a  lot of people unemployed in this economy.  </p><p> Congressman Sestak, Roger and John, thank you so much, gentlemen.  </p><p> SESTAK:  Thank you for having me.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.</p><p> GLICK:  A reminder, by the way please join me, 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time.  I  will be speaking to the labor secretary, Hilda Solis, in a \"First on Fox\"  interview here to break down this May employment number.  So please tune in  for that.  We'll get an opportunity to get her thoughts in just about 45  minutes.  </p><p> All right.  Coming up, more jobs lost.  We're talking to students just  entering the working world about their hunt for employment.</p><p> And of course we will head live to the New York Stock Exchange for a little  bit of a preview on what is now a market that's looking pretty good.  </p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  All week we have been taking a look at the nation's growing deficit  as a result of government spending as something we called red ink.  Now,  MONEY FOR BREAKFAST teamed up with the college news service U-Wire to take  a closer look at Generation Debt, the students of America who will inherit  the current deficit  </p><p> Some of those students told us the financial worries that are keeping them  -- frankly, they're keeping them up at night.  Take a listen to what they  had to say.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My biggest financial concern is just to find a job  after I graduate.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm more worried about people my parents' age who have  just seen their retirement funds completely be gone.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My parents' businesses since December, like, their  sales have been halved.  And that kind of really affects me because I'm in  school now.  I can't help them out.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My personal biggest financial concern is just being  able to live the life that we're expected to live as -- you know, again  since I came from a background where my parents didn't necessarily have a  lot of money, I think there was a big expectation for me coming to college  and getting the job.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GLICK:  Well, as you heard, some of the students we spoke to say finding a  job is their top worry.  With roughly 1.5 million graduating seniors  entering the workforce this year and a loss of another 500,000 -- well, now  actually we have seen 350,000 jobs in May, according to the most recent  survey -- what will they do?  And is now the time to figure out other  options?  </p><p> Joining us right now, Emily Sutherland, who is heading into her senior year  at Colorado State; Leah Finnegan, who graduated from the University of  Texas this year; and Dean Van Tassell, who received his MBA from Pace  University just two weeks ago.  </p><p> Good morning, guys.  Good to see you.  </p><p> LEAH FINNEGAN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS GRADUATE:  Good morning.</p><p> DEAN VAN TASSELL, RECEIVED MBA FROM PACE UNIVERSITY:  Good morning.</p><p> EMILY SUTHERLAND, HEADING INTO SENIOR YEAR AT COLORADO STATE:  Good  morning.</p><p> GLICK:  All right, Dean.  Let me talk to you.</p><p> You just graduated two weeks ago from Pace University.  You have been on  the job hunt.  What have you been experiencing?  </p><p> VAN TASSELL:  Well, first of all, thank you for having me on the program.   And BB&amp;T Capital Markets loves Fox Business.</p><p> GLICK:  Oh, that's good to know.  Thanks.  </p><p> VAN TASSELL:  I have been applying to, let's see now, about 70 different  investment banks, writing the HR departments, following with managing  directors, trying to get my name out there as much as possible.  I have a  nice stack of rejection letters right now, so it's rough out there.  </p><p> You know, you have to start making contingency plans.  And it's -- you  know, we're up to 9.4 percent.  The only solace I have is that maybe the  9.4 percent unemployment is backwards looking, and the market seems to be  shrugging it off today.  So hopefully we will have second derivative fever  and things will start to level out and pick up relatively soon.</p><p> GLICK:  Leah, you just graduated from the University of Texas.  You have a  BA in American studies.  </p><p> What kind of jobs have you been looking for?  </p><p> FINNEGAN:  I'm actually going into journalism, which is, you know, quite an  experience at this time.  And I applied to about 20 jobs, and I heard \"No\"  from about five.  And then I just didn't hear from the rest of them.  So  it's kind of like applying to a black hole.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes, radio silence.  </p><p> So what did you decide to do when you just weren't getting back any  responses or you were just getting rejection notes without even, as I  understand, getting an opportunity to even interview?  </p><p> FINNEGAN:  Well, my contingency plan was grad school, and I wasn't sure if  I wanted to go, and kind of applied on the lark and ended up getting into  grad school and not getting into any jobs.  So grad school it is.</p><p> GLICK:  So you're going to Columbia?</p><p> FINNEGAN:  Yes.</p><p> GLICK:  My alma mater.  </p><p> FINNEGAN:  Oh, OK.</p><p> GLICK:  Very excited.  OK.</p><p> Now Emily, let me talk to you.  I understand you are majoring in  communications.  You are going to be a senior this year at Colorado State.  </p><p> When you listen to what's happening to Dean and Leah and I'm sure a lot of  your other classmates, how is that impacting you?  How nervous does it make  you knowing that you are going into your senior year of college?  </p><p> SUTHERLAND:  Well, it makes me really nervous, of course.  A lot of my  friends have graduated.  A lot of them have resulted in working at  Starbucks and their degree has gotten them absolutely nowhere.  So I just  hope that things pick up so I actually do have job opportunities out there  once I graduate.</p><p> GLICK:  Dean, you smiled there.  I mean, how many of your friends and  colleagues have had to do that?  Like, you might have had aspirations of  working on Wall Street or working in a particular sector, but there's no  opportunities and you have to get what you can get.  </p><p> VAN TASSELL:  I know a lot of people who would be lucky to get a job at  Starbucks.  It's hard.  </p><p> I will probably have to go back to bartending for a little bit, but it seem  just as competitive as Wall Street, if not more.  You have a lot of people  laid off and in the same position I'm in, so a lot of people just don't  have any options, even contingency plans.  </p><p> The number one thing I hear is there's a lot of government jobs out there,  but the mentality of, I want to work on Wall Street, I'm very aggressive, I  want to be in the financial markets than going into a government job, it's  a bit different from what you have expected might be around after you  graduate.  So...</p><p> GLICK:  Right.</p><p> And Leah, how many other classmates of yours have said they are going to  choose to continue to go back to school because that's really the only and  best option?  </p><p> FINNEGAN:  A really good number.  It is a very popular option right now.   And I don't know, I'm kind of finding the whole experience a bit freeing,  and I think a lot of people my peers are as well, that now we have this  time right now to kind of relax and discover what we really want to do.</p><p> GLICK:  Good point.</p><p> FINNEGAN:  and then we have the rest of our lives to do it.  So there's not  so much pressure to be successful and make more than $100,000 right out of  college.</p><p> GLICK:  Great point.  </p><p> I wish you all the best success.  Leah, Dean and Emily, thank you guys so  much.  </p><p> VAN TASSELL:  Thank you.</p><p> FINNEGAN:  Thank you.</p><p> SUTHERLAND:  Thank you.</p><p> GLICK:  All right, guys.  We're going to take a break.  We will be right  back with \"THE OPENING BELL\" in just a moment.  We're just about five  minutes away.  </p><p> All right.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Welcome back.  It's time for \"The One Thing You Should  Know.\"</p><p> Connell, you were watching actually the bond market reaction to the jobs  data.  What did you see happen?  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Well, a big move up in yields, which is really going to be the  story that we're going to have to follow very, very closely, Alexis, when  you think about it.  </p><p> And Charles, you and I talked about this, the idea that hey, maybe the  economy has bottomed out and things are starting to look better, but what  about rising yields, rising mortgage rates, and other things?  And does  that cut off the recovery?</p><p> GLICK:  It could be a tough bear market for the bonds.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Absolutely.  And also, I was looking at equities.  I thought the  Dow and this type of number would be up 200, 300 points.  I'm serious.  I  think we have a conflict here with the unemployment number being 9.4.</p><p> GLICK:  I agree.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Two separate surveys -- the Household Survey saying, listen, it's  tough, it's tougher than the way the businesses maybe are looking at it.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  You've got to wonder why the divergence.</p><p> And speaking of which, actually, I'm going to talk to Labor Secretary Hilda  Solis coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time.  So tune in.   She will he' be joining us \"First on Fox.\"</p><p> All right, guys.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC.

The Journal reporting Sheila  Bair and the FDIC want a change and it could include CEO Vikram Pandit.   Who might be tapped to replace him?  And what do the people at Citigroup  think?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the SEC charges Mozilo federal regulators charge Countrywide cofounder  Angelo Mozilo with insider trading and securities fraud.  What will happen  to him next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're serving these stories and much more this morning on MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.</p><p>Good morning and happy Friday.  Welcome to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm Alexis  Glick.</p><p>Coming up this morning, much more on the latest on GM Saturn sale and that  possible shakeup at Citigroup.</p><p>Plus the smart phone war is heating up as Palm gets ready to release its  new device; it's called the Pre.  And it goes public later today.  We'll  get a preview of that phone.</p><p>And all this as reports that Steve Jobs is ready to return to the helm  after a six-month medical hiatus.  Could Apple be making a big announcement  as early as next week?</p><p>Plus, the May unemployment numbers are due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.   All eyes are on this number.  Expectations are for a loss of another  520,000 jobs; unemployment to reach 9.2 percent.  We'll see in just  moments.</p><p>Roger Ballou, CDI Core President and CEO and Representative Joe Sestak from  Pennsylvania are both going to join me to break down those numbers when  they come out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>We'll also have a terrific roundtable discussion on where the jobs are  being created in the state and local municipalities.  Is the fiscal  stimulus package actually helping create enough jobs?</p><p>Let's take a look at the futures right now as we get started.  As you can  see across the board we're in the green; right now the DOW up 36; S&amp;P up  four; NASDAQ up three.  So across the board we're up just fractionally.</p><p>Let's get directly to the markets.  Fox Business contributor Gavin Gray is  in for Mr. Ashley Webster in London.  And Connell McShane is here with us  right now.  Let's get started with Connell here in New York -- Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning Alexis.  Yes we're  certainly watching those markets closely, you showed us the futures moving  a little bit higher indicating we might get a higher open at the final  trading day of the week.</p><p>But all of that can change of course; 8:30 a.m. Eastern time will be the  big number on jobs.  Now, speaking of jobs in a different -- speaking of it  in a different way, Steve Jobs is making big news at Apple.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning reporting he is on pace to take back  the CEO position to come back on to the job as planned and with that said,  from medical leave, the stock is getting a nice boost this morning.</p><p>All of that kind of plays into what Alexis was talking about a little while  ago, the back and forth between Apple and Palm; Palm coming out over the  weekend with its Pre.  Not only might jobs come back as planned here but  the idea is maybe he comes back a little earlier than planned.</p><p>There's a big developer's conference next week and the thinking is maybe  Jobs comes back for that, announces a new iPhone.  We'll see that getting a  little bit ahead of ourselves but the \"Journal\" starting that speculation  this morning.</p><p>Investors seem to like it.  The Apple stock price as you see there up to  147 in change pre-market trading.</p><p>Ok, let's see what the European markets are up to this morning as we do now  head over to Gavin Gray in London -- Gavin.</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Connell thanks very much indeed.  Let's first  of all have a look at the markets over here; all really waiting on  particularly in Europe and Britain waiting really for the results of the  cabinet reshuffle.</p><p>But let's kick off in London with the FTSE.  That is currently up 67 points  leading the way at 4,454; the CAC-40 now gaining of a bit of strength as  well, up 28 points.  And the DAX really hasn't moved much all morning.   Just up 21 points or 0.4 of a percent.</p><p>As really as I said, eyes looking at Downing Street, waiting for this  Cabinet reshuffle.  We haven't had it confirmed yet but we do believe that  the Alistair Darling who is the current Chancellor -- the moneyman is going  to keep his position.  It's rumored he told Gordon Brown I either have this  job or I don't have a job in your cabinet.  We do think that he is going to  remain as Chancellor.  One or two other movements, we believe a fourth  Minister has resigned.  That is the fourth in just four days.</p><p>And also a report that U.K. inflation continues to fall.  A sign about that  the Office of National Statistics says the price of manufactured goods has  come down just 0.3 percent year on year,  largely because of the oil price  coming down in that last year, but of course oil is coming back up.  But  that is the biggest annual decline since June 2002.</p><p>Alexis back to you.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, Gavin thank you very much.</p><p>Well, auto news now.  It is a hot topic.</p><p>Breaking news this morning the \"Wall Street Journal\" says auto dealer Roger  Penske will reportedly buy the Saturn brand from General Motors.  Sources  say, Penske would buy vehicles from GM and Renault then sell them under the  Saturn brand.  No word yet on how much Penske is paying.  An official  announcement is to be made later today.</p><p>And the deal to sell Hummer to a Chinese company may have hit a bump in the  road.  Some experts say regulators in Beijing may block it because the  Hummer brand goes against China's focus on fuel efficient vehicles.</p><p>And GM will finance a huge part of a private equity firm's buyout of parts  maker Delphi.  GM will provide $2.5 billion of the $3.6 billion -- that  specific $3.6 billion price tag.  In return GM buys back four Delphi  plants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL PACINO, ACTOR:  Something really wrong is going on here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You are out of order.</p><p>PACINO:  You're out of order, you're out of order.  The whole trial is out  of order.  They are out of order.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK:  And there you have it.  That was Al Pacino.  I'm not sure if you  remember in the courtroom black comedy \"And Justice For All\" which details  chaos in the court system.  And some think that's precisely what's going on  today with the Chrysler bankruptcy hearing.</p><p>A judge in New York will hear arguments from a group trying to block the  deal with Fiat.  Opponents include a group of Indiana state pension funds  and a dozen other parties.</p><p>Speaking of which, for more on what we can expect today, let's go directly  down to lower Manhattan to our own Adam Shapiro who is standing outside the  U.S. Court of Appeals.</p><p>And Adam I'm not sure it's quite Al Pacino style but it seems like it's  getting pretty close.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it could be close, but the Indiana - - the lawyers for the Indiana State Treasurer Richard Murdock are going to  be arguing on behalf of 100,000 Indiana pensioners, police officers as well  as teachers that the sale to Fiat violates all kinds of bankruptcy law as  well as the TARP law -- the law which created the Trouble Asset Relief  Program.  That's the argument they're going to make in court.</p><p>First, that senior secured lenders like the pensioners are being given a  secondary position in this bankruptcy which is counter to Bankruptcy Law.   Second, that the TARP was originally created to help financial institutions  not automobile companies and that's a violation of the Troubled Asset  Relief Program that was set up last year.</p><p>And that third, this is just a deal that is not good for the U.S.  taxpayers.  That's the argument they're going to make in court.  And that  argument lost.  They didn't gain any ground with that argument when they  presented it to Judge Arthur Gonzalez at the Bankruptcy Court.</p><p>They've also argued that this was a private plan agreed to before, they  called it a Sub-Rosa plan, before Chrysler filed for bankruptcy, but again,  Arthur Gonzalez said no that's just not the case.  That's what the  Appellate panel is going to hear; the three judges on the Appellate Court.</p><p>They're also going to be considering Chrysler's motion to certify the sale.   If that happens, if the Indiana pensioners lose and Chrysler wins and the  sale is certified, you can expect that sale to close almost immediately  because Chrysler says it has to close the deal with Fiat by the 15th of  June or else Fiat has the option to walk away from the table and worse it  walks away with $35 million from Chrysler as a penalty for failing to close  the deal.</p><p>So there's a lot riding on this decision today, Alexis.</p><p>One other thing in regards to that Hummer sale and the report that the  Chinese are making perhaps a problem as to closing that deal because  Hummers aren't fuel efficient.  Hummer dealers will tell you that the H-3  which is the smaller Hummer -- it's built on the Chevy Colorado platform --  they'll tell you it gets better gas mileage on the highway than some of the  import SUVs like the Lexus.  So that's an argument that they are probably  ready to fight.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, Adam.  I was just going to ask you about that, I  appreciate it.  All right, we'll check in with you a little later outside  the court.</p><p>All right, well Chrysler is fighting two courtroom battles which Adam just  talked about in its push to exit bankruptcy and merge with Fiat.  In  addition to today's hearing with the group of those Indiana state pensions  and investment funds that are looking to block the deal.  Close to 800 of  the Chrysler's dealers are making their case in court.  They made it  yesterday to put the breaks on the plan.</p><p>For a closer look at the impact of the courtroom battles, Laurie Moncrieff  is the president of Schmald Tool &amp; Die, an auto parts supplier that did  business for Chrysler, and joining us on the phone Jim Anderer, the owner  of Island Jeep in Long Island who is fighting in court to keep his business  open.</p><p>Laurie, don't worry about the people behind you.  I saw you telling people  to keep quiet.  Believe me I do that every single day.  All right Laurie,  tell me first of all, what does this delay mean to you and your business?</p><p>LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE:  The manufacturers have  been feeling the effects of what's been happening in the auto industry for  quite some time.  So quite frankly we're ready to get on with business.</p><p>The markets up here have been largely frozen because of what's going on in  our economy in Michigan with the Detroit three.  So in our opinion, we feel  that moving forward quickly with the bankruptcy would be a help to the  manufacturers.</p><p>GLICK:  And Laurie, explain specifically what it is that you guys do and  sort of where you fit into the food chain here in terms of how this impacts  your business.</p><p>MONCRIEFF:  We do precision machining and make dyes for the auto industry  as well as many other industries.  And quite frankly, all this upheaval is  affecting a lot of industries besides just the auto industry.</p><p>GLICK:  Great point.</p><p>Jim, I know you're joining us by phone.  You've been kind enough to be here  on several occasions.  You're fighting to keep your dealership alive.  You  are one of those who received a pink slip.  Tell me why the delay of this  judgment of this decision could actually help you.</p><p>JIM ANDERER, PRESIDENT, ISLAND JEEP (via telephone):  Hi, Alexis.  Well,  thanks for having me.</p><p>The delay helps me only in regard that it can possibly nix this deal.  This  is a bad deal for the American taxpayer.  It's a bad deal for pretty much  everybody involved, in my opinion.</p><p>I know that the vendor on the other line, you know, has her own agenda, and  I'm sympathetic to that.  But in my personal opinion this is a tragedy  that's taking place in the American marketplace.  It's putting 100,000  people out of work.  It's really devastating to our economy right now.  And  I would like to see it nixed to be honest with you.  I don't think it's a  good deal... </p><p>GLICK:  Ok, so Jim... </p><p>ANDERER:  I think that Fiat is coming into this deal with no cash.  And  it's wrought with a lot of problems.</p><p>GLICK:  Jim, you and I have talked about this before, and you have been in  the courtroom.  In fact you were in the courtroom yesterday speaking on  behalf of those dealers who are being forced to shut down.</p><p>What convinces you that if the deal were not to go through with Fiat, that  a liquidation of Chrysler would put you in a better position than if this  deal were to go through?</p><p>ANDERER:  Very simply that the market forces that would take place is  exactly what should take place.  The market forces would seek their own  level which is the way it should be.</p><p>Ok, what's going on with this taxpayer bailout and all this other stuff?  I  mean, you know, give me a break.  If -- whatever these particular brands  are worth when they're in liquidation would be sold for what they are  worth.</p><p>Ok I'm a stand-alone Jeep store.  Jeep is never going to go away.  It is  going to be picked up by somebody.  And whoever that is, is going to make a  real go of it.  But there's a false propping up of these brands is  insanity.  This is just not the way things should be done in a free  marketplace.</p><p>GLICK:  Laurie, let me switch to you for a moment.  You actually feel that  if they can make it through bankruptcy, that as suppliers, your position  will be that much safer and more secure.  Explain to people why that is.</p><p>LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE:  Well, it's always a lot  more risky to do business with a company prior to bankruptcy than after  bankruptcy so we felt a huge disruption, and quite frankly in the tool and  die industry, we felt a huge disruption for many, many years and we've seen  this coming for many years.</p><p>We've known there's been instability in the market for many years.  We were  somewhat of the canary in the mines frankly in this economy and have been  discussing the problems in tooling and in manufacturing since the early  2000 because we could feel that it was very unstable, and that the economy  was not doing well quite frankly in the early 2002, 2003.</p><p>There were a lot of discussions about the problems in the market.  So while  many of the dealers and other segments of the auto industry quite frankly  probably weren't even aware of the problems we were very much aware of it  in our industry.  </p><p>GLICK:  So Laurie when you look at the current environment, I mean look,  you live in Flint, Michigan.  We're actually going to talk to Virg Bernero  a little bit later on this morning.</p><p>What are people doing right now to either make sure that companies like you  are diversifying your risk or finding other viable job opportunities  because I imagine everything is tightened up in Michigan?  </p><p>MONCRIEFF:  Everything's not only tightened up.  It's frozen in the market  right now.  And it's not just the auto industry, it's the financial markets  are really playing a huge role.  The state of Michigan has been basically  red lined by a lot of banks so lines of credit are being pulled, very much  a big problem with getting financing to operate your business.</p><p>And then even in other industries when you diversify, we're feeling a lot  of difficulty in a lot of other industries that are not even part of the  auto industry because the financial market up in Michigan is frozen, as I  said.  So we're very anxious for the market to be unfrozen, whatever it  takes to do that.</p><p>We need financing.  We need money to start flowing to survive.  That's  basically what we're doing up here in Flint is working very, very hard to  survive this right now.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Well, Laurie, we wish you the very best.  And Jim, you  too.  Thank you guys so much for taking the time to join us this morning.  </p><p>ANDERER:  Thanks, Alexis.  </p><p>MONCRIEFF:  Thank you.  </p><p>GLICK:  Coming up, Countrywide's cofounder Angelo Mozilo charged with fraud  by the SEC.  The Judge is going to join us with his take.  </p><p>And later the Palm Pre hits stores tomorrow.  Will it take a bite out of  Apple's iPhone?  There's a lot of buzz about this.  We're going to tell you  about it in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  In court now, two executives from a defunct Seattle investment  management firm are charged with running what prosecutors call one of the  largest tax fraud schemes ever uncovered in the country.  Quellos founder,  Matthew Krane and CEO Jeffrey Greenstein and two others are charged with  fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.  Prosecutors say they created more  than $1.3 billion in fraudulent losses for clients.  Quellos used to be one  of the world's biggest managers of mutual funds.</p><p>A jury not a judge will hear claims in a case between American  International Group, AIG and Star International, the company controlled by  Maurice Greenberg AIG's former CEO.  The trial will now start June 15th.   There are several lawsuits outstanding between AIG and Mr. Greenberg and  sure wants Star to return AIG stocks and proceeds from stock sales.  AIG  received billions of dollars in federal bailout funds.</p><p>And the Securities and Exchange Commission charges former Countrywide CEO  Angelo Mozilo with fraud and insider trading.  Prosecutors say Mozilo and  two other former executives misled investors about risky lending practices.   The SEC also says Mozilo unloaded $140 million in Countrywide stock using  insider information.  It is the first case against a high-profile executive  stemming from the sub prime mortgage meltdown.  Mozilo has denied any  wrongdoing and his lawyer calls the SEC's allegations baseless.</p><p>Our fox news senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us right  now for a look at the case.  The judge is in the house and he's going to  give us some explanations here.  Judge, good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning  Alexis.  Good to see you.</p><p>GLICK:  surprised by this announcement?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm surprised by this announcement.  I expected -- and that  would be standard operating procedure in a case like this -- an indictment  rather than a civil lawsuit.  This is a civil lawsuit the Securities and  Exchange Commission says you didn't tell your opinion of your own products  to your shareholders, and that caused them to acquire shares ignorant of  what you thought of the products.</p><p>What did he think of them?  Well the SEC got some e-mails, and in that he  referred to his own products as toxic and poison.  Now, that's the bad news  that he said that in these e-mails.  The good news for him is he was not  indicted.  He was not charged with a crime.  The feds may still be  investigating for that purpose.</p><p>But standard operating procedure in cases of fraud and insider trading is  to indict and convict first and then to sue civilly.  So the fact that they  are suing him civilly, they are just looking for money and an order from a  judge that he can never run a public company again.  They are not looking  to take away his freedom, tells me they don't have enough evidence to  indict him or convict him.</p><p>GLICK:  It's interesting because involved in this case also being charged  with this as well is his chief operating officer and the CFO.  All three of  which are saying that number one, it's baseless.  That they did divulge the  proper information throughout the entire reporting process, and they say  look the fact of the matter is the SEC has not done anything right in  years, and they are using them as the poster child for what the SEC should  have done over the past five years.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the SEC's failures is a political argument that the  court will not allow them to make to a jury.  But the court will let them  say this, \"Look, you have accused us of failing to share our opinions with  everyone.  You haven't us accused of failing to share facts.\"</p><p>This is not Enron or WorldCom where inaccurate data was given out.  This is  just a case where an opinion like toxic and poison wasn't shared with the  public.</p><p>GLICK:  Ok, but what is the chance, though, that when you read what the SEC  is suggesting here, that this is brought on to suggest that it is very much  like an Enron case, where they were not divulging material public  information that could have affected decisions of shareholders, investors,  etc.?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is a question of law for the court to decide.  Is it  material information what the CEO's personal opinion is of his products?   These are not facts now.  They didn't hide numbers.  They didn't cook  books.  They just held back these words like toxic and poison.</p><p>Flip side of this is, if this was really insider trading, they would have  indicted him.  But because they haven't indicted him, what it is, is using  insider knowledge to sell; knowledge that anyone else could have gotten had  they looked into the books.  </p><p>GLICK:  Let's bring up one of those e-mails dating back to 2006 because I  want people to hear specifically what he said.  \"In all my years in the  business, I have never seen a more toxic product.\"  That was one e-mail.</p><p>He also sent another e-mail regarding a certain kind of sub prime loan.   And he said \"it is the most dangerous product in existence, and there can  be nothing more toxic.  Loans had been originated through our channels with  disregard for process and compliance with guidelines.\"  This is where he's  talking about the fact that the procedure for getting loans was just way  too simple.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know what the defense is?  \"The government wanted us to do  this and Fannie and Freddie took them off our backs and the shareholders  are no longer at risk.\"  That's the defense that he'll make and that's  true.</p><p>The government did want those subprime loans given out and Fannie and  Freddie did take them off the backs of Countrywide and others.  That is  inappropriate in my view believing in a free market.  That's what the  government did and that's why we have this crisis.</p><p>GLICK:  Let's talk about one of the domino effects here.  There's no doubt  in my mind that Senator Christopher Dodd is climbing in a shell, perhaps in  a bunker, as a result of this.  He was one of those on the sort of Mozilo  list of getting what some argue is a better mortgage.  What do you make of  this for Dodd?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  This is very bad news for Chris Dodd who already is suffering  politically in Connecticut as a result of this.  He's up for reelection in  2010.</p><p>Just as Angelo Mozilo kept from shareholders his opinion of his own  product, Chris Dodd kept from voters the fact that Angelo Mozilo gave him  an absolute sweetheart deal.</p><p>What's the relationship between Chris Dodd and Angelo Mozilo?  Chris Dodd  is the chairman of the senate banking committee which regulates these  things and writes the laws to control them.  And he's accepting an enormous  benefit that the public could never get from the CEO of one of the biggest  companies he's writing the laws to regulate.  The voters of Connecticut  will have their say on this one, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, this is ugly.  And then that whole issue with the AIG, the  wording of the bonuses and the fiscal stimulus package.  Oh my goodness.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Senator Dodd's also deep into that one.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  Judge, thank you very much.  Great seeing you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Happy Friday.  Have a great weekend.  </p><p>GLICK:  Happy Friday.</p><p>Also again I do want to say Mozilo has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer  David Siegel calls the SEC allegations baseless.  As for the other  defendants, they attorney for David Sambol called this \"a baseless  complaint that is a result of the political pressure the SEC is facing for  the well-publicized enforcement failures.\"</p><p>And Eric Sieracki's attorney meanwhile says the SEC's case is \"without  merit.  Countrywide's stock performance was tied to the fortunes of the  real estate and secondary markets for loans.  Something all investors knew  about.\"</p><p>I just wanted to clear up some statements from their attorneys.</p><p>Coming up, Charles Payne offers up his stock choices.</p><p>And President Obama meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel today; the  president reassured the Europeans about the U.S. economy.  We will tell you  what he had to say when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.

France's Transportation Minister says  French forces have found no evidence of an Airbus A-330 airplane that  vanished over the Atlantic.  He's urging extreme prudence about suspected  debris fished from the ocean.  The French Transportation Minister says he  regrets an announcement by Brazilian teams that they had recovered plane  debris from Air France flight 447.  The jetliner was flying from Rio de  Janeiro to Paris; 228 people were on board.  </p><p>AFP is reporting that former vice president Al Gore may be sent to North  Korea to negotiate the release of two American journalists.  Laura Ling and  Euna Lee were arrested on March 17th near the North Korean border on  charges they entered the country illegally and were engaged in hostile  acts.  Both women are reporters for Gore's California-based Current TV.   They each could be sentenced to ten years in a labor camp.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Now back to New York and Charles Payne for a look at the stocks he's  watching -- Charles, I'm listening.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you so much Gavin really  appreciate it.  Well folks it's going to be an exciting day today.   Hopefully we will be to the upside.</p><p>A couple of stocks three stocks we're looking at.  Manitowoc is one.  This  is one of these real hot equipment making stocks that obviously because of  the economy has gotten hit real good.  I think your risk reward now is  really, really nice.  Right here is where it broke the trend line recently.   Now we're looking at a little resistance right around $7.80.</p><p>A break out there and I think you are pretty good.  That takes you right  here, that would be north of 10 buck; a huge percentage play.  I love the  fact that the risk reward is pretty good.  In the March quarter they beat  the street by almost 30 percent.  Maybe that business is turning around.   Certainly, the chart is attractive here.</p><p>Sina, I've probably mentioned this one now at least five times in the last  year.  As you can see, it is really starting to come on here to the point  where it looks extremely, extremely attractive.  This stock is breaking key  resistance.  I love the volume on it.  I think if you don't have any China  stocks, Baidu is my favorite.  A lot of people are afraid to buy a stock  that's almost $300 a share.  This one might have room all the way up to $47  a share.  It is one to take a look at.  It is a reiteration.</p><p>And finally the stock that caught my eye more than any other yesterday.  A  company called Flir.  The chart isn't so hot necessarily, it's been going  down for a long time but I think it's hit a bottom and I think it's on the  cusp of a major breakout.</p><p>By the way, this company has beaten the Street in each of the last four  quarters and each time they beat by a larger margin.  They make imaging  systems for the military and of course for commercial use.  I think the  stock has room to $32 that would be almost 50 percent gain.  I love the way  it looked yesterday.</p><p>By the way, I have one pick on the Web that you have to go and take a look  at today.  Fox Business.com/moneyforbreakfast. </p><p>GLICK:  All right, Mr. Payne, I look forward to it.</p><p>PAYNE:  I'm pumped up about today, I'm hoping under 500,000.  Keep our  fingers crossed.</p><p>GLICK:  Let's hope it is not too bad.  Thank you very much Charles.</p><p>Coming up, we're going to go live to London for a look on how the overseas  markets are trading.  And Palm looking to take a bite out of Apple's bottom  line with its new smart phone called the Pre.  We're going to get a real  live demonstration right here in studio and tell you why there's a lot of  buzz about it.  That's coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, and welcome back to MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.  I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>Coming up: More on a report this morning from \"The Wall Street  Journal\" that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's top  management, including CEO Vikram Pandit.  We're going to see who was  mentioned as a possible replacement.</p><p>And Palm gets ready to release its Pre device tomorrow, looking to  steal some of the success from Apple's iPhone.  We're going to preview it  in just a couple of minutes.</p><p>And what movie could possibly take down Pixar's \"Up\" from the top  spot?  Well, Universal and Warner Brothers have new releases.  We're going  to get those expectations both coming out today.</p><p>And we have the May employment report due out at 8:30.  The  expectation is for a loss of 520,000 jobs.  We'll be live at the Labor  Department.</p><p>And then, coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL\" at 9:35 a.m., I will be  speaking with Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and get her reaction on the First  on FOX to those job numbers.</p><p>All right.  Let's take a look at the futures.  We've been in the  green throughout the morning.  Let's see, are we still in the green?  We  are.  OK, good news.</p><p>We're actually a little bit higher earlier this morning.  The Dow up  41, S&amp;P up 5, NASDAQ up 5 as well.  So, looking pretty good.</p><p>Let's get directly to financial news though -- we got a lot of that  news.  The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in  its boardroom.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be  bounced out.  \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S.  Bancorp CEO, Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job.  The Feds own 34  percent of Citigroup.</p><p>And the FDIC is putting its program to rid the nation's banks of  toxic assets on hold.  The Legacy Loans Program was supposed to begin with  trial sale this month, the FDIC says banks have proven they can raise  private capital without cleansing their balance sheets.  The FDIC says the  program could come back in a different form.</p><p>And the FDIC is very busy today, also shutting down Silverton Bank.   The troubled bank did attract investors from interest or from private  equity guys.  The FDIC says it had to do was cheapest for the insurance  fund and shutting it down was cheaper.  Silverton was not a retail bank.   Most of its customers were actually other banks.</p><p>All right.  Well, we've all been waiting for the big preview.  The  forefather of handheld phone is taking a run at Apple's iPhone to reclaim  the spot as the king of the smartphone on the hill.  Well, Palm will  release its touch-screen Pre device tomorrow, exclusively on the Sprint  network.  And the phone offers a whole slew of slick new features.</p><p>With a look at it in some real details and whether or not it is  going to be the necessary thing to boost Palm -- joining us right now is  Lance Ulanoff.  He's the editor-in-chief of PCMag.com.  And FOX Business  contributor Charles Payne, also WStreet.com founder is here with us as well  to talk about the implications for the stocks of Palm and Apple.</p><p>All right.  Lance, you've got the phone right in front of you.  I'm  very excited about this.  How does it stack up?  What are the things about  the device that look so good?</p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, PC MAGAZINE EDITOR IN CHIEF:  It stacks up pretty  well.  It is Sprint's best smartphone, bar none.  It is gorgeous.  It has  many features you find on iPhone.  It has a touch-screen, so I can add and  drag around applications.</p><p>It has something the iPhone doesn't have, multitasking.  So, if you  are looking at the screen right now, I'm actually going through a bunch of  different things that are running at once.  So, it's a $199 phone after  rebate.  So, it starts at $299.</p><p>But it has something that the -- well, the iPhone doesn't have which  is a QWERTY keyboard.  So, this is one of the things that makes it so  exciting.  And you can use that QWERTY keyboard to do ubiquitous search,  meaning the minute you start to type, it just starts to find whatever is on  the phone.</p><p>One of the ways that it does that is it brings together all of your  contacts from Google, Facebook, Exchange.  It can search there.  It can  search throughout all of that.</p><p>It has a 3-megapixel camera.  It plays video.  And yes, it does have  an accelerometer and what that means is you're going to be able to turn it  to its side and you basically can play -- you can play videos in landscape  mode.</p><p>GLICK:  It looks really -- </p><p>ULANOFF:  It is.</p><p>GLICK:  I'm entrenched.  I'm watching -- </p><p>ULANOFF:  Oh, and, by the way -- and, by the way, it's got a really  loud speaker.</p><p>GLICK:  Wow.  It's really awesome.</p><p>OK.  So, let's talk about the big issue, which is the number of  applications on the phone because I know I happen to have an iPhone.</p><p>ULANOFF:  Right.</p><p>GLICK:  And my kids adore it because it has so many different games  on it.  What are the applications like on this?</p><p>ULANOFF:  Unfortunately, they are not coming out of the gate with a  ton of applications.  Right now, the iPhone has about 40,000 applications.   This is going to start with about 20 or so.  So, it's a -- it is far fewer  and they are not really pushing the capabilities of this phone.</p><p>I've got Connect 4 up here, which is a lot of fun to play.  I can  drop in.  I'm going to lose by the way.  But I can drop in my checkers.   But, except for touching it, you can't really shake it.  You can't turn it  over, shake out the chips, or anything like that.</p><p>There's Fandango.  There's AP News.  There's a NASCAR app, but not a  NASCAR app where you drive a car, you just going to learn about what's  going on if you are interested in NASCAR.</p><p>So, for somebody who's trying to decide between the iPhone and the  Pre, well then, if you care about apps, there might not be much of a  competition -- at least for now.  But we do expect Palm to add in its app  catalog a ton more apps very quickly.</p><p>GLICK:  We are putting if here, Charles, the sort of what we're  calling the tale of the tape here, which is the Palm Pre versus the Apple  iPhone, walking through the carriers, the size of the memory, the screen,  the applications, the cost -- all those things combined.</p><p>A lot of people believe, Charles, that this is do-or-die for Palm.   This is their last opportunity to get out there and dazzle the community.</p><p>How important is it for them, and do you think they are doing what  they need to do?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, there's no doubt that this is  do-or-die.  This is the bottom of 9th, two -- you know, two men out, two  strikes against you, and you got to hit a home run.  You can't hit a base.   You can't bunt this thing.</p><p>The one thing, though, is that Wall Street has bid this stock up  tremendously.  Look at this chart.  It's a mind-boggling move.</p><p>GLICK:  Well, because the buzz on this phone has been very hot.</p><p>PAYNE:  The buzz is hot but it's not like the buzz on the iPhone,  where we saw people standing at midnight at the Apple Store waiting around  in a line.  I mean, this -- when the stock goes from like a buck to 13  bucks, that's huge, you know?  So, ironically, of course, Apple's stock  hasn't suffered too much.</p><p>And that's what I think you got going on here, too, a couple of  things from the market's point of view.  Maybe the smartphone category is  big enough and is growing enough for there to be more than one winner.  And  maybe this won't be an iPhone killer, but perhaps, it will do well enough - - although the stock though, at this point, has had one heck of a move.   And, you know, Wall Street, we get -- </p><p>GLICK:  The Palm's stock or Apple stock?</p><p>PAYNE:  Palm stock.</p><p>GLICK:  OK.</p><p>PAYNE:  Palm stock.  Apple stock is still down from its high,  although it's made a heck of a move recently from the lows of 88, 87.  But  still, I think on Wall Street, we tend to get extremely excited about  things like this and we pump up these stocks.  And I don't know that Palm  can live up -- Palm Pre can live to the hype, at least not initially out of  the gate.</p><p>GLICK:  Lance, you made a facial expression when Charles talked  about demand for the Pre.  I hear that they are not releasing that many,  and so, they think demand will be really hot.</p><p>ULANOFF:  Well, I've heard that too.  The CEO came out and said they  might not be a lot of them out there.  But I've also heard that there will  be people waiting on lines, that there already is some guy waiting out  there.  And there are people who are telling me they are going to try and  get it on Saturday because they are afraid there won't be enough at each  store.  But I have to say, Sprint has been working on this a long time.   I'd be shocked if there aren't enough of these Pres to go around.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, I mean, it's interesting Walter Mossberg, you know,  from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he wrote a whole piece on it as well, and  it was interesting to hear some of his points of view because a lot of  people are looking to next week with Apple -- to see whether or not they  are going to come out with a new iPhone.  They are going to dazzle us,  because a lot of their initial two-year contracts are set to expire coming  up this summer.  So, if they come out with one, this could be perfectly  timed.</p><p>How crucial is it -- and, Lance, will Steve Jobs show up?</p><p>ULANOFF:  We're all talking about that.  You know, Wozniak, his  former co-founder said he looked robust which is great news.  We always  expect surprises from Apple at every one of these major events.  But I  think this is going to be unique, because the third thing -- Steve Jobs has  this habit in these events of going one more thing and he pulls it out of  his back pocket.</p><p>I think the one more thing at this event is Steve Jobs.  You have  announcement, announcement -- Steve Jobs walks out with whatever the new  iPhone is.  I really think that could happen because he is a showman.  He  knows how to pull something like this thing off.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.</p><p>ULANOFF:  And there's going to be hot product out there.  I don't  know what it is, but it doesn't diminish what Palm has accomplished with  the Pre, because I have to tell you -- this is a home run.</p><p>GLICK:  You know, Charles, Tim Cook had done a terrific job in the  role . </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>GLICK:  . of Steve Jobs obviously left in terms of running day-to- day operations.  The stock is up 68 percent versus NASDAQ, which is up a  little bit over 20 percent since left due to health concerns in January.</p><p>What will this mean if he does come back for Apple's stock?</p><p>PAYNE:  Oh, it's a cherry on top of it.  But more than that -- you  know, listen, I don't think there's a CEO that's so identified with this  company as Steven Jobs is with Apple.  And listen, Apple already, early  this morning, is indicating it's going to be up 3 or 4 points at the open  today.  And this is ahead of the Pre coming out tomorrow.</p><p>So, there's a lot of excitement about Steve Jobs coming in and doing  something spectacular.</p><p>GLICK:  We didn't even get to Sprint and AT&amp;T and Verizon.  There's  too much to talk about.  But it looks so cool.  It really does.</p><p>PAYNE:  By the way, I think this is more important -- it might be as  equally as important for Sprint as it is . </p><p>GLICK:  As it is for Palm.</p><p>PAYNE:  Palm -- absolutely.</p><p>GLICK:  Great point.  Lance, thank you very much for breaking it in.</p><p>ULANOFF:  It's a pleasure.</p><p>GLICK:  You must be having fun with that.</p><p>ULANOFF:  I am.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK:  He is grinning from ear to ear with this phone.</p><p>ULANOFF:  I still want to keep it.</p><p>GLICK:  OK.  The control room would like you to go visit them  because there are several purchasers, including my executive producer, who  wants to buy that immediately.</p><p>ULANOFF:  I'm taking bids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK:  OK.</p><p>All right.  Coming up: We'll check the latest news headlines.  And  Warner Brothers is looking to cash in on a major hangover this weekend.   We're going to preview the weekend box-office when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GREY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.  I'm Gavin Grey in London with a look at this morning's top news  stories.</p><p>House Republican leaders are suggesting more than $23 billion in  budget cuts.  Overall, the proposal includes cuts in no less than 37  programs.  One example is eliminating transportation enhancements and this  measure alone would save $833 million a year.  It would take place over the  next five years.  The plan has been sent now to the White House.</p><p>And the State Supreme Court in South Carolina is ordering the  state's governor to accept federal bailout money.  Mark Sanford had refused  to take the money designated to South Carolina over the next two years.   But this court decision ends months of wrangling with legislators who  accused him of playing politics with people's lives.  Sanford says he will  not appeal the decision and plans to sign the paperwork on Monday.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the FOX Business Network.  Now, let's get back  to New York and Alexis Glick.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>My favorite topic, let's get right to sports business right now.   Star architect Frank Gehry won't be working on the $4 billion Atlantic  Yards project in Brooklyn, New York, anymore.  Developer brace Ratner is  trying to trim $200 million in costs.  Ellerbe Becket will take his place.</p><p>Ratner is blaming the economic downturn and litigation being brought  on by project opponents.  Ratner hopes to have the new arena opened for the  New Jersey Nets by 2010, 2011.</p><p>The Big Unit joins baseball 300-win club.  Pitcher Randy Johnson  becoming only the 24th pitcher in history to win 300 games as the San  Francisco Giants beat the Washington Nationals five to one.  Johnson who is  45 years old has pitched for 16 in a 22-year career.  Incredible.</p><p>And Charles Hayward, the president and CEO of the New York Racing  Association said the absence of Rachel Alexandra would likely cost the  Belmont Stakes significantly in attendance.  With Rachel Alexandra in the  race, Hayward estimated a crowd of between 80,000 to 90,000.  Without her,  he believes the crowd will be 50,000 to 60,000.  Last year, when Big Brown  was going for the Triple Crown, the attendance was 94,476.</p><p>Speaking of which, here now with a little preview of Belmont Stakes  is FOX News reporter Rick Leventhal, who is live in Belmont Park.</p><p>Rick, pretty cool thing to be doing.  I'm jealous.  What's it  looking like for tomorrow?</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, don't be too jealous  because we're getting rained on right now.  Attendance is near zero by the  way because there's no races going on.  However, Chip Woolley, the trainer  of Mine That Bird you probably recognize from the Kentucky Derby is kind  enough to join us for an exclusive one-on-one.</p><p>Now, they are saying attendance may be done because Rachel Alexandra  who won the Preakness isn't running this race.  You said that you believe  that's possible?</p><p>CHIP WOOLLEY, MINE THAT BIRD TRAINER:  Sure, she's a great filly and  it would be good for in racing in general if she was here.  But, in this  game, you have to do what's best for the horse.  And if they didn't feel  like it was a best thing for her, it's better they don't run her.</p><p>And that, you know, racing -- racing will take care of itself.  But  we have to -- the horses have to come first.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  Mine That Bird finished at close second to Rachel  Alexandra.  Are you disappointed that you didn't have a chance at a rematch  on this longer track?</p><p>WOOLLEY:  You know, a little bit disappointed I suppose.  Really, I  mean, it's -- for me, it's better she's not in here because that's one less  horse you have to beat.  And let's face it.  If you don't have to beat  them, you don't want to, you know?  You want to limit the field to who you  run at.  So, I don't mind her not being here.</p><p>She's a great filly and you got to respect her a lot.  So, really,  for me, it's probably better she's not in for the racing game.  It might be  better that she would be here.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  Your horse was on the track.  It still is, I believe, on  the track?</p><p>WOOLLEY:  It just went off.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  It just went off.  So, you just watched the horse  working out in these conditions, which hopefully tomorrow, it will be sunny  and drier.  But how -- but how does Mine That Bird look today?</p><p>WOOLLEY:  He looked great this morning.  Just got over the ground  really, really well.  So we're real happy with where we're at.  It looks  like we got in here in good shape.  And we're looking forward to running.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  You said he looked like a million bucks.</p><p>WOOLLEY:  At least a million.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  That's the purse.</p><p>WOOLLEY:  Yes, sir.  Hopefully, we can get some of it, and  hopefully, he'll have his best race in him tomorrow.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  So, Chip, if I were a betting man -- which I might be,  by the way -- would you suggest I put money on your horse?</p><p>WOOLLEY:  I will never make a suggestion like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  Chip Woolley, the trainer of Mine That Bird -- thanks so  much for being with us.  And get well soon.</p><p>WOOLLEY:  Nice to meet you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  All right.  Nice to meet you, too.  So, that's the  story.</p><p>And here's another look at Belmont Park and the track, which is very  muddy.  But again, they are expecting sunshine tomorrow.  And if you were  on the fence about whether to come here or not, I'm told there will be  sunny skies and it should be a great day for racing.</p><p>GLICK:  If you were a betting man, is that the cat calling the  kettle black or what?</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  I didn't want to come out and say it, but, you know, I  might put a couple dollars on the race.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Rick, I'll e-mail you later to do the same for  me.  Great interview.  Thanks so much for seeing you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  OK.  I look forward to it.  Thank you.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Coming up: We're going to give you the box  office preview for the weekend.</p><p>And this weekend, once again, you can pitch your business idea to a  venture capitalist live right here on the FOX Business Network.  Start  emailing your pitches at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:YourMoney@FOXBusiness.com\">YourMoney@FOXBusiness.com</email>  Lucky ones will get to  sell their idea live on-air during on \"Your Questions, Your Money\" with  Dagen McDowell and Robert Gray this Saturday, 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.</p><p>Stay with us.  Movies -- coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  This weekend, Will Ferrell is going to be battling  dinosaurs, bugs and one massive headache.  The PG-13 time travel comedy,  \"Land of the Lost\" from General Electric's Universal Pictures is going  against Warner Brothers \"The Hangover,\" an R-rated bachelor party that  shows what happens in Las Vegas may leave you with a tiger, a baby, and a  missing groom.  Yes, that's right.</p><p>Here to tell us how the films will do and if either of them can  capture the upward mobility of Walt Disney's-Pixar's \"Up,\" joining me right  now is Bradley Jacobs.  He is the senior editor of \"Us Weekly.\"</p><p>Good morning, Bradley.  Good to see you.</p><p>BRADLEY JACOBS, US WEEKLY SENIOR EDITOR:  Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK:  No, wait a second.  Is \"Hangover\" PG-13 or R?</p><p>JACOBS:  That's definitely R-rated.</p><p>GLICK:  OK.</p><p>JACOBS:  R-rated movie.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, because -- OK, because I heard there's a lot of  profanity.  I just wasn't sure if it was -- OK.  Anyhow, I was saying to  you before that I was at the movies yesterday evening, and I came out and  there were these massive lines down the block.  I understand there were  midnight showings of \"Hangover.\"  What's the buzz?</p><p>JACOBS:  It had some of the best buzz of the year.  You know, for a  movie with no big stars, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, the concept is really  key here.  Four guys, a bachelor party that goes wrong, a missing groom,  there's a baby in the mix.  There's a stripper in the mix.</p><p>I saw it a couple of weeks ago.  I really loved it.  I think it is  going to be hugely successful.  R-rated summer movies are kind of the rare  thing.  So, you got -- you got the college students, you got -- </p><p>GLICK:  That's why I said, \"Are you sure it's R, are you sure it's  not PG-13\"?</p><p>JACOBS:  I am absolutely sure.</p><p>GLICK:  Are you sure?</p><p>JACOBS:  I am doubly sure that \"Land of the Lost\" is PG-13, and  that's more of a kids' movie although it's PG-13.  So, it's not really for  4-year-olds, it's not really for 6-year-olds.  It's sort of, you know, for  people in the PG-13 era, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds.</p><p>I think the battle between these two is really interesting.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, it is interesting.  I do want to bring in Harry Medved,  also from Fandango.com.</p><p>Because, Harry, I know you've been looking at \"The Land of the Lost\"  pre-sales (ph) and there are just completely non-existent.  Bradley was  telling me the reviews are just horrific.</p><p>You tell me, Harry, what did they get wrong with \"Land of the Lost\"?   Will anybody go see it?</p><p>HARRY MEDVED, FANDANGO.COM:  Well, you know, people are saying on  Fandango, the user reviews are saying it's perfect for 13 year olds of all  ages, especially if you're for bathroom humor, because it is PG-13.  But  there's plenty of dinosaur manure, dinosaur urine, masturbation jokes and  frequent uses of the S-word for any 13-year-old to wallow in.</p><p>Now, parents may not be too excited about it.  But at least it's not  the R-rated comedy of \"The Hangover\" that Bradley was just talking about.</p><p>GLICK:  But, Bradley, look, this is box-office projections for these  movies that are coming out of here.  And \"Land of the Lost\" is getting  some, you know, at least some decent -- I mean, not great, but decent  projections.  Is that because of Will Ferrell, you know, you just -- </p><p>JACOBS:  Will Ferrell is a huge star.  They run commercials  everywhere, marketing everywhere for this film.  They just want to get  butts in seats in the first few days before the word really spreads about  it.</p><p>But I actually think those productions may be wrong and you could  see \"Hangover\" end up number two this weekend.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  I mean, I was saying to you . </p><p>JACOBS:  I do, too.</p><p>GLICK:  I was saying to you before, like, oh, my God, I had never  seen a movie marketed more than this one, oh my goodness.  OK.  How does  this stack up against up, against \"Star Trek\"?  You know, we had some big  blockbusters last summer.  You know, who turns out to be the big ones this  summer?</p><p>JACOBS:  Well, \"Up\" had a huge weekend last weekend, and I wouldn't  be surprised if \"Up\" were number one again this weekend.  It would be the  first time in more than a year that an animated movie has been number one  two weekends in a row.  But \"Up,\" you have that magic thing where the  critics love it and audiences love it -- which is very rare.</p><p>I saw it here in 3-D last weekend.  I want to see it again.  And I  think that there is incredible word of mouth for that film, because it's  one of those things where you can take your family.  You can take kids.   You can take teenagers.  You can take your friend.</p><p>You know, it's really in that magical place.  So, I think that will  be number one.</p><p>MEDVED:  You know -- </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, Harry, go quickly.</p><p>MEDVED:  I'm not sure you want to take kids under 6 years old,  because there are some terrifying elements to \"Up.\"  Now, on Fandango,  that's the place where people buy advanced tickets, we are seeing that \"Up\"  is leading the way for ticketing this weekend, it's about 42 percent of all  tickets sold on Fandango.</p><p>GLICK:  Wow.</p><p>MEDVED:  But \"The Hangover\" is gaining momentum.  There was a surge  of tickets last night.  Those people you saw online last night, Alexis,  they're all across the country.  Thursday midnight shows were sold out last  night.</p><p>I went to one last night and people came out of the theater saying,  \"I want to see `The Hangover' again.\"</p><p>GLICK:  Wow.</p><p>MEDVED:  So, I think you will be surprised.  \"Hangover\" will not be  number two.  I think it will be number one.</p><p>GLICK:  I have to leave it there, Harry and Bradley.  I know what  I'm doing this weekend if only I could get a baby-sitter.  Gentlemen, thank  you very much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>JACOBS:  Thank you.</p><p>GLICK:  We'll be right back.  We're going to do a roundtable on jobs  as jobs numbers are due out in half hour.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Good morning and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm  Alexis Glick.  </p><p>We're about 30 minutes way from the release of the May employment report.   Expectations are for a loss of another 520,000 jobs, sending the  unemployment rate to 9.2 percent.  We are live at the U.S. Labor Department  in Washington, D.C., to break down those numbers.  </p><p>Also, Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is going to join us for his  analysis on those numbers.  And Roger Ballou, the CDI Corp. CEO, is going  to join me to break it all down.  </p><p>And news this morning that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's  top management, including perhaps CEO Vikram Pandit.  We're going to get  into those details in just a moment.</p><p>And on the jobs front, speaking of which, I will be talking to the labor  secretary coming up later this morning on \"The Opening Bell\" at just about  9:35 a.m. Eastern Time.  We'll get Hilda Solis' point of view on the jobs.  </p><p>Let's look at the markets, though.  We're in the green.  We're at the highs  of the morning.  Dow up 45.  S&amp;P up 5.  Nasdaq up 5 as well.  So across the  board we're up about 0.5 percent.</p><p>All right, let's get a look at the markets.  We have business contributor  Gavin Gray and Connell McShane.  Let's start with Connell.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Alexis, thanks very much.</p><p>As you said, we are trading higher ahead of the open this morning and  ahead, more importantly, of the jobs report because when you think about  it, all things can change here half an hour from now.  So, you know, and  that's all we're going to be talking about a half an hour from now.  So let  me give you a couple of stocks individually to watch.  Either way, no  matter what the jobs report comes out at, these are going to be stocks to  watch.  </p><p>Apple, right behind me, is definitely one of them.  There's a report in  \"The Wall Street Journal\" about Steve Jobs this morning.  Look at it going  from below $144 to almost $147 in pre-market trading.  So a nice little  boost.  The report in \"The Journal\" is Jobs is on track to come back on the  job as the CEO there after taking medical leave by the end of the month.   And there's even some speculation in that \"Journal\" article that he comes  back earlier.  </p><p>The big developer's conference next week.  The Palm Pre coming out over the  weekend.  The speculation, and again this might be getting ahead of  ourselves, is that Jobs maybe comes back ahead of schedule in order to  announce a new iPhone.  Either way, a lot of optimism about Apple.  </p><p>One other quick stock to watch, a company called Quanta Services.  PWR is  the ticker on it.  It is going to take the place of Ingersoll Rand in the  S&amp;P 500.  So Quanta, again, a power company that -- the index fund managers  are going to have to buy this stock.  It was up after hours. Ingersoll, by  the way, is reincorporates itself.  It's going to have its base in Ireland.   With a name like Connell McShane, there's not (ph) any problem with having  your base in Ireland.  But the S&amp;P doesn't like that because you're  supposed to be based in the United States.  They make the exception for  Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, which is where Quanta -- where Ingersoll was  based before that.  So they were allowed to be in the S&amp;P.  Now they're  leaving.  Quanta takes its place.  There you have it.  </p><p>Gavin Gray over in Europe with a look at those overseas markets for us now.</p><p>Gavin, take it away.  </p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Connell, thanks very much indeed.  I'm sure  they'll make an exception for you, as you say.</p><p>Looking at the European markets, in Asia it was a 1 percent club today.  It  is in Europe as well pretty much.  Starting off with the FTSE here in  London.  All waiting on announcements about Gordon Brown and his reshuffle.   But up 1.5 percent at 67 points, 4,454.  The CAC 40 in Paris, 3,347, up 35  points.  The DAX hardly shifting at all today.  Up just 33 points or 0.65  percent.</p><p>And despite that reshuffle in the U.K. cabinet, today we're getting details  coming through in bits and pieces.  Gordon Brown's position as prime  minister really does remain in jeopardy.  Some of the newspaper headlines  today really damaging.  Comes after four cabinet members have resigned in  just four days, causing many politicians to question whether Mr. Brown has  enough authority to continue at the head of the British government.  </p><p>One thing we now believe is really pretty certain is the chancellor, the  money man, the treasurer, Alistair Darling.  He has apparently told Gordon  Brown, I say as chancellor or I'm out.  And we do think that he is going to  stay as chancellor.  </p><p>All this political uncertainty has been weighing heavily on the British  pound.  It slid against the dollar in recent days.  Today it is down  against both the dollar and the euro.  And $1.61 will buy you one pound.   And the dollar against the euro, though, is down, and $1.41 will buy you a  euro.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.  </p><p>GLICK: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.  </p><p>Well, we could see the unemployment rate climb to 9.2 percent this morning  with the release of the Labor Department's May employment report.  Now  while that rate may be up, job cuts may be down for the second month in a  row with an estimated 520,000 job losses last month versus 539,000 lost in  April.  March, 699,000.  Now, states are getting their hands on some of the  $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help create  employment opportunities.  Is that enough?  And what are state and local  leaders doing right now with that money to create jobs? </p><p>Here's my take.  Number one, we need to basically stem the tide on the job  front and figure out what we're doing to address private sector jobs,  particularly those that are created by small businesses.  Number two, will  the work -- will the work programs -- will they ultimately work to retain  enough people?  Those worker training programs.  And number three, concern  that the stimulus package is ultimately not enough to help the jobs  situation.  Perhaps time is the only cure.  But keep in mind that the  underemployed numbers are much more disconcerting and you've got to make  sure you look at the big picture, not just the unemployed.  </p><p>Joining me right now is Mayor Virg Bernero of Lansing, Michigan, Mayor R.T.  Rybak of Minneapolis, and Steve Crowley, the host of \"American Scene\" radio  program and the financial TV program \"Wall Street Cast.\"</p><p>Good morning, everybody.  Good to see you guys.  </p><p>STEVE CROWLEY, \"AMERICAN SCENE\" RADIO HOST: Thank you, Alexis.  Thanks very  much.  This is great (ph).</p><p>GLICK: All right, Mayor Bernero, let me start with you.  Let me walk  through some of the numbers here.  The unemployment rate, as you know, in  Michigan, the highest in the country, 12.9 percent.  I understand you can  get a little less than $4 billion in the stimulus.  Is it enough to help  create and save jobs?  What are you doing? </p><p>MAYOR VIRG BERNERO, (D) LANCING, MICHIGAN: Well, look, a lot of it is going  into infrastructure.  It's going into roads.  It's going into retraining of  workers.  We're trying to get a business incubator up and going to generate  new ideas and for business startups.  </p><p>But, look, we've talked about this for months.  The best stimulus is a  stimulating job.  People need jobs.  They want long-term security.  And so  the temporary help is great.  We appreciate that.  But we need to restore  health in the economy.  </p><p>And, you know, Lansing dodged a bullet.  We were very fortunate not to have  any plant closures with GM.  In fact, our factories may get a little more  work.  But still, in the long run, we need a healthy auto industry.  We  need to make sure that we're making the cars of the future in places like  Lansing, Michigan.  </p><p>And I think the economy, in terms of people starting to buy again, I mean  they want that long-term future.  And when you talk about retraining, I'm  all for the retraining, but I've got e-mails from people all over the  country that say, you know, I've been retrained two or three times and the  job is eliminated.  And so what are we going to retrain them in? </p><p>And you and I have talked about this.  We need to have manufacturing.  I'm  not giving up.  I don't think we can be a post manufacturing society.  I  think we have to find a way that we have manufacturing in this country,  advanced manufacturing, and that means leveling the playing field on trade.   Until we do that, we're not going to have a permanent recovery.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes, I mean, Mayor Rybak, I'm concerned about the training efforts  too.  I mean that's what I keep hearing as one of the cures to solve the  problem here.  And I'm concerned that it's not really going to truly impact  job creation.  It's great to learn a lot of other, you know, things to do  and skills to have, but at the end of the day, it's not a job.  </p><p>MAYOR R.T. RYBAK, (D) MINNEAPOLIS: Well, I totally agree with your point.   I will say that in the middle of a recession, education and training is --  if you're ever going to do it, it's a good time to do it.  </p><p>But first and foremost, we didn't just wake up to the retraining issue when  the economy went south.  We've been doing it for a number of years.  When I  took office, unemployment was 1 percent higher in the city than in the  suburbs.  Today it's lower in the city than the rest of the region.  Very  few cities can say that.  The reason is because we've been in an ongoing  training effort for hard to employ people.  </p><p>Now when you hit a period of time like this, it's a big challenge.  You  have two things.  You have, one, the fact that there are a lot of people  who are out of work.  So, for instance, some of the key construction  trades, up to half the people will be sitting on the bench.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we know that coming up is going to be a new economy that's going  to be based a lot on clean energy, including some of the weatherization  work that really takes skilled workers.  So we have this tough problem of  needing workers in the future, but if you train them for trades where  there's high unemployment, you have a problem.  I spent all yesterday  morning meeting with trades and other folks trying to talk about that tough  issue.  </p><p>We do, however, have to say, you've got to create a job at the end of it.   So we've put a lot of our stimulus dollars into creating those new clean  energy jobs.  We've put some significant investment into solar, trying to  make sure that works.  We are training people to do solar installation.   We're training them to do green roof installation and are putting  incentives in it to create more green roofs.  </p><p>Now those are not going to bring back the manufacturing base of America.   And I agree with the mayor very much so.  I'm not giving up on making  things in America.  </p><p>I just got back from China.  And part of what we need to do as well is to  tap into a global economy.  We brought a Danish med tech firm into  Minneapolis and it's now moved into its headquarters here, 600 new jobs.   That's part of it too.  </p><p>But you have to home grow the economy.  You have to be part of global  economy.  And you have to have trained workers.  There's no one easy fix.  </p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>Steve, you talk to people every single day . . .</p><p>CROWLEY: We do.  </p><p>GLICK: Nationally syndicated radio show.  What are people saying to you  about the jobs environment? </p><p>CROWLEY: Well, sometimes you can't get a job in your local area.  Sometimes  people have to move.  We talked to one person who was a CPA/MBA, couldn't  get a job in south Florida.  If they would move to Houston, there's plenty  of jobs.  There's a shortage of CPA/MBAs.  So sometimes you do have to  retrain, go back to school.  People that learn Chinese right now can get a  job, I guarantee you.  </p><p>GLICK: So, you know, Steve, you've been doing this for a very long time.   Have you ever seen anything like this? </p><p>CROWLEY: No.  No one has really seen anything like this.  You have to go  back to the '30s, you know, to really see something like this.  This is an  unbelievable time in American history.  But I think it's getting a lot  better.  I think 12 to 18 months from now the market is predicting that the  jobs market is going to be better.  </p><p>GLICK: You know . . .</p><p>BERNERO: Let me say, Alexis, what's happened is the . . .</p><p>GLICK: Yes, Mayor Bernero, go ahead.</p><p>BERNERO: The chickens have come home to roost on this free trade.  We've  had unfettered free trade.  It's unilateral, economic disarmament.  And the  last speaker, you know, I appreciate -- I hope he's right that things turn  around, but there's a complete disconnect between the stock market, between  Wall Street and main street, because most of the production in this country  has been shipped overseas.  We've taken the P out of GDP, Gross Domestic  Product.  We've replaced it with a C.  We have Gross Domestic Consumption.  </p><p>And we have move so much with these unfair trade policies.  We've moved so  much of our production overseas that what you can see is the stock market  can recover, I think, because the production, most of it's overseas.  And  when you ship it to Malaysia and China and you can pollute the environment  and exploit the workers and pay a lot less, I guess Wall Street can make  more, but main street is hurting.  And I don't see that turning around  until we find a way to bring these jobs back to the United States.  </p><p>And it's not that these jobs evaporated.  That's a myth that these  manufacturing jobs just evaporated into the air because of technology.  Not  at all.  We have these jobs here in Lansing.  The new factories are  wonderful.  They are robotic.  And we have workers in them.  </p><p>But more and more of these high-tech, high-advanced manufacturing jobs are  going to places like Mexico and China.  And we've got to find a way to  reverse that and have fair trade that favors American workers, that allows  American workers to compete fairly.  </p><p>GLICK: Mayor Rybak, he raise as very important point.  Several states are  doing what they can to incentivize overseas operations to move here to the  United States, or incentivize U.S. companies who garner the lions share of  their revenues from international operations to stay in the United States.   But does that then raise a question of protectionism? </p><p>RYBAK: Well, I don't think the issue is protectionism as much as trying to  home grow an economy.  I mean, look, there are ways to ship jobs from  overseas.  But the thing Americans have always done is they've created the  job in the first place.  We're an incubator of innovation.  And if we  continue to incubate, then we can have not only the ideas, but the  manufacturing here.  </p><p>Now an example is, we're putting some of our stimulus dollars into helping  a company called Ken Kay Solar (ph).  It's a new approach to doing solar  that will hopefully make it cheaper to put it into homes.  So that's a  brain power idea.  But we need to also make sure that the person power  that's making it is done here as well.  </p><p>I think there's a really important moment when American ingenuity then  creates a product.  We do that well and will continue to do that well.  The  point is, is once that product is ready to be made, that we have to make it  here at home.  </p><p>I think the mayor made a good point in this whole issue of the unfair  competition of labor costs.  As I say, I was in China.  They're doing some  wonderful things.  But I sure as heck don't want my cousin or my  constituent getting some of the wages that are being paid over there.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes, right.  </p><p>RYBAK: So I think we need to certainly level the playing field, but also  recognize, hey, look, this is America.  We're not on our knees.  We know  what we're doing.  And we've done great things.  And we're going to do them  again.  Let's just get back to the basics of invention, incubation and  manufacturing.  We can do this.  </p><p>GLICK: You know, we heard yesterday some bright spots.  We heard about Wal- Mart hiring 22,000 people.  </p><p>CROWLEY: That's right.</p><p>GLICK: We've heard a couple of other companies start to say that they're  beginning to hire again.  That they're beginning to spend again.  You and I  yesterday talked about, you know, the ordering of jets and things of that  nature.  </p><p>CROWLEY: Right.  </p><p>GLICK: Are we starting to see those signs of life?  Are they starting to  suggest perhaps a bottom? </p><p>CROWLEY: I think it will all start with a good glimmer of hope, don't you?   But I -- you know, I really believe the small businesses, the nation's job  maker, net/net, Alexis, all new jobs are created by small business.  Apple  Computer and Microsoft started as small businesses and now employ a lot of  people.  </p><p>But a lot of companies that employ fewer than 50 people are now starting to  see the light.  We're getting reports back that the CEOs of these smaller  companies are saying, yes, business is picking up.  We're starting to bring  in our old employees that we let go.  And people who we cut down to 20, 30  hours a week, we're bringing back to 40 hours a week.  </p><p>So I think that's where the new jobs are going to be created.  And even  like cities like Lansing, which is a small business community too, I think  that's where the real job generation is going to happen.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes, you know, Mayor Bernero, I'm going to talk to the labor  secretary coming up in the next hour and the thing that worries me is that  the small business community, as Steve points out, which is something I  talked in one of my talking points, is essential for private sector jobs.   And what we saw in the last report is private sector jobs got hit so  tremendously.  Are we doing enough to help small businesses? </p><p>BERNERO: Look, look, number one, I mean, I just want to say, with all due  respect, you know, you help prove my point with the Wal-Mart.  I mean GM  lays off 20,000 high-paying, top of the line, top of the food chain  manufacturing jobs.  Twenty thousand.  Wal-Mart's hiring 20,000.  </p><p>It's the Wal-Martization of our economy and that's part of what's killing  us.  I mean that's great that Wal-Mart's hiring, that will give some hope,  but you're taking basically $26, $28 an hour jobs and going down to I don't  know what Wal-Mart pays, you know, $10 maybe if you're lucky.  So this is  part of the problem.  </p><p>Now as far as small business goes, one problem is the banking.  We've  helped banks at the top.  OK.  And, look, I'm not bashing Obama here.  I  mean the guy has inherited a mess and he's doing an admirable job with it.  </p><p>But we've helped banks at the top.  It hasn't trickled down to the  community banks.  The community banks, Steve's right, the small businesses  where the growth is, we all know that, there can't be any growth because  nobody can get a loan.  The community banks have been shut out.  While the  banks in Wall Street are getting help, the community banks, you know what  they're getting?  More regulation from FDIC.  They're getting tighter  regulations, tighter standards.  They're not getting any help.  And the  community banks weren't even part of the problem.  </p><p>So this has got to be addressed by the administration.  The community banks  are being strangle held and they're the ones that are -- that know the  people, that know the communities and know where the money should be given.   And they didn't do anything wrong.  They weren't involved in all the  chicanery that Wall Street was, but they're getting punished by the FDIC.   So this insanity has got to stop.  We need our community banks help.  </p><p>But the other thing, I want to just tell you, the small businesses are  hurting.  I've got e-mails and I've got people in my community, the small - - I can show you letters from union presidents and company presidents,  small business presidents, that sound just the same.  Main street America  is hurting.  Because when you wipe out manufacturing, you wipe out a lot of  the small businesses.  When I hear people say we're a service economy, what  are we going to service?  These small businesses are hurting because as so  much manufacturing has left, the small businesses -- of course we're in  Michigan.  I mean a lot of our small businesses were auto related, tool and  dye and this sort of thing.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes.  </p><p>BERNERO: They're hurting.  And I think this is true all across the country,  though.  You've had furniture makers and all sorts of small businesses that  are struggling to survive.  Again, I hate to sound like a one-note Nelly  (ph), but with that foreign competition.  </p><p>GLICK: You are incredible.  </p><p>Mayor Rybak, I just have to ask you the last question.  Are you going to  run for governor? </p><p>RYBAK: Oh, I -- we'll figure that out tomorrow.  But I want to say that  going back to the point of . . .</p><p>GLICK: Oh, we'll figure it out tomorrow.  You're -- the governor of your  state is saying that he's going to run -- he's going to go for the White  House.  </p><p>RYBAK: Well, he's going to get his butt kicked by Barack Obama, but that's  another thing.  </p><p>The point of the matter is . . .</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>RYBAK: I want to talk about jobs here.  </p><p>The point of the matter is, I absolutely strongly agree with the point that  was just being made about make things in America.  I do want to say,  though, that when you hear that a retail company is adding jobs, we don't  just want people behind the cash register, but speaking from the  headquarters of Target and Best Buy here in Minneapolis, some phenomenal  jobs are in that sector.  </p><p>But the other thing that happens in the economy in a period of time like  this is that as people go into transition, as sadly people leave a job and  try to figure out what to do next, you do have innovation.  And I think  that's one of the things we've got to work with, with the lending  community, and that is where sometimes the public sector needs to spur  innovation.  Someone leaves a company.  They get fired.  They get laid off.   They start to think about it.  They talk with their friend about what  they've always wanted to do.  This is when the new American jobs get  created.  </p><p>Now we can't be in la-la land about this.  They've got to make things too.   But I think innovation will help us at this point.  </p><p>GLICK: All right, sounds like the role of governor looks appealing.</p><p>All right, Mayor Rybak, thank you so much.  Mayor Bernero, and Steve,  gentlemen, thank you very much.  </p><p>All right, guys, we're going to take a quick break.  We've got the jobs  data coming out in just about 12 minutes.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Checking financial news now.</p><p>The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in its  boardroom.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be  bounced out.  \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S.  Bancorp CEO Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job.  The feds, of  course, own 34 percent of Citigroup.  </p><p>And the FDIC putting its program to rid the nation's banks of toxic assets  on hold.  The legacy loans program was supposed to begin with a trial sale  this month.  The FDIC says banks have proven they can raise private capital  without cleansing their balance sheets.  Therefore, the FDIC says the  program could come back later on in different form.  </p><p>And the FDIC is very busy today.  Also shutting down Silverton Bank.  The  troubled bank did attract interest from private equity folks, but the FDIC  said it had to do what was cheapest for the insurance fund and ultimately  shutting it down was cheaper.  Silverton was not a retail bank. Most of its  customers were actually other banks.  </p><p>All right.  Let's go over to Charles Payne and take a look at the Fox 50.  </p><p>Charles.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, thanks a lot, Alexis.  </p><p>Well, as you said, Citigroup, Apple, and Intel, they're all Fox 50 stocks  and they're all making news this morning.  Former Barclay's (ph) capital  investment manager and financial analyst Vn Man (ph), he joins us now to  break them all down.</p><p>And let's talk about this Citi thing because I don't think it's news that a  lot of people want to see Vikram Pandit go.  The bigger story here seems to  be Sheila Bair versus Timothy Geithner and the FDIC not only saying we want  to be in this game, we actually want more power.</p><p>VN MAN, FMR. BARCLAY'S CAPITAL INVESTMENT MANAGER: Yes, absolutely.  I mean  the -- what's going on here is the FDIC is essentially trying to get more  power than the comptroller.  But, you know, not since the days of Howard  Stern fighting the FCC have we seen government versus the private sector.   I mean this is really turning into a soap opera.  </p><p>On one hand you've got Sheila Bair and she interrupted kind of Citigroup's  ideas in the past.  I don't know if you recall when she actually -- when  Citigroup was trying to buy Wachovia and then Wells Fargo swept in there  and bought Wachovia instead.  And Sheila Bair backed Wells Fargo.  And so,  you know, there's kind of this struggle between . . .</p><p>PAYNE: There's definitely a power struggle going on there.  </p><p>Let's talk about Apple here.  </p><p>MAN: OK.</p><p>PAYNE: Big, big news.  Obviously tomorrow the Pre comes out.  But the  bigger news for folks on the Apple stock is that Steve Jobs is coming back.   And it always feels like Caesar returning to Rome.  So much excitement.   The stock is indicating it will open higher here.  What do you think is  going to happen?</p><p>MANN: You know, everybody -- me included -- everybody wants to know they  work for the best and the brightest.  And Steve Jobs, he's not just a  maverick.  You know, he's a hero to the people he works for and a hero to  the investors.  So people want to know that he's coming back.</p><p>But what's interesting is, over the last five months, since he left in  January, the stock has appreciated over 68 percent.  So the market believes  that Apple can continue to be successful, even without Steve Jobs there on  a daily basis.  </p><p>PAYNE: Right.  And we do have the bid ask.  It's up.  Indicating up almost  3 points here at the open.  </p><p>Having said that and the fact that you pointed out it's already up, as an  investor, if an investor came to you this morning and said, should I buy  this stock, what would you tell them? </p><p>MAN: You know, I love this stock.  I mean I actually have my own iPhone.   I'm a huge fan of the iPhone.  And the new one is coming out supposedly.   That's what we're hearing rumors is that it's going to come out at the  worldwide development conference.  </p><p>PAYNE: Let's talk about another big tech name.</p><p>MAN: Yes.  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Intel made a rare acquisition yesterday.  A company called Wind  River Systems.  What does that tell you that Intel is starting to make some  of these acquisitions? </p><p>MAN: You know, Intel has -- obviously they control the PC market, the  server market in terms of their chips.</p><p>PAYNE: But it's sort of like a one trick pony.  </p><p>MAN: Well, what this is doing, it's giving them access to customers.  I  mean who are the customers of Wind River?  The customers are Apple.  The  customers are Sony, Panasonic.  And this gives them access to those  customers.  So I think it's a good move.  </p><p>PAYNE: Quickly before I take it back to Alexis.  The stock closed at  $11.70.  The bid is $11.50. Does that tell you there could be another bid  coming for this company? </p><p>MAN: Yes.  I mean if they're making an offer of $11.50 and already, you  know, since Wednesday you see it's trading up to $11.70 that means there's  potentially somebody else or the market thinks that somebody else is going  to step in there and offer something -- you know, a higher number.  </p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot.  We really appreciate it.  That's fantastic.  </p><p>MAN: Thank you.  Thanks.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, Alexis, back over to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p>Coming up, Chrysler is back in court today.  Adam Shapiro is there live  with the very latest.  </p><p>And we are just minutes away from the May employment number.  We're going  to have that for you as it happens and a full break down.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: We've got some breaking auto news now.  Dow Jones Newswire is  reporting there will be no Opel launch in the United States due to a future  Magna deal.  </p><p>Chrysler heads backed to court today where the judge will hear from a group  trying to block its deal with Fiat.  Our own Fox Business' Adam Shapiro is  live outside the courthouse with the details on both of these developments.  </p><p>Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the latest, let's start with Opel  real quick.  There are Opels in the United States now.  They actually build  cars for Saturn and the Saturn Astra is one of them.  With the news that  Saturn may be sold to Penske Auto Group out of Detroit, you might still  have some kind of contractual agreement where Opel would manufacture cars  and be sold under the Saturn brand.  So to say Opel won't be launched in  the U.S. is accurate, but you can still get an Opel, it would just have a  different name.  </p><p>Now to Chrysler.</p><p>The appellate court, the three judge panel, will hear arguments starting at  2:00 as to why the deal with Fiat should be delayed.  Keep in mind, it was  Chrysler which asked for this emergency hearing.  They're trying to get the  panel to certify the sale so the deal can close before July 15th. But the  Indiana state treasurer, along with 12 other parties, are trying to stop  the deal and they've also petitioned to get the stay in place which now  exists.  They say, this is the exact quote, \"that the Indiana retirees and  Indiana taxpayers have suffered losses because of unprecedented and illegal  acts of the federal government.\"</p><p>Sources close to all of this say they expect a decision from the three- panel judges by late tonight, possibly early Saturday morning.  So  everybody will be watching to see if Chrysler and Fiat get the go ahead to  close their deal or if it will be delayed.  And if it's delayed past that  July 15th date where they say they have to close, Fiat has the option to  walk.  And if they do walk, Chrysler has to come up with $35 million as a  penalty for not closing many time.  </p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: OK.  Before I let you go, Adam, just to confirm here, the deadline  is June 15th, right, not July 15th.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: June 15th, not July.  June 15th.  I miss spoke.  June 15th.  </p><p>GLICK: OK, good.  I just wanted to confirm.  I want to confirm that.  </p><p>The other thing here is, is if, in fact, Fiat were to walk, what happens  with the role of the Treasury and the U.S. government in backstopping this  debtor in possession financing?  </p><p>SHAPIRO: That's a very good question.  We'll try and get that one answered.   But most people are not even addressing it.  They expect it to close.  But  it would throw the entire deal with Chrysler up in the air because the U.S.  government has said, without Fiat, there is no future for Chrysler.  </p><p>GLICK: All right.  Adam Shapiro, we will continue to keep a close eye on  these developments throughout the morning.  Thank you very much, Adam.  </p><p>Well, we are just about a minute away from the jobs data.  I want to bring  up the futures right now as we take a look at this here.  Expectations  right now for unemployment to rise to 9.2 percent.  It was 8.9 percent in  April.  Expectations are also for 520,000 job losses.  We did lose 539,000  jobs last month. </p><p>Now keep in mind, though, we have seen upward revisions time and time  again.  And those jobs numbers, January, February, March, were well north  of 600.  In fact, back in January, 740,000 job losses.  At this point, if  we lose about 500,000, we will have lost 6.2 million job since the start of  the recession according to the NABE.  That was December of 2007.  </p><p>As you can see, the futures are in the green.  So we're looking up to be in  positive territory here. But if we get something in the 500s, low 500s, the  anticipation is that the market will rally on the news that perhaps job  losses are beginning to subside.  </p><p>Let's go to Rich Edson.  He is at the Labor Department with the number.  </p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: 345,000 jobs lost.  345,000 jobs lost.   We've got an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent.  That's the highest since  1983.  There are 14.5 unemployed people in this country.  That is the  highest ever.  </p><p>Again, 345,000 jobs lost last month.  We had 539,000 jobs lost initially  last month, April, excuse me.  That number is now 504,000.  In March, the  initial number, 699,000 jobs lost.  That is now 652,000 jobs lost. </p><p>Since the recession began in December of 2007, the unemployment rate has  increased 4.5 percent and six million jobs have been lost.</p><p>Let's take a look at the private sector -- 338,000 jobs lost.  Government  fell 7,000 jobs.  The federal government dropped 15,000 jobs.</p><p>Leisure and hospitality, get this, up 3,000 jobs.  That's the first  increase since December of 2007 when the recession began.  Eight thousands  of those jobs are food and drinking services.</p><p>Education and health services up 44,000 jobs.  And credit intermediation,  if you are looking for those refinance jobs, down 6,000.  Those are people  who do refis if you are looking for an indication of that.  </p><p>Let's take a look at construction jobs, a little bit better than had been.   Manufacturing jobs, 156,000.  Let's start with that, 156,000 jobs lost for  manufacturing.  Motor vehicles and parts down 30,000.  </p><p>And since December of 2007, there have been 1.8 million jobs lost because  of manufacturing.  That accounts for three-tenths of all jobs lost since  there.  Construction employment down 59,000.  And believe it or not, that's  about half the average of the previous six months.  </p><p>Household wages averaging $18.54.  That is up .1 percent, year over year up  3.1 percent.  </p><p>Also, government was up 92,000 last month.  It was originally thought to be  up 72,000 -- excuse me, that's for the month of April.  The month of April  up 92,000, originally thought to be 72,000. </p><p>Alexis, we'll leave it there.  Back to you.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  So, before I let you go, Rich, just to review this here  right now, the 14.5 million people that are unemployed is the highest on  which record?  From what date?  </p><p>EDSON:  That was when record keeping began back in 1948.  So it's the  highest ever taken when they started all the way back in 1948.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, terrific.  And just before I let you go, any revisions?   No revisions to unemployment rate, revisions downward for April and March  in terms of non-farm payrolls?  </p><p>EDSON:  That's right.  We lost fewer jobs in April and March.  Originally,  it was thought in April that we'd lost 539,000 jobs.  That's now been  revised to 504,000 jobs, so a difference of 35,000 jobs on the good side.  </p><p>March, originally thought to be nearly 700,000, 699,000, we are now at  652,000 for the month of March.  That is a change to the good side of  47,000.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Rich Edison, what a surprise.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>Let's break down the numbers.  </p><p>Democratic Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is with us; Roger Ballou,  the president and CEO of the professional service company CDI; and John  Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Investor Services.  </p><p>Gentlemen, I'm in a little bit of shock, a little surprised.  </p><p>John, let me start with you.  You're my resident economist here.  </p><p>Why would the unemployment rate tick up from 8.9 percent to 9.4 percent and  yet in non-farm payrolls we lost a little less than 350,000?  </p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES:  Well, you know,  we first have to consider that these job estimates are taken from two  separate different surveys.  The unemployment rate is taken from a  household survey.  The count of jobs, number of jobs is taken from a survey  of employers.  </p><p>That being said, you know, one of the defining characteristics of this  recession has been the record length of unemployment.  So while fewer  people are losing their jobs -- and we pick that up from the recent decline  if first time jobless claims -- we still find that the number of people  that are out of work or collecting state unemployment benefits continues to  grow.  This is a recession where it was very damaging to have lost your job  because of the unusually long period of time it's taken to secure new  employment if you are that lucky.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  </p><p>Let me go to Congressman Sestak.  </p><p>Are you surprised by the numbers?  </p><p>REP. JOE SESTAK (D), PENNSYLVANIA:  Actually, I am.  I had expected them to  be in the low 500,000s.  In fact, when we ran the models several months  ago, if we had gotten to the low 500,000s or just below it by July, we  would have assumed everything was going according to script -- still  intense, but not intensifying.  What this data shows is that as compared to  past recessions, employers laid off employees much more rapidly when you  look at the data, which means that this stopping of the cratering of our  economy may come to a halt a bit more rapidly.  </p><p>I had expected unemployment to be about 9.2 percent.  And he is right,  overall, people who don't have any jobs and aren't seeking is about 16  percent.  But think about what else is now happening.  </p><p>The yields in the financial market have really come down.  We also see that  the housing market is beginning to see the bottom of housing prices  falling.  We also are seeing here that consumer spending is actually  beginning to increase as the rebates come back.  </p><p>In fact, if you compare May of this year, when our rebates came out from  the stimulus bill, to a year ago, it's hard to compare, because remember,  Alexis, a year ago in May, we also had a stimulus bill.  But when you see  the two, comparison, it appears as though consumer confidence is beginning  to come back.  We'll get to about 10 percent unemployment by the end of the  year, but I don't think we're going to go above it, and then we're out of  here, as Mr. Bernanke pointed out recently, and our economy begins to go  again.</p><p>GLICK:  You know, Roger, you are an outsourcing firm.  You deal with part- time and full-time workforce.  Have you been seeing improving trends, or is  this data a surprise to you?  </p><p>ROGER BALLOU, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CDI:  Actually, this data is confirmatory  of what we have been seeing throughout our business, our MRINetwork offices  across he country and our CDI professional staffing organizations, where,  if you look at it, there have been a lot of bright areas in the economy in  spite of the losses of jobs.  </p><p>For example, rural economies have continued to perform better than urban  economies, where they are driven by more commodities, agriculture, things  like that.  Secondly, the service sector, if you look at health care, has  actually been experiencing growth through this.  </p><p>We saw what appeared to be the beginning of the end of the recession at the  end of the first quarter in our numbers.  We saw it confirmed in April.  We  see it confirmed again here in May.  </p><p>So what we're seeing in this national data is confirmation of what our  MRINetwork offices and our professional organizations that we serve have  been seeing over the last two or three months.  So the actual exact number  I couldn't have predicted, but we did predict that it was beginning of the  end of the recession occurring in this last part of the first quarter,  first part of the second quarter.</p><p>GLICK:  Gentlemen, I want to bring up for just a moment what the market is  doing in reaction to this, because the market is reacting pretty favorably  -- that would be putting it lightly -- to this news.  </p><p>The market was up about 40 beforehand.  The Dow now up 135 points.  So  we're up 1.5 percent.  The S&amp;P right now is up 1.7 percent and Nasdaq up a  percent.  So we've rallied a full one percent in reaction to this.  </p><p>Two points.  </p><p>Congressman Sestak, let me first start with you on the president's fiscal  stimulus package.  He has tried to demonstrate in several speeches recently  that the fiscal stimulus is starting to work its way into the economy.   Money is being spent.  I think he recently said about 100,000 jobs have  been saved or created.  </p><p>Is this proof in the pudding that in fact it is starting to work, and it  was the necessary fuel that we needed to get everybody off the sidelines?  </p><p>SESTAK:  Yes, I believe it was one of the necessary tools.  We also have to  give a lot of credit to the TARP program and the TALF program, the second  one, as you well know, to the Federal Reserve, because they have gotten the  mother milk of our economy, credit, flowing again.  And so there's a lot  more confidence in the markets also.</p><p>But without a doubt, this economic stimulus bill intended to get money out  there so people would spend it.  A lot of it on retailing has started to  work.  Now what you are going to see is later this year, the construction  money -- only about six percent of it has been spent thus far -- is really  going to kick in just as the recession seems to be coming to a halt and is  ready to come up.  I think it's been well played.</p><p>GLICK:  You know, John, it's interesting.  I was speaking to Jim Rohr, the  chairman and CEO of PNC, and the other day he said, \"Alexis, one of the  greatest stimulus in this economy has been what the Fed has done because  those who have been able to refinance on average has saved about $300 on  monthly payments.\"  </p><p>I wonder, is that stimulus generated by refi activity enough to offset the  fact that as we sit here right now, oil is breaking above $70 a barrel,  it's at a seven-month high, and so what was perceived as a tax credit  because of declining gasoline and oil prices is now going to be a tax on  consumers?  </p><p>LONSKI:  You know, we have to keep our eye on energy prices, but I believe  that when consumers look at energy prices, they take a longer-term view.   And they didn't believe that oil was going to stay at $40 to $50 per  gallon.  </p><p>Consumer spending proceeds on the assumption the price of crude oil will be  in a range of $60 to $70 per barrel.  So we are hitting the upper end of  this range beyond which consumer spending might indeed suffer.  And so it  would behoove the administration to take any action necessary to prevent a  replay of what happened in the first half of 2008, when the price of crude  oil soared up to nearly $150 per barrel.  If that happens again, then the  wait for the next economic recovery will be longer than we currently  anticipate.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.</p><p>I mean, Roger, there's a lot of confluences of events right now that are  beginning to signal that perhaps the global economy is starting to heal.   The concern is -- and John brings up some great points -- is that  inflation, things of that nature become a bigger concern and act as a tax  on consumers or cause interest rates to rise.</p><p>What impact, if any, will all this have on the corporations that you talk  to on a daily basis who are looking to slowly but surely begin to bring new  employees into the fold?</p><p>BALLOU:  Well, I think two things.</p><p>Congressman Sestak commented earlier that -- I think what you saw this time  is a steeper quicker reduction in employment and inventories than we have  ever seen before.  I think that the information systems companies now used  to control their inventories and their production capacity led them to  react much, much more quickly.  What I think that's going to lead to is a  slower sustained recovery coming out of this, so it's going to be like a  reverse hockey stick, where you saw a quicker downtick, but a gradual  uptick that will come.  </p><p>I also agree that I think the financial programs are the key driver of the  uptick here.  I don't think that much of the stimulus has kicked in yet, so  I suspect that the bigger stimulus effect here has been the credit markets  opening up, and that leading to enhanced consumer confidence and business  confidence.  </p><p>The other thing that's gone on is the global economy, where you see the  Indian economy continuing to grow very, very strongly.  You see the Chinese  economy in resurgence based on their stimulus programs.  So I think those  things are contributing significantly to the uptick as well.  </p><p>So, it is an interconnected global economy.  In our case, I think the  financial programs have been very, very critical to it.  I also think the  president himself has been instilling confidence through his communication,  through his demeanor, through the programs that he's launched.  And this is  a very -- you know, people's psyches are fragile, but they also can move in  a positive direction, very, very quickly, and I think you are beginning to  see that occurring.</p><p>GLICK:  Congressman Sestak, I'm going to give you the last word.  </p><p>One of the things about the data shows that number of hours worked have  dropped.  Productivity, as we just saw yesterday, is rising.  </p><p>One material concern out there is that we will see declining wages, that  we've seen declining wages, but that it will be a bigger issue that the  consumer will still remain fairly tapped out.  And because we've figured  out how to accomplish more with less workers, that some of those jobs may  not come back.  </p><p>How important is it to find those future jobs that will perhaps replace a  lot of the millions of jobs of the six million that we have seen since the  recession began?  </p><p>SESTAK:  This is an excellent point you make.  </p><p>We have lost about a trillion dollars in our GDP as compared to our 2007  GDP high peak.  And if we just have an economy, as was just mentioned, that  grows slowly, and let's just say it grows at 2.5 percent, which was the  average between 2001 and 2007, it will take us three years to soak up that  $1 trillion of lost GDP capacity.  Which means if we don't grow more  rapidly, we won't be creating these jobs that you spoke about.  </p><p>That's why the president's budget is absolutely critical.  If he is -- and  I believe he is -- intent upon in succeeding in retooling the economy in  the types of jobs, the green energy jobs, the ability to reform our health  care system, those parts of this budget will be absolutely critical.  </p><p>Second, I go back that we have to do more in the entrepreneur incentives by  the right tax incentives to get that extra bump to our economy above 2.5  percent growth in the next few years to come, or we won't create those  jobs.</p><p>GLICK:  Right.  Good point.</p><p>SESTAK:  Because China is growing this year 6.8 percent as we lose about  five or six percent.  So that's why this is important, your point.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, guys.  We are going to leave it there.  Terrific,  terrific discussion.  </p><p>I'm glad to see we've seen some relief in the numbers, but remember still a  lot of people unemployed in this economy.  </p><p>Congressman Sestak, Roger and John, thank you so much, gentlemen.  </p><p>SESTAK:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.</p><p>GLICK:  A reminder, by the way please join me, 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time.  I  will be speaking to the labor secretary, Hilda Solis, in a \"First on Fox\"  interview here to break down this May employment number.  So please tune in  for that.  We'll get an opportunity to get her thoughts in just about 45  minutes.  </p><p>All right.  Coming up, more jobs lost.  We're talking to students just  entering the working world about their hunt for employment.</p><p>And of course we will head live to the New York Stock Exchange for a little  bit of a preview on what is now a market that's looking pretty good.  </p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  All week we have been taking a look at the nation's growing deficit  as a result of government spending as something we called red ink.  Now,  MONEY FOR BREAKFAST teamed up with the college news service U-Wire to take  a closer look at Generation Debt, the students of America who will inherit  the current deficit  </p><p>Some of those students told us the financial worries that are keeping them  -- frankly, they're keeping them up at night.  Take a listen to what they  had to say.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My biggest financial concern is just to find a job  after I graduate.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm more worried about people my parents' age who have  just seen their retirement funds completely be gone.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My parents' businesses since December, like, their  sales have been halved.  And that kind of really affects me because I'm in  school now.  I can't help them out.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My personal biggest financial concern is just being  able to live the life that we're expected to live as -- you know, again  since I came from a background where my parents didn't necessarily have a  lot of money, I think there was a big expectation for me coming to college  and getting the job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK:  Well, as you heard, some of the students we spoke to say finding a  job is their top worry.  With roughly 1.5 million graduating seniors  entering the workforce this year and a loss of another 500,000 -- well, now  actually we have seen 350,000 jobs in May, according to the most recent  survey -- what will they do?  And is now the time to figure out other  options?  </p><p>Joining us right now, Emily Sutherland, who is heading into her senior year  at Colorado State; Leah Finnegan, who graduated from the University of  Texas this year; and Dean Van Tassell, who received his MBA from Pace  University just two weeks ago.  </p><p>Good morning, guys.  Good to see you.  </p><p>LEAH FINNEGAN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS GRADUATE:  Good morning.</p><p>DEAN VAN TASSELL, RECEIVED MBA FROM PACE UNIVERSITY:  Good morning.</p><p>EMILY SUTHERLAND, HEADING INTO SENIOR YEAR AT COLORADO STATE:  Good  morning.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, Dean.  Let me talk to you.</p><p>You just graduated two weeks ago from Pace University.  You have been on  the job hunt.  What have you been experiencing?  </p><p>VAN TASSELL:  Well, first of all, thank you for having me on the program.   And BB&amp;T Capital Markets loves Fox Business.</p><p>GLICK:  Oh, that's good to know.  Thanks.  </p><p>VAN TASSELL:  I have been applying to, let's see now, about 70 different  investment banks, writing the HR departments, following with managing  directors, trying to get my name out there as much as possible.  I have a  nice stack of rejection letters right now, so it's rough out there.  </p><p>You know, you have to start making contingency plans.  And it's -- you  know, we're up to 9.4 percent.  The only solace I have is that maybe the  9.4 percent unemployment is backwards looking, and the market seems to be  shrugging it off today.  So hopefully we will have second derivative fever  and things will start to level out and pick up relatively soon.</p><p>GLICK:  Leah, you just graduated from the University of Texas.  You have a  BA in American studies.  </p><p>What kind of jobs have you been looking for?  </p><p>FINNEGAN:  I'm actually going into journalism, which is, you know, quite an  experience at this time.  And I applied to about 20 jobs, and I heard \"No\"  from about five.  And then I just didn't hear from the rest of them.  So  it's kind of like applying to a black hole.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, radio silence.  </p><p>So what did you decide to do when you just weren't getting back any  responses or you were just getting rejection notes without even, as I  understand, getting an opportunity to even interview?  </p><p>FINNEGAN:  Well, my contingency plan was grad school, and I wasn't sure if  I wanted to go, and kind of applied on the lark and ended up getting into  grad school and not getting into any jobs.  So grad school it is.</p><p>GLICK:  So you're going to Columbia?</p><p>FINNEGAN:  Yes.</p><p>GLICK:  My alma mater.  </p><p>FINNEGAN:  Oh, OK.</p><p>GLICK:  Very excited.  OK.</p><p>Now Emily, let me talk to you.  I understand you are majoring in  communications.  You are going to be a senior this year at Colorado State.  </p><p>When you listen to what's happening to Dean and Leah and I'm sure a lot of  your other classmates, how is that impacting you?  How nervous does it make  you knowing that you are going into your senior year of college?  </p><p>SUTHERLAND:  Well, it makes me really nervous, of course.  A lot of my  friends have graduated.  A lot of them have resulted in working at  Starbucks and their degree has gotten them absolutely nowhere.  So I just  hope that things pick up so I actually do have job opportunities out there  once I graduate.</p><p>GLICK:  Dean, you smiled there.  I mean, how many of your friends and  colleagues have had to do that?  Like, you might have had aspirations of  working on Wall Street or working in a particular sector, but there's no  opportunities and you have to get what you can get.  </p><p>VAN TASSELL:  I know a lot of people who would be lucky to get a job at  Starbucks.  It's hard.  </p><p>I will probably have to go back to bartending for a little bit, but it seem  just as competitive as Wall Street, if not more.  You have a lot of people  laid off and in the same position I'm in, so a lot of people just don't  have any options, even contingency plans.  </p><p>The number one thing I hear is there's a lot of government jobs out there,  but the mentality of, I want to work on Wall Street, I'm very aggressive, I  want to be in the financial markets than going into a government job, it's  a bit different from what you have expected might be around after you  graduate.  So...</p><p>GLICK:  Right.</p><p>And Leah, how many other classmates of yours have said they are going to  choose to continue to go back to school because that's really the only and  best option?  </p><p>FINNEGAN:  A really good number.  It is a very popular option right now.   And I don't know, I'm kind of finding the whole experience a bit freeing,  and I think a lot of people my peers are as well, that now we have this  time right now to kind of relax and discover what we really want to do.</p><p>GLICK:  Good point.</p><p>FINNEGAN:  and then we have the rest of our lives to do it.  So there's not  so much pressure to be successful and make more than $100,000 right out of  college.</p><p>GLICK:  Great point.  </p><p>I wish you all the best success.  Leah, Dean and Emily, thank you guys so  much.  </p><p>VAN TASSELL:  Thank you.</p><p>FINNEGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>SUTHERLAND:  Thank you.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, guys.  We're going to take a break.  We will be right  back with \"THE OPENING BELL\" in just a moment.  We're just about five  minutes away.  </p><p>All right.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Welcome back.  It's time for \"The One Thing You Should  Know.\"</p><p>Connell, you were watching actually the bond market reaction to the jobs  data.  What did you see happen?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, a big move up in yields, which is really going to be the  story that we're going to have to follow very, very closely, Alexis, when  you think about it.  </p><p>And Charles, you and I talked about this, the idea that hey, maybe the  economy has bottomed out and things are starting to look better, but what  about rising yields, rising mortgage rates, and other things?  And does  that cut off the recovery?</p><p>GLICK:  It could be a tough bear market for the bonds.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Absolutely.  And also, I was looking at equities.  I thought the  Dow and this type of number would be up 200, 300 points.  I'm serious.  I  think we have a conflict here with the unemployment number being 9.4.</p><p>GLICK:  I agree.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Two separate surveys -- the Household Survey saying, listen, it's  tough, it's tougher than the way the businesses maybe are looking at it.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  You've got to wonder why the divergence.</p><p>And speaking of which, actually, I'm going to talk to Labor Secretary Hilda  Solis coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time.  So tune in.   She will he' be joining us \"First on Fox.\"</p><p>All right, guys.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC.

The Journal reporting Sheila  Bair and the FDIC want a change and it could include CEO Vikram Pandit.   Who might be tapped to replace him?  And what do the people at Citigroup  think?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the SEC charges Mozilo federal regulators charge Countrywide cofounder  Angelo Mozilo with insider trading and securities fraud.  What will happen  to him next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're serving these stories and much more this morning on MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.</p><p>Good morning and happy Friday.  Welcome to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm Alexis  Glick.</p><p>Coming up this morning, much more on the latest on GM Saturn sale and that  possible shakeup at Citigroup.</p><p>Plus the smart phone war is heating up as Palm gets ready to release its  new device; it's called the Pre.  And it goes public later today.  We'll  get a preview of that phone.</p><p>And all this as reports that Steve Jobs is ready to return to the helm  after a six-month medical hiatus.  Could Apple be making a big announcement  as early as next week?</p><p>Plus, the May unemployment numbers are due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.   All eyes are on this number.  Expectations are for a loss of another  520,000 jobs; unemployment to reach 9.2 percent.  We'll see in just  moments.</p><p>Roger Ballou, CDI Core President and CEO and Representative Joe Sestak from  Pennsylvania are both going to join me to break down those numbers when  they come out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>We'll also have a terrific roundtable discussion on where the jobs are  being created in the state and local municipalities.  Is the fiscal  stimulus package actually helping create enough jobs?</p><p>Let's take a look at the futures right now as we get started.  As you can  see across the board we're in the green; right now the DOW up 36; S&amp;P up  four; NASDAQ up three.  So across the board we're up just fractionally.</p><p>Let's get directly to the markets.  Fox Business contributor Gavin Gray is  in for Mr. Ashley Webster in London.  And Connell McShane is here with us  right now.  Let's get started with Connell here in New York -- Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning Alexis.  Yes we're  certainly watching those markets closely, you showed us the futures moving  a little bit higher indicating we might get a higher open at the final  trading day of the week.</p><p>But all of that can change of course; 8:30 a.m. Eastern time will be the  big number on jobs.  Now, speaking of jobs in a different -- speaking of it  in a different way, Steve Jobs is making big news at Apple.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning reporting he is on pace to take back  the CEO position to come back on to the job as planned and with that said,  from medical leave, the stock is getting a nice boost this morning.</p><p>All of that kind of plays into what Alexis was talking about a little while  ago, the back and forth between Apple and Palm; Palm coming out over the  weekend with its Pre.  Not only might jobs come back as planned here but  the idea is maybe he comes back a little earlier than planned.</p><p>There's a big developer's conference next week and the thinking is maybe  Jobs comes back for that, announces a new iPhone.  We'll see that getting a  little bit ahead of ourselves but the \"Journal\" starting that speculation  this morning.</p><p>Investors seem to like it.  The Apple stock price as you see there up to  147 in change pre-market trading.</p><p>Ok, let's see what the European markets are up to this morning as we do now  head over to Gavin Gray in London -- Gavin.</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Connell thanks very much indeed.  Let's first  of all have a look at the markets over here; all really waiting on  particularly in Europe and Britain waiting really for the results of the  cabinet reshuffle.</p><p>But let's kick off in London with the FTSE.  That is currently up 67 points  leading the way at 4,454; the CAC-40 now gaining of a bit of strength as  well, up 28 points.  And the DAX really hasn't moved much all morning.   Just up 21 points or 0.4 of a percent.</p><p>As really as I said, eyes looking at Downing Street, waiting for this  Cabinet reshuffle.  We haven't had it confirmed yet but we do believe that  the Alistair Darling who is the current Chancellor -- the moneyman is going  to keep his position.  It's rumored he told Gordon Brown I either have this  job or I don't have a job in your cabinet.  We do think that he is going to  remain as Chancellor.  One or two other movements, we believe a fourth  Minister has resigned.  That is the fourth in just four days.</p><p>And also a report that U.K. inflation continues to fall.  A sign about that  the Office of National Statistics says the price of manufactured goods has  come down just 0.3 percent year on year,  largely because of the oil price  coming down in that last year, but of course oil is coming back up.  But  that is the biggest annual decline since June 2002.</p><p>Alexis back to you.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, Gavin thank you very much.</p><p>Well, auto news now.  It is a hot topic.</p><p>Breaking news this morning the \"Wall Street Journal\" says auto dealer Roger  Penske will reportedly buy the Saturn brand from General Motors.  Sources  say, Penske would buy vehicles from GM and Renault then sell them under the  Saturn brand.  No word yet on how much Penske is paying.  An official  announcement is to be made later today.</p><p>And the deal to sell Hummer to a Chinese company may have hit a bump in the  road.  Some experts say regulators in Beijing may block it because the  Hummer brand goes against China's focus on fuel efficient vehicles.</p><p>And GM will finance a huge part of a private equity firm's buyout of parts  maker Delphi.  GM will provide $2.5 billion of the $3.6 billion -- that  specific $3.6 billion price tag.  In return GM buys back four Delphi  plants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL PACINO, ACTOR:  Something really wrong is going on here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You are out of order.</p><p>PACINO:  You're out of order, you're out of order.  The whole trial is out  of order.  They are out of order.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK:  And there you have it.  That was Al Pacino.  I'm not sure if you  remember in the courtroom black comedy \"And Justice For All\" which details  chaos in the court system.  And some think that's precisely what's going on  today with the Chrysler bankruptcy hearing.</p><p>A judge in New York will hear arguments from a group trying to block the  deal with Fiat.  Opponents include a group of Indiana state pension funds  and a dozen other parties.</p><p>Speaking of which, for more on what we can expect today, let's go directly  down to lower Manhattan to our own Adam Shapiro who is standing outside the  U.S. Court of Appeals.</p><p>And Adam I'm not sure it's quite Al Pacino style but it seems like it's  getting pretty close.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it could be close, but the Indiana - - the lawyers for the Indiana State Treasurer Richard Murdock are going to  be arguing on behalf of 100,000 Indiana pensioners, police officers as well  as teachers that the sale to Fiat violates all kinds of bankruptcy law as  well as the TARP law -- the law which created the Trouble Asset Relief  Program.  That's the argument they're going to make in court.</p><p>First, that senior secured lenders like the pensioners are being given a  secondary position in this bankruptcy which is counter to Bankruptcy Law.   Second, that the TARP was originally created to help financial institutions  not automobile companies and that's a violation of the Troubled Asset  Relief Program that was set up last year.</p><p>And that third, this is just a deal that is not good for the U.S.  taxpayers.  That's the argument they're going to make in court.  And that  argument lost.  They didn't gain any ground with that argument when they  presented it to Judge Arthur Gonzalez at the Bankruptcy Court.</p><p>They've also argued that this was a private plan agreed to before, they  called it a Sub-Rosa plan, before Chrysler filed for bankruptcy, but again,  Arthur Gonzalez said no that's just not the case.  That's what the  Appellate panel is going to hear; the three judges on the Appellate Court.</p><p>They're also going to be considering Chrysler's motion to certify the sale.   If that happens, if the Indiana pensioners lose and Chrysler wins and the  sale is certified, you can expect that sale to close almost immediately  because Chrysler says it has to close the deal with Fiat by the 15th of  June or else Fiat has the option to walk away from the table and worse it  walks away with $35 million from Chrysler as a penalty for failing to close  the deal.</p><p>So there's a lot riding on this decision today, Alexis.</p><p>One other thing in regards to that Hummer sale and the report that the  Chinese are making perhaps a problem as to closing that deal because  Hummers aren't fuel efficient.  Hummer dealers will tell you that the H-3  which is the smaller Hummer -- it's built on the Chevy Colorado platform --  they'll tell you it gets better gas mileage on the highway than some of the  import SUVs like the Lexus.  So that's an argument that they are probably  ready to fight.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, Adam.  I was just going to ask you about that, I  appreciate it.  All right, we'll check in with you a little later outside  the court.</p><p>All right, well Chrysler is fighting two courtroom battles which Adam just  talked about in its push to exit bankruptcy and merge with Fiat.  In  addition to today's hearing with the group of those Indiana state pensions  and investment funds that are looking to block the deal.  Close to 800 of  the Chrysler's dealers are making their case in court.  They made it  yesterday to put the breaks on the plan.</p><p>For a closer look at the impact of the courtroom battles, Laurie Moncrieff  is the president of Schmald Tool &amp; Die, an auto parts supplier that did  business for Chrysler, and joining us on the phone Jim Anderer, the owner  of Island Jeep in Long Island who is fighting in court to keep his business  open.</p><p>Laurie, don't worry about the people behind you.  I saw you telling people  to keep quiet.  Believe me I do that every single day.  All right Laurie,  tell me first of all, what does this delay mean to you and your business?</p><p>LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE:  The manufacturers have  been feeling the effects of what's been happening in the auto industry for  quite some time.  So quite frankly we're ready to get on with business.</p><p>The markets up here have been largely frozen because of what's going on in  our economy in Michigan with the Detroit three.  So in our opinion, we feel  that moving forward quickly with the bankruptcy would be a help to the  manufacturers.</p><p>GLICK:  And Laurie, explain specifically what it is that you guys do and  sort of where you fit into the food chain here in terms of how this impacts  your business.</p><p>MONCRIEFF:  We do precision machining and make dyes for the auto industry  as well as many other industries.  And quite frankly, all this upheaval is  affecting a lot of industries besides just the auto industry.</p><p>GLICK:  Great point.</p><p>Jim, I know you're joining us by phone.  You've been kind enough to be here  on several occasions.  You're fighting to keep your dealership alive.  You  are one of those who received a pink slip.  Tell me why the delay of this  judgment of this decision could actually help you.</p><p>JIM ANDERER, PRESIDENT, ISLAND JEEP (via telephone):  Hi, Alexis.  Well,  thanks for having me.</p><p>The delay helps me only in regard that it can possibly nix this deal.  This  is a bad deal for the American taxpayer.  It's a bad deal for pretty much  everybody involved, in my opinion.</p><p>I know that the vendor on the other line, you know, has her own agenda, and  I'm sympathetic to that.  But in my personal opinion this is a tragedy  that's taking place in the American marketplace.  It's putting 100,000  people out of work.  It's really devastating to our economy right now.  And  I would like to see it nixed to be honest with you.  I don't think it's a  good deal... </p><p>GLICK:  Ok, so Jim... </p><p>ANDERER:  I think that Fiat is coming into this deal with no cash.  And  it's wrought with a lot of problems.</p><p>GLICK:  Jim, you and I have talked about this before, and you have been in  the courtroom.  In fact you were in the courtroom yesterday speaking on  behalf of those dealers who are being forced to shut down.</p><p>What convinces you that if the deal were not to go through with Fiat, that  a liquidation of Chrysler would put you in a better position than if this  deal were to go through?</p><p>ANDERER:  Very simply that the market forces that would take place is  exactly what should take place.  The market forces would seek their own  level which is the way it should be.</p><p>Ok, what's going on with this taxpayer bailout and all this other stuff?  I  mean, you know, give me a break.  If -- whatever these particular brands  are worth when they're in liquidation would be sold for what they are  worth.</p><p>Ok I'm a stand-alone Jeep store.  Jeep is never going to go away.  It is  going to be picked up by somebody.  And whoever that is, is going to make a  real go of it.  But there's a false propping up of these brands is  insanity.  This is just not the way things should be done in a free  marketplace.</p><p>GLICK:  Laurie, let me switch to you for a moment.  You actually feel that  if they can make it through bankruptcy, that as suppliers, your position  will be that much safer and more secure.  Explain to people why that is.</p><p>LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE:  Well, it's always a lot  more risky to do business with a company prior to bankruptcy than after  bankruptcy so we felt a huge disruption, and quite frankly in the tool and  die industry, we felt a huge disruption for many, many years and we've seen  this coming for many years.</p><p>We've known there's been instability in the market for many years.  We were  somewhat of the canary in the mines frankly in this economy and have been  discussing the problems in tooling and in manufacturing since the early  2000 because we could feel that it was very unstable, and that the economy  was not doing well quite frankly in the early 2002, 2003.</p><p>There were a lot of discussions about the problems in the market.  So while  many of the dealers and other segments of the auto industry quite frankly  probably weren't even aware of the problems we were very much aware of it  in our industry.  </p><p>GLICK:  So Laurie when you look at the current environment, I mean look,  you live in Flint, Michigan.  We're actually going to talk to Virg Bernero  a little bit later on this morning.</p><p>What are people doing right now to either make sure that companies like you  are diversifying your risk or finding other viable job opportunities  because I imagine everything is tightened up in Michigan?  </p><p>MONCRIEFF:  Everything's not only tightened up.  It's frozen in the market  right now.  And it's not just the auto industry, it's the financial markets  are really playing a huge role.  The state of Michigan has been basically  red lined by a lot of banks so lines of credit are being pulled, very much  a big problem with getting financing to operate your business.</p><p>And then even in other industries when you diversify, we're feeling a lot  of difficulty in a lot of other industries that are not even part of the  auto industry because the financial market up in Michigan is frozen, as I  said.  So we're very anxious for the market to be unfrozen, whatever it  takes to do that.</p><p>We need financing.  We need money to start flowing to survive.  That's  basically what we're doing up here in Flint is working very, very hard to  survive this right now.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Well, Laurie, we wish you the very best.  And Jim, you  too.  Thank you guys so much for taking the time to join us this morning.  </p><p>ANDERER:  Thanks, Alexis.  </p><p>MONCRIEFF:  Thank you.  </p><p>GLICK:  Coming up, Countrywide's cofounder Angelo Mozilo charged with fraud  by the SEC.  The Judge is going to join us with his take.  </p><p>And later the Palm Pre hits stores tomorrow.  Will it take a bite out of  Apple's iPhone?  There's a lot of buzz about this.  We're going to tell you  about it in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  In court now, two executives from a defunct Seattle investment  management firm are charged with running what prosecutors call one of the  largest tax fraud schemes ever uncovered in the country.  Quellos founder,  Matthew Krane and CEO Jeffrey Greenstein and two others are charged with  fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.  Prosecutors say they created more  than $1.3 billion in fraudulent losses for clients.  Quellos used to be one  of the world's biggest managers of mutual funds.</p><p>A jury not a judge will hear claims in a case between American  International Group, AIG and Star International, the company controlled by  Maurice Greenberg AIG's former CEO.  The trial will now start June 15th.   There are several lawsuits outstanding between AIG and Mr. Greenberg and  sure wants Star to return AIG stocks and proceeds from stock sales.  AIG  received billions of dollars in federal bailout funds.</p><p>And the Securities and Exchange Commission charges former Countrywide CEO  Angelo Mozilo with fraud and insider trading.  Prosecutors say Mozilo and  two other former executives misled investors about risky lending practices.   The SEC also says Mozilo unloaded $140 million in Countrywide stock using  insider information.  It is the first case against a high-profile executive  stemming from the sub prime mortgage meltdown.  Mozilo has denied any  wrongdoing and his lawyer calls the SEC's allegations baseless.</p><p>Our fox news senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us right  now for a look at the case.  The judge is in the house and he's going to  give us some explanations here.  Judge, good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning  Alexis.  Good to see you.</p><p>GLICK:  surprised by this announcement?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm surprised by this announcement.  I expected -- and that  would be standard operating procedure in a case like this -- an indictment  rather than a civil lawsuit.  This is a civil lawsuit the Securities and  Exchange Commission says you didn't tell your opinion of your own products  to your shareholders, and that caused them to acquire shares ignorant of  what you thought of the products.</p><p>What did he think of them?  Well the SEC got some e-mails, and in that he  referred to his own products as toxic and poison.  Now, that's the bad news  that he said that in these e-mails.  The good news for him is he was not  indicted.  He was not charged with a crime.  The feds may still be  investigating for that purpose.</p><p>But standard operating procedure in cases of fraud and insider trading is  to indict and convict first and then to sue civilly.  So the fact that they  are suing him civilly, they are just looking for money and an order from a  judge that he can never run a public company again.  They are not looking  to take away his freedom, tells me they don't have enough evidence to  indict him or convict him.</p><p>GLICK:  It's interesting because involved in this case also being charged  with this as well is his chief operating officer and the CFO.  All three of  which are saying that number one, it's baseless.  That they did divulge the  proper information throughout the entire reporting process, and they say  look the fact of the matter is the SEC has not done anything right in  years, and they are using them as the poster child for what the SEC should  have done over the past five years.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the SEC's failures is a political argument that the  court will not allow them to make to a jury.  But the court will let them  say this, \"Look, you have accused us of failing to share our opinions with  everyone.  You haven't us accused of failing to share facts.\"</p><p>This is not Enron or WorldCom where inaccurate data was given out.  This is  just a case where an opinion like toxic and poison wasn't shared with the  public.</p><p>GLICK:  Ok, but what is the chance, though, that when you read what the SEC  is suggesting here, that this is brought on to suggest that it is very much  like an Enron case, where they were not divulging material public  information that could have affected decisions of shareholders, investors,  etc.?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is a question of law for the court to decide.  Is it  material information what the CEO's personal opinion is of his products?   These are not facts now.  They didn't hide numbers.  They didn't cook  books.  They just held back these words like toxic and poison.</p><p>Flip side of this is, if this was really insider trading, they would have  indicted him.  But because they haven't indicted him, what it is, is using  insider knowledge to sell; knowledge that anyone else could have gotten had  they looked into the books.  </p><p>GLICK:  Let's bring up one of those e-mails dating back to 2006 because I  want people to hear specifically what he said.  \"In all my years in the  business, I have never seen a more toxic product.\"  That was one e-mail.</p><p>He also sent another e-mail regarding a certain kind of sub prime loan.   And he said \"it is the most dangerous product in existence, and there can  be nothing more toxic.  Loans had been originated through our channels with  disregard for process and compliance with guidelines.\"  This is where he's  talking about the fact that the procedure for getting loans was just way  too simple.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know what the defense is?  \"The government wanted us to do  this and Fannie and Freddie took them off our backs and the shareholders  are no longer at risk.\"  That's the defense that he'll make and that's  true.</p><p>The government did want those subprime loans given out and Fannie and  Freddie did take them off the backs of Countrywide and others.  That is  inappropriate in my view believing in a free market.  That's what the  government did and that's why we have this crisis.</p><p>GLICK:  Let's talk about one of the domino effects here.  There's no doubt  in my mind that Senator Christopher Dodd is climbing in a shell, perhaps in  a bunker, as a result of this.  He was one of those on the sort of Mozilo  list of getting what some argue is a better mortgage.  What do you make of  this for Dodd?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  This is very bad news for Chris Dodd who already is suffering  politically in Connecticut as a result of this.  He's up for reelection in  2010.</p><p>Just as Angelo Mozilo kept from shareholders his opinion of his own  product, Chris Dodd kept from voters the fact that Angelo Mozilo gave him  an absolute sweetheart deal.</p><p>What's the relationship between Chris Dodd and Angelo Mozilo?  Chris Dodd  is the chairman of the senate banking committee which regulates these  things and writes the laws to control them.  And he's accepting an enormous  benefit that the public could never get from the CEO of one of the biggest  companies he's writing the laws to regulate.  The voters of Connecticut  will have their say on this one, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, this is ugly.  And then that whole issue with the AIG, the  wording of the bonuses and the fiscal stimulus package.  Oh my goodness.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Senator Dodd's also deep into that one.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  Judge, thank you very much.  Great seeing you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Happy Friday.  Have a great weekend.  </p><p>GLICK:  Happy Friday.</p><p>Also again I do want to say Mozilo has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer  David Siegel calls the SEC allegations baseless.  As for the other  defendants, they attorney for David Sambol called this \"a baseless  complaint that is a result of the political pressure the SEC is facing for  the well-publicized enforcement failures.\"</p><p>And Eric Sieracki's attorney meanwhile says the SEC's case is \"without  merit.  Countrywide's stock performance was tied to the fortunes of the  real estate and secondary markets for loans.  Something all investors knew  about.\"</p><p>I just wanted to clear up some statements from their attorneys.</p><p>Coming up, Charles Payne offers up his stock choices.</p><p>And President Obama meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel today; the  president reassured the Europeans about the U.S. economy.  We will tell you  what he had to say when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.   I'm Gavin Gray with a look at this morning's top news stories.</p><p>President Obama is meeting with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel today  after bilateral meeting addressed in castle (ph), President Obama held a  joint press conference with the German chancellor.  The president reassured  the Europeans about the U.S. economy.  Take a listen to what he had to say  here.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  In the United States we are  working diligently to strengthen financial regulations, to ensure that a  crisis like this doesn't happen again.  And it is going to be very  important to coordinate between Europe and the United States as we move to  strengthen our financial regulatory systems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAY:  He'll be visiting Buchenwald concentration camp this morning.   Before leaving for Paris, president Obama will meet with wounded soldiers  at Landstuhl Medical Center.  </p><p>In other news, investigators -- or rather reports of a setback for the  search for Air France flight 447.  France's Transportation Minister says  French forces have found no evidence of an Airbus A-330 airplane that  vanished over the Atlantic.  He's urging extreme prudence about suspected  debris fished from the ocean.  The French Transportation Minister says he  regrets an announcement by Brazilian teams that they had recovered plane  debris from Air France flight 447.  The jetliner was flying from Rio de  Janeiro to Paris; 228 people were on board.  </p><p>AFP is reporting that former vice president Al Gore may be sent to North  Korea to negotiate the release of two American journalists.  Laura Ling and  Euna Lee were arrested on March 17th near the North Korean border on  charges they entered the country illegally and were engaged in hostile  acts.  Both women are reporters for Gore's California-based Current TV.   They each could be sentenced to ten years in a labor camp.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Now back to New York and Charles Payne for a look at the stocks he's  watching -- Charles, I'm listening.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you so much Gavin really  appreciate it.  Well folks it's going to be an exciting day today.   Hopefully we will be to the upside.</p><p>A couple of stocks three stocks we're looking at.  Manitowoc is one.  This  is one of these real hot equipment making stocks that obviously because of  the economy has gotten hit real good.  I think your risk reward now is  really, really nice.  Right here is where it broke the trend line recently.   Now we're looking at a little resistance right around $7.80.</p><p>A break out there and I think you are pretty good.  That takes you right  here, that would be north of 10 buck; a huge percentage play.  I love the  fact that the risk reward is pretty good.  In the March quarter they beat  the street by almost 30 percent.  Maybe that business is turning around.   Certainly, the chart is attractive here.</p><p>Sina, I've probably mentioned this one now at least five times in the last  year.  As you can see, it is really starting to come on here to the point  where it looks extremely, extremely attractive.  This stock is breaking key  resistance.  I love the volume on it.  I think if you don't have any China  stocks, Baidu is my favorite.  A lot of people are afraid to buy a stock  that's almost $300 a share.  This one might have room all the way up to $47  a share.  It is one to take a look at.  It is a reiteration.</p><p>And finally the stock that caught my eye more than any other yesterday.  A  company called Flir.  The chart isn't so hot necessarily, it's been going  down for a long time but I think it's hit a bottom and I think it's on the  cusp of a major breakout.</p><p>By the way, this company has beaten the Street in each of the last four  quarters and each time they beat by a larger margin.  They make imaging  systems for the military and of course for commercial use.  I think the  stock has room to $32 that would be almost 50 percent gain.  I love the way  it looked yesterday.</p><p>By the way, I have one pick on the Web that you have to go and take a look  at today.  Fox Business.com/moneyforbreakfast. </p><p>GLICK:  All right, Mr. Payne, I look forward to it.</p><p>PAYNE:  I'm pumped up about today, I'm hoping under 500,000.  Keep our  fingers crossed.</p><p>GLICK:  Let's hope it is not too bad.  Thank you very much Charles.</p><p>Coming up, we're going to go live to London for a look on how the overseas  markets are trading.  And Palm looking to take a bite out of Apple's bottom  line with its new smart phone called the Pre.  We're going to get a real  live demonstration right here in studio and tell you why there's a lot of  buzz about it.  That's coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning, and welcome back to MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.  I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>Coming up: More on a report this morning from \"The Wall Street  Journal\" that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's top  management, including CEO Vikram Pandit.  We're going to see who was  mentioned as a possible replacement.</p><p>And Palm gets ready to release its Pre device tomorrow, looking to  steal some of the success from Apple's iPhone.  We're going to preview it  in just a couple of minutes.</p><p>And what movie could possibly take down Pixar's \"Up\" from the top  spot?  Well, Universal and Warner Brothers have new releases.  We're going  to get those expectations both coming out today.</p><p>And we have the May employment report due out at 8:30.  The  expectation is for a loss of 520,000 jobs.  We'll be live at the Labor  Department.</p><p>And then, coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL\" at 9:35 a.m., I will be  speaking with Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and get her reaction on the First  on FOX to those job numbers.</p><p>All right.  Let's take a look at the futures.  We've been in the  green throughout the morning.  Let's see, are we still in the green?  We  are.  OK, good news.</p><p>We're actually a little bit higher earlier this morning.  The Dow up  41, S&amp;P up 5, NASDAQ up 5 as well.  So, looking pretty good.</p><p>Let's get directly to financial news though -- we got a lot of that  news.  The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in  its boardroom.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be  bounced out.  \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S.  Bancorp CEO, Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job.  The Feds own 34  percent of Citigroup.</p><p>And the FDIC is putting its program to rid the nation's banks of  toxic assets on hold.  The Legacy Loans Program was supposed to begin with  trial sale this month, the FDIC says banks have proven they can raise  private capital without cleansing their balance sheets.  The FDIC says the  program could come back in a different form.</p><p>And the FDIC is very busy today, also shutting down Silverton Bank.   The troubled bank did attract investors from interest or from private  equity guys.  The FDIC says it had to do was cheapest for the insurance  fund and shutting it down was cheaper.  Silverton was not a retail bank.   Most of its customers were actually other banks.</p><p>All right.  Well, we've all been waiting for the big preview.  The  forefather of handheld phone is taking a run at Apple's iPhone to reclaim  the spot as the king of the smartphone on the hill.  Well, Palm will  release its touch-screen Pre device tomorrow, exclusively on the Sprint  network.  And the phone offers a whole slew of slick new features.</p><p>With a look at it in some real details and whether or not it is  going to be the necessary thing to boost Palm -- joining us right now is  Lance Ulanoff.  He's the editor-in-chief of PCMag.com.  And FOX Business  contributor Charles Payne, also WStreet.com founder is here with us as well  to talk about the implications for the stocks of Palm and Apple.</p><p>All right.  Lance, you've got the phone right in front of you.  I'm  very excited about this.  How does it stack up?  What are the things about  the device that look so good?</p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, PC MAGAZINE EDITOR IN CHIEF:  It stacks up pretty  well.  It is Sprint's best smartphone, bar none.  It is gorgeous.  It has  many features you find on iPhone.  It has a touch-screen, so I can add and  drag around applications.</p><p>It has something the iPhone doesn't have, multitasking.  So, if you  are looking at the screen right now, I'm actually going through a bunch of  different things that are running at once.  So, it's a $199 phone after  rebate.  So, it starts at $299.</p><p>But it has something that the -- well, the iPhone doesn't have which  is a QWERTY keyboard.  So, this is one of the things that makes it so  exciting.  And you can use that QWERTY keyboard to do ubiquitous search,  meaning the minute you start to type, it just starts to find whatever is on  the phone.</p><p>One of the ways that it does that is it brings together all of your  contacts from Google, Facebook, Exchange.  It can search there.  It can  search throughout all of that.</p><p>It has a 3-megapixel camera.  It plays video.  And yes, it does have  an accelerometer and what that means is you're going to be able to turn it  to its side and you basically can play -- you can play videos in landscape  mode.</p><p>GLICK:  It looks really -- </p><p>ULANOFF:  It is.</p><p>GLICK:  I'm entrenched.  I'm watching -- </p><p>ULANOFF:  Oh, and, by the way -- and, by the way, it's got a really  loud speaker.</p><p>GLICK:  Wow.  It's really awesome.</p><p>OK.  So, let's talk about the big issue, which is the number of  applications on the phone because I know I happen to have an iPhone.</p><p>ULANOFF:  Right.</p><p>GLICK:  And my kids adore it because it has so many different games  on it.  What are the applications like on this?</p><p>ULANOFF:  Unfortunately, they are not coming out of the gate with a  ton of applications.  Right now, the iPhone has about 40,000 applications.   This is going to start with about 20 or so.  So, it's a -- it is far fewer  and they are not really pushing the capabilities of this phone.</p><p>I've got Connect 4 up here, which is a lot of fun to play.  I can  drop in.  I'm going to lose by the way.  But I can drop in my checkers.   But, except for touching it, you can't really shake it.  You can't turn it  over, shake out the chips, or anything like that.</p><p>There's Fandango.  There's AP News.  There's a NASCAR app, but not a  NASCAR app where you drive a car, you just going to learn about what's  going on if you are interested in NASCAR.</p><p>So, for somebody who's trying to decide between the iPhone and the  Pre, well then, if you care about apps, there might not be much of a  competition -- at least for now.  But we do expect Palm to add in its app  catalog a ton more apps very quickly.</p><p>GLICK:  We are putting if here, Charles, the sort of what we're  calling the tale of the tape here, which is the Palm Pre versus the Apple  iPhone, walking through the carriers, the size of the memory, the screen,  the applications, the cost -- all those things combined.</p><p>A lot of people believe, Charles, that this is do-or-die for Palm.   This is their last opportunity to get out there and dazzle the community.</p><p>How important is it for them, and do you think they are doing what  they need to do?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, there's no doubt that this is  do-or-die.  This is the bottom of 9th, two -- you know, two men out, two  strikes against you, and you got to hit a home run.  You can't hit a base.   You can't bunt this thing.</p><p>The one thing, though, is that Wall Street has bid this stock up  tremendously.  Look at this chart.  It's a mind-boggling move.</p><p>GLICK:  Well, because the buzz on this phone has been very hot.</p><p>PAYNE:  The buzz is hot but it's not like the buzz on the iPhone,  where we saw people standing at midnight at the Apple Store waiting around  in a line.  I mean, this -- when the stock goes from like a buck to 13  bucks, that's huge, you know?  So, ironically, of course, Apple's stock  hasn't suffered too much.</p><p>And that's what I think you got going on here, too, a couple of  things from the market's point of view.  Maybe the smartphone category is  big enough and is growing enough for there to be more than one winner.  And  maybe this won't be an iPhone killer, but perhaps, it will do well enough - - although the stock though, at this point, has had one heck of a move.   And, you know, Wall Street, we get -- </p><p>GLICK:  The Palm's stock or Apple stock?</p><p>PAYNE:  Palm stock.</p><p>GLICK:  OK.</p><p>PAYNE:  Palm stock.  Apple stock is still down from its high,  although it's made a heck of a move recently from the lows of 88, 87.  But  still, I think on Wall Street, we tend to get extremely excited about  things like this and we pump up these stocks.  And I don't know that Palm  can live up -- Palm Pre can live to the hype, at least not initially out of  the gate.</p><p>GLICK:  Lance, you made a facial expression when Charles talked  about demand for the Pre.  I hear that they are not releasing that many,  and so, they think demand will be really hot.</p><p>ULANOFF:  Well, I've heard that too.  The CEO came out and said they  might not be a lot of them out there.  But I've also heard that there will  be people waiting on lines, that there already is some guy waiting out  there.  And there are people who are telling me they are going to try and  get it on Saturday because they are afraid there won't be enough at each  store.  But I have to say, Sprint has been working on this a long time.   I'd be shocked if there aren't enough of these Pres to go around.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, I mean, it's interesting Walter Mossberg, you know,  from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he wrote a whole piece on it as well, and  it was interesting to hear some of his points of view because a lot of  people are looking to next week with Apple -- to see whether or not they  are going to come out with a new iPhone.  They are going to dazzle us,  because a lot of their initial two-year contracts are set to expire coming  up this summer.  So, if they come out with one, this could be perfectly  timed.</p><p>How crucial is it -- and, Lance, will Steve Jobs show up?</p><p>ULANOFF:  We're all talking about that.  You know, Wozniak, his  former co-founder said he looked robust which is great news.  We always  expect surprises from Apple at every one of these major events.  But I  think this is going to be unique, because the third thing -- Steve Jobs has  this habit in these events of going one more thing and he pulls it out of  his back pocket.</p><p>I think the one more thing at this event is Steve Jobs.  You have  announcement, announcement -- Steve Jobs walks out with whatever the new  iPhone is.  I really think that could happen because he is a showman.  He  knows how to pull something like this thing off.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.</p><p>ULANOFF:  And there's going to be hot product out there.  I don't  know what it is, but it doesn't diminish what Palm has accomplished with  the Pre, because I have to tell you -- this is a home run.</p><p>GLICK:  You know, Charles, Tim Cook had done a terrific job in the  role ... </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>GLICK:  ... of Steve Jobs obviously left in terms of running day-to- day operations.  The stock is up 68 percent versus NASDAQ, which is up a  little bit over 20 percent since left due to health concerns in January.</p><p>What will this mean if he does come back for Apple's stock?</p><p>PAYNE:  Oh, it's a cherry on top of it.  But more than that -- you  know, listen, I don't think there's a CEO that's so identified with this  company as Steven Jobs is with Apple.  And listen, Apple already, early  this morning, is indicating it's going to be up 3 or 4 points at the open  today.  And this is ahead of the Pre coming out tomorrow.</p><p>So, there's a lot of excitement about Steve Jobs coming in and doing  something spectacular.</p><p>GLICK:  We didn't even get to Sprint and AT&amp;T and Verizon.  There's  too much to talk about.  But it looks so cool.  It really does.</p><p>PAYNE:  By the way, I think this is more important -- it might be as  equally as important for Sprint as it is ... </p><p>GLICK:  As it is for Palm.</p><p>PAYNE:  Palm -- absolutely.</p><p>GLICK:  Great point.  Lance, thank you very much for breaking it in.</p><p>ULANOFF:  It's a pleasure.</p><p>GLICK:  You must be having fun with that.</p><p>ULANOFF:  I am.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK:  He is grinning from ear to ear with this phone.</p><p>ULANOFF:  I still want to keep it.</p><p>GLICK:  OK.  The control room would like you to go visit them  because there are several purchasers, including my executive producer, who  wants to buy that immediately.</p><p>ULANOFF:  I'm taking bids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK:  OK.</p><p>All right.  Coming up: We'll check the latest news headlines.  And  Warner Brothers is looking to cash in on a major hangover this weekend.   We're going to preview the weekend box-office when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GREY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR  BREAKFAST.  I'm Gavin Grey in London with a look at this morning's top news  stories.</p><p>House Republican leaders are suggesting more than $23 billion in  budget cuts.  Overall, the proposal includes cuts in no less than 37  programs.  One example is eliminating transportation enhancements and this  measure alone would save $833 million a year.  It would take place over the  next five years.  The plan has been sent now to the White House.</p><p>And the State Supreme Court in South Carolina is ordering the  state's governor to accept federal bailout money.  Mark Sanford had refused  to take the money designated to South Carolina over the next two years.   But this court decision ends months of wrangling with legislators who  accused him of playing politics with people's lives.  Sanford says he will  not appeal the decision and plans to sign the paperwork on Monday.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the FOX Business Network.  Now, let's get back  to New York and Alexis Glick.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>My favorite topic, let's get right to sports business right now.   Star architect Frank Gehry won't be working on the $4 billion Atlantic  Yards project in Brooklyn, New York, anymore.  Developer brace Ratner is  trying to trim $200 million in costs.  Ellerbe Becket will take his place.</p><p>Ratner is blaming the economic downturn and litigation being brought  on by project opponents.  Ratner hopes to have the new arena opened for the  New Jersey Nets by 2010, 2011.</p><p>The Big Unit joins baseball 300-win club.  Pitcher Randy Johnson  becoming only the 24th pitcher in history to win 300 games as the San  Francisco Giants beat the Washington Nationals five to one.  Johnson who is  45 years old has pitched for 16 in a 22-year career.  Incredible.</p><p>And Charles Hayward, the president and CEO of the New York Racing  Association said the absence of Rachel Alexandra would likely cost the  Belmont Stakes significantly in attendance.  With Rachel Alexandra in the  race, Hayward estimated a crowd of between 80,000 to 90,000.  Without her,  he believes the crowd will be 50,000 to 60,000.  Last year, when Big Brown  was going for the Triple Crown, the attendance was 94,476.</p><p>Speaking of which, here now with a little preview of Belmont Stakes  is FOX News reporter Rick Leventhal, who is live in Belmont Park.</p><p>Rick, pretty cool thing to be doing.  I'm jealous.  What's it  looking like for tomorrow?</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, don't be too jealous  because we're getting rained on right now.  Attendance is near zero by the  way because there's no races going on.  However, Chip Woolley, the trainer  of Mine That Bird you probably recognize from the Kentucky Derby is kind  enough to join us for an exclusive one-on-one.</p><p>Now, they are saying attendance may be done because Rachel Alexandra  who won the Preakness isn't running this race.  You said that you believe  that's possible?</p><p>CHIP WOOLLEY, MINE THAT BIRD TRAINER:  Sure, she's a great filly and  it would be good for in racing in general if she was here.  But, in this  game, you have to do what's best for the horse.  And if they didn't feel  like it was a best thing for her, it's better they don't run her.</p><p>And that, you know, racing -- racing will take care of itself.  But  we have to -- the horses have to come first.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  Mine That Bird finished at close second to Rachel  Alexandra.  Are you disappointed that you didn't have a chance at a rematch  on this longer track?</p><p>WOOLLEY:  You know, a little bit disappointed I suppose.  Really, I  mean, it's -- for me, it's better she's not in here because that's one less  horse you have to beat.  And let's face it.  If you don't have to beat  them, you don't want to, you know?  You want to limit the field to who you  run at.  So, I don't mind her not being here.</p><p>She's a great filly and you got to respect her a lot.  So, really,  for me, it's probably better she's not in for the racing game.  It might be  better that she would be here.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  Your horse was on the track.  It still is, I believe, on  the track?</p><p>WOOLLEY:  It just went off.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  It just went off.  So, you just watched the horse  working out in these conditions, which hopefully tomorrow, it will be sunny  and drier.  But how -- but how does Mine That Bird look today?</p><p>WOOLLEY:  He looked great this morning.  Just got over the ground  really, really well.  So we're real happy with where we're at.  It looks  like we got in here in good shape.  And we're looking forward to running.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  You said he looked like a million bucks.</p><p>WOOLLEY:  At least a million.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  That's the purse.</p><p>WOOLLEY:  Yes, sir.  Hopefully, we can get some of it, and  hopefully, he'll have his best race in him tomorrow.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  So, Chip, if I were a betting man -- which I might be,  by the way -- would you suggest I put money on your horse?</p><p>WOOLLEY:  I will never make a suggestion like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  Chip Woolley, the trainer of Mine That Bird -- thanks so  much for being with us.  And get well soon.</p><p>WOOLLEY:  Nice to meet you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  All right.  Nice to meet you, too.  So, that's the  story.</p><p>And here's another look at Belmont Park and the track, which is very  muddy.  But again, they are expecting sunshine tomorrow.  And if you were  on the fence about whether to come here or not, I'm told there will be  sunny skies and it should be a great day for racing.</p><p>GLICK:  If you were a betting man, is that the cat calling the  kettle black or what?</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  I didn't want to come out and say it, but, you know, I  might put a couple dollars on the race.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Rick, I'll e-mail you later to do the same for  me.  Great interview.  Thanks so much for seeing you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL:  OK.  I look forward to it.  Thank you.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Coming up: We're going to give you the box  office preview for the weekend.</p><p>And this weekend, once again, you can pitch your business idea to a  venture capitalist live right here on the FOX Business Network.  Start  emailing your pitches at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:YourMoney@FOXBusiness.com\">YourMoney@FOXBusiness.com</email>  Lucky ones will get to  sell their idea live on-air during on \"Your Questions, Your Money\" with  Dagen McDowell and Robert Gray this Saturday, 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.</p><p>Stay with us.  Movies -- coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  This weekend, Will Ferrell is going to be battling  dinosaurs, bugs and one massive headache.  The PG-13 time travel comedy,  \"Land of the Lost\" from General Electric's Universal Pictures is going  against Warner Brothers \"The Hangover,\" an R-rated bachelor party that  shows what happens in Las Vegas may leave you with a tiger, a baby, and a  missing groom.  Yes, that's right.</p><p>Here to tell us how the films will do and if either of them can  capture the upward mobility of Walt Disney's-Pixar's \"Up,\" joining me right  now is Bradley Jacobs.  He is the senior editor of \"Us Weekly.\"</p><p>Good morning, Bradley.  Good to see you.</p><p>BRADLEY JACOBS, US WEEKLY SENIOR EDITOR:  Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK:  No, wait a second.  Is \"Hangover\" PG-13 or R?</p><p>JACOBS:  That's definitely R-rated.</p><p>GLICK:  OK.</p><p>JACOBS:  R-rated movie.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, because -- OK, because I heard there's a lot of  profanity.  I just wasn't sure if it was -- OK.  Anyhow, I was saying to  you before that I was at the movies yesterday evening, and I came out and  there were these massive lines down the block.  I understand there were  midnight showings of \"Hangover.\"  What's the buzz?</p><p>JACOBS:  It had some of the best buzz of the year.  You know, for a  movie with no big stars, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, the concept is really  key here.  Four guys, a bachelor party that goes wrong, a missing groom,  there's a baby in the mix.  There's a stripper in the mix.</p><p>I saw it a couple of weeks ago.  I really loved it.  I think it is  going to be hugely successful.  R-rated summer movies are kind of the rare  thing.  So, you got -- you got the college students, you got -- </p><p>GLICK:  That's why I said, \"Are you sure it's R, are you sure it's  not PG-13\"?</p><p>JACOBS:  I am absolutely sure.</p><p>GLICK:  Are you sure?</p><p>JACOBS:  I am doubly sure that \"Land of the Lost\" is PG-13, and  that's more of a kids' movie although it's PG-13.  So, it's not really for  4-year-olds, it's not really for 6-year-olds.  It's sort of, you know, for  people in the PG-13 era, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds.</p><p>I think the battle between these two is really interesting.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, it is interesting.  I do want to bring in Harry Medved,  also from Fandango.com.</p><p>Because, Harry, I know you've been looking at \"The Land of the Lost\"  pre-sales (ph) and there are just completely non-existent.  Bradley was  telling me the reviews are just horrific.</p><p>You tell me, Harry, what did they get wrong with \"Land of the Lost\"?   Will anybody go see it?</p><p>HARRY MEDVED, FANDANGO.COM:  Well, you know, people are saying on  Fandango, the user reviews are saying it's perfect for 13 year olds of all  ages, especially if you're for bathroom humor, because it is PG-13.  But  there's plenty of dinosaur manure, dinosaur urine, masturbation jokes and  frequent uses of the S-word for any 13-year-old to wallow in.</p><p>Now, parents may not be too excited about it.  But at least it's not  the R-rated comedy of \"The Hangover\" that Bradley was just talking about.</p><p>GLICK:  But, Bradley, look, this is box-office projections for these  movies that are coming out of here.  And \"Land of the Lost\" is getting  some, you know, at least some decent -- I mean, not great, but decent  projections.  Is that because of Will Ferrell, you know, you just -- </p><p>JACOBS:  Will Ferrell is a huge star.  They run commercials  everywhere, marketing everywhere for this film.  They just want to get  butts in seats in the first few days before the word really spreads about  it.</p><p>But I actually think those productions may be wrong and you could  see \"Hangover\" end up number two this weekend.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  I mean, I was saying to you ... </p><p>JACOBS:  I do, too.</p><p>GLICK:  I was saying to you before, like, oh, my God, I had never  seen a movie marketed more than this one, oh my goodness.  OK.  How does  this stack up against up, against \"Star Trek\"?  You know, we had some big  blockbusters last summer.  You know, who turns out to be the big ones this  summer?</p><p>JACOBS:  Well, \"Up\" had a huge weekend last weekend, and I wouldn't  be surprised if \"Up\" were number one again this weekend.  It would be the  first time in more than a year that an animated movie has been number one  two weekends in a row.  But \"Up,\" you have that magic thing where the  critics love it and audiences love it -- which is very rare.</p><p>I saw it here in 3-D last weekend.  I want to see it again.  And I  think that there is incredible word of mouth for that film, because it's  one of those things where you can take your family.  You can take kids.   You can take teenagers.  You can take your friend.</p><p>You know, it's really in that magical place.  So, I think that will  be number one.</p><p>MEDVED:  You know -- </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, Harry, go quickly.</p><p>MEDVED:  I'm not sure you want to take kids under 6 years old,  because there are some terrifying elements to \"Up.\"  Now, on Fandango,  that's the place where people buy advanced tickets, we are seeing that \"Up\"  is leading the way for ticketing this weekend, it's about 42 percent of all  tickets sold on Fandango.</p><p>GLICK:  Wow.</p><p>MEDVED:  But \"The Hangover\" is gaining momentum.  There was a surge  of tickets last night.  Those people you saw online last night, Alexis,  they're all across the country.  Thursday midnight shows were sold out last  night.</p><p>I went to one last night and people came out of the theater saying,  \"I want to see 'The Hangover' again.\"</p><p>GLICK:  Wow.</p><p>MEDVED:  So, I think you will be surprised.  \"Hangover\" will not be  number two.  I think it will be number one.</p><p>GLICK:  I have to leave it there, Harry and Bradley.  I know what  I'm doing this weekend if only I could get a baby-sitter.  Gentlemen, thank  you very much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>JACOBS:  Thank you.</p><p>GLICK:  We'll be right back.  We're going to do a roundtable on jobs  as jobs numbers are due out in half hour.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Good morning and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm  Alexis Glick.  </p><p>We're about 30 minutes way from the release of the May employment report.   Expectations are for a loss of another 520,000 jobs, sending the  unemployment rate to 9.2 percent.  We are live at the U.S. Labor Department  in Washington, D.C., to break down those numbers.  </p><p>Also, Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is going to join us for his  analysis on those numbers.  And Roger Ballou, the CDI Corp. CEO, is going  to join me to break it all down.  </p><p>And news this morning that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's  top management, including perhaps CEO Vikram Pandit.  We're going to get  into those details in just a moment.</p><p>And on the jobs front, speaking of which, I will be talking to the labor  secretary coming up later this morning on \"The Opening Bell\" at just about  9:35 a.m. Eastern Time.  We'll get Hilda Solis' point of view on the jobs.  </p><p>Let's look at the markets, though.  We're in the green.  We're at the highs  of the morning.  Dow up 45.  S&amp;P up 5.  Nasdaq up 5 as well.  So across the  board we're up about 0.5 percent.</p><p>All right, let's get a look at the markets.  We have business contributor  Gavin Gray and Connell McShane.  Let's start with Connell.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Alexis, thanks very much.</p><p>As you said, we are trading higher ahead of the open this morning and  ahead, more importantly, of the jobs report because when you think about  it, all things can change here half an hour from now.  So, you know, and  that's all we're going to be talking about a half an hour from now.  So let  me give you a couple of stocks individually to watch.  Either way, no  matter what the jobs report comes out at, these are going to be stocks to  watch.  </p><p>Apple, right behind me, is definitely one of them.  There's a report in  \"The Wall Street Journal\" about Steve Jobs this morning.  Look at it going  from below $144 to almost $147 in pre-market trading.  So a nice little  boost.  The report in \"The Journal\" is Jobs is on track to come back on the  job as the CEO there after taking medical leave by the end of the month.   And there's even some speculation in that \"Journal\" article that he comes  back earlier.  </p><p>The big developer's conference next week.  The Palm Pre coming out over the  weekend.  The speculation, and again this might be getting ahead of  ourselves, is that Jobs maybe comes back ahead of schedule in order to  announce a new iPhone.  Either way, a lot of optimism about Apple.  </p><p>One other quick stock to watch, a company called Quanta Services.  PWR is  the ticker on it.  It is going to take the place of Ingersoll Rand in the  S&amp;P 500.  So Quanta, again, a power company that -- the index fund managers  are going to have to buy this stock.  It was up after hours. Ingersoll, by  the way, is reincorporates itself.  It's going to have its base in Ireland.   With a name like Connell McShane, there's not (ph) any problem with having  your base in Ireland.  But the S&amp;P doesn't like that because you're  supposed to be based in the United States.  They make the exception for  Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, which is where Quanta -- where Ingersoll was  based before that.  So they were allowed to be in the S&amp;P.  Now they're  leaving.  Quanta takes its place.  There you have it.  </p><p>Gavin Gray over in Europe with a look at those overseas markets for us now.</p><p>Gavin, take it away.  </p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Connell, thanks very much indeed.  I'm sure  they'll make an exception for you, as you say.</p><p>Looking at the European markets, in Asia it was a 1 percent club today.  It  is in Europe as well pretty much.  Starting off with the FTSE here in  London.  All waiting on announcements about Gordon Brown and his reshuffle.   But up 1.5 percent at 67 points, 4,454.  The CAC 40 in Paris, 3,347, up 35  points.  The DAX hardly shifting at all today.  Up just 33 points or 0.65  percent.</p><p>And despite that reshuffle in the U.K. cabinet, today we're getting details  coming through in bits and pieces.  Gordon Brown's position as prime  minister really does remain in jeopardy.  Some of the newspaper headlines  today really damaging.  Comes after four cabinet members have resigned in  just four days, causing many politicians to question whether Mr. Brown has  enough authority to continue at the head of the British government.  </p><p>One thing we now believe is really pretty certain is the chancellor, the  money man, the treasurer, Alistair Darling.  He has apparently told Gordon  Brown, I say as chancellor or I'm out.  And we do think that he is going to  stay as chancellor.  </p><p>All this political uncertainty has been weighing heavily on the British  pound.  It slid against the dollar in recent days.  Today it is down  against both the dollar and the euro.  And $1.61 will buy you one pound.   And the dollar against the euro, though, is down, and $1.41 will buy you a  euro.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.  </p><p>GLICK: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.  </p><p>Well, we could see the unemployment rate climb to 9.2 percent this morning  with the release of the Labor Department's May employment report.  Now  while that rate may be up, job cuts may be down for the second month in a  row with an estimated 520,000 job losses last month versus 539,000 lost in  April.  March, 699,000.  Now, states are getting their hands on some of the  $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help create  employment opportunities.  Is that enough?  And what are state and local  leaders doing right now with that money to create jobs? </p><p>Here's my take.  Number one, we need to basically stem the tide on the job  front and figure out what we're doing to address private sector jobs,  particularly those that are created by small businesses.  Number two, will  the work -- will the work programs -- will they ultimately work to retain  enough people?  Those worker training programs.  And number three, concern  that the stimulus package is ultimately not enough to help the jobs  situation.  Perhaps time is the only cure.  But keep in mind that the  underemployed numbers are much more disconcerting and you've got to make  sure you look at the big picture, not just the unemployed.  </p><p>Joining me right now is Mayor Virg Bernero of Lansing, Michigan, Mayor R.T.  Rybak of Minneapolis, and Steve Crowley, the host of \"American Scene\" radio  program and the financial TV program \"Wall Street Cast.\"</p><p>Good morning, everybody.  Good to see you guys.  </p><p>STEVE CROWLEY, \"AMERICAN SCENE\" RADIO HOST: Thank you, Alexis.  Thanks very  much.  This is great (ph).</p><p>GLICK: All right, Mayor Bernero, let me start with you.  Let me walk  through some of the numbers here.  The unemployment rate, as you know, in  Michigan, the highest in the country, 12.9 percent.  I understand you can  get a little less than $4 billion in the stimulus.  Is it enough to help  create and save jobs?  What are you doing? </p><p>MAYOR VIRG BERNERO, (D) LANCING, MICHIGAN: Well, look, a lot of it is going  into infrastructure.  It's going into roads.  It's going into retraining of  workers.  We're trying to get a business incubator up and going to generate  new ideas and for business startups.  </p><p>But, look, we've talked about this for months.  The best stimulus is a  stimulating job.  People need jobs.  They want long-term security.  And so  the temporary help is great.  We appreciate that.  But we need to restore  health in the economy.  </p><p>And, you know, Lansing dodged a bullet.  We were very fortunate not to have  any plant closures with GM.  In fact, our factories may get a little more  work.  But still, in the long run, we need a healthy auto industry.  We  need to make sure that we're making the cars of the future in places like  Lansing, Michigan.  </p><p>And I think the economy, in terms of people starting to buy again, I mean  they want that long-term future.  And when you talk about retraining, I'm  all for the retraining, but I've got e-mails from people all over the  country that say, you know, I've been retrained two or three times and the  job is eliminated.  And so what are we going to retrain them in? </p><p>And you and I have talked about this.  We need to have manufacturing.  I'm  not giving up.  I don't think we can be a post manufacturing society.  I  think we have to find a way that we have manufacturing in this country,  advanced manufacturing, and that means leveling the playing field on trade.   Until we do that, we're not going to have a permanent recovery.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes, I mean, Mayor Rybak, I'm concerned about the training efforts  too.  I mean that's what I keep hearing as one of the cures to solve the  problem here.  And I'm concerned that it's not really going to truly impact  job creation.  It's great to learn a lot of other, you know, things to do  and skills to have, but at the end of the day, it's not a job.  </p><p>MAYOR R.T. RYBAK, (D) MINNEAPOLIS: Well, I totally agree with your point.   I will say that in the middle of a recession, education and training is --  if you're ever going to do it, it's a good time to do it.  </p><p>But first and foremost, we didn't just wake up to the retraining issue when  the economy went south.  We've been doing it for a number of years.  When I  took office, unemployment was 1 percent higher in the city than in the  suburbs.  Today it's lower in the city than the rest of the region.  Very  few cities can say that.  The reason is because we've been in an ongoing  training effort for hard to employ people.  </p><p>Now when you hit a period of time like this, it's a big challenge.  You  have two things.  You have, one, the fact that there are a lot of people  who are out of work.  So, for instance, some of the key construction  trades, up to half the people will be sitting on the bench.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we know that coming up is going to be a new economy that's going  to be based a lot on clean energy, including some of the weatherization  work that really takes skilled workers.  So we have this tough problem of  needing workers in the future, but if you train them for trades where  there's high unemployment, you have a problem.  I spent all yesterday  morning meeting with trades and other folks trying to talk about that tough  issue.  </p><p>We do, however, have to say, you've got to create a job at the end of it.   So we've put a lot of our stimulus dollars into creating those new clean  energy jobs.  We've put some significant investment into solar, trying to  make sure that works.  We are training people to do solar installation.   We're training them to do green roof installation and are putting  incentives in it to create more green roofs.  </p><p>Now those are not going to bring back the manufacturing base of America.   And I agree with the mayor very much so.  I'm not giving up on making  things in America.  </p><p>I just got back from China.  And part of what we need to do as well is to  tap into a global economy.  We brought a Danish med tech firm into  Minneapolis and it's now moved into its headquarters here, 600 new jobs.   That's part of it too.  </p><p>But you have to home grow the economy.  You have to be part of global  economy.  And you have to have trained workers.  There's no one easy fix.  </p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>Steve, you talk to people every single day . . .</p><p>CROWLEY: We do.  </p><p>GLICK: Nationally syndicated radio show.  What are people saying to you  about the jobs environment? </p><p>CROWLEY: Well, sometimes you can't get a job in your local area.  Sometimes  people have to move.  We talked to one person who was a CPA/MBA, couldn't  get a job in south Florida.  If they would move to Houston, there's plenty  of jobs.  There's a shortage of CPA/MBAs.  So sometimes you do have to  retrain, go back to school.  People that learn Chinese right now can get a  job, I guarantee you.  </p><p>GLICK: So, you know, Steve, you've been doing this for a very long time.   Have you ever seen anything like this? </p><p>CROWLEY: No.  No one has really seen anything like this.  You have to go  back to the '30s, you know, to really see something like this.  This is an  unbelievable time in American history.  But I think it's getting a lot  better.  I think 12 to 18 months from now the market is predicting that the  jobs market is going to be better.  </p><p>GLICK: You know . . .</p><p>BERNERO: Let me say, Alexis, what's happened is the . . .</p><p>GLICK: Yes, Mayor Bernero, go ahead.</p><p>BERNERO: The chickens have come home to roost on this free trade.  We've  had unfettered free trade.  It's unilateral, economic disarmament.  And the  last speaker, you know, I appreciate -- I hope he's right that things turn  around, but there's a complete disconnect between the stock market, between  Wall Street and main street, because most of the production in this country  has been shipped overseas.  We've taken the P out of GDP, Gross Domestic  Product.  We've replaced it with a C.  We have Gross Domestic Consumption.  </p><p>And we have move so much with these unfair trade policies.  We've moved so  much of our production overseas that what you can see is the stock market  can recover, I think, because the production, most of it's overseas.  And  when you ship it to Malaysia and China and you can pollute the environment  and exploit the workers and pay a lot less, I guess Wall Street can make  more, but main street is hurting.  And I don't see that turning around  until we find a way to bring these jobs back to the United States.  </p><p>And it's not that these jobs evaporated.  That's a myth that these  manufacturing jobs just evaporated into the air because of technology.  Not  at all.  We have these jobs here in Lansing.  The new factories are  wonderful.  They are robotic.  And we have workers in them.  </p><p>But more and more of these high-tech, high-advanced manufacturing jobs are  going to places like Mexico and China.  And we've got to find a way to  reverse that and have fair trade that favors American workers, that allows  American workers to compete fairly.  </p><p>GLICK: Mayor Rybak, he raise as very important point.  Several states are  doing what they can to incentivize overseas operations to move here to the  United States, or incentivize U.S. companies who garner the lions share of  their revenues from international operations to stay in the United States.   But does that then raise a question of protectionism? </p><p>RYBAK: Well, I don't think the issue is protectionism as much as trying to  home grow an economy.  I mean, look, there are ways to ship jobs from  overseas.  But the thing Americans have always done is they've created the  job in the first place.  We're an incubator of innovation.  And if we  continue to incubate, then we can have not only the ideas, but the  manufacturing here.  </p><p>Now an example is, we're putting some of our stimulus dollars into helping  a company called Ken Kay Solar (ph).  It's a new approach to doing solar  that will hopefully make it cheaper to put it into homes.  So that's a  brain power idea.  But we need to also make sure that the person power  that's making it is done here as well.  </p><p>I think there's a really important moment when American ingenuity then  creates a product.  We do that well and will continue to do that well.  The  point is, is once that product is ready to be made, that we have to make it  here at home.  </p><p>I think the mayor made a good point in this whole issue of the unfair  competition of labor costs.  As I say, I was in China.  They're doing some  wonderful things.  But I sure as heck don't want my cousin or my  constituent getting some of the wages that are being paid over there.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes, right.  </p><p>RYBAK: So I think we need to certainly level the playing field, but also  recognize, hey, look, this is America.  We're not on our knees.  We know  what we're doing.  And we've done great things.  And we're going to do them  again.  Let's just get back to the basics of invention, incubation and  manufacturing.  We can do this.  </p><p>GLICK: You know, we heard yesterday some bright spots.  We heard about Wal- Mart hiring 22,000 people.  </p><p>CROWLEY: That's right.</p><p>GLICK: We've heard a couple of other companies start to say that they're  beginning to hire again.  That they're beginning to spend again.  You and I  yesterday talked about, you know, the ordering of jets and things of that  nature.  </p><p>CROWLEY: Right.  </p><p>GLICK: Are we starting to see those signs of life?  Are they starting to  suggest perhaps a bottom? </p><p>CROWLEY: I think it will all start with a good glimmer of hope, don't you?   But I -- you know, I really believe the small businesses, the nation's job  maker, net/net, Alexis, all new jobs are created by small business.  Apple  Computer and Microsoft started as small businesses and now employ a lot of  people.  </p><p>But a lot of companies that employ fewer than 50 people are now starting to  see the light.  We're getting reports back that the CEOs of these smaller  companies are saying, yes, business is picking up.  We're starting to bring  in our old employees that we let go.  And people who we cut down to 20, 30  hours a week, we're bringing back to 40 hours a week.  </p><p>So I think that's where the new jobs are going to be created.  And even  like cities like Lansing, which is a small business community too, I think  that's where the real job generation is going to happen.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes, you know, Mayor Bernero, I'm going to talk to the labor  secretary coming up in the next hour and the thing that worries me is that  the small business community, as Steve points out, which is something I  talked in one of my talking points, is essential for private sector jobs.   And what we saw in the last report is private sector jobs got hit so  tremendously.  Are we doing enough to help small businesses? </p><p>BERNERO: Look, look, number one, I mean, I just want to say, with all due  respect, you know, you help prove my point with the Wal-Mart.  I mean GM  lays off 20,000 high-paying, top of the line, top of the food chain  manufacturing jobs.  Twenty thousand.  Wal-Mart's hiring 20,000.  </p><p>It's the Wal-Martization of our economy and that's part of what's killing  us.  I mean that's great that Wal-Mart's hiring, that will give some hope,  but you're taking basically $26, $28 an hour jobs and going down to I don't  know what Wal-Mart pays, you know, $10 maybe if you're lucky.  So this is  part of the problem.  </p><p>Now as far as small business goes, one problem is the banking.  We've  helped banks at the top.  OK.  And, look, I'm not bashing Obama here.  I  mean the guy has inherited a mess and he's doing an admirable job with it.  </p><p>But we've helped banks at the top.  It hasn't trickled down to the  community banks.  The community banks, Steve's right, the small businesses  where the growth is, we all know that, there can't be any growth because  nobody can get a loan.  The community banks have been shut out.  While the  banks in Wall Street are getting help, the community banks, you know what  they're getting?  More regulation from FDIC.  They're getting tighter  regulations, tighter standards.  They're not getting any help.  And the  community banks weren't even part of the problem.  </p><p>So this has got to be addressed by the administration.  The community banks  are being strangle held and they're the ones that are -- that know the  people, that know the communities and know where the money should be given.   And they didn't do anything wrong.  They weren't involved in all the  chicanery that Wall Street was, but they're getting punished by the FDIC.   So this insanity has got to stop.  We need our community banks help.  </p><p>But the other thing, I want to just tell you, the small businesses are  hurting.  I've got e-mails and I've got people in my community, the small - - I can show you letters from union presidents and company presidents,  small business presidents, that sound just the same.  Main street America  is hurting.  Because when you wipe out manufacturing, you wipe out a lot of  the small businesses.  When I hear people say we're a service economy, what  are we going to service?  These small businesses are hurting because as so  much manufacturing has left, the small businesses -- of course we're in  Michigan.  I mean a lot of our small businesses were auto related, tool and  dye and this sort of thing.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes.  </p><p>BERNERO: They're hurting.  And I think this is true all across the country,  though.  You've had furniture makers and all sorts of small businesses that  are struggling to survive.  Again, I hate to sound like a one-note Nelly  (ph), but with that foreign competition.  </p><p>GLICK: You are incredible.  </p><p>Mayor Rybak, I just have to ask you the last question.  Are you going to  run for governor? </p><p>RYBAK: Oh, I -- we'll figure that out tomorrow.  But I want to say that  going back to the point of . . .</p><p>GLICK: Oh, we'll figure it out tomorrow.  You're -- the governor of your  state is saying that he's going to run -- he's going to go for the White  House.  </p><p>RYBAK: Well, he's going to get his butt kicked by Barack Obama, but that's  another thing.  </p><p>The point of the matter is . . .</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>RYBAK: I want to talk about jobs here.  </p><p>The point of the matter is, I absolutely strongly agree with the point that  was just being made about make things in America.  I do want to say,  though, that when you hear that a retail company is adding jobs, we don't  just want people behind the cash register, but speaking from the  headquarters of Target and Best Buy here in Minneapolis, some phenomenal  jobs are in that sector.  </p><p>But the other thing that happens in the economy in a period of time like  this is that as people go into transition, as sadly people leave a job and  try to figure out what to do next, you do have innovation.  And I think  that's one of the things we've got to work with, with the lending  community, and that is where sometimes the public sector needs to spur  innovation.  Someone leaves a company.  They get fired.  They get laid off.   They start to think about it.  They talk with their friend about what  they've always wanted to do.  This is when the new American jobs get  created.  </p><p>Now we can't be in la-la land about this.  They've got to make things too.   But I think innovation will help us at this point.  </p><p>GLICK: All right, sounds like the role of governor looks appealing.</p><p>All right, Mayor Rybak, thank you so much.  Mayor Bernero, and Steve,  gentlemen, thank you very much.  </p><p>All right, guys, we're going to take a quick break.  We've got the jobs  data coming out in just about 12 minutes.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Checking financial news now.</p><p>The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in its  boardroom.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be  bounced out.  \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S.  Bancorp CEO Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job.  The feds, of  course, own 34 percent of Citigroup.  </p><p>And the FDIC putting its program to rid the nation's banks of toxic assets  on hold.  The legacy loans program was supposed to begin with a trial sale  this month.  The FDIC says banks have proven they can raise private capital  without cleansing their balance sheets.  Therefore, the FDIC says the  program could come back later on in different form.  </p><p>And the FDIC is very busy today.  Also shutting down Silverton Bank.  The  troubled bank did attract interest from private equity folks, but the FDIC  said it had to do what was cheapest for the insurance fund and ultimately  shutting it down was cheaper.  Silverton was not a retail bank. Most of its  customers were actually other banks.  </p><p>All right.  Let's go over to Charles Payne and take a look at the Fox 50.  </p><p>Charles.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, thanks a lot, Alexis.  </p><p>Well, as you said, Citigroup, Apple, and Intel, they're all Fox 50 stocks  and they're all making news this morning.  Former Barclay's (ph) capital  investment manager and financial analyst Vn Man (ph), he joins us now to  break them all down.</p><p>And let's talk about this Citi thing because I don't think it's news that a  lot of people want to see Vikram Pandit go.  The bigger story here seems to  be Sheila Bair versus Timothy Geithner and the FDIC not only saying we want  to be in this game, we actually want more power.</p><p>VN MAN, FMR. BARCLAY'S CAPITAL INVESTMENT MANAGER: Yes, absolutely.  I mean  the -- what's going on here is the FDIC is essentially trying to get more  power than the comptroller.  But, you know, not since the days of Howard  Stern fighting the FCC have we seen government versus the private sector.   I mean this is really turning into a soap opera.  </p><p>On one hand you've got Sheila Bair and she interrupted kind of Citigroup's  ideas in the past.  I don't know if you recall when she actually -- when  Citigroup was trying to buy Wachovia and then Wells Fargo swept in there  and bought Wachovia instead.  And Sheila Bair backed Wells Fargo.  And so,  you know, there's kind of this struggle between . . .</p><p>PAYNE: There's definitely a power struggle going on there.  </p><p>Let's talk about Apple here.  </p><p>MAN: OK.</p><p>PAYNE: Big, big news.  Obviously tomorrow the Pre comes out.  But the  bigger news for folks on the Apple stock is that Steve Jobs is coming back.   And it always feels like Caesar returning to Rome.  So much excitement.   The stock is indicating it will open higher here.  What do you think is  going to happen?</p><p>MANN: You know, everybody -- me included -- everybody wants to know they  work for the best and the brightest.  And Steve Jobs, he's not just a  maverick.  You know, he's a hero to the people he works for and a hero to  the investors.  So people want to know that he's coming back.</p><p>But what's interesting is, over the last five months, since he left in  January, the stock has appreciated over 68 percent.  So the market believes  that Apple can continue to be successful, even without Steve Jobs there on  a daily basis.  </p><p>PAYNE: Right.  And we do have the bid ask.  It's up.  Indicating up almost  3 points here at the open.  </p><p>Having said that and the fact that you pointed out it's already up, as an  investor, if an investor came to you this morning and said, should I buy  this stock, what would you tell them? </p><p>MAN: You know, I love this stock.  I mean I actually have my own iPhone.   I'm a huge fan of the iPhone.  And the new one is coming out supposedly.   That's what we're hearing rumors is that it's going to come out at the  worldwide development conference.  </p><p>PAYNE: Let's talk about another big tech name.</p><p>MAN: Yes.  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Intel made a rare acquisition yesterday.  A company called Wind  River Systems.  What does that tell you that Intel is starting to make some  of these acquisitions? </p><p>MAN: You know, Intel has -- obviously they control the PC market, the  server market in terms of their chips.</p><p>PAYNE: But it's sort of like a one trick pony.  </p><p>MAN: Well, what this is doing, it's giving them access to customers.  I  mean who are the customers of Wind River?  The customers are Apple.  The  customers are Sony, Panasonic.  And this gives them access to those  customers.  So I think it's a good move.  </p><p>PAYNE: Quickly before I take it back to Alexis.  The stock closed at  $11.70.  The bid is $11.50. Does that tell you there could be another bid  coming for this company? </p><p>MAN: Yes.  I mean if they're making an offer of $11.50 and already, you  know, since Wednesday you see it's trading up to $11.70 that means there's  potentially somebody else or the market thinks that somebody else is going  to step in there and offer something -- you know, a higher number.  </p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot.  We really appreciate it.  That's fantastic.  </p><p>MAN: Thank you.  Thanks.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, Alexis, back over to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p>Coming up, Chrysler is back in court today.  Adam Shapiro is there live  with the very latest.  </p><p>And we are just minutes away from the May employment number.  We're going  to have that for you as it happens and a full break down.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: We've got some breaking auto news now.  Dow Jones Newswire is  reporting there will be no Opel launch in the United States due to a future  Magna deal.  </p><p>Chrysler heads backed to court today where the judge will hear from a group  trying to block its deal with Fiat.  Our own Fox Business' Adam Shapiro is  live outside the courthouse with the details on both of these developments.  </p><p>Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the latest, let's start with Opel  real quick.  There are Opels in the United States now.  They actually build  cars for Saturn and the Saturn Astra is one of them.  With the news that  Saturn may be sold to Penske Auto Group out of Detroit, you might still  have some kind of contractual agreement where Opel would manufacture cars  and be sold under the Saturn brand.  So to say Opel won't be launched in  the U.S. is accurate, but you can still get an Opel, it would just have a  different name.  </p><p>Now to Chrysler.</p><p>The appellate court, the three judge panel, will hear arguments starting at  2:00 as to why the deal with Fiat should be delayed.  Keep in mind, it was  Chrysler which asked for this emergency hearing.  They're trying to get the  panel to certify the sale so the deal can close before July 15th. But the  Indiana state treasurer, along with 12 other parties, are trying to stop  the deal and they've also petitioned to get the stay in place which now  exists.  They say, this is the exact quote, \"that the Indiana retirees and  Indiana taxpayers have suffered losses because of unprecedented and illegal  acts of the federal government.\"</p><p>Sources close to all of this say they expect a decision from the three- panel judges by late tonight, possibly early Saturday morning.  So  everybody will be watching to see if Chrysler and Fiat get the go ahead to  close their deal or if it will be delayed.  And if it's delayed past that  July 15th date where they say they have to close, Fiat has the option to  walk.  And if they do walk, Chrysler has to come up with $35 million as a  penalty for not closing many time.  </p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: OK.  Before I let you go, Adam, just to confirm here, the deadline  is June 15th, right, not July 15th.  </p><p>SHAPIRO: June 15th, not July.  June 15th.  I miss spoke.  June 15th.  </p><p>GLICK: OK, good.  I just wanted to confirm.  I want to confirm that.  </p><p>The other thing here is, is if, in fact, Fiat were to walk, what happens  with the role of the Treasury and the U.S. government in backstopping this  debtor in possession financing?  </p><p>SHAPIRO: That's a very good question.  We'll try and get that one answered.   But most people are not even addressing it.  They expect it to close.  But  it would throw the entire deal with Chrysler up in the air because the U.S.  government has said, without Fiat, there is no future for Chrysler.  </p><p>GLICK: All right.  Adam Shapiro, we will continue to keep a close eye on  these developments throughout the morning.  Thank you very much, Adam.  </p><p>Well, we are just about a minute away from the jobs data.  I want to bring  up the futures right now as we take a look at this here.  Expectations  right now for unemployment to rise to 9.2 percent.  It was 8.9 percent in  April.  Expectations are also for 520,000 job losses.  We did lose 539,000  jobs last month. </p><p>Now keep in mind, though, we have seen upward revisions time and time  again.  And those jobs numbers, January, February, March, were well north  of 600.  In fact, back in January, 740,000 job losses.  At this point, if  we lose about 500,000, we will have lost 6.2 million job since the start of  the recession according to the NABE.  That was December of 2007.  </p><p>As you can see, the futures are in the green.  So we're looking up to be in  positive territory here. But if we get something in the 500s, low 500s, the  anticipation is that the market will rally on the news that perhaps job  losses are beginning to subside.  </p><p>Let's go to Rich Edson.  He is at the Labor Department with the number.  </p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: 345,000 jobs lost.  345,000 jobs lost.   We've got an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent.  That's the highest since  1983.  There are 14.5 unemployed people in this country.  That is the  highest ever.  </p><p>Again, 345,000 jobs lost last month.  We had 539,000 jobs lost initially  last month, April, excuse me.  That number is now 504,000.  In March, the  initial number, 699,000 jobs lost.  That is now 652,000 jobs lost. </p><p>Since the recession began in December of 2007, the unemployment rate has  increased 4.5 percent and six million jobs have been lost.</p><p>Let's take a look at the private sector -- 338,000 jobs lost.  Government  fell 7,000 jobs.  The federal government dropped 15,000 jobs.</p><p>Leisure and hospitality, get this, up 3,000 jobs.  That's the first  increase since December of 2007 when the recession began.  Eight thousands  of those jobs are food and drinking services.</p><p>Education and health services up 44,000 jobs.  And credit intermediation,  if you are looking for those refinance jobs, down 6,000.  Those are people  who do refis if you are looking for an indication of that.  </p><p>Let's take a look at construction jobs, a little bit better than had been.   Manufacturing jobs, 156,000.  Let's start with that, 156,000 jobs lost for  manufacturing.  Motor vehicles and parts down 30,000.  </p><p>And since December of 2007, there have been 1.8 million jobs lost because  of manufacturing.  That accounts for three-tenths of all jobs lost since  there.  Construction employment down 59,000.  And believe it or not, that's  about half the average of the previous six months.  </p><p>Household wages averaging $18.54.  That is up .1 percent, year over year up  3.1 percent.  </p><p>Also, government was up 92,000 last month.  It was originally thought to be  up 72,000 -- excuse me, that's for the month of April.  The month of April  up 92,000, originally thought to be 72,000. </p><p>Alexis, we'll leave it there.  Back to you.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  So, before I let you go, Rich, just to review this here  right now, the 14.5 million people that are unemployed is the highest on  which record?  From what date?  </p><p>EDSON:  That was when record keeping began back in 1948.  So it's the  highest ever taken when they started all the way back in 1948.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, terrific.  And just before I let you go, any revisions?   No revisions to unemployment rate, revisions downward for April and March  in terms of non-farm payrolls?  </p><p>EDSON:  That's right.  We lost fewer jobs in April and March.  Originally,  it was thought in April that we'd lost 539,000 jobs.  That's now been  revised to 504,000 jobs, so a difference of 35,000 jobs on the good side.  </p><p>March, originally thought to be nearly 700,000, 699,000, we are now at  652,000 for the month of March.  That is a change to the good side of  47,000.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Rich Edison, what a surprise.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>Let's break down the numbers.  </p><p>Democratic Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is with us; Roger Ballou,  the president and CEO of the professional service company CDI; and John  Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Investor Services.  </p><p>Gentlemen, I'm in a little bit of shock, a little surprised.  </p><p>John, let me start with you.  You're my resident economist here.  </p><p>Why would the unemployment rate tick up from 8.9 percent to 9.4 percent and  yet in non-farm payrolls we lost a little less than 350,000?  </p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES:  Well, you know,  we first have to consider that these job estimates are taken from two  separate different surveys.  The unemployment rate is taken from a  household survey.  The count of jobs, number of jobs is taken from a survey  of employers.  </p><p>That being said, you know, one of the defining characteristics of this  recession has been the record length of unemployment.  So while fewer  people are losing their jobs -- and we pick that up from the recent decline  if first time jobless claims -- we still find that the number of people  that are out of work or collecting state unemployment benefits continues to  grow.  This is a recession where it was very damaging to have lost your job  because of the unusually long period of time it's taken to secure new  employment if you are that lucky.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  </p><p>Let me go to Congressman Sestak.  </p><p>Are you surprised by the numbers?  </p><p>REP. JOE SESTAK (D), PENNSYLVANIA:  Actually, I am.  I had expected them to  be in the low 500,000s.  In fact, when we ran the models several months  ago, if we had gotten to the low 500,000s or just below it by July, we  would have assumed everything was going according to script -- still  intense, but not intensifying.  What this data shows is that as compared to  past recessions, employers laid off employees much more rapidly when you  look at the data, which means that this stopping of the cratering of our  economy may come to a halt a bit more rapidly.  </p><p>I had expected unemployment to be about 9.2 percent.  And he is right,  overall, people who don't have any jobs and aren't seeking is about 16  percent.  But think about what else is now happening.  </p><p>The yields in the financial market have really come down.  We also see that  the housing market is beginning to see the bottom of housing prices  falling.  We also are seeing here that consumer spending is actually  beginning to increase as the rebates come back.  </p><p>In fact, if you compare May of this year, when our rebates came out from  the stimulus bill, to a year ago, it's hard to compare, because remember,  Alexis, a year ago in May, we also had a stimulus bill.  But when you see  the two, comparison, it appears as though consumer confidence is beginning  to come back.  We'll get to about 10 percent unemployment by the end of the  year, but I don't think we're going to go above it, and then we're out of  here, as Mr. Bernanke pointed out recently, and our economy begins to go  again.</p><p>GLICK:  You know, Roger, you are an outsourcing firm.  You deal with part- time and full-time workforce.  Have you been seeing improving trends, or is  this data a surprise to you?  </p><p>ROGER BALLOU, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CDI:  Actually, this data is confirmatory  of what we have been seeing throughout our business, our MRINetwork offices  across he country and our CDI professional staffing organizations, where,  if you look at it, there have been a lot of bright areas in the economy in  spite of the losses of jobs.  </p><p>For example, rural economies have continued to perform better than urban  economies, where they are driven by more commodities, agriculture, things  like that.  Secondly, the service sector, if you look at health care, has  actually been experiencing growth through this.  </p><p>We saw what appeared to be the beginning of the end of the recession at the  end of the first quarter in our numbers.  We saw it confirmed in April.  We  see it confirmed again here in May.  </p><p>So what we're seeing in this national data is confirmation of what our  MRINetwork offices and our professional organizations that we serve have  been seeing over the last two or three months.  So the actual exact number  I couldn't have predicted, but we did predict that it was beginning of the  end of the recession occurring in this last part of the first quarter,  first part of the second quarter.</p><p>GLICK:  Gentlemen, I want to bring up for just a moment what the market is  doing in reaction to this, because the market is reacting pretty favorably  -- that would be putting it lightly -- to this news.  </p><p>The market was up about 40 beforehand.  The Dow now up 135 points.  So  we're up 1.5 percent.  The S&amp;P right now is up 1.7 percent and Nasdaq up a  percent.  So we've rallied a full one percent in reaction to this.  </p><p>Two points.  </p><p>Congressman Sestak, let me first start with you on the president's fiscal  stimulus package.  He has tried to demonstrate in several speeches recently  that the fiscal stimulus is starting to work its way into the economy.   Money is being spent.  I think he recently said about 100,000 jobs have  been saved or created.  </p><p>Is this proof in the pudding that in fact it is starting to work, and it  was the necessary fuel that we needed to get everybody off the sidelines?  </p><p>SESTAK:  Yes, I believe it was one of the necessary tools.  We also have to  give a lot of credit to the TARP program and the TALF program, the second  one, as you well know, to the Federal Reserve, because they have gotten the  mother milk of our economy, credit, flowing again.  And so there's a lot  more confidence in the markets also.</p><p>But without a doubt, this economic stimulus bill intended to get money out  there so people would spend it.  A lot of it on retailing has started to  work.  Now what you are going to see is later this year, the construction  money -- only about six percent of it has been spent thus far -- is really  going to kick in just as the recession seems to be coming to a halt and is  ready to come up.  I think it's been well played.</p><p>GLICK:  You know, John, it's interesting.  I was speaking to Jim Rohr, the  chairman and CEO of PNC, and the other day he said, \"Alexis, one of the  greatest stimulus in this economy has been what the Fed has done because  those who have been able to refinance on average has saved about $300 on  monthly payments.\"  </p><p>I wonder, is that stimulus generated by refi activity enough to offset the  fact that as we sit here right now, oil is breaking above $70 a barrel,  it's at a seven-month high, and so what was perceived as a tax credit  because of declining gasoline and oil prices is now going to be a tax on  consumers?  </p><p>LONSKI:  You know, we have to keep our eye on energy prices, but I believe  that when consumers look at energy prices, they take a longer-term view.   And they didn't believe that oil was going to stay at $40 to $50 per  gallon.  </p><p>Consumer spending proceeds on the assumption the price of crude oil will be  in a range of $60 to $70 per barrel.  So we are hitting the upper end of  this range beyond which consumer spending might indeed suffer.  And so it  would behoove the administration to take any action necessary to prevent a  replay of what happened in the first half of 2008, when the price of crude  oil soared up to nearly $150 per barrel.  If that happens again, then the  wait for the next economic recovery will be longer than we currently  anticipate.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.</p><p>I mean, Roger, there's a lot of confluences of events right now that are  beginning to signal that perhaps the global economy is starting to heal.   The concern is -- and John brings up some great points -- is that  inflation, things of that nature become a bigger concern and act as a tax  on consumers or cause interest rates to rise.</p><p>What impact, if any, will all this have on the corporations that you talk  to on a daily basis who are looking to slowly but surely begin to bring new  employees into the fold?</p><p>BALLOU:  Well, I think two things.</p><p>Congressman Sestak commented earlier that -- I think what you saw this time  is a steeper quicker reduction in employment and inventories than we have  ever seen before.  I think that the information systems companies now used  to control their inventories and their production capacity led them to  react much, much more quickly.  What I think that's going to lead to is a  slower sustained recovery coming out of this, so it's going to be like a  reverse hockey stick, where you saw a quicker downtick, but a gradual  uptick that will come.  </p><p>I also agree that I think the financial programs are the key driver of the  uptick here.  I don't think that much of the stimulus has kicked in yet, so  I suspect that the bigger stimulus effect here has been the credit markets  opening up, and that leading to enhanced consumer confidence and business  confidence.  </p><p>The other thing that's gone on is the global economy, where you see the  Indian economy continuing to grow very, very strongly.  You see the Chinese  economy in resurgence based on their stimulus programs.  So I think those  things are contributing significantly to the uptick as well.  </p><p>So, it is an interconnected global economy.  In our case, I think the  financial programs have been very, very critical to it.  I also think the  president himself has been instilling confidence through his communication,  through his demeanor, through the programs that he's launched.  And this is  a very -- you know, people's psyches are fragile, but they also can move in  a positive direction, very, very quickly, and I think you are beginning to  see that occurring.</p><p>GLICK:  Congressman Sestak, I'm going to give you the last word.  </p><p>One of the things about the data shows that number of hours worked have  dropped.  Productivity, as we just saw yesterday, is rising.  </p><p>One material concern out there is that we will see declining wages, that  we've seen declining wages, but that it will be a bigger issue that the  consumer will still remain fairly tapped out.  And because we've figured  out how to accomplish more with less workers, that some of those jobs may  not come back.  </p><p>How important is it to find those future jobs that will perhaps replace a  lot of the millions of jobs of the six million that we have seen since the  recession began?  </p><p>SESTAK:  This is an excellent point you make.  </p><p>We have lost about a trillion dollars in our GDP as compared to our 2007  GDP high peak.  And if we just have an economy, as was just mentioned, that  grows slowly, and let's just say it grows at 2.5 percent, which was the  average between 2001 and 2007, it will take us three years to soak up that  $1 trillion of lost GDP capacity.  Which means if we don't grow more  rapidly, we won't be creating these jobs that you spoke about.  </p><p>That's why the president's budget is absolutely critical.  If he is -- and  I believe he is -- intent upon in succeeding in retooling the economy in  the types of jobs, the green energy jobs, the ability to reform our health  care system, those parts of this budget will be absolutely critical.  </p><p>Second, I go back that we have to do more in the entrepreneur incentives by  the right tax incentives to get that extra bump to our economy above 2.5  percent growth in the next few years to come, or we won't create those  jobs.</p><p>GLICK:  Right.  Good point.</p><p>SESTAK:  Because China is growing this year 6.8 percent as we lose about  five or six percent.  So that's why this is important, your point.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, guys.  We are going to leave it there.  Terrific,  terrific discussion.  </p><p>I'm glad to see we've seen some relief in the numbers, but remember still a  lot of people unemployed in this economy.  </p><p>Congressman Sestak, Roger and John, thank you so much, gentlemen.  </p><p>SESTAK:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.</p><p>GLICK:  A reminder, by the way please join me, 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time.  I  will be speaking to the labor secretary, Hilda Solis, in a \"First on Fox\"  interview here to break down this May employment number.  So please tune in  for that.  We'll get an opportunity to get her thoughts in just about 45  minutes.  </p><p>All right.  Coming up, more jobs lost.  We're talking to students just  entering the working world about their hunt for employment.</p><p>And of course we will head live to the New York Stock Exchange for a little  bit of a preview on what is now a market that's looking pretty good.  </p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  All week we have been taking a look at the nation's growing deficit  as a result of government spending as something we called red ink.  Now,  MONEY FOR BREAKFAST teamed up with the college news service U-Wire to take  a closer look at Generation Debt, the students of America who will inherit  the current deficit  </p><p>Some of those students told us the financial worries that are keeping them  -- frankly, they're keeping them up at night.  Take a listen to what they  had to say.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My biggest financial concern is just to find a job  after I graduate.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm more worried about people my parents' age who have  just seen their retirement funds completely be gone.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My parents' businesses since December, like, their  sales have been halved.  And that kind of really affects me because I'm in  school now.  I can't help them out.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My personal biggest financial concern is just being  able to live the life that we're expected to live as -- you know, again  since I came from a background where my parents didn't necessarily have a  lot of money, I think there was a big expectation for me coming to college  and getting the job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK:  Well, as you heard, some of the students we spoke to say finding a  job is their top worry.  With roughly 1.5 million graduating seniors  entering the workforce this year and a loss of another 500,000 -- well, now  actually we have seen 350,000 jobs in May, according to the most recent  survey -- what will they do?  And is now the time to figure out other  options?  </p><p>Joining us right now, Emily Sutherland, who is heading into her senior year  at Colorado State; Leah Finnegan, who graduated from the University of  Texas this year; and Dean Van Tassell, who received his MBA from Pace  University just two weeks ago.  </p><p>Good morning, guys.  Good to see you.  </p><p>LEAH FINNEGAN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS GRADUATE:  Good morning.</p><p>DEAN VAN TASSELL, RECEIVED MBA FROM PACE UNIVERSITY:  Good morning.</p><p>EMILY SUTHERLAND, HEADING INTO SENIOR YEAR AT COLORADO STATE:  Good  morning.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, Dean.  Let me talk to you.</p><p>You just graduated two weeks ago from Pace University.  You have been on  the job hunt.  What have you been experiencing?  </p><p>VAN TASSELL:  Well, first of all, thank you for having me on the program.   And BB&amp;T Capital Markets loves Fox Business.</p><p>GLICK:  Oh, that's good to know.  Thanks.  </p><p>VAN TASSELL:  I have been applying to, let's see now, about 70 different  investment banks, writing the HR departments, following with managing  directors, trying to get my name out there as much as possible.  I have a  nice stack of rejection letters right now, so it's rough out there.  </p><p>You know, you have to start making contingency plans.  And it's -- you  know, we're up to 9.4 percent.  The only solace I have is that maybe the  9.4 percent unemployment is backwards looking, and the market seems to be  shrugging it off today.  So hopefully we will have second derivative fever  and things will start to level out and pick up relatively soon.</p><p>GLICK:  Leah, you just graduated from the University of Texas.  You have a  BA in American studies.  </p><p>What kind of jobs have you been looking for?  </p><p>FINNEGAN:  I'm actually going into journalism, which is, you know, quite an  experience at this time.  And I applied to about 20 jobs, and I heard \"No\"  from about five.  And then I just didn't hear from the rest of them.  So  it's kind of like applying to a black hole.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, radio silence.  </p><p>So what did you decide to do when you just weren't getting back any  responses or you were just getting rejection notes without even, as I  understand, getting an opportunity to even interview?  </p><p>FINNEGAN:  Well, my contingency plan was grad school, and I wasn't sure if  I wanted to go, and kind of applied on the lark and ended up getting into  grad school and not getting into any jobs.  So grad school it is.</p><p>GLICK:  So you're going to Columbia?</p><p>FINNEGAN:  Yes.</p><p>GLICK:  My alma mater.  </p><p>FINNEGAN:  Oh, OK.</p><p>GLICK:  Very excited.  OK.</p><p>Now Emily, let me talk to you.  I understand you are majoring in  communications.  You are going to be a senior this year at Colorado State.  </p><p>When you listen to what's happening to Dean and Leah and I'm sure a lot of  your other classmates, how is that impacting you?  How nervous does it make  you knowing that you are going into your senior year of college?  </p><p>SUTHERLAND:  Well, it makes me really nervous, of course.  A lot of my  friends have graduated.  A lot of them have resulted in working at  Starbucks and their degree has gotten them absolutely nowhere.  So I just  hope that things pick up so I actually do have job opportunities out there  once I graduate.</p><p>GLICK:  Dean, you smiled there.  I mean, how many of your friends and  colleagues have had to do that?  Like, you might have had aspirations of  working on Wall Street or working in a particular sector, but there's no  opportunities and you have to get what you can get.  </p><p>VAN TASSELL:  I know a lot of people who would be lucky to get a job at  Starbucks.  It's hard.  </p><p>I will probably have to go back to bartending for a little bit, but it seem  just as competitive as Wall Street, if not more.  You have a lot of people  laid off and in the same position I'm in, so a lot of people just don't  have any options, even contingency plans.  </p><p>The number one thing I hear is there's a lot of government jobs out there,  but the mentality of, I want to work on Wall Street, I'm very aggressive, I  want to be in the financial markets than going into a government job, it's  a bit different from what you have expected might be around after you  graduate.  So...</p><p>GLICK:  Right.</p><p>And Leah, how many other classmates of yours have said they are going to  choose to continue to go back to school because that's really the only and  best option?  </p><p>FINNEGAN:  A really good number.  It is a very popular option right now.   And I don't know, I'm kind of finding the whole experience a bit freeing,  and I think a lot of people my peers are as well, that now we have this  time right now to kind of relax and discover what we really want to do.</p><p>GLICK:  Good point.</p><p>FINNEGAN:  and then we have the rest of our lives to do it.  So there's not  so much pressure to be successful and make more than $100,000 right out of  college.</p><p>GLICK:  Great point.  </p><p>I wish you all the best success.  Leah, Dean and Emily, thank you guys so  much.  </p><p>VAN TASSELL:  Thank you.</p><p>FINNEGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>SUTHERLAND:  Thank you.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, guys.  We're going to take a break.  We will be right  back with \"THE OPENING BELL\" in just a moment.  We're just about five  minutes away.  </p><p>All right.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Welcome back.  It's time for \"The One Thing You Should  Know.\"</p><p>Connell, you were watching actually the bond market reaction to the jobs  data.  What did you see happen?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, a big move up in yields, which is really going to be the  story that we're going to have to follow very, very closely, Alexis, when  you think about it.  </p><p>And Charles, you and I talked about this, the idea that hey, maybe the  economy has bottomed out and things are starting to look better, but what  about rising yields, rising mortgage rates, and other things?  And does  that cut off the recovery?</p><p>GLICK:  It could be a tough bear market for the bonds.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Absolutely.  And also, I was looking at equities.  I thought the  Dow and this type of number would be up 200, 300 points.  I'm serious.  I  think we have a conflict here with the unemployment number being 9.4.</p><p>GLICK:  I agree.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Two separate surveys -- the Household Survey saying, listen, it's  tough, it's tougher than the way the businesses maybe are looking at it.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  You've got to wonder why the divergence.</p><p>And speaking of which, actually, I'm going to talk to Labor Secretary Hilda  Solis coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time.  So tune in.   She will he' be joining us \"First on Fox.\"</p><p>All right, guys.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC.

What will happen to him next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're serving these stories and much more this morning on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>Good morning and happy Friday. Welcome to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>Coming up this morning, much more on the latest on GM Saturn sale and that possible shakeup at Citigroup.</p><p>Plus the smart phone war is heating up as Palm gets ready to release its new device; it's called the Pre. And it goes public later today. We'll get a preview of that phone.</p><p>And all this as reports that <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is ready to return to the helm after a six-month medical hiatus. Could Apple be making a big announcement as early as next week?</p><p>Plus, the May unemployment numbers are due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. All eyes are on this number. Expectations are for a loss of another 520,000 jobs; unemployment to reach 9.2 percent. We'll see in just moments.</p><p>Roger Ballou, CDI Core President and CEO and Representative Joe Sestak from Pennsylvania are both going to join me to break down those numbers when they come out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>We'll also have a terrific roundtable discussion on where the jobs are being created in the state and local municipalities. Is the fiscal stimulus package actually helping create enough jobs?</p><p>Let's take a look at the futures right now as we get started. As you can see across the board we're in the green; right now the DOW up 36; S&amp;P up four; NASDAQ up three. So across the board we're up just fractionally.</p><p>Let's get directly to the markets. Fox Business contributor Gavin Gray is in for Mr. Ashley Webster in London. And Connell McShane is here with us right now. Let's get started with Connell here in New York -- Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning Alexis. Yes we're certainly watching those markets closely, you showed us the futures moving a little bit higher indicating we might get a higher open at the final trading day of the week.</p><p>But all of that can change of course; 8:30 a.m. Eastern time will be the big number on jobs. Now, speaking of jobs in a different -- speaking of it in a different way, <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is making big news at Apple.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning reporting he is on pace to take back the CEO position to come back on to the job as planned and with that said, from medical leave, the stock is getting a nice boost this morning.</p><p>All of that kind of plays into what Alexis was talking about a little while ago, the back and forth between Apple and Palm; Palm coming out over the weekend with its Pre. Not only might jobs come back as planned here but the idea is maybe he comes back a little earlier than planned.</p><p>There's a big developer's conference next week and the thinking is maybe Jobs comes back for that, announces a new iPhone. We'll see that getting a little bit ahead of ourselves but the \"Journal\" starting that speculation this morning.</p><p>Investors seem to like it. The Apple stock price as you see there up to 147 in change pre-market trading.</p><p>Ok, let's see what the European markets are up to this morning as we do now head over to Gavin Gray in London -- Gavin.</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Connell thanks very much indeed. Let's first of all have a look at the markets over here; all really waiting on particularly in Europe and Britain waiting really for the results of the cabinet reshuffle.</p><p>But let's kick off in London with the FTSE. That is currently up 67 points leading the way at 4,454; the CAC-40 now gaining of a bit of strength as well, up 28 points. And the DAX really hasn't moved much all morning. Just up 21 points or 0.4 of a percent.</p><p>As really as I said, eyes looking at Downing Street, waiting for this Cabinet reshuffle. We haven't had it confirmed yet but we do believe that the Alistair Darling who is the current Chancellor -- the moneyman is going to keep his position. It's rumored he told Gordon Brown I either have this job or I don't have a job in your cabinet. We do think that he is going to remain as Chancellor. One or two other movements, we believe a fourth Minister has resigned. That is the fourth in just four days.</p><p>And also a report that U.K. inflation continues to fall. A sign about that the Office of National Statistics says the price of manufactured goods has come down just 0.3 percent year on year, largely because of the oil price coming down in that last year, but of course oil is coming back up. But that is the biggest annual decline since June 2002.</p><p>Alexis back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Gavin thank you very much.</p><p>Well, auto news now. It is a hot topic.</p><p>Breaking news this morning the \"Wall Street Journal\" says auto dealer Roger Penske will reportedly buy the Saturn brand from General Motors. Sources say, Penske would buy vehicles from GM and Renault then sell them under the Saturn brand. No word yet on how much Penske is paying. An official announcement is to be made later today.</p><p>And the deal to sell Hummer to a Chinese company may have hit a bump in the road. Some experts say regulators in Beijing may block it because the Hummer brand goes against China's focus on fuel efficient vehicles.</p><p>And GM will finance a huge part of a private equity firm's buyout of parts maker Delphi. GM will provide $2.5 billion of the $3.6 billion -- that specific $3.6 billion price tag. In return GM buys back four Delphi plants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL PACINO, ACTOR: Something really wrong is going on here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are out of order.</p><p>PACINO: You're out of order, you're out of order. The whole trial is out of order. They are out of order.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: And there you have it. That was Al Pacino. I'm not sure if you remember in the courtroom black comedy \"And Justice For All\" which details chaos in the court system. And some think that's precisely what's going on today with the Chrysler bankruptcy hearing.</p><p>A judge in New York will hear arguments from a group trying to block the deal with Fiat. Opponents include a group of Indiana state pension funds and a dozen other parties.</p><p>Speaking of which, for more on what we can expect today, let's go directly down to lower Manhattan to our own Adam Shapiro who is standing outside the U.S. Court of Appeals.</p><p>And Adam I'm not sure it's quite Al Pacino style but it seems like it's getting pretty close.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it could be close, but the Indiana - - the lawyers for the Indiana State Treasurer Richard Murdock are going to be arguing on behalf of 100,000 Indiana pensioners, police officers as well as teachers that the sale to Fiat violates all kinds of bankruptcy law as well as the TARP law -- the law which created the Trouble Asset Relief Program. That's the argument they're going to make in court.</p><p>First, that senior secured lenders like the pensioners are being given a secondary position in this bankruptcy which is counter to Bankruptcy Law. Second, that the TARP was originally created to help financial institutions not automobile companies and that's a violation of the Troubled Asset Relief Program that was set up last year.</p><p>And that third, this is just a deal that is not good for the U.S. taxpayers. That's the argument they're going to make in court. And that argument lost. They didn't gain any ground with that argument when they presented it to Judge Arthur Gonzalez at the Bankruptcy Court.</p><p>They've also argued that this was a private plan agreed to before, they called it a Sub-Rosa plan, before Chrysler filed for bankruptcy, but again, Arthur Gonzalez said no that's just not the case. That's what the Appellate panel is going to hear; the three judges on the Appellate Court.</p><p>They're also going to be considering Chrysler's motion to certify the sale. If that happens, if the Indiana pensioners lose and Chrysler wins and the sale is certified, you can expect that sale to close almost immediately because Chrysler says it has to close the deal with Fiat by the 15th of June or else Fiat has the option to walk away from the table and worse it walks away with $35 million from Chrysler as a penalty for failing to close the deal.</p><p>So there's a lot riding on this decision today, Alexis.</p><p>One other thing in regards to that Hummer sale and the report that the Chinese are making perhaps a problem as to closing that deal because Hummers aren't fuel efficient. Hummer dealers will tell you that the H-3 which is the smaller Hummer -- it's built on the Chevy Colorado platform -- they'll tell you it gets better gas mileage on the highway than some of the import SUVs like the Lexus. So that's an argument that they are probably ready to fight.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Adam. I was just going to ask you about that, I appreciate it. All right, we'll check in with you a little later outside the court.</p><p>All right, well Chrysler is fighting two courtroom battles which Adam just talked about in its push to exit bankruptcy and merge with Fiat. In addition to today's hearing with the group of those Indiana state pensions and investment funds that are looking to block the deal. Close to 800 of the Chrysler's dealers are making their case in court. They made it yesterday to put the breaks on the plan.</p><p>For a closer look at the impact of the courtroom battles, Laurie Moncrieff is the president of Schmald Tool &amp; Die, an auto parts supplier that did business for Chrysler, and joining us on the phone Jim Anderer, the owner of Island Jeep in Long Island who is fighting in court to keep his business open.</p><p>Laurie, don't worry about the people behind you. I saw you telling people to keep quiet. Believe me I do that every single day. All right Laurie, tell me first of all, what does this delay mean to you and your business?</p><p>LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE: The manufacturers have been feeling the effects of what's been happening in the auto industry for quite some time. So quite frankly we're ready to get on with business.</p><p>The markets up here have been largely frozen because of what's going on in our economy in Michigan with the Detroit three. So in our opinion, we feel that moving forward quickly with the bankruptcy would be a help to the manufacturers.</p><p>GLICK: And Laurie, explain specifically what it is that you guys do and sort of where you fit into the food chain here in terms of how this impacts your business.</p><p>MONCRIEFF: We do precision machining and make dyes for the auto industry as well as many other industries. And quite frankly, all this upheaval is affecting a lot of industries besides just the auto industry.</p><p>GLICK: Great point.</p><p>Jim, I know you're joining us by phone. You've been kind enough to be here on several occasions. You're fighting to keep your dealership alive. You are one of those who received a pink slip. Tell me why the delay of this judgment of this decision could actually help you.</p><p>JIM ANDERER, PRESIDENT, ISLAND JEEP (via telephone): Hi, Alexis. Well, thanks for having me.</p><p>The delay helps me only in regard that it can possibly nix this deal. This is a bad deal for the American taxpayer. It's a bad deal for pretty much everybody involved, in my opinion.</p><p>I know that the vendor on the other line, you know, has her own agenda, and I'm sympathetic to that. But in my personal opinion this is a tragedy that's taking place in the American marketplace. It's putting 100,000 people out of work. It's really devastating to our economy right now. And I would like to see it nixed to be honest with you. I don't think it's a good deal...</p><p>GLICK: Ok, so Jim...</p><p>ANDERER: I think that Fiat is coming into this deal with no cash. And it's wrought with a lot of problems.</p><p>GLICK: Jim, you and I have talked about this before, and you have been in the courtroom. In fact you were in the courtroom yesterday speaking on behalf of those dealers who are being forced to shut down.</p><p>What convinces you that if the deal were not to go through with Fiat, that a liquidation of Chrysler would put you in a better position than if this deal were to go through?</p><p>ANDERER: Very simply that the market forces that would take place is exactly what should take place. The market forces would seek their own level which is the way it should be.</p><p>Ok, what's going on with this taxpayer bailout and all this other stuff? I mean, you know, give me a break. If -- whatever these particular brands are worth when they're in liquidation would be sold for what they are worth.</p><p>Ok I'm a stand-alone Jeep store. Jeep is never going to go away. It is going to be picked up by somebody. And whoever that is, is going to make a real go of it. But there's a false propping up of these brands is insanity. This is just not the way things should be done in a free marketplace.</p><p>GLICK: Laurie, let me switch to you for a moment. You actually feel that if they can make it through bankruptcy, that as suppliers, your position will be that much safer and more secure. Explain to people why that is.</p><p>LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE: Well, it's always a lot more risky to do business with a company prior to bankruptcy than after bankruptcy so we felt a huge disruption, and quite frankly in the tool and die industry, we felt a huge disruption for many, many years and we've seen this coming for many years.</p><p>We've known there's been instability in the market for many years. We were somewhat of the canary in the mines frankly in this economy and have been discussing the problems in tooling and in manufacturing since the early 2000 because we could feel that it was very unstable, and that the economy was not doing well quite frankly in the early 2002, 2003.</p><p>There were a lot of discussions about the problems in the market. So while many of the dealers and other segments of the auto industry quite frankly probably weren't even aware of the problems we were very much aware of it in our industry.</p><p>GLICK: So Laurie when you look at the current environment, I mean look, you live in Flint, Michigan. We're actually going to talk to Virg Bernero a little bit later on this morning.</p><p>What are people doing right now to either make sure that companies like you are diversifying your risk or finding other viable job opportunities because I imagine everything is tightened up in Michigan?</p><p>MONCRIEFF: Everything's not only tightened up. It's frozen in the market right now. And it's not just the auto industry, it's the financial markets are really playing a huge role. The state of Michigan has been basically red lined by a lot of banks so lines of credit are being pulled, very much a big problem with getting financing to operate your business.</p><p>And then even in other industries when you diversify, we're feeling a lot of difficulty in a lot of other industries that are not even part of the auto industry because the financial market up in Michigan is frozen, as I said. So we're very anxious for the market to be unfrozen, whatever it takes to do that.</p><p>We need financing. We need money to start flowing to survive. That's basically what we're doing up here in Flint is working very, very hard to survive this right now.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, Laurie, we wish you the very best. And Jim, you too. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to join us this morning.</p><p>ANDERER: Thanks, Alexis.</p><p>MONCRIEFF: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: Coming up, Countrywide's cofounder <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>charged with fraud by the SEC. The Judge is going to join us with his take.</p><p>And later the Palm Pre hits stores tomorrow. Will it take a bite out of Apple's iPhone? There's a lot of buzz about this. We're going to tell you about it in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: In court now, two executives from a defunct Seattle investment management firm are charged with running what prosecutors call one of the largest tax fraud schemes ever uncovered in the country. Quellos founder, Matthew Krane and CEO Jeffrey Greenstein and two others are charged with fraud, tax evasion and money laundering. Prosecutors say they created more than $1.3 billion in fraudulent losses for clients. Quellos used to be one of the world's biggest managers of mutual funds.</p><p>A jury not a judge will hear claims in a case between American International Group, AIG and Star International, the company controlled by Maurice Greenberg AIG's former CEO. The trial will now start June 15th. There are several lawsuits outstanding between AIG and Mr. Greenberg and sure wants Star to return AIG stocks and proceeds from stock sales. AIG received billions of dollars in federal bailout funds.</p><p>And the Securities and Exchange Commission charges former Countrywide CEO <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>with fraud and insider trading. Prosecutors say Mozilo and two other former executives misled investors about risky lending practices. The SEC also says Mozilo unloaded $140 million in Countrywide stock using insider information. It is the first case against a high-profile executive stemming from the sub prime mortgage meltdown. Mozilo has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer calls the SEC's allegations baseless.</p><p>Our fox news senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us right now for a look at the case. The judge is in the house and he's going to give us some explanations here. Judge, good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning Alexis. Good to see you.</p><p>GLICK: surprised by this announcement?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm surprised by this announcement. I expected -- and that would be standard operating procedure in a case like this -- an indictment rather than a civil lawsuit. This is a civil lawsuit the Securities and Exchange Commission says you didn't tell your opinion of your own products to your shareholders, and that caused them to acquire shares ignorant of what you thought of the products.</p><p>What did he think of them? Well the SEC got some e-mails, and in that he referred to his own products as toxic and poison. Now, that's the bad news that he said that in these e-mails. The good news for him is he was not indicted. He was not charged with a crime. The feds may still be investigating for that purpose.</p><p>But standard operating procedure in cases of fraud and insider trading is to indict and convict first and then to sue civilly. So the fact that they are suing him civilly, they are just looking for money and an order from a judge that he can never run a public company again. They are not looking to take away his freedom, tells me they don't have enough evidence to indict him or convict him.</p><p>GLICK: It's interesting because involved in this case also being charged with this as well is his chief operating officer and the CFO. All three of which are saying that number one, it's baseless. That they did divulge the proper information throughout the entire reporting process, and they say look the fact of the matter is the SEC has not done anything right in years, and they are using them as the poster child for what the SEC should have done over the past five years.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, the SEC's failures is a political argument that the court will not allow them to make to a jury. But the court will let them say this, \"Look, you have accused us of failing to share our opinions with everyone. You haven't us accused of failing to share facts.\"</p><p>This is not Enron or WorldCom where inaccurate data was given out. This is just a case where an opinion like toxic and poison wasn't shared with the public.</p><p>GLICK: Ok, but what is the chance, though, that when you read what the SEC is suggesting here, that this is brought on to suggest that it is very much like an Enron case, where they were not divulging material public information that could have affected decisions of shareholders, investors, etc.?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It is a question of law for the court to decide. Is it material information what the CEO's personal opinion is of his products? These are not facts now. They didn't hide numbers. They didn't cook books. They just held back these words like toxic and poison.</p><p>Flip side of this is, if this was really insider trading, they would have indicted him. But because they haven't indicted him, what it is, is using insider knowledge to sell; knowledge that anyone else could have gotten had they looked into the books.</p><p>GLICK: Let's bring up one of those e-mails dating back to 2006 because I want people to hear specifically what he said. \"In all my years in the business, I have never seen a more toxic product.\" That was one e-mail.</p><p>He also sent another e-mail regarding a certain kind of sub prime loan. And he said \"it is the most dangerous product in existence, and there can be nothing more toxic. Loans had been originated through our channels with disregard for process and compliance with guidelines.\" This is where he's talking about the fact that the procedure for getting loans was just way too simple.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know what the defense is? \"The government wanted us to do this and Fannie and Freddie took them off our backs and the shareholders are no longer at risk.\" That's the defense that he'll make and that's true.</p><p>The government did want those subprime loans given out and Fannie and Freddie did take them off the backs of Countrywide and others. That is inappropriate in my view believing in a free market. That's what the government did and that's why we have this crisis.</p><p>GLICK: Let's talk about one of the domino effects here. There's no doubt in my mind that Senator Christopher Dodd is climbing in a shell, perhaps in a bunker, as a result of this. He was one of those on the sort of Mozilo list of getting what some argue is a better mortgage. What do you make of this for Dodd?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: This is very bad news for Chris Dodd who already is suffering politically in Connecticut as a result of this. He's up for reelection in 2010.</p><p>Just as <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>kept from shareholders his opinion of his own product, Chris Dodd kept from voters the fact that <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>gave him an absolute sweetheart deal.</p><p>What's the relationship between Chris Dodd and <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo? </nameText></person>Chris Dodd is the chairman of the senate banking committee which regulates these things and writes the laws to control them. And he's accepting an enormous benefit that the public could never get from the CEO of one of the biggest companies he's writing the laws to regulate. The voters of Connecticut will have their say on this one, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, this is ugly. And then that whole issue with the AIG, the wording of the bonuses and the fiscal stimulus package. Oh my goodness.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Senator Dodd's also deep into that one.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. Judge, thank you very much. Great seeing you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Happy Friday. Have a great weekend.</p><p>GLICK: Happy Friday.</p><p>Also again I do want to say Mozilo has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer David Siegel calls the SEC allegations baseless. As for the other defendants, they attorney for David Sambol called this \"a baseless complaint that is a result of the political pressure the SEC is facing for the well-publicized enforcement failures.\"</p><p>And Eric Sieracki's attorney meanwhile says the SEC's case is \"without merit. Countrywide's stock performance was tied to the fortunes of the real estate and secondary markets for loans. Something all investors knew about.\"</p><p>I just wanted to clear up some statements from their attorneys.</p><p>Coming up, Charles Payne offers up his stock choices.</p><p>And President Obama meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel today; the president reassured the Europeans about the U.S. economy. We will tell you what he had to say when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Gavin Gray with a look at this morning's top news stories.</p><p>President Obama is meeting with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel today after bilateral meeting addressed in castle (ph), President Obama held a joint press conference with the German chancellor. The president reassured the Europeans about the U.S. economy. Take a listen to what he had to say here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In the United States we are working diligently to strengthen financial regulations, to ensure that a crisis like this doesn't happen again. And it is going to be very important to coordinate between Europe and the United States as we move to strengthen our financial regulatory systems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAY: He'll be visiting Buchenwald concentration camp this morning. Before leaving for Paris, president Obama will meet with wounded soldiers at Landstuhl Medical Center.</p><p>In other news, investigators -- or rather reports of a setback for the search for Air France flight 447. France's Transportation Minister says French forces have found no evidence of an Airbus A-330 airplane that vanished over the Atlantic. He's urging extreme prudence about suspected debris fished from the ocean. The French Transportation Minister says he regrets an announcement by Brazilian teams that they had recovered plane debris from Air France flight 447. The jetliner was flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris; 228 people were on board.</p><p>AFP is reporting that former vice president Al Gore may be sent to North Korea to negotiate the release of two American journalists. Laura Ling and Euna Lee were arrested on March 17th near the North Korean border on charges they entered the country illegally and were engaged in hostile acts. Both women are reporters for Gore's California-based Current TV. They each could be sentenced to ten years in a labor camp.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Now back to New York and Charles Payne for a look at the stocks he's watching -- Charles, I'm listening.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you so much Gavin really appreciate it. Well folks it's going to be an exciting day today. Hopefully we will be to the upside.</p><p>A couple of stocks three stocks we're looking at. Manitowoc is one. This is one of these real hot equipment making stocks that obviously because of the economy has gotten hit real good. I think your risk reward now is really, really nice. Right here is where it broke the trend line recently. Now we're looking at a little resistance right around $7.80.</p><p>A break out there and I think you are pretty good. That takes you right here, that would be north of 10 buck; a huge percentage play. I love the fact that the risk reward is pretty good. In the March quarter they beat the street by almost 30 percent. Maybe that business is turning around. Certainly, the chart is attractive here.</p><p>Sina, I've probably mentioned this one now at least five times in the last year. As you can see, it is really starting to come on here to the point where it looks extremely, extremely attractive. This stock is breaking key resistance. I love the volume on it. I think if you don't have any China stocks, Baidu is my favorite. A lot of people are afraid to buy a stock that's almost $300 a share. This one might have room all the way up to $47 a share. It is one to take a look at. It is a reiteration.</p><p>And finally the stock that caught my eye more than any other yesterday. A company called Flir. The chart isn't so hot necessarily, it's been going down for a long time but I think it's hit a bottom and I think it's on the cusp of a major breakout.</p><p>By the way, this company has beaten the Street in each of the last four quarters and each time they beat by a larger margin. They make imaging systems for the military and of course for commercial use. I think the stock has room to $32 that would be almost 50 percent gain. I love the way it looked yesterday.</p><p>By the way, I have one pick on the Web that you have to go and take a look at today. Fox Business.com/moneyforbreakfast.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Mr. Payne, I look forward to it.</p><p>PAYNE: I'm pumped up about today, I'm hoping under 500,000. Keep our fingers crossed.</p><p>GLICK: Let's hope it is not too bad. Thank you very much Charles.</p><p>Coming up, we're going to go live to London for a look on how the overseas markets are trading. And Palm looking to take a bite out of Apple's bottom line with its new smart phone called the Pre. We're going to get a real live demonstration right here in studio and tell you why there's a lot of buzz about it. That's coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning, and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>Coming up: More on a report this morning from \"The Wall Street Journal\" that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's top management, including CEO Vikram Pandit. We're going to see who was mentioned as a possible replacement.</p><p>And Palm gets ready to release its Pre device tomorrow, looking to steal some of the success from Apple's iPhone. We're going to preview it in just a couple of minutes.</p><p>And what movie could possibly take down Pixar's \"Up\" from the top spot? Well, Universal and Warner Brothers have new releases. We're going to get those expectations both coming out today.</p><p>And we have the May employment report due out at 8:30. The expectation is for a loss of 520,000 jobs. We'll be live at the Labor Department.</p><p>And then, coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL\" at 9:35 a.m., I will be speaking with Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and get her reaction on the First on FOX to those job numbers.</p><p>All right. Let's take a look at the futures. We've been in the green throughout the morning. Let's see, are we still in the green? We are. OK, good news.</p><p>We're actually a little bit higher earlier this morning. The Dow up 41, S&amp;P up 5, NASDAQ up 5 as well. So, looking pretty good.</p><p>Let's get directly to financial news though -- we got a lot of that news. The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in its boardroom. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be bounced out. \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S. Bancorp CEO, Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job. The Feds own 34 percent of Citigroup.</p><p>And the FDIC is putting its program to rid the nation's banks of toxic assets on hold. The Legacy Loans Program was supposed to begin with trial sale this month, the FDIC says banks have proven they can raise private capital without cleansing their balance sheets. The FDIC says the program could come back in a different form.</p><p>And the FDIC is very busy today, also shutting down Silverton Bank. The troubled bank did attract investors from interest or from private equity guys. The FDIC says it had to do was cheapest for the insurance fund and shutting it down was cheaper. Silverton was not a retail bank. Most of its customers were actually other banks.</p><p>All right. Well, we've all been waiting for the big preview. The forefather of handheld phone is taking a run at Apple's iPhone to reclaim the spot as the king of the smartphone on the hill. Well, Palm will release its touch-screen Pre device tomorrow, exclusively on the Sprint network. And the phone offers a whole slew of slick new features.</p><p>With a look at it in some real details and whether or not it is going to be the necessary thing to boost Palm -- joining us right now is Lance Ulanoff. He's the editor-in-chief of PCMag.com. And FOX Business contributor Charles Payne, also WStreet.com founder is here with us as well to talk about the implications for the stocks of Palm and Apple.</p><p>All right. Lance, you've got the phone right in front of you. I'm very excited about this. How does it stack up? What are the things about the device that look so good?</p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, PC MAGAZINE EDITOR IN CHIEF: It stacks up pretty well. It is Sprint's best smartphone, bar none. It is gorgeous. It has many features you find on iPhone. It has a touch-screen, so I can add and drag around applications.</p><p>It has something the iPhone doesn't have, multitasking. So, if you are looking at the screen right now, I'm actually going through a bunch of different things that are running at once. So, it's a $199 phone after rebate. So, it starts at $299.</p><p>But it has something that the -- well, the iPhone doesn't have which is a QWERTY keyboard. So, this is one of the things that makes it so exciting. And you can use that QWERTY keyboard to do ubiquitous search, meaning the minute you start to type, it just starts to find whatever is on the phone.</p><p>One of the ways that it does that is it brings together all of your contacts from Google, Facebook, Exchange. It can search there. It can search throughout all of that.</p><p>It has a 3-megapixel camera. It plays video. And yes, it does have an accelerometer and what that means is you're going to be able to turn it to its side and you basically can play -- you can play videos in landscape mode.</p><p>GLICK: It looks really --</p><p>ULANOFF: It is.</p><p>GLICK: I'm entrenched. I'm watching --</p><p>ULANOFF: Oh, and, by the way -- and, by the way, it's got a really loud speaker.</p><p>GLICK: Wow. It's really awesome.</p><p>OK. So, let's talk about the big issue, which is the number of applications on the phone because I know I happen to have an iPhone.</p><p>ULANOFF: Right.</p><p>GLICK: And my kids adore it because it has so many different games on it. What are the applications like on this?</p><p>ULANOFF: Unfortunately, they are not coming out of the gate with a ton of applications. Right now, the iPhone has about 40,000 applications. This is going to start with about 20 or so. So, it's a -- it is far fewer and they are not really pushing the capabilities of this phone.</p><p>I've got Connect 4 up here, which is a lot of fun to play. I can drop in. I'm going to lose by the way. But I can drop in my checkers. But, except for touching it, you can't really shake it. You can't turn it over, shake out the chips, or anything like that.</p><p>There's Fandango. There's AP News. There's a NASCAR app, but not a NASCAR app where you drive a car, you just going to learn about what's going on if you are interested in NASCAR.</p><p>So, for somebody who's trying to decide between the iPhone and the Pre, well then, if you care about apps, there might not be much of a competition -- at least for now. But we do expect Palm to add in its app catalog a ton more apps very quickly.</p><p>GLICK: We are putting if here, Charles, the sort of what we're calling the tale of the tape here, which is the Palm Pre versus the Apple iPhone, walking through the carriers, the size of the memory, the screen, the applications, the cost -- all those things combined.</p><p>A lot of people believe, Charles, that this is do-or-die for Palm. This is their last opportunity to get out there and dazzle the community.</p><p>How important is it for them, and do you think they are doing what they need to do?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, there's no doubt that this is do-or-die. This is the bottom of 9th, two -- you know, two men out, two strikes against you, and you got to hit a home run. You can't hit a base. You can't bunt this thing.</p><p>The one thing, though, is that Wall Street has bid this stock up tremendously. Look at this chart. It's a mind-boggling move.</p><p>GLICK: Well, because the buzz on this phone has been very hot.</p><p>PAYNE: The buzz is hot but it's not like the buzz on the iPhone, where we saw people standing at midnight at the Apple Store waiting around in a line. I mean, this -- when the stock goes from like a buck to 13 bucks, that's huge, you know? So, ironically, of course, Apple's stock hasn't suffered too much.</p><p>And that's what I think you got going on here, too, a couple of things from the market's point of view. Maybe the smartphone category is big enough and is growing enough for there to be more than one winner. And maybe this won't be an iPhone killer, but perhaps, it will do well enough - - although the stock though, at this point, has had one heck of a move. And, you know, Wall Street, we get --</p><p>GLICK: The Palm's stock or Apple stock?</p><p>PAYNE: Palm stock.</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>PAYNE: Palm stock. Apple stock is still down from its high, although it's made a heck of a move recently from the lows of 88, 87. But still, I think on Wall Street, we tend to get extremely excited about things like this and we pump up these stocks. And I don't know that Palm can live up -- Palm Pre can live to the hype, at least not initially out of the gate.</p><p>GLICK: Lance, you made a facial expression when Charles talked about demand for the Pre. I hear that they are not releasing that many, and so, they think demand will be really hot.</p><p>ULANOFF: Well, I've heard that too. The CEO came out and said they might not be a lot of them out there. But I've also heard that there will be people waiting on lines, that there already is some guy waiting out there. And there are people who are telling me they are going to try and get it on Saturday because they are afraid there won't be enough at each store. But I have to say, Sprint has been working on this a long time. I'd be shocked if there aren't enough of these Pres to go around.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I mean, it's interesting Walter Mossberg, you know, from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he wrote a whole piece on it as well, and it was interesting to hear some of his points of view because a lot of people are looking to next week with Apple -- to see whether or not they are going to come out with a new iPhone. They are going to dazzle us, because a lot of their initial two-year contracts are set to expire coming up this summer. So, if they come out with one, this could be perfectly timed.</p><p>How crucial is it -- and, Lance, will <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>show up?</p><p>ULANOFF: We're all talking about that. You know, Wozniak, his former co-founder said he looked robust which is great news. We always expect surprises from Apple at every one of these major events. But I think this is going to be unique, because the third thing -- <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>has this habit in these events of going one more thing and he pulls it out of his back pocket.</p><p>I think the one more thing at this event is <person><nameText>Steve Jobs. </nameText></person>You have announcement, announcement -- <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>walks out with whatever the new iPhone is. I really think that could happen because he is a showman. He knows how to pull something like this thing off.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>ULANOFF: And there's going to be hot product out there. I don't know what it is, but it doesn't diminish what Palm has accomplished with the Pre, because I have to tell you -- this is a home run.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Charles, Tim Cook had done a terrific job in the role ...</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GLICK: ... of <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>obviously left in terms of running day-to- day operations. The stock is up 68 percent versus NASDAQ, which is up a little bit over 20 percent since left due to health concerns in January.</p><p>What will this mean if he does come back for Apple's stock?</p><p>PAYNE: Oh, it's a cherry on top of it. But more than that -- you know, listen, I don't think there's a CEO that's so identified with this company as Steven Jobs is with Apple. And listen, Apple already, early this morning, is indicating it's going to be up 3 or 4 points at the open today. And this is ahead of the Pre coming out tomorrow.</p><p>So, there's a lot of excitement about <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>coming in and doing something spectacular.</p><p>GLICK: We didn't even get to Sprint and AT&amp;T and Verizon. There's too much to talk about. But it looks so cool. It really does.</p><p>PAYNE: By the way, I think this is more important -- it might be as equally as important for Sprint as it is ...</p><p>GLICK: As it is for Palm.</p><p>PAYNE: Palm -- absolutely.</p><p>GLICK: Great point. Lance, thank you very much for breaking it in.</p><p>ULANOFF: It's a pleasure.</p><p>GLICK: You must be having fun with that.</p><p>ULANOFF: I am.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: He is grinning from ear to ear with this phone.</p><p>ULANOFF: I still want to keep it.</p><p>GLICK: OK. The control room would like you to go visit them because there are several purchasers, including my executive producer, who wants to buy that immediately.</p><p>ULANOFF: I'm taking bids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>All right. Coming up: We'll check the latest news headlines. And Warner Brothers is looking to cash in on a major hangover this weekend. We're going to preview the weekend box-office when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GREY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Gavin Grey in London with a look at this morning's top news stories.</p><p>House Republican leaders are suggesting more than $23 billion in budget cuts. Overall, the proposal includes cuts in no less than 37 programs. One example is eliminating transportation enhancements and this measure alone would save $833 million a year. It would take place over the next five years. The plan has been sent now to the White House.</p><p>And the State Supreme Court in South Carolina is ordering the state's governor to accept federal bailout money. Mark Sanford had refused to take the money designated to South Carolina over the next two years. But this court decision ends months of wrangling with legislators who accused him of playing politics with people's lives. Sanford says he will not appeal the decision and plans to sign the paperwork on Monday.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the FOX Business Network. Now, let's get back to New York and Alexis Glick.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>My favorite topic, let's get right to sports business right now. Star architect Frank Gehry won't be working on the $4 billion Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, New York, anymore. Developer brace Ratner is trying to trim $200 million in costs. Ellerbe Becket will take his place.</p><p>Ratner is blaming the economic downturn and litigation being brought on by project opponents. Ratner hopes to have the new arena opened for the New Jersey Nets by 2010, 2011.</p><p>The Big Unit joins baseball 300-win club. Pitcher Randy Johnson becoming only the 24th pitcher in history to win 300 games as the San Francisco Giants beat the Washington Nationals five to one. Johnson who is 45 years old has pitched for 16 in a 22-year career. Incredible.</p><p>And Charles Hayward, the president and CEO of the New York Racing Association said the absence of Rachel Alexandra would likely cost the Belmont Stakes significantly in attendance. With Rachel Alexandra in the race, Hayward estimated a crowd of between 80,000 to 90,000. Without her, he believes the crowd will be 50,000 to 60,000. Last year, when Big Brown was going for the Triple Crown, the attendance was 94,476.</p><p>Speaking of which, here now with a little preview of Belmont Stakes is FOX News reporter Rick Leventhal, who is live in Belmont Park.</p><p>Rick, pretty cool thing to be doing. I'm jealous. What's it looking like for tomorrow?</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, don't be too jealous because we're getting rained on right now. Attendance is near zero by the way because there's no races going on. However, Chip Woolley, the trainer of Mine That Bird you probably recognize from the Kentucky Derby is kind enough to join us for an exclusive one-on-one.</p><p>Now, they are saying attendance may be done because Rachel Alexandra who won the Preakness isn't running this race. You said that you believe that's possible?</p><p>CHIP WOOLLEY, MINE THAT BIRD TRAINER: Sure, she's a great filly and it would be good for in racing in general if she was here. But, in this game, you have to do what's best for the horse. And if they didn't feel like it was a best thing for her, it's better they don't run her.</p><p>And that, you know, racing -- racing will take care of itself. But we have to -- the horses have to come first.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Mine That Bird finished at close second to Rachel Alexandra. Are you disappointed that you didn't have a chance at a rematch on this longer track?</p><p>WOOLLEY: You know, a little bit disappointed I suppose. Really, I mean, it's -- for me, it's better she's not in here because that's one less horse you have to beat. And let's face it. If you don't have to beat them, you don't want to, you know? You want to limit the field to who you run at. So, I don't mind her not being here.</p><p>She's a great filly and you got to respect her a lot. So, really, for me, it's probably better she's not in for the racing game. It might be better that she would be here.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Your horse was on the track. It still is, I believe, on the track?</p><p>WOOLLEY: It just went off.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: It just went off. So, you just watched the horse working out in these conditions, which hopefully tomorrow, it will be sunny and drier. But how -- but how does Mine That Bird look today?</p><p>WOOLLEY: He looked great this morning. Just got over the ground really, really well. So we're real happy with where we're at. It looks like we got in here in good shape. And we're looking forward to running.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: You said he looked like a million bucks.</p><p>WOOLLEY: At least a million.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: That's the purse.</p><p>WOOLLEY: Yes, sir. Hopefully, we can get some of it, and hopefully, he'll have his best race in him tomorrow.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: So, Chip, if I were a betting man -- which I might be, by the way -- would you suggest I put money on your horse?</p><p>WOOLLEY: I will never make a suggestion like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Chip Woolley, the trainer of Mine That Bird -- thanks so much for being with us. And get well soon.</p><p>WOOLLEY: Nice to meet you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: All right. Nice to meet you, too. So, that's the story.</p><p>And here's another look at Belmont Park and the track, which is very muddy. But again, they are expecting sunshine tomorrow. And if you were on the fence about whether to come here or not, I'm told there will be sunny skies and it should be a great day for racing.</p><p>GLICK: If you were a betting man, is that the cat calling the kettle black or what?</p><p>LEVENTHAL: I didn't want to come out and say it, but, you know, I might put a couple dollars on the race.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Rick, I'll e-mail you later to do the same for me. Great interview. Thanks so much for seeing you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: OK. I look forward to it. Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Coming up: We're going to give you the box office preview for the weekend.</p><p>And this weekend, once again, you can pitch your business idea to a venture capitalist live right here on the FOX Business Network. Start emailing your pitches at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:YourMoney@FOXBusiness.com\">YourMoney@FOXBusiness.com</email> Lucky ones will get to sell their idea live on-air during on \"Your Questions, Your Money\" with Dagen McDowell and Robert Gray this Saturday, 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.</p><p>Stay with us. Movies -- coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: This weekend, Will Ferrell is going to be battling dinosaurs, bugs and one massive headache. The PG-13 time travel comedy, \"Land of the Lost\" from General Electric's Universal Pictures is going against Warner Brothers \"The Hangover,\" an R-rated bachelor party that shows what happens in Las Vegas may leave you with a tiger, a baby, and a missing groom. Yes, that's right.</p><p>Here to tell us how the films will do and if either of them can capture the upward mobility of Walt Disney's-Pixar's \"Up,\" joining me right now is Bradley Jacobs. He is the senior editor of \"Us Weekly.\"</p><p>Good morning, Bradley. Good to see you.</p><p>BRADLEY JACOBS, US WEEKLY SENIOR EDITOR: Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: No, wait a second. Is \"Hangover\" PG-13 or R?</p><p>JACOBS: That's definitely R-rated.</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>JACOBS: R-rated movie.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, because -- OK, because I heard there's a lot of profanity. I just wasn't sure if it was -- OK. Anyhow, I was saying to you before that I was at the movies yesterday evening, and I came out and there were these massive lines down the block. I understand there were midnight showings of \"Hangover.\" What's the buzz?</p><p>JACOBS: It had some of the best buzz of the year. You know, for a movie with no big stars, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, the concept is really key here. Four guys, a bachelor party that goes wrong, a missing groom, there's a baby in the mix. There's a stripper in the mix.</p><p>I saw it a couple of weeks ago. I really loved it. I think it is going to be hugely successful. R-rated summer movies are kind of the rare thing. So, you got -- you got the college students, you got --</p><p>GLICK: That's why I said, \"Are you sure it's R, are you sure it's not PG-13\"?</p><p>JACOBS: I am absolutely sure.</p><p>GLICK: Are you sure?</p><p>JACOBS: I am doubly sure that \"Land of the Lost\" is PG-13, and that's more of a kids' movie although it's PG-13. So, it's not really for 4-year-olds, it's not really for 6-year-olds. It's sort of, you know, for people in the PG-13 era, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds.</p><p>I think the battle between these two is really interesting.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, it is interesting. I do want to bring in Harry Medved, also from Fandango.com.</p><p>Because, Harry, I know you've been looking at \"The Land of the Lost\" pre-sales (ph) and there are just completely non-existent. Bradley was telling me the reviews are just horrific.</p><p>You tell me, Harry, what did they get wrong with \"Land of the Lost\"? Will anybody go see it?</p><p>HARRY MEDVED, FANDANGO.COM: Well, you know, people are saying on Fandango, the user reviews are saying it's perfect for 13 year olds of all ages, especially if you're for bathroom humor, because it is PG-13. But there's plenty of dinosaur manure, dinosaur urine, masturbation jokes and frequent uses of the S-word for any 13-year-old to wallow in.</p><p>Now, parents may not be too excited about it. But at least it's not the R-rated comedy of \"The Hangover\" that Bradley was just talking about.</p><p>GLICK: But, Bradley, look, this is box-office projections for these movies that are coming out of here. And \"Land of the Lost\" is getting some, you know, at least some decent -- I mean, not great, but decent projections. Is that because of Will Ferrell, you know, you just --</p><p>JACOBS: Will Ferrell is a huge star. They run commercials everywhere, marketing everywhere for this film. They just want to get butts in seats in the first few days before the word really spreads about it.</p><p>But I actually think those productions may be wrong and you could see \"Hangover\" end up number two this weekend.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. I mean, I was saying to you ...</p><p>JACOBS: I do, too.</p><p>GLICK: I was saying to you before, like, oh, my God, I had never seen a movie marketed more than this one, oh my goodness. OK. How does this stack up against up, against \"Star Trek\"? You know, we had some big blockbusters last summer. You know, who turns out to be the big ones this summer?</p><p>JACOBS: Well, \"Up\" had a huge weekend last weekend, and I wouldn't be surprised if \"Up\" were number one again this weekend. It would be the first time in more than a year that an animated movie has been number one two weekends in a row. But \"Up,\" you have that magic thing where the critics love it and audiences love it -- which is very rare.</p><p>I saw it here in 3-D last weekend. I want to see it again. And I think that there is incredible word of mouth for that film, because it's one of those things where you can take your family. You can take kids. You can take teenagers. You can take your friend.</p><p>You know, it's really in that magical place. So, I think that will be number one.</p><p>MEDVED: You know --</p><p>GLICK: Yes, Harry, go quickly.</p><p>MEDVED: I'm not sure you want to take kids under 6 years old, because there are some terrifying elements to \"Up.\" Now, on Fandango, that's the place where people buy advanced tickets, we are seeing that \"Up\" is leading the way for ticketing this weekend, it's about 42 percent of all tickets sold on Fandango.</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>MEDVED: But \"The Hangover\" is gaining momentum. There was a surge of tickets last night. Those people you saw online last night, Alexis, they're all across the country. Thursday midnight shows were sold out last night.</p><p>I went to one last night and people came out of the theater saying, \"I want to see 'The Hangover' again.\"</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>MEDVED: So, I think you will be surprised. \"Hangover\" will not be number two. I think it will be number one.</p><p>GLICK: I have to leave it there, Harry and Bradley. I know what I'm doing this weekend if only I could get a baby-sitter. Gentlemen, thank you very much. I appreciate it.</p><p>JACOBS: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: We'll be right back. We're going to do a roundtable on jobs as jobs numbers are due out in half hour. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Good morning and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>We're about 30 minutes way from the release of the May employment report. Expectations are for a loss of another 520,000 jobs, sending the unemployment rate to 9.2 percent. We are live at the U.S. Labor Department in Washington, D.C., to break down those numbers.</p><p>Also, Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is going to join us for his analysis on those numbers. And Roger Ballou, the CDI Corp. CEO, is going to join me to break it all down.</p><p>And news this morning that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's top management, including perhaps CEO Vikram Pandit. We're going to get into those details in just a moment.</p><p>And on the jobs front, speaking of which, I will be talking to the labor secretary coming up later this morning on \"The Opening Bell\" at just about 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time. We'll get Hilda Solis' point of view on the jobs.</p><p>Let's look at the markets, though. We're in the green. We're at the highs of the morning. Dow up 45. S&amp;P up 5. Nasdaq up 5 as well. So across the board we're up about 0.5 percent.</p><p>All right, let's get a look at the markets. We have business contributor Gavin Gray and Connell McShane. Let's start with Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Alexis, thanks very much.</p><p>As you said, we are trading higher ahead of the open this morning and ahead, more importantly, of the jobs report because when you think about it, all things can change here half an hour from now. So, you know, and that's all we're going to be talking about a half an hour from now. So let me give you a couple of stocks individually to watch. Either way, no matter what the jobs report comes out at, these are going to be stocks to watch.</p><p>Apple, right behind me, is definitely one of them. There's a report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" about <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>this morning. Look at it going from below $144 to almost $147 in pre-market trading. So a nice little boost. The report in \"The Journal\" is Jobs is on track to come back on the job as the CEO there after taking medical leave by the end of the month. And there's even some speculation in that \"Journal\" article that he comes back earlier.</p><p>The big developer's conference next week. The Palm Pre coming out over the weekend. The speculation, and again this might be getting ahead of ourselves, is that Jobs maybe comes back ahead of schedule in order to announce a new iPhone. Either way, a lot of optimism about Apple.</p><p>One other quick stock to watch, a company called Quanta Services. PWR is the ticker on it. It is going to take the place of Ingersoll Rand in the S&amp;P 500. So Quanta, again, a power company that -- the index fund managers are going to have to buy this stock. It was up after hours. Ingersoll, by the way, is reincorporates itself. It's going to have its base in Ireland. With a name like Connell McShane, there's not (ph) any problem with having your base in Ireland. But the S&amp;P doesn't like that because you're supposed to be based in the United States. They make the exception for Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, which is where Quanta -- where Ingersoll was based before that. So they were allowed to be in the S&amp;P. Now they're leaving. Quanta takes its place. There you have it.</p><p>Gavin Gray over in Europe with a look at those overseas markets for us now.</p><p>Gavin, take it away.</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Connell, thanks very much indeed. I'm sure they'll make an exception for you, as you say.</p><p>Looking at the European markets, in Asia it was a 1 percent club today. It is in Europe as well pretty much. Starting off with the FTSE here in London. All waiting on announcements about Gordon Brown and his reshuffle. But up 1.5 percent at 67 points, 4,454. The CAC 40 in Paris, 3,347, up 35 points. The DAX hardly shifting at all today. Up just 33 points or 0.65 percent.</p><p>And despite that reshuffle in the U.K. cabinet, today we're getting details coming through in bits and pieces. Gordon Brown's position as prime minister really does remain in jeopardy. Some of the newspaper headlines today really damaging. Comes after four cabinet members have resigned in just four days, causing many politicians to question whether Mr. Brown has enough authority to continue at the head of the British government.</p><p>One thing we now believe is really pretty certain is the chancellor, the money man, the treasurer, Alistair Darling. He has apparently told Gordon Brown, I say as chancellor or I'm out. And we do think that he is going to stay as chancellor.</p><p>All this political uncertainty has been weighing heavily on the British pound. It slid against the dollar in recent days. Today it is down against both the dollar and the euro. And $1.61 will buy you one pound. And the dollar against the euro, though, is down, and $1.41 will buy you a euro.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, we could see the unemployment rate climb to 9.2 percent this morning with the release of the Labor Department's May employment report. Now while that rate may be up, job cuts may be down for the second month in a row with an estimated 520,000 job losses last month versus 539,000 lost in April. March, 699,000. Now, states are getting their hands on some of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help create employment opportunities. Is that enough? And what are state and local leaders doing right now with that money to create jobs?</p><p>Here's my take. Number one, we need to basically stem the tide on the job front and figure out what we're doing to address private sector jobs, particularly those that are created by small businesses. Number two, will the work -- will the work programs -- will they ultimately work to retain enough people? Those worker training programs. And number three, concern that the stimulus package is ultimately not enough to help the jobs situation. Perhaps time is the only cure. But keep in mind that the underemployed numbers are much more disconcerting and you've got to make sure you look at the big picture, not just the unemployed.</p><p>Joining me right now is Mayor Virg Bernero of Lansing, Michigan, Mayor R.T. Rybak of Minneapolis, and Steve Crowley, the host of \"American Scene\" radio program and the financial TV program \"Wall Street Cast.\"</p><p>Good morning, everybody. Good to see you guys.</p><p>STEVE CROWLEY, \"AMERICAN SCENE\" RADIO HOST: Thank you, Alexis. Thanks very much. This is great (ph).</p><p>GLICK: All right, Mayor Bernero, let me start with you. Let me walk through some of the numbers here. The unemployment rate, as you know, in Michigan, the highest in the country, 12.9 percent. I understand you can get a little less than $4 billion in the stimulus. Is it enough to help create and save jobs? What are you doing?</p><p>MAYOR VIRG BERNERO, (D) LANCING, MICHIGAN: Well, look, a lot of it is going into infrastructure. It's going into roads. It's going into retraining of workers. We're trying to get a business incubator up and going to generate new ideas and for business startups.</p><p>But, look, we've talked about this for months. The best stimulus is a stimulating job. People need jobs. They want long-term security. And so the temporary help is great. We appreciate that. But we need to restore health in the economy.</p><p>And, you know, Lansing dodged a bullet. We were very fortunate not to have any plant closures with GM. In fact, our factories may get a little more work. But still, in the long run, we need a healthy auto industry. We need to make sure that we're making the cars of the future in places like Lansing, Michigan.</p><p>And I think the economy, in terms of people starting to buy again, I mean they want that long-term future. And when you talk about retraining, I'm all for the retraining, but I've got e-mails from people all over the country that say, you know, I've been retrained two or three times and the job is eliminated. And so what are we going to retrain them in?</p><p>And you and I have talked about this. We need to have manufacturing. I'm not giving up. I don't think we can be a post manufacturing society. I think we have to find a way that we have manufacturing in this country, advanced manufacturing, and that means leveling the playing field on trade. Until we do that, we're not going to have a permanent recovery.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I mean, Mayor Rybak, I'm concerned about the training efforts too. I mean that's what I keep hearing as one of the cures to solve the problem here. And I'm concerned that it's not really going to truly impact job creation. It's great to learn a lot of other, you know, things to do and skills to have, but at the end of the day, it's not a job.</p><p>MAYOR R.T. RYBAK, (D) MINNEAPOLIS: Well, I totally agree with your point. I will say that in the middle of a recession, education and training is -- if you're ever going to do it, it's a good time to do it.</p><p>But first and foremost, we didn't just wake up to the retraining issue when the economy went south. We've been doing it for a number of years. When I took office, unemployment was 1 percent higher in the city than in the suburbs. Today it's lower in the city than the rest of the region. Very few cities can say that. The reason is because we've been in an ongoing training effort for hard to employ people.</p><p>Now when you hit a period of time like this, it's a big challenge. You have two things. You have, one, the fact that there are a lot of people who are out of work. So, for instance, some of the key construction trades, up to half the people will be sitting on the bench.</p><p>Meanwhile, we know that coming up is going to be a new economy that's going to be based a lot on clean energy, including some of the weatherization work that really takes skilled workers. So we have this tough problem of needing workers in the future, but if you train them for trades where there's high unemployment, you have a problem. I spent all yesterday morning meeting with trades and other folks trying to talk about that tough issue.</p><p>We do, however, have to say, you've got to create a job at the end of it. So we've put a lot of our stimulus dollars into creating those new clean energy jobs. We've put some significant investment into solar, trying to make sure that works. We are training people to do solar installation. We're training them to do green roof installation and are putting incentives in it to create more green roofs.</p><p>Now those are not going to bring back the manufacturing base of America. And I agree with the mayor very much so. I'm not giving up on making things in America.</p><p>I just got back from China. And part of what we need to do as well is to tap into a global economy. We brought a Danish med tech firm into Minneapolis and it's now moved into its headquarters here, 600 new jobs. That's part of it too.</p><p>But you have to home grow the economy. You have to be part of global economy. And you have to have trained workers. There's no one easy fix.</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>Steve, you talk to people every single day . . .</p><p>CROWLEY: We do.</p><p>GLICK: Nationally syndicated radio show. What are people saying to you about the jobs environment?</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, sometimes you can't get a job in your local area. Sometimes people have to move. We talked to one person who was a CPA/MBA, couldn't get a job in south Florida. If they would move to Houston, there's plenty of jobs. There's a shortage of CPA/MBAs. So sometimes you do have to retrain, go back to school. People that learn Chinese right now can get a job, I guarantee you.</p><p>GLICK: So, you know, Steve, you've been doing this for a very long time. Have you ever seen anything like this? </p><p>CROWLEY: No. No one has really seen anything like this. You have to go back to the '30s, you know, to really see something like this. This is an unbelievable time in American history. But I think it's getting a lot better. I think 12 to 18 months from now the market is predicting that the jobs market is going to be better.</p><p>GLICK: You know . . .</p><p>BERNERO: Let me say, Alexis, what's happened is the . . .</p><p>GLICK: Yes, Mayor Bernero, go ahead.</p><p>BERNERO: The chickens have come home to roost on this free trade. We've had unfettered free trade. It's unilateral, economic disarmament. And the last speaker, you know, I appreciate -- I hope he's right that things turn around, but there's a complete disconnect between the stock market, between Wall Street and main street, because most of the production in this country has been shipped overseas. We've taken the P out of GDP, Gross Domestic Product. We've replaced it with a C. We have Gross Domestic Consumption.</p><p>And we have move so much with these unfair trade policies. We've moved so much of our production overseas that what you can see is the stock market can recover, I think, because the production, most of it's overseas. And when you ship it to Malaysia and China and you can pollute the environment and exploit the workers and pay a lot less, I guess Wall Street can make more, but main street is hurting. And I don't see that turning around until we find a way to bring these jobs back to the United States.</p><p>And it's not that these jobs evaporated. That's a myth that these manufacturing jobs just evaporated into the air because of technology. Not at all. We have these jobs here in Lansing. The new factories are wonderful. They are robotic. And we have workers in them.</p><p>But more and more of these high-tech, high-advanced manufacturing jobs are going to places like Mexico and China. And we've got to find a way to reverse that and have fair trade that favors American workers, that allows American workers to compete fairly.</p><p>GLICK: Mayor Rybak, he raise as very important point. Several states are doing what they can to incentivize overseas operations to move here to the United States, or incentivize U.S. companies who garner the lions share of their revenues from international operations to stay in the United States. But does that then raise a question of protectionism?</p><p>RYBAK: Well, I don't think the issue is protectionism as much as trying to home grow an economy. I mean, look, there are ways to ship jobs from overseas. But the thing Americans have always done is they've created the job in the first place. We're an incubator of innovation. And if we continue to incubate, then we can have not only the ideas, but the manufacturing here.</p><p>Now an example is, we're putting some of our stimulus dollars into helping a company called Ken Kay Solar (ph). It's a new approach to doing solar that will hopefully make it cheaper to put it into homes. So that's a brain power idea. But we need to also make sure that the person power that's making it is done here as well.</p><p>I think there's a really important moment when American ingenuity then creates a product. We do that well and will continue to do that well. The point is, is once that product is ready to be made, that we have to make it here at home.</p><p>I think the mayor made a good point in this whole issue of the unfair competition of labor costs. As I say, I was in China. They're doing some wonderful things. But I sure as heck don't want my cousin or my constituent getting some of the wages that are being paid over there.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, right.</p><p>RYBAK: So I think we need to certainly level the playing field, but also recognize, hey, look, this is America. We're not on our knees. We know what we're doing. And we've done great things. And we're going to do them again. Let's just get back to the basics of invention, incubation and manufacturing. We can do this.</p><p>GLICK: You know, we heard yesterday some bright spots. We heard about Wal- Mart hiring 22,000 people.</p><p>CROWLEY: That's right.</p><p>GLICK: We've heard a couple of other companies start to say that they're beginning to hire again. That they're beginning to spend again. You and I yesterday talked about, you know, the ordering of jets and things of that nature.</p><p>CROWLEY: Right.</p><p>GLICK: Are we starting to see those signs of life? Are they starting to suggest perhaps a bottom? </p><p>CROWLEY: I think it will all start with a good glimmer of hope, don't you? But I -- you know, I really believe the small businesses, the nation's job maker, net/net, Alexis, all new jobs are created by small business. Apple Computer and Microsoft started as small businesses and now employ a lot of people.</p><p>But a lot of companies that employ fewer than 50 people are now starting to see the light. We're getting reports back that the CEOs of these smaller companies are saying, yes, business is picking up. We're starting to bring in our old employees that we let go. And people who we cut down to 20, 30 hours a week, we're bringing back to 40 hours a week.</p><p>So I think that's where the new jobs are going to be created. And even like cities like Lansing, which is a small business community too, I think that's where the real job generation is going to happen.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, you know, Mayor Bernero, I'm going to talk to the labor secretary coming up in the next hour and the thing that worries me is that the small business community, as Steve points out, which is something I talked in one of my talking points, is essential for private sector jobs. And what we saw in the last report is private sector jobs got hit so tremendously. Are we doing enough to help small businesses?</p><p>BERNERO: Look, look, number one, I mean, I just want to say, with all due respect, you know, you help prove my point with the Wal-Mart. I mean GM lays off 20,000 high-paying, top of the line, top of the food chain manufacturing jobs. Twenty thousand. Wal-Mart's hiring 20,000.</p><p>It's the Wal-Martization of our economy and that's part of what's killing us. I mean that's great that Wal-Mart's hiring, that will give some hope, but you're taking basically $26, $28 an hour jobs and going down to I don't know what Wal-Mart pays, you know, $10 maybe if you're lucky. So this is part of the problem. </p><p>Now as far as small business goes, one problem is the banking. We've helped banks at the top. OK. And, look, I'm not bashing Obama here. I mean the guy has inherited a mess and he's doing an admirable job with it.</p><p>But we've helped banks at the top. It hasn't trickled down to the community banks. The community banks, Steve's right, the small businesses where the growth is, we all know that, there can't be any growth because nobody can get a loan. The community banks have been shut out. While the banks in Wall Street are getting help, the community banks, you know what they're getting? More regulation from FDIC. They're getting tighter regulations, tighter standards. They're not getting any help. And the community banks weren't even part of the problem.</p><p>So this has got to be addressed by the administration. The community banks are being strangle held and they're the ones that are -- that know the people, that know the communities and know where the money should be given. And they didn't do anything wrong. They weren't involved in all the chicanery that Wall Street was, but they're getting punished by the FDIC. So this insanity has got to stop. We need our community banks help.</p><p>But the other thing, I want to just tell you, the small businesses are hurting. I've got e-mails and I've got people in my community, the small - - I can show you letters from union presidents and company presidents, small business presidents, that sound just the same. Main street America is hurting. Because when you wipe out manufacturing, you wipe out a lot of the small businesses. When I hear people say we're a service economy, what are we going to service? These small businesses are hurting because as so much manufacturing has left, the small businesses -- of course we're in Michigan. I mean a lot of our small businesses were auto related, tool and dye and this sort of thing.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>BERNERO: They're hurting. And I think this is true all across the country, though. You've had furniture makers and all sorts of small businesses that are struggling to survive. Again, I hate to sound like a one-note Nelly (ph), but with that foreign competition.</p><p>GLICK: You are incredible.</p><p>Mayor Rybak, I just have to ask you the last question. Are you going to run for governor?</p><p>RYBAK: Oh, I -- we'll figure that out tomorrow. But I want to say that going back to the point of . . .</p><p>GLICK: Oh, we'll figure it out tomorrow. You're -- the governor of your state is saying that he's going to run -- he's going to go for the White House.</p><p>RYBAK: Well, he's going to get his butt kicked by Barack Obama, but that's another thing.</p><p>The point of the matter is . . .</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>RYBAK: I want to talk about jobs here.</p><p>The point of the matter is, I absolutely strongly agree with the point that was just being made about make things in America. I do want to say, though, that when you hear that a retail company is adding jobs, we don't just want people behind the cash register, but speaking from the headquarters of Target and Best Buy here in Minneapolis, some phenomenal jobs are in that sector.</p><p>But the other thing that happens in the economy in a period of time like this is that as people go into transition, as sadly people leave a job and try to figure out what to do next, you do have innovation. And I think that's one of the things we've got to work with, with the lending community, and that is where sometimes the public sector needs to spur innovation. Someone leaves a company. They get fired. They get laid off. They start to think about it. They talk with their friend about what they've always wanted to do. This is when the new American jobs get created.</p><p>Now we can't be in la-la land about this. They've got to make things too. But I think innovation will help us at this point.</p><p>GLICK: All right, sounds like the role of governor looks appealing.</p><p>All right, Mayor Rybak, thank you so much. Mayor Bernero, and Steve, gentlemen, thank you very much.</p><p>All right, guys, we're going to take a quick break. We've got the jobs data coming out in just about 12 minutes. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Checking financial news now.</p><p>The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in its boardroom. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be bounced out. \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S. Bancorp CEO Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job. The feds, of course, own 34 percent of Citigroup.</p><p>And the FDIC putting its program to rid the nation's banks of toxic assets on hold. The legacy loans program was supposed to begin with a trial sale this month. The FDIC says banks have proven they can raise private capital without cleansing their balance sheets. Therefore, the FDIC says the program could come back later on in different form.</p><p>And the FDIC is very busy today. Also shutting down Silverton Bank. The troubled bank did attract interest from private equity folks, but the FDIC said it had to do what was cheapest for the insurance fund and ultimately shutting it down was cheaper. Silverton was not a retail bank. Most of its customers were actually other banks.</p><p>All right. Let's go over to Charles Payne and take a look at the Fox 50.</p><p>Charles.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, thanks a lot, Alexis.</p><p>Well, as you said, Citigroup, Apple, and Intel, they're all Fox 50 stocks and they're all making news this morning. Former Barclay's (ph) capital investment manager and financial analyst Vn Man (ph), he joins us now to break them all down.</p><p>And let's talk about this Citi thing because I don't think it's news that a lot of people want to see Vikram Pandit go. The bigger story here seems to be Sheila Bair versus Timothy Geithner and the FDIC not only saying we want to be in this game, we actually want more power.</p><p>VN MAN, FMR. BARCLAY'S CAPITAL INVESTMENT MANAGER: Yes, absolutely. I mean the -- what's going on here is the FDIC is essentially trying to get more power than the comptroller. But, you know, not since the days of Howard Stern fighting the FCC have we seen government versus the private sector. I mean this is really turning into a soap opera.</p><p>On one hand you've got Sheila Bair and she interrupted kind of Citigroup's ideas in the past. I don't know if you recall when she actually -- when Citigroup was trying to buy Wachovia and then Wells Fargo swept in there and bought Wachovia instead. And Sheila Bair backed Wells Fargo. And so, you know, there's kind of this struggle between . . .</p><p>PAYNE: There's definitely a power struggle going on there.</p><p>Let's talk about Apple here.</p><p>MAN: OK.</p><p>PAYNE: Big, big news. Obviously tomorrow the Pre comes out. But the bigger news for folks on the Apple stock is that <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is coming back. And it always feels like Caesar returning to Rome. So much excitement. The stock is indicating it will open higher here. What do you think is going to happen?</p><p>MANN: You know, everybody -- me included -- everybody wants to know they work for the best and the brightest. And <person><nameText>Steve Jobs, </nameText></person>he's not just a maverick. You know, he's a hero to the people he works for and a hero to the investors. So people want to know that he's coming back.</p><p>But what's interesting is, over the last five months, since he left in January, the stock has appreciated over 68 percent. So the market believes that Apple can continue to be successful, even without <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>there on a daily basis.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. And we do have the bid ask. It's up. Indicating up almost 3 points here at the open.</p><p>Having said that and the fact that you pointed out it's already up, as an investor, if an investor came to you this morning and said, should I buy this stock, what would you tell them?</p><p>MAN: You know, I love this stock. I mean I actually have my own iPhone. I'm a huge fan of the iPhone. And the new one is coming out supposedly. That's what we're hearing rumors is that it's going to come out at the worldwide development conference.</p><p>PAYNE: Let's talk about another big tech name.</p><p>MAN: Yes. Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Intel made a rare acquisition yesterday. A company called Wind River Systems. What does that tell you that Intel is starting to make some of these acquisitions?</p><p>MAN: You know, Intel has -- obviously they control the PC market, the server market in terms of their chips.</p><p>PAYNE: But it's sort of like a one trick pony.</p><p>MAN: Well, what this is doing, it's giving them access to customers. I mean who are the customers of Wind River? The customers are Apple. The customers are Sony, Panasonic. And this gives them access to those customers. So I think it's a good move.</p><p>PAYNE: Quickly before I take it back to Alexis. The stock closed at $11.70. The bid is $11.50. Does that tell you there could be another bid coming for this company?</p><p>MAN: Yes. I mean if they're making an offer of $11.50 and already, you know, since Wednesday you see it's trading up to $11.70 that means there's potentially somebody else or the market thinks that somebody else is going to step in there and offer something -- you know, a higher number.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot. We really appreciate it. That's fantastic.</p><p>MAN: Thank you. Thanks.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, Alexis, back over to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Charles, thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up, Chrysler is back in court today. Adam Shapiro is there live with the very latest.</p><p>And we are just minutes away from the May employment number. We're going to have that for you as it happens and a full break down. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: We've got some breaking auto news now. Dow Jones Newswire is reporting there will be no Opel launch in the United States due to a future Magna deal.</p><p>Chrysler heads backed to court today where the judge will hear from a group trying to block its deal with Fiat. Our own Fox Business' Adam Shapiro is live outside the courthouse with the details on both of these developments.</p><p>Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the latest, let's start with Opel real quick. There are Opels in the United States now. They actually build cars for Saturn and the Saturn Astra is one of them. With the news that Saturn may be sold to Penske Auto Group out of Detroit, you might still have some kind of contractual agreement where Opel would manufacture cars and be sold under the Saturn brand. So to say Opel won't be launched in the U.S. is accurate, but you can still get an Opel, it would just have a different name.</p><p>Now to Chrysler.</p><p>The appellate court, the three judge panel, will hear arguments starting at 2:00 as to why the deal with Fiat should be delayed. Keep in mind, it was Chrysler which asked for this emergency hearing. They're trying to get the panel to certify the sale so the deal can close before July 15th. But the Indiana state treasurer, along with 12 other parties, are trying to stop the deal and they've also petitioned to get the stay in place which now exists. They say, this is the exact quote, \"that the Indiana retirees and Indiana taxpayers have suffered losses because of unprecedented and illegal acts of the federal government.\"</p><p>Sources close to all of this say they expect a decision from the three- panel judges by late tonight, possibly early Saturday morning. So everybody will be watching to see if Chrysler and Fiat get the go ahead to close their deal or if it will be delayed. And if it's delayed past that July 15th date where they say they have to close, Fiat has the option to walk. And if they do walk, Chrysler has to come up with $35 million as a penalty for not closing many time.</p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: OK. Before I let you go, Adam, just to confirm here, the deadline is June 15th, right, not July 15th.</p><p>SHAPIRO: June 15th, not July. June 15th. I miss spoke. June 15th.</p><p>GLICK: OK, good. I just wanted to confirm. I want to confirm that.</p><p>The other thing here is, is if, in fact, Fiat were to walk, what happens with the role of the Treasury and the U.S. government in backstopping this debtor in possession financing?</p><p>SHAPIRO: That's a very good question. We'll try and get that one answered. But most people are not even addressing it. They expect it to close. But it would throw the entire deal with Chrysler up in the air because the U.S. government has said, without Fiat, there is no future for Chrysler.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Adam Shapiro, we will continue to keep a close eye on these developments throughout the morning. Thank you very much, Adam.</p><p>Well, we are just about a minute away from the jobs data. I want to bring up the futures right now as we take a look at this here. Expectations right now for unemployment to rise to 9.2 percent. It was 8.9 percent in April. Expectations are also for 520,000 job losses. We did lose 539,000 jobs last month.</p><p>Now keep in mind, though, we have seen upward revisions time and time again. And those jobs numbers, January, February, March, were well north of 600. In fact, back in January, 740,000 job losses. At this point, if we lose about 500,000, we will have lost 6.2 million job since the start of the recession according to the NABE. That was December of 2007.</p><p>As you can see, the futures are in the green. So we're looking up to be in positive territory here. But if we get something in the 500s, low 500s, the anticipation is that the market will rally on the news that perhaps job losses are beginning to subside.</p><p>Let's go to Rich Edson. He is at the Labor Department with the number.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: 345,000 jobs lost. 345,000 jobs lost. We've got an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent. That's the highest since 1983. There are 14.5 unemployed people in this country. That is the highest ever.</p><p>Again, 345,000 jobs lost last month. We had 539,000 jobs lost initially last month, April, excuse me. That number is now 504,000. In March, the initial number, 699,000 jobs lost. That is now 652,000 jobs lost.</p><p>Since the recession began in December of 2007, the unemployment rate has increased 4.5 percent and six million jobs have been lost.</p><p>Let's take a look at the private sector -- 338,000 jobs lost. Government fell 7,000 jobs. The federal government dropped 15,000 jobs.</p><p>Leisure and hospitality, get this, up 3,000 jobs. That's the first increase since December of 2007 when the recession began. Eight thousands of those jobs are food and drinking services.</p><p>Education and health services up 44,000 jobs. And credit intermediation, if you are looking for those refinance jobs, down 6,000. Those are people who do refis if you are looking for an indication of that.</p><p>Let's take a look at construction jobs, a little bit better than had been. Manufacturing jobs, 156,000. Let's start with that, 156,000 jobs lost for manufacturing. Motor vehicles and parts down 30,000.</p><p>And since December of 2007, there have been 1.8 million jobs lost because of manufacturing. That accounts for three-tenths of all jobs lost since there. Construction employment down 59,000. And believe it or not, that's about half the average of the previous six months.</p><p>Household wages averaging $18.54. That is up .1 percent, year over year up 3.1 percent.</p><p>Also, government was up 92,000 last month. It was originally thought to be up 72,000 -- excuse me, that's for the month of April. The month of April up 92,000, originally thought to be 72,000.</p><p>Alexis, we'll leave it there. Back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right. So, before I let you go, Rich, just to review this here right now, the 14.5 million people that are unemployed is the highest on which record? From what date?</p><p>EDSON: That was when record keeping began back in 1948. So it's the highest ever taken when they started all the way back in 1948.</p><p>GLICK: All right, terrific. And just before I let you go, any revisions? No revisions to unemployment rate, revisions downward for April and March in terms of non-farm payrolls?</p><p>EDSON: That's right. We lost fewer jobs in April and March. Originally, it was thought in April that we'd lost 539,000 jobs. That's now been revised to 504,000 jobs, so a difference of 35,000 jobs on the good side.</p><p>March, originally thought to be nearly 700,000, 699,000, we are now at 652,000 for the month of March. That is a change to the good side of 47,000.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Rich Edison, what a surprise. Thank you very much.</p><p>Let's break down the numbers.</p><p>Democratic Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is with us; Roger Ballou, the president and CEO of the professional service company CDI; and John Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Investor Services.</p><p>Gentlemen, I'm in a little bit of shock, a little surprised.</p><p>John, let me start with you. You're my resident economist here.</p><p>Why would the unemployment rate tick up from 8.9 percent to 9.4 percent and yet in non-farm payrolls we lost a little less than 350,000?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES: Well, you know, we first have to consider that these job estimates are taken from two separate different surveys. The unemployment rate is taken from a household survey. The count of jobs, number of jobs is taken from a survey of employers.</p><p>That being said, you know, one of the defining characteristics of this recession has been the record length of unemployment. So while fewer people are losing their jobs -- and we pick that up from the recent decline if first time jobless claims -- we still find that the number of people that are out of work or collecting state unemployment benefits continues to grow. This is a recession where it was very damaging to have lost your job because of the unusually long period of time it's taken to secure new employment if you are that lucky.</p><p>GLICK: All right. </p><p>Let me go to Congressman Sestak.</p><p>Are you surprised by the numbers?</p><p>REP. JOE SESTAK (D), PENNSYLVANIA: Actually, I am. I had expected them to be in the low 500,000s. In fact, when we ran the models several months ago, if we had gotten to the low 500,000s or just below it by July, we would have assumed everything was going according to script -- still intense, but not intensifying. What this data shows is that as compared to past recessions, employers laid off employees much more rapidly when you look at the data, which means that this stopping of the cratering of our economy may come to a halt a bit more rapidly.</p><p>I had expected unemployment to be about 9.2 percent. And he is right, overall, people who don't have any jobs and aren't seeking is about 16 percent. But think about what else is now happening.</p><p>The yields in the financial market have really come down. We also see that the housing market is beginning to see the bottom of housing prices falling. We also are seeing here that consumer spending is actually beginning to increase as the rebates come back.</p><p>In fact, if you compare May of this year, when our rebates came out from the stimulus bill, to a year ago, it's hard to compare, because remember, Alexis, a year ago in May, we also had a stimulus bill. But when you see the two, comparison, it appears as though consumer confidence is beginning to come back. We'll get to about 10 percent unemployment by the end of the year, but I don't think we're going to go above it, and then we're out of here, as Mr. Bernanke pointed out recently, and our economy begins to go again.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Roger, you are an outsourcing firm. You deal with part- time and full-time workforce. Have you been seeing improving trends, or is this data a surprise to you?</p><p>ROGER BALLOU, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CDI: Actually, this data is confirmatory of what we have been seeing throughout our business, our MRINetwork offices across he country and our CDI professional staffing organizations, where, if you look at it, there have been a lot of bright areas in the economy in spite of the losses of jobs.</p><p>For example, rural economies have continued to perform better than urban economies, where they are driven by more commodities, agriculture, things like that. Secondly, the service sector, if you look at health care, has actually been experiencing growth through this.</p><p>We saw what appeared to be the beginning of the end of the recession at the end of the first quarter in our numbers. We saw it confirmed in April. We see it confirmed again here in May.</p><p>So what we're seeing in this national data is confirmation of what our MRINetwork offices and our professional organizations that we serve have been seeing over the last two or three months. So the actual exact number I couldn't have predicted, but we did predict that it was beginning of the end of the recession occurring in this last part of the first quarter, first part of the second quarter.</p><p>GLICK: Gentlemen, I want to bring up for just a moment what the market is doing in reaction to this, because the market is reacting pretty favorably -- that would be putting it lightly -- to this news.</p><p>The market was up about 40 beforehand. The Dow now up 135 points. So we're up 1.5 percent. The S&amp;P right now is up 1.7 percent and Nasdaq up a percent. So we've rallied a full one percent in reaction to this.</p><p>Two points.</p><p>Congressman Sestak, let me first start with you on the president's fiscal stimulus package. He has tried to demonstrate in several speeches recently that the fiscal stimulus is starting to work its way into the economy. Money is being spent. I think he recently said about 100,000 jobs have been saved or created.</p><p>Is this proof in the pudding that in fact it is starting to work, and it was the necessary fuel that we needed to get everybody off the sidelines?</p><p>SESTAK: Yes, I believe it was one of the necessary tools. We also have to give a lot of credit to the TARP program and the TALF program, the second one, as you well know, to the Federal Reserve, because they have gotten the mother milk of our economy, credit, flowing again. And so there's a lot more confidence in the markets also.</p><p>But without a doubt, this economic stimulus bill intended to get money out there so people would spend it. A lot of it on retailing has started to work. Now what you are going to see is later this year, the construction money -- only about six percent of it has been spent thus far -- is really going to kick in just as the recession seems to be coming to a halt and is ready to come up. I think it's been well played.</p><p>GLICK: You know, John, it's interesting. I was speaking to Jim Rohr, the chairman and CEO of PNC, and the other day he said, \"Alexis, one of the greatest stimulus in this economy has been what the Fed has done because those who have been able to refinance on average has saved about $300 on monthly payments.\"</p><p>I wonder, is that stimulus generated by refi activity enough to offset the fact that as we sit here right now, oil is breaking above $70 a barrel, it's at a seven-month high, and so what was perceived as a tax credit because of declining gasoline and oil prices is now going to be a tax on consumers?</p><p>LONSKI: You know, we have to keep our eye on energy prices, but I believe that when consumers look at energy prices, they take a longer-term view. And they didn't believe that oil was going to stay at $40 to $50 per gallon.</p><p>Consumer spending proceeds on the assumption the price of crude oil will be in a range of $60 to $70 per barrel. So we are hitting the upper end of this range beyond which consumer spending might indeed suffer. And so it would behoove the administration to take any action necessary to prevent a replay of what happened in the first half of 2008, when the price of crude oil soared up to nearly $150 per barrel. If that happens again, then the wait for the next economic recovery will be longer than we currently anticipate.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>I mean, Roger, there's a lot of confluences of events right now that are beginning to signal that perhaps the global economy is starting to heal. The concern is -- and John brings up some great points -- is that inflation, things of that nature become a bigger concern and act as a tax on consumers or cause interest rates to rise.</p><p>What impact, if any, will all this have on the corporations that you talk to on a daily basis who are looking to slowly but surely begin to bring new employees into the fold?</p><p>BALLOU: Well, I think two things.</p><p>Congressman Sestak commented earlier that -- I think what you saw this time is a steeper quicker reduction in employment and inventories than we have ever seen before. I think that the information systems companies now used to control their inventories and their production capacity led them to react much, much more quickly. What I think that's going to lead to is a slower sustained recovery coming out of this, so it's going to be like a reverse hockey stick, where you saw a quicker downtick, but a gradual uptick that will come. </p><p>I also agree that I think the financial programs are the key driver of the uptick here. I don't think that much of the stimulus has kicked in yet, so I suspect that the bigger stimulus effect here has been the credit markets opening up, and that leading to enhanced consumer confidence and business confidence.</p><p>The other thing that's gone on is the global economy, where you see the Indian economy continuing to grow very, very strongly. You see the Chinese economy in resurgence based on their stimulus programs. So I think those things are contributing significantly to the uptick as well.</p><p>So, it is an interconnected global economy. In our case, I think the financial programs have been very, very critical to it. I also think the president himself has been instilling confidence through his communication, through his demeanor, through the programs that he's launched. And this is a very -- you know, people's psyches are fragile, but they also can move in a positive direction, very, very quickly, and I think you are beginning to see that occurring.</p><p>GLICK: Congressman Sestak, I'm going to give you the last word.</p><p>One of the things about the data shows that number of hours worked have dropped. Productivity, as we just saw yesterday, is rising.</p><p>One material concern out there is that we will see declining wages, that we've seen declining wages, but that it will be a bigger issue that the consumer will still remain fairly tapped out. And because we've figured out how to accomplish more with less workers, that some of those jobs may not come back.</p><p>How important is it to find those future jobs that will perhaps replace a lot of the millions of jobs of the six million that we have seen since the recession began?</p><p>SESTAK: This is an excellent point you make.</p><p>We have lost about a trillion dollars in our GDP as compared to our 2007 GDP high peak. And if we just have an economy, as was just mentioned, that grows slowly, and let's just say it grows at 2.5 percent, which was the average between 2001 and 2007, it will take us three years to soak up that $1 trillion of lost GDP capacity. Which means if we don't grow more rapidly, we won't be creating these jobs that you spoke about.</p><p>That's why the president's budget is absolutely critical. If he is -- and I believe he is -- intent upon in succeeding in retooling the economy in the types of jobs, the green energy jobs, the ability to reform our health care system, those parts of this budget will be absolutely critical.</p><p>Second, I go back that we have to do more in the entrepreneur incentives by the right tax incentives to get that extra bump to our economy above 2.5 percent growth in the next few years to come, or we won't create those jobs.</p><p>GLICK: Right. Good point.</p><p>SESTAK: Because China is growing this year 6.8 percent as we lose about five or six percent. So that's why this is important, your point.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys. We are going to leave it there. Terrific, terrific discussion.</p><p>I'm glad to see we've seen some relief in the numbers, but remember still a lot of people unemployed in this economy.</p><p>Congressman Sestak, Roger and John, thank you so much, gentlemen.</p><p>SESTAK: Thank you for having me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: A reminder, by the way please join me, 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time. I will be speaking to the labor secretary, Hilda Solis, in a \"First on Fox\" interview here to break down this May employment number. So please tune in for that. We'll get an opportunity to get her thoughts in just about 45 minutes.</p><p>All right. Coming up, more jobs lost. We're talking to students just entering the working world about their hunt for employment.</p><p>And of course we will head live to the New York Stock Exchange for a little bit of a preview on what is now a market that's looking pretty good.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: All week we have been taking a look at the nation's growing deficit as a result of government spending as something we called red ink. Now, MONEY FOR BREAKFAST teamed up with the college news service U-Wire to take a closer look at Generation Debt, the students of America who will inherit the current deficit</p><p>Some of those students told us the financial worries that are keeping them -- frankly, they're keeping them up at night. Take a listen to what they had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My biggest financial concern is just to find a job after I graduate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm more worried about people my parents' age who have just seen their retirement funds completely be gone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My parents' businesses since December, like, their sales have been halved. And that kind of really affects me because I'm in school now. I can't help them out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My personal biggest financial concern is just being able to live the life that we're expected to live as -- you know, again since I came from a background where my parents didn't necessarily have a lot of money, I think there was a big expectation for me coming to college and getting the job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: Well, as you heard, some of the students we spoke to say finding a job is their top worry. With roughly 1.5 million graduating seniors entering the workforce this year and a loss of another 500,000 -- well, now actually we have seen 350,000 jobs in May, according to the most recent survey -- what will they do? And is now the time to figure out other options?</p><p>Joining us right now, Emily Sutherland, who is heading into her senior year at Colorado State; Leah Finnegan, who graduated from the University of Texas this year; and Dean Van Tassell, who received his MBA from Pace University just two weeks ago.</p><p>Good morning, guys. Good to see you.</p><p>LEAH FINNEGAN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS GRADUATE: Good morning.</p><p>DEAN VAN TASSELL, RECEIVED MBA FROM PACE UNIVERSITY: Good morning.</p><p>EMILY SUTHERLAND, HEADING INTO SENIOR YEAR AT COLORADO STATE: Good morning.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Dean. Let me talk to you.</p><p>You just graduated two weeks ago from Pace University. You have been on the job hunt. What have you been experiencing?</p><p>VAN TASSELL: Well, first of all, thank you for having me on the program. And BB&amp;T Capital Markets loves Fox Business.</p><p>GLICK: Oh, that's good to know. Thanks.</p><p>VAN TASSELL: I have been applying to, let's see now, about 70 different investment banks, writing the HR departments, following with managing directors, trying to get my name out there as much as possible. I have a nice stack of rejection letters right now, so it's rough out there.</p><p>You know, you have to start making contingency plans. And it's -- you know, we're up to 9.4 percent. The only solace I have is that maybe the 9.4 percent unemployment is backwards looking, and the market seems to be shrugging it off today. So hopefully we will have second derivative fever and things will start to level out and pick up relatively soon.</p><p>GLICK: Leah, you just graduated from the University of Texas. You have a BA in American studies.</p><p>What kind of jobs have you been looking for?</p><p>FINNEGAN: I'm actually going into journalism, which is, you know, quite an experience at this time. And I applied to about 20 jobs, and I heard \"No\" from about five. And then I just didn't hear from the rest of them. So it's kind of like applying to a black hole.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, radio silence. </p><p>So what did you decide to do when you just weren't getting back any responses or you were just getting rejection notes without even, as I understand, getting an opportunity to even interview?</p><p>FINNEGAN: Well, my contingency plan was grad school, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go, and kind of applied on the lark and ended up getting into grad school and not getting into any jobs. So grad school it is.</p><p>GLICK: So you're going to Columbia?</p><p>FINNEGAN: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: My alma mater.</p><p>FINNEGAN: Oh, OK.</p><p>GLICK: Very excited. OK.</p><p>Now Emily, let me talk to you. I understand you are majoring in communications. You are going to be a senior this year at Colorado State.</p><p>When you listen to what's happening to Dean and Leah and I'm sure a lot of your other classmates, how is that impacting you? How nervous does it make you knowing that you are going into your senior year of college?</p><p>SUTHERLAND: Well, it makes me really nervous, of course. A lot of my friends have graduated. A lot of them have resulted in working at Starbucks and their degree has gotten them absolutely nowhere. So I just hope that things pick up so I actually do have job opportunities out there once I graduate.</p><p>GLICK: Dean, you smiled there. I mean, how many of your friends and colleagues have had to do that? Like, you might have had aspirations of working on Wall Street or working in a particular sector, but there's no opportunities and you have to get what you can get.</p><p>VAN TASSELL: I know a lot of people who would be lucky to get a job at Starbucks. It's hard.</p><p>I will probably have to go back to bartending for a little bit, but it seem just as competitive as Wall Street, if not more. You have a lot of people laid off and in the same position I'm in, so a lot of people just don't have any options, even contingency plans.</p><p>The number one thing I hear is there's a lot of government jobs out there, but the mentality of, I want to work on Wall Street, I'm very aggressive, I want to be in the financial markets than going into a government job, it's a bit different from what you have expected might be around after you graduate. So...</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>And Leah, how many other classmates of yours have said they are going to choose to continue to go back to school because that's really the only and best option?</p><p>FINNEGAN: A really good number. It is a very popular option right now. And I don't know, I'm kind of finding the whole experience a bit freeing, and I think a lot of people my peers are as well, that now we have this time right now to kind of relax and discover what we really want to do.</p><p>GLICK: Good point.</p><p>FINNEGAN: and then we have the rest of our lives to do it. So there's not so much pressure to be successful and make more than $100,000 right out of college.</p><p>GLICK: Great point.</p><p>I wish you all the best success. Leah, Dean and Emily, thank you guys so much.</p><p>VAN TASSELL: Thank you.</p><p>FINNEGAN: Thank you.</p><p>SUTHERLAND: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys. We're going to take a break. We will be right back with \"THE OPENING BELL\" in just a moment. We're just about five minutes away.</p><p>All right. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: All right. Welcome back. It's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>Connell, you were watching actually the bond market reaction to the jobs data. What did you see happen?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, a big move up in yields, which is really going to be the story that we're going to have to follow very, very closely, Alexis, when you think about it.</p><p>And Charles, you and I talked about this, the idea that hey, maybe the economy has bottomed out and things are starting to look better, but what about rising yields, rising mortgage rates, and other things? And does that cut off the recovery?</p><p>GLICK: It could be a tough bear market for the bonds.</p><p>PAYNE: Absolutely. And also, I was looking at equities. I thought the Dow and this type of number would be up 200, 300 points. I'm serious. I think we have a conflict here with the unemployment number being 9.4.</p><p>GLICK: I agree.</p><p>PAYNE: Two separate surveys -- the Household Survey saying, listen, it's tough, it's tougher than the way the businesses maybe are looking at it.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. You've got to wonder why the divergence.</p><p>And speaking of which, actually, I'm going to talk to Labor Secretary Hilda Solis coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time. So tune in. She will he' be joining us \"First on Fox.\"</p><p>All right, guys. We'll be right back.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Journal reporting Sheila Bair and the FDIC want a change and it could include CEO Vikram Pandit. Who might be tapped to replace him? And what do the people at Citigroup think?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the SEC charges Mozilo federal regulators charge Countrywide cofounder <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>with insider trading and securities fraud. What will happen to him next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're serving these stories and much more this morning on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>Good morning and happy Friday. Welcome to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>Coming up this morning, much more on the latest on GM Saturn sale and that possible shakeup at Citigroup.</p><p>Plus the smart phone war is heating up as Palm gets ready to release its new device; it's called the Pre. And it goes public later today. We'll get a preview of that phone.</p><p>And all this as reports that <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is ready to return to the helm after a six-month medical hiatus. Could Apple be making a big announcement as early as next week?</p><p>Plus, the May unemployment numbers are due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. All eyes are on this number. Expectations are for a loss of another 520,000 jobs; unemployment to reach 9.2 percent. We'll see in just moments.</p><p>Roger Ballou, CDI Core President and CEO and Representative Joe Sestak from Pennsylvania are both going to join me to break down those numbers when they come out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>We'll also have a terrific roundtable discussion on where the jobs are being created in the state and local municipalities. Is the fiscal stimulus package actually helping create enough jobs?</p><p>Let's take a look at the futures right now as we get started. As you can see across the board we're in the green; right now the DOW up 36; S&amp;P up four; NASDAQ up three. So across the board we're up just fractionally.</p><p>Let's get directly to the markets. Fox Business contributor Gavin Gray is in for Mr. Ashley Webster in London. And Connell McShane is here with us right now. Let's get started with Connell here in New York -- Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning Alexis. Yes we're certainly watching those markets closely, you showed us the futures moving a little bit higher indicating we might get a higher open at the final trading day of the week.</p><p>But all of that can change of course; 8:30 a.m. Eastern time will be the big number on jobs. Now, speaking of jobs in a different -- speaking of it in a different way, <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is making big news at Apple.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning reporting he is on pace to take back the CEO position to come back on to the job as planned and with that said, from medical leave, the stock is getting a nice boost this morning.</p><p>All of that kind of plays into what Alexis was talking about a little while ago, the back and forth between Apple and Palm; Palm coming out over the weekend with its Pre. Not only might jobs come back as planned here but the idea is maybe he comes back a little earlier than planned.</p><p>There's a big developer's conference next week and the thinking is maybe Jobs comes back for that, announces a new iPhone. We'll see that getting a little bit ahead of ourselves but the \"Journal\" starting that speculation this morning.</p><p>Investors seem to like it. The Apple stock price as you see there up to 147 in change pre-market trading.</p><p>Ok, let's see what the European markets are up to this morning as we do now head over to Gavin Gray in London -- Gavin.</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Connell thanks very much indeed. Let's first of all have a look at the markets over here; all really waiting on particularly in Europe and Britain waiting really for the results of the cabinet reshuffle.</p><p>But let's kick off in London with the FTSE. That is currently up 67 points leading the way at 4,454; the CAC-40 now gaining of a bit of strength as well, up 28 points. And the DAX really hasn't moved much all morning. Just up 21 points or 0.4 of a percent.</p><p>As really as I said, eyes looking at Downing Street, waiting for this Cabinet reshuffle. We haven't had it confirmed yet but we do believe that the Alistair Darling who is the current Chancellor -- the moneyman is going to keep his position. It's rumored he told Gordon Brown I either have this job or I don't have a job in your cabinet. We do think that he is going to remain as Chancellor. One or two other movements, we believe a fourth Minister has resigned. That is the fourth in just four days.</p><p>And also a report that U.K. inflation continues to fall. A sign about that the Office of National Statistics says the price of manufactured goods has come down just 0.3 percent year on year, largely because of the oil price coming down in that last year, but of course oil is coming back up. But that is the biggest annual decline since June 2002.</p><p>Alexis back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Gavin thank you very much.</p><p>Well, auto news now. It is a hot topic.</p><p>Breaking news this morning the \"Wall Street Journal\" says auto dealer Roger Penske will reportedly buy the Saturn brand from General Motors. Sources say, Penske would buy vehicles from GM and Renault then sell them under the Saturn brand. No word yet on how much Penske is paying. An official announcement is to be made later today.</p><p>And the deal to sell Hummer to a Chinese company may have hit a bump in the road. Some experts say regulators in Beijing may block it because the Hummer brand goes against China's focus on fuel efficient vehicles.</p><p>And GM will finance a huge part of a private equity firm's buyout of parts maker Delphi. GM will provide $2.5 billion of the $3.6 billion -- that specific $3.6 billion price tag. In return GM buys back four Delphi plants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL PACINO, ACTOR: Something really wrong is going on here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are out of order.</p><p>PACINO: You're out of order, you're out of order. The whole trial is out of order. They are out of order.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: And there you have it. That was Al Pacino. I'm not sure if you remember in the courtroom black comedy \"And Justice For All\" which details chaos in the court system. And some think that's precisely what's going on today with the Chrysler bankruptcy hearing.</p><p>A judge in New York will hear arguments from a group trying to block the deal with Fiat. Opponents include a group of Indiana state pension funds and a dozen other parties.</p><p>Speaking of which, for more on what we can expect today, let's go directly down to lower Manhattan to our own Adam Shapiro who is standing outside the U.S. Court of Appeals.</p><p>And Adam I'm not sure it's quite Al Pacino style but it seems like it's getting pretty close.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it could be close, but the Indiana - - the lawyers for the Indiana State Treasurer Richard Murdock are going to be arguing on behalf of 100,000 Indiana pensioners, police officers as well as teachers that the sale to Fiat violates all kinds of bankruptcy law as well as the TARP law -- the law which created the Trouble Asset Relief Program. That's the argument they're going to make in court.</p><p>First, that senior secured lenders like the pensioners are being given a secondary position in this bankruptcy which is counter to Bankruptcy Law. Second, that the TARP was originally created to help financial institutions not automobile companies and that's a violation of the Troubled Asset Relief Program that was set up last year.</p><p>And that third, this is just a deal that is not good for the U.S. taxpayers. That's the argument they're going to make in court. And that argument lost. They didn't gain any ground with that argument when they presented it to Judge Arthur Gonzalez at the Bankruptcy Court.</p><p>They've also argued that this was a private plan agreed to before, they called it a Sub-Rosa plan, before Chrysler filed for bankruptcy, but again, Arthur Gonzalez said no that's just not the case. That's what the Appellate panel is going to hear; the three judges on the Appellate Court.</p><p>They're also going to be considering Chrysler's motion to certify the sale. If that happens, if the Indiana pensioners lose and Chrysler wins and the sale is certified, you can expect that sale to close almost immediately because Chrysler says it has to close the deal with Fiat by the 15th of June or else Fiat has the option to walk away from the table and worse it walks away with $35 million from Chrysler as a penalty for failing to close the deal.</p><p>So there's a lot riding on this decision today, Alexis.</p><p>One other thing in regards to that Hummer sale and the report that the Chinese are making perhaps a problem as to closing that deal because Hummers aren't fuel efficient. Hummer dealers will tell you that the H-3 which is the smaller Hummer -- it's built on the Chevy Colorado platform -- they'll tell you it gets better gas mileage on the highway than some of the import SUVs like the Lexus. So that's an argument that they are probably ready to fight.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Adam. I was just going to ask you about that, I appreciate it. All right, we'll check in with you a little later outside the court.</p><p>All right, well Chrysler is fighting two courtroom battles which Adam just talked about in its push to exit bankruptcy and merge with Fiat. In addition to today's hearing with the group of those Indiana state pensions and investment funds that are looking to block the deal. Close to 800 of the Chrysler's dealers are making their case in court. They made it yesterday to put the breaks on the plan.</p><p>For a closer look at the impact of the courtroom battles, Laurie Moncrieff is the president of Schmald Tool &amp; Die, an auto parts supplier that did business for Chrysler, and joining us on the phone Jim Anderer, the owner of Island Jeep in Long Island who is fighting in court to keep his business open.</p><p>Laurie, don't worry about the people behind you. I saw you telling people to keep quiet. Believe me I do that every single day. All right Laurie, tell me first of all, what does this delay mean to you and your business?</p><p>LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE: The manufacturers have been feeling the effects of what's been happening in the auto industry for quite some time. So quite frankly we're ready to get on with business.</p><p>The markets up here have been largely frozen because of what's going on in our economy in Michigan with the Detroit three. So in our opinion, we feel that moving forward quickly with the bankruptcy would be a help to the manufacturers.</p><p>GLICK: And Laurie, explain specifically what it is that you guys do and sort of where you fit into the food chain here in terms of how this impacts your business.</p><p>MONCRIEFF: We do precision machining and make dyes for the auto industry as well as many other industries. And quite frankly, all this upheaval is affecting a lot of industries besides just the auto industry.</p><p>GLICK: Great point.</p><p>Jim, I know you're joining us by phone. You've been kind enough to be here on several occasions. You're fighting to keep your dealership alive. You are one of those who received a pink slip. Tell me why the delay of this judgment of this decision could actually help you.</p><p>JIM ANDERER, PRESIDENT, ISLAND JEEP (via telephone): Hi, Alexis. Well, thanks for having me.</p><p>The delay helps me only in regard that it can possibly nix this deal. This is a bad deal for the American taxpayer. It's a bad deal for pretty much everybody involved, in my opinion.</p><p>I know that the vendor on the other line, you know, has her own agenda, and I'm sympathetic to that. But in my personal opinion this is a tragedy that's taking place in the American marketplace. It's putting 100,000 people out of work. It's really devastating to our economy right now. And I would like to see it nixed to be honest with you. I don't think it's a good deal...</p><p>GLICK: Ok, so Jim...</p><p>ANDERER: I think that Fiat is coming into this deal with no cash. And it's wrought with a lot of problems.</p><p>GLICK: Jim, you and I have talked about this before, and you have been in the courtroom. In fact you were in the courtroom yesterday speaking on behalf of those dealers who are being forced to shut down.</p><p>What convinces you that if the deal were not to go through with Fiat, that a liquidation of Chrysler would put you in a better position than if this deal were to go through?</p><p>ANDERER: Very simply that the market forces that would take place is exactly what should take place. The market forces would seek their own level which is the way it should be.</p><p>Ok, what's going on with this taxpayer bailout and all this other stuff? I mean, you know, give me a break. If -- whatever these particular brands are worth when they're in liquidation would be sold for what they are worth.</p><p>Ok I'm a stand-alone Jeep store. Jeep is never going to go away. It is going to be picked up by somebody. And whoever that is, is going to make a real go of it. But there's a false propping up of these brands is insanity. This is just not the way things should be done in a free marketplace.</p><p>GLICK: Laurie, let me switch to you for a moment. You actually feel that if they can make it through bankruptcy, that as suppliers, your position will be that much safer and more secure. Explain to people why that is.</p><p>LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE: Well, it's always a lot more risky to do business with a company prior to bankruptcy than after bankruptcy so we felt a huge disruption, and quite frankly in the tool and die industry, we felt a huge disruption for many, many years and we've seen this coming for many years.</p><p>We've known there's been instability in the market for many years. We were somewhat of the canary in the mines frankly in this economy and have been discussing the problems in tooling and in manufacturing since the early 2000 because we could feel that it was very unstable, and that the economy was not doing well quite frankly in the early 2002, 2003.</p><p>There were a lot of discussions about the problems in the market. So while many of the dealers and other segments of the auto industry quite frankly probably weren't even aware of the problems we were very much aware of it in our industry.</p><p>GLICK: So Laurie when you look at the current environment, I mean look, you live in Flint, Michigan. We're actually going to talk to Virg Bernero a little bit later on this morning.</p><p>What are people doing right now to either make sure that companies like you are diversifying your risk or finding other viable job opportunities because I imagine everything is tightened up in Michigan?</p><p>MONCRIEFF: Everything's not only tightened up. It's frozen in the market right now. And it's not just the auto industry, it's the financial markets are really playing a huge role. The state of Michigan has been basically red lined by a lot of banks so lines of credit are being pulled, very much a big problem with getting financing to operate your business.</p><p>And then even in other industries when you diversify, we're feeling a lot of difficulty in a lot of other industries that are not even part of the auto industry because the financial market up in Michigan is frozen, as I said. So we're very anxious for the market to be unfrozen, whatever it takes to do that.</p><p>We need financing. We need money to start flowing to survive. That's basically what we're doing up here in Flint is working very, very hard to survive this right now.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, Laurie, we wish you the very best. And Jim, you too. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to join us this morning.</p><p>ANDERER: Thanks, Alexis.</p><p>MONCRIEFF: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: Coming up, Countrywide's cofounder <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>charged with fraud by the SEC. The Judge is going to join us with his take.</p><p>And later the Palm Pre hits stores tomorrow. Will it take a bite out of Apple's iPhone? There's a lot of buzz about this. We're going to tell you about it in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: In court now, two executives from a defunct Seattle investment management firm are charged with running what prosecutors call one of the largest tax fraud schemes ever uncovered in the country. Quellos founder, Matthew Krane and CEO Jeffrey Greenstein and two others are charged with fraud, tax evasion and money laundering. Prosecutors say they created more than $1.3 billion in fraudulent losses for clients. Quellos used to be one of the world's biggest managers of mutual funds.</p><p>A jury not a judge will hear claims in a case between American International Group, AIG and Star International, the company controlled by Maurice Greenberg AIG's former CEO. The trial will now start June 15th. There are several lawsuits outstanding between AIG and Mr. Greenberg and sure wants Star to return AIG stocks and proceeds from stock sales. AIG received billions of dollars in federal bailout funds.</p><p>And the Securities and Exchange Commission charges former Countrywide CEO <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>with fraud and insider trading. Prosecutors say Mozilo and two other former executives misled investors about risky lending practices. The SEC also says Mozilo unloaded $140 million in Countrywide stock using insider information. It is the first case against a high-profile executive stemming from the sub prime mortgage meltdown. Mozilo has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer calls the SEC's allegations baseless.</p><p>Our fox news senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us right now for a look at the case. The judge is in the house and he's going to give us some explanations here. Judge, good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning Alexis. Good to see you.</p><p>GLICK: surprised by this announcement?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm surprised by this announcement. I expected -- and that would be standard operating procedure in a case like this -- an indictment rather than a civil lawsuit. This is a civil lawsuit the Securities and Exchange Commission says you didn't tell your opinion of your own products to your shareholders, and that caused them to acquire shares ignorant of what you thought of the products.</p><p>What did he think of them? Well the SEC got some e-mails, and in that he referred to his own products as toxic and poison. Now, that's the bad news that he said that in these e-mails. The good news for him is he was not indicted. He was not charged with a crime. The feds may still be investigating for that purpose.</p><p>But standard operating procedure in cases of fraud and insider trading is to indict and convict first and then to sue civilly. So the fact that they are suing him civilly, they are just looking for money and an order from a judge that he can never run a public company again. They are not looking to take away his freedom, tells me they don't have enough evidence to indict him or convict him.</p><p>GLICK: It's interesting because involved in this case also being charged with this as well is his chief operating officer and the CFO. All three of which are saying that number one, it's baseless. That they did divulge the proper information throughout the entire reporting process, and they say look the fact of the matter is the SEC has not done anything right in years, and they are using them as the poster child for what the SEC should have done over the past five years.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, the SEC's failures is a political argument that the court will not allow them to make to a jury. But the court will let them say this, \"Look, you have accused us of failing to share our opinions with everyone. You haven't us accused of failing to share facts.\"</p><p>This is not Enron or WorldCom where inaccurate data was given out. This is just a case where an opinion like toxic and poison wasn't shared with the public.</p><p>GLICK: Ok, but what is the chance, though, that when you read what the SEC is suggesting here, that this is brought on to suggest that it is very much like an Enron case, where they were not divulging material public information that could have affected decisions of shareholders, investors, etc.?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It is a question of law for the court to decide. Is it material information what the CEO's personal opinion is of his products? These are not facts now. They didn't hide numbers. They didn't cook books. They just held back these words like toxic and poison.</p><p>Flip side of this is, if this was really insider trading, they would have indicted him. But because they haven't indicted him, what it is, is using insider knowledge to sell; knowledge that anyone else could have gotten had they looked into the books.</p><p>GLICK: Let's bring up one of those e-mails dating back to 2006 because I want people to hear specifically what he said. \"In all my years in the business, I have never seen a more toxic product.\" That was one e-mail.</p><p>He also sent another e-mail regarding a certain kind of sub prime loan. And he said \"it is the most dangerous product in existence, and there can be nothing more toxic. Loans had been originated through our channels with disregard for process and compliance with guidelines.\" This is where he's talking about the fact that the procedure for getting loans was just way too simple.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know what the defense is? \"The government wanted us to do this and Fannie and Freddie took them off our backs and the shareholders are no longer at risk.\" That's the defense that he'll make and that's true.</p><p>The government did want those subprime loans given out and Fannie and Freddie did take them off the backs of Countrywide and others. That is inappropriate in my view believing in a free market. That's what the government did and that's why we have this crisis.</p><p>GLICK: Let's talk about one of the domino effects here. There's no doubt in my mind that Senator Christopher Dodd is climbing in a shell, perhaps in a bunker, as a result of this. He was one of those on the sort of Mozilo list of getting what some argue is a better mortgage. What do you make of this for Dodd?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: This is very bad news for Chris Dodd who already is suffering politically in Connecticut as a result of this. He's up for reelection in 2010.</p><p>Just as <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>kept from shareholders his opinion of his own product, Chris Dodd kept from voters the fact that <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>gave him an absolute sweetheart deal.</p><p>What's the relationship between Chris Dodd and <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo? </nameText></person>Chris Dodd is the chairman of the senate banking committee which regulates these things and writes the laws to control them. And he's accepting an enormous benefit that the public could never get from the CEO of one of the biggest companies he's writing the laws to regulate. The voters of Connecticut will have their say on this one, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, this is ugly. And then that whole issue with the AIG, the wording of the bonuses and the fiscal stimulus package. Oh my goodness.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Senator Dodd's also deep into that one.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. Judge, thank you very much. Great seeing you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Happy Friday. Have a great weekend.</p><p>GLICK: Happy Friday.</p><p>Also again I do want to say Mozilo has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer David Siegel calls the SEC allegations baseless. As for the other defendants, they attorney for David Sambol called this \"a baseless complaint that is a result of the political pressure the SEC is facing for the well-publicized enforcement failures.\"</p><p>And Eric Sieracki's attorney meanwhile says the SEC's case is \"without merit. Countrywide's stock performance was tied to the fortunes of the real estate and secondary markets for loans. Something all investors knew about.\"</p><p>I just wanted to clear up some statements from their attorneys.</p><p>Coming up, Charles Payne offers up his stock choices.</p><p>And President Obama meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel today; the president reassured the Europeans about the U.S. economy. We will tell you what he had to say when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Gavin Gray with a look at this morning's top news stories.</p><p>President Obama is meeting with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel today after bilateral meeting addressed in castle (ph), President Obama held a joint press conference with the German chancellor. The president reassured the Europeans about the U.S. economy. Take a listen to what he had to say here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In the United States we are working diligently to strengthen financial regulations, to ensure that a crisis like this doesn't happen again. And it is going to be very important to coordinate between Europe and the United States as we move to strengthen our financial regulatory systems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAY: He'll be visiting Buchenwald concentration camp this morning. Before leaving for Paris, president Obama will meet with wounded soldiers at Landstuhl Medical Center.</p><p>In other news, investigators -- or rather reports of a setback for the search for Air France flight 447. France's Transportation Minister says French forces have found no evidence of an Airbus A-330 airplane that vanished over the Atlantic. He's urging extreme prudence about suspected debris fished from the ocean. The French Transportation Minister says he regrets an announcement by Brazilian teams that they had recovered plane debris from Air France flight 447. The jetliner was flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris; 228 people were on board.</p><p>AFP is reporting that former vice president Al Gore may be sent to North Korea to negotiate the release of two American journalists. Laura Ling and Euna Lee were arrested on March 17th near the North Korean border on charges they entered the country illegally and were engaged in hostile acts. Both women are reporters for Gore's California-based Current TV. They each could be sentenced to ten years in a labor camp.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Now back to New York and Charles Payne for a look at the stocks he's watching -- Charles, I'm listening.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you so much Gavin really appreciate it. Well folks it's going to be an exciting day today. Hopefully we will be to the upside.</p><p>A couple of stocks three stocks we're looking at. Manitowoc is one. This is one of these real hot equipment making stocks that obviously because of the economy has gotten hit real good. I think your risk reward now is really, really nice. Right here is where it broke the trend line recently. Now we're looking at a little resistance right around $7.80.</p><p>A break out there and I think you are pretty good. That takes you right here, that would be north of 10 buck; a huge percentage play. I love the fact that the risk reward is pretty good. In the March quarter they beat the street by almost 30 percent. Maybe that business is turning around. Certainly, the chart is attractive here.</p><p>Sina, I've probably mentioned this one now at least five times in the last year. As you can see, it is really starting to come on here to the point where it looks extremely, extremely attractive. This stock is breaking key resistance. I love the volume on it. I think if you don't have any China stocks, Baidu is my favorite. A lot of people are afraid to buy a stock that's almost $300 a share. This one might have room all the way up to $47 a share. It is one to take a look at. It is a reiteration.</p><p>And finally the stock that caught my eye more than any other yesterday. A company called Flir. The chart isn't so hot necessarily, it's been going down for a long time but I think it's hit a bottom and I think it's on the cusp of a major breakout.</p><p>By the way, this company has beaten the Street in each of the last four quarters and each time they beat by a larger margin. They make imaging systems for the military and of course for commercial use. I think the stock has room to $32 that would be almost 50 percent gain. I love the way it looked yesterday.</p><p>By the way, I have one pick on the Web that you have to go and take a look at today. Fox Business.com/moneyforbreakfast.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Mr. Payne, I look forward to it.</p><p>PAYNE: I'm pumped up about today, I'm hoping under 500,000. Keep our fingers crossed.</p><p>GLICK: Let's hope it is not too bad. Thank you very much Charles.</p><p>Coming up, we're going to go live to London for a look on how the overseas markets are trading. And Palm looking to take a bite out of Apple's bottom line with its new smart phone called the Pre. We're going to get a real live demonstration right here in studio and tell you why there's a lot of buzz about it. That's coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning, and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>Coming up: More on a report this morning from \"The Wall Street Journal\" that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's top management, including CEO Vikram Pandit. We're going to see who was mentioned as a possible replacement.</p><p>And Palm gets ready to release its Pre device tomorrow, looking to steal some of the success from Apple's iPhone. We're going to preview it in just a couple of minutes.</p><p>And what movie could possibly take down Pixar's \"Up\" from the top spot? Well, Universal and Warner Brothers have new releases. We're going to get those expectations both coming out today.</p><p>And we have the May employment report due out at 8:30. The expectation is for a loss of 520,000 jobs. We'll be live at the Labor Department.</p><p>And then, coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL\" at 9:35 a.m., I will be speaking with Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and get her reaction on the First on FOX to those job numbers.</p><p>All right. Let's take a look at the futures. We've been in the green throughout the morning. Let's see, are we still in the green? We are. OK, good news.</p><p>We're actually a little bit higher earlier this morning. The Dow up 41, S&amp;P up 5, NASDAQ up 5 as well. So, looking pretty good.</p><p>Let's get directly to financial news though -- we got a lot of that news. The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in its boardroom. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be bounced out. \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S. Bancorp CEO, Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job. The Feds own 34 percent of Citigroup.</p><p>And the FDIC is putting its program to rid the nation's banks of toxic assets on hold. The Legacy Loans Program was supposed to begin with trial sale this month, the FDIC says banks have proven they can raise private capital without cleansing their balance sheets. The FDIC says the program could come back in a different form.</p><p>And the FDIC is very busy today, also shutting down Silverton Bank. The troubled bank did attract investors from interest or from private equity guys. The FDIC says it had to do was cheapest for the insurance fund and shutting it down was cheaper. Silverton was not a retail bank. Most of its customers were actually other banks.</p><p>All right. Well, we've all been waiting for the big preview. The forefather of handheld phone is taking a run at Apple's iPhone to reclaim the spot as the king of the smartphone on the hill. Well, Palm will release its touch-screen Pre device tomorrow, exclusively on the Sprint network. And the phone offers a whole slew of slick new features.</p><p>With a look at it in some real details and whether or not it is going to be the necessary thing to boost Palm -- joining us right now is Lance Ulanoff. He's the editor-in-chief of PCMag.com. And FOX Business contributor Charles Payne, also WStreet.com founder is here with us as well to talk about the implications for the stocks of Palm and Apple.</p><p>All right. Lance, you've got the phone right in front of you. I'm very excited about this. How does it stack up? What are the things about the device that look so good?</p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, PC MAGAZINE EDITOR IN CHIEF: It stacks up pretty well. It is Sprint's best smartphone, bar none. It is gorgeous. It has many features you find on iPhone. It has a touch-screen, so I can add and drag around applications.</p><p>It has something the iPhone doesn't have, multitasking. So, if you are looking at the screen right now, I'm actually going through a bunch of different things that are running at once. So, it's a $199 phone after rebate. So, it starts at $299.</p><p>But it has something that the -- well, the iPhone doesn't have which is a QWERTY keyboard. So, this is one of the things that makes it so exciting. And you can use that QWERTY keyboard to do ubiquitous search, meaning the minute you start to type, it just starts to find whatever is on the phone.</p><p>One of the ways that it does that is it brings together all of your contacts from Google, Facebook, Exchange. It can search there. It can search throughout all of that.</p><p>It has a 3-megapixel camera. It plays video. And yes, it does have an accelerometer and what that means is you're going to be able to turn it to its side and you basically can play -- you can play videos in landscape mode.</p><p>GLICK: It looks really --</p><p>ULANOFF: It is.</p><p>GLICK: I'm entrenched. I'm watching --</p><p>ULANOFF: Oh, and, by the way -- and, by the way, it's got a really loud speaker.</p><p>GLICK: Wow. It's really awesome.</p><p>OK. So, let's talk about the big issue, which is the number of applications on the phone because I know I happen to have an iPhone.</p><p>ULANOFF: Right.</p><p>GLICK: And my kids adore it because it has so many different games on it. What are the applications like on this?</p><p>ULANOFF: Unfortunately, they are not coming out of the gate with a ton of applications. Right now, the iPhone has about 40,000 applications. This is going to start with about 20 or so. So, it's a -- it is far fewer and they are not really pushing the capabilities of this phone.</p><p>I've got Connect 4 up here, which is a lot of fun to play. I can drop in. I'm going to lose by the way. But I can drop in my checkers. But, except for touching it, you can't really shake it. You can't turn it over, shake out the chips, or anything like that.</p><p>There's Fandango. There's AP News. There's a NASCAR app, but not a NASCAR app where you drive a car, you just going to learn about what's going on if you are interested in NASCAR.</p><p>So, for somebody who's trying to decide between the iPhone and the Pre, well then, if you care about apps, there might not be much of a competition -- at least for now. But we do expect Palm to add in its app catalog a ton more apps very quickly.</p><p>GLICK: We are putting if here, Charles, the sort of what we're calling the tale of the tape here, which is the Palm Pre versus the Apple iPhone, walking through the carriers, the size of the memory, the screen, the applications, the cost -- all those things combined.</p><p>A lot of people believe, Charles, that this is do-or-die for Palm. This is their last opportunity to get out there and dazzle the community.</p><p>How important is it for them, and do you think they are doing what they need to do?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, there's no doubt that this is do-or-die. This is the bottom of 9th, two -- you know, two men out, two strikes against you, and you got to hit a home run. You can't hit a base. You can't bunt this thing.</p><p>The one thing, though, is that Wall Street has bid this stock up tremendously. Look at this chart. It's a mind-boggling move.</p><p>GLICK: Well, because the buzz on this phone has been very hot.</p><p>PAYNE: The buzz is hot but it's not like the buzz on the iPhone, where we saw people standing at midnight at the Apple Store waiting around in a line. I mean, this -- when the stock goes from like a buck to 13 bucks, that's huge, you know? So, ironically, of course, Apple's stock hasn't suffered too much.</p><p>And that's what I think you got going on here, too, a couple of things from the market's point of view. Maybe the smartphone category is big enough and is growing enough for there to be more than one winner. And maybe this won't be an iPhone killer, but perhaps, it will do well enough - - although the stock though, at this point, has had one heck of a move. And, you know, Wall Street, we get --</p><p>GLICK: The Palm's stock or Apple stock?</p><p>PAYNE: Palm stock.</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>PAYNE: Palm stock. Apple stock is still down from its high, although it's made a heck of a move recently from the lows of 88, 87. But still, I think on Wall Street, we tend to get extremely excited about things like this and we pump up these stocks. And I don't know that Palm can live up -- Palm Pre can live to the hype, at least not initially out of the gate.</p><p>GLICK: Lance, you made a facial expression when Charles talked about demand for the Pre. I hear that they are not releasing that many, and so, they think demand will be really hot.</p><p>ULANOFF: Well, I've heard that too. The CEO came out and said they might not be a lot of them out there. But I've also heard that there will be people waiting on lines, that there already is some guy waiting out there. And there are people who are telling me they are going to try and get it on Saturday because they are afraid there won't be enough at each store. But I have to say, Sprint has been working on this a long time. I'd be shocked if there aren't enough of these Pres to go around.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I mean, it's interesting Walter Mossberg, you know, from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he wrote a whole piece on it as well, and it was interesting to hear some of his points of view because a lot of people are looking to next week with Apple -- to see whether or not they are going to come out with a new iPhone. They are going to dazzle us, because a lot of their initial two-year contracts are set to expire coming up this summer. So, if they come out with one, this could be perfectly timed.</p><p>How crucial is it -- and, Lance, will <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>show up?</p><p>ULANOFF: We're all talking about that. You know, Wozniak, his former co-founder said he looked robust which is great news. We always expect surprises from Apple at every one of these major events. But I think this is going to be unique, because the third thing -- <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>has this habit in these events of going one more thing and he pulls it out of his back pocket.</p><p>I think the one more thing at this event is <person><nameText>Steve Jobs. </nameText></person>You have announcement, announcement -- <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>walks out with whatever the new iPhone is. I really think that could happen because he is a showman. He knows how to pull something like this thing off.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>ULANOFF: And there's going to be hot product out there. I don't know what it is, but it doesn't diminish what Palm has accomplished with the Pre, because I have to tell you -- this is a home run.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Charles, Tim Cook had done a terrific job in the role ...</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GLICK: ... of <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>obviously left in terms of running day-to- day operations. The stock is up 68 percent versus NASDAQ, which is up a little bit over 20 percent since left due to health concerns in January.</p><p>What will this mean if he does come back for Apple's stock?</p><p>PAYNE: Oh, it's a cherry on top of it. But more than that -- you know, listen, I don't think there's a CEO that's so identified with this company as Steven Jobs is with Apple. And listen, Apple already, early this morning, is indicating it's going to be up 3 or 4 points at the open today. And this is ahead of the Pre coming out tomorrow.</p><p>So, there's a lot of excitement about <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>coming in and doing something spectacular.</p><p>GLICK: We didn't even get to Sprint and AT&amp;T and Verizon. There's too much to talk about. But it looks so cool. It really does.</p><p>PAYNE: By the way, I think this is more important -- it might be as equally as important for Sprint as it is ...</p><p>GLICK: As it is for Palm.</p><p>PAYNE: Palm -- absolutely.</p><p>GLICK: Great point. Lance, thank you very much for breaking it in.</p><p>ULANOFF: It's a pleasure.</p><p>GLICK: You must be having fun with that.</p><p>ULANOFF: I am.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: He is grinning from ear to ear with this phone.</p><p>ULANOFF: I still want to keep it.</p><p>GLICK: OK. The control room would like you to go visit them because there are several purchasers, including my executive producer, who wants to buy that immediately.</p><p>ULANOFF: I'm taking bids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>All right. Coming up: We'll check the latest news headlines. And Warner Brothers is looking to cash in on a major hangover this weekend. We're going to preview the weekend box-office when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GREY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.

Johnson who is 45 years old has pitched for 16 in a 22-year career. Incredible.</p><p>And Charles Hayward, the president and CEO of the New York Racing Association said the absence of Rachel Alexandra would likely cost the Belmont Stakes significantly in attendance. With Rachel Alexandra in the race, Hayward estimated a crowd of between 80,000 to 90,000. Without her, he believes the crowd will be 50,000 to 60,000. Last year, when Big Brown was going for the Triple Crown, the attendance was 94,476.</p><p>Speaking of which, here now with a little preview of Belmont Stakes is FOX News reporter Rick Leventhal, who is live in Belmont Park.</p><p>Rick, pretty cool thing to be doing. I'm jealous. What's it looking like for tomorrow?</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, don't be too jealous because we're getting rained on right now. Attendance is near zero by the way because there's no races going on. However, Chip Woolley, the trainer of Mine That Bird you probably recognize from the Kentucky Derby is kind enough to join us for an exclusive one-on-one.</p><p>Now, they are saying attendance may be done because Rachel Alexandra who won the Preakness isn't running this race. You said that you believe that's possible?</p><p>CHIP WOOLLEY, MINE THAT BIRD TRAINER: Sure, she's a great filly and it would be good for in racing in general if she was here. But, in this game, you have to do what's best for the horse. And if they didn't feel like it was a best thing for her, it's better they don't run her.</p><p>And that, you know, racing -- racing will take care of itself. But we have to -- the horses have to come first.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Mine That Bird finished at close second to Rachel Alexandra. Are you disappointed that you didn't have a chance at a rematch on this longer track?</p><p>WOOLLEY: You know, a little bit disappointed I suppose. Really, I mean, it's -- for me, it's better she's not in here because that's one less horse you have to beat. And let's face it. If you don't have to beat them, you don't want to, you know? You want to limit the field to who you run at. So, I don't mind her not being here.</p><p>She's a great filly and you got to respect her a lot. So, really, for me, it's probably better she's not in for the racing game. It might be better that she would be here.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Your horse was on the track. It still is, I believe, on the track?</p><p>WOOLLEY: It just went off.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: It just went off. So, you just watched the horse working out in these conditions, which hopefully tomorrow, it will be sunny and drier. But how -- but how does Mine That Bird look today?</p><p>WOOLLEY: He looked great this morning. Just got over the ground really, really well. So we're real happy with where we're at. It looks like we got in here in good shape. And we're looking forward to running.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: You said he looked like a million bucks.</p><p>WOOLLEY: At least a million.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: That's the purse.</p><p>WOOLLEY: Yes, sir. Hopefully, we can get some of it, and hopefully, he'll have his best race in him tomorrow.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: So, Chip, if I were a betting man -- which I might be, by the way -- would you suggest I put money on your horse?</p><p>WOOLLEY: I will never make a suggestion like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Chip Woolley, the trainer of Mine That Bird -- thanks so much for being with us. And get well soon.</p><p>WOOLLEY: Nice to meet you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: All right. Nice to meet you, too. So, that's the story.</p><p>And here's another look at Belmont Park and the track, which is very muddy. But again, they are expecting sunshine tomorrow. And if you were on the fence about whether to come here or not, I'm told there will be sunny skies and it should be a great day for racing.</p><p>GLICK: If you were a betting man, is that the cat calling the kettle black or what?</p><p>LEVENTHAL: I didn't want to come out and say it, but, you know, I might put a couple dollars on the race.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Rick, I'll e-mail you later to do the same for me. Great interview. Thanks so much for seeing you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: OK. I look forward to it. Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Coming up: We're going to give you the box office preview for the weekend.</p><p>And this weekend, once again, you can pitch your business idea to a venture capitalist live right here on the FOX Business Network. Start emailing your pitches at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:YourMoney@FOXBusiness.com\">YourMoney@FOXBusiness.com</email> Lucky ones will get to sell their idea live on-air during on \"Your Questions, Your Money\" with Dagen McDowell and Robert Gray this Saturday, 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.</p><p>Stay with us. Movies -- coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: This weekend, Will Ferrell is going to be battling dinosaurs, bugs and one massive headache. The PG-13 time travel comedy, \"Land of the Lost\" from General Electric's Universal Pictures is going against Warner Brothers \"The Hangover,\" an R-rated bachelor party that shows what happens in Las Vegas may leave you with a tiger, a baby, and a missing groom. Yes, that's right.</p><p>Here to tell us how the films will do and if either of them can capture the upward mobility of Walt Disney's-Pixar's \"Up,\" joining me right now is Bradley Jacobs. He is the senior editor of \"Us Weekly.\"</p><p>Good morning, Bradley. Good to see you.</p><p>BRADLEY JACOBS, US WEEKLY SENIOR EDITOR: Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: No, wait a second. Is \"Hangover\" PG-13 or R?</p><p>JACOBS: That's definitely R-rated.</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>JACOBS: R-rated movie.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, because -- OK, because I heard there's a lot of profanity. I just wasn't sure if it was -- OK. Anyhow, I was saying to you before that I was at the movies yesterday evening, and I came out and there were these massive lines down the block. I understand there were midnight showings of \"Hangover.\" What's the buzz?</p><p>JACOBS: It had some of the best buzz of the year. You know, for a movie with no big stars, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, the concept is really key here. Four guys, a bachelor party that goes wrong, a missing groom, there's a baby in the mix. There's a stripper in the mix.</p><p>I saw it a couple of weeks ago. I really loved it. I think it is going to be hugely successful. R-rated summer movies are kind of the rare thing. So, you got -- you got the college students, you got --</p><p>GLICK: That's why I said, \"Are you sure it's R, are you sure it's not PG-13\"?</p><p>JACOBS: I am absolutely sure.</p><p>GLICK: Are you sure?</p><p>JACOBS: I am doubly sure that \"Land of the Lost\" is PG-13, and that's more of a kids' movie although it's PG-13. So, it's not really for 4-year-olds, it's not really for 6-year-olds. It's sort of, you know, for people in the PG-13 era, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds.</p><p>I think the battle between these two is really interesting.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, it is interesting. I do want to bring in Harry Medved, also from Fandango.com.</p><p>Because, Harry, I know you've been looking at \"The Land of the Lost\" pre-sales (ph) and there are just completely non-existent. Bradley was telling me the reviews are just horrific.</p><p>You tell me, Harry, what did they get wrong with \"Land of the Lost\"? Will anybody go see it?</p><p>HARRY MEDVED, FANDANGO.COM: Well, you know, people are saying on Fandango, the user reviews are saying it's perfect for 13 year olds of all ages, especially if you're for bathroom humor, because it is PG-13. But there's plenty of dinosaur manure, dinosaur urine, masturbation jokes and frequent uses of the S-word for any 13-year-old to wallow in.</p><p>Now, parents may not be too excited about it. But at least it's not the R-rated comedy of \"The Hangover\" that Bradley was just talking about.</p><p>GLICK: But, Bradley, look, this is box-office projections for these movies that are coming out of here. And \"Land of the Lost\" is getting some, you know, at least some decent -- I mean, not great, but decent projections. Is that because of Will Ferrell, you know, you just --</p><p>JACOBS: Will Ferrell is a huge star. They run commercials everywhere, marketing everywhere for this film. They just want to get butts in seats in the first few days before the word really spreads about it.</p><p>But I actually think those productions may be wrong and you could see \"Hangover\" end up number two this weekend.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. I mean, I was saying to you ...</p><p>JACOBS: I do, too.</p><p>GLICK: I was saying to you before, like, oh, my God, I had never seen a movie marketed more than this one, oh my goodness. OK. How does this stack up against up, against \"Star Trek\"? You know, we had some big blockbusters last summer. You know, who turns out to be the big ones this summer?</p><p>JACOBS: Well, \"Up\" had a huge weekend last weekend, and I wouldn't be surprised if \"Up\" were number one again this weekend. It would be the first time in more than a year that an animated movie has been number one two weekends in a row. But \"Up,\" you have that magic thing where the critics love it and audiences love it -- which is very rare.</p><p>I saw it here in 3-D last weekend. I want to see it again. And I think that there is incredible word of mouth for that film, because it's one of those things where you can take your family. You can take kids. You can take teenagers. You can take your friend.</p><p>You know, it's really in that magical place. So, I think that will be number one.</p><p>MEDVED: You know --</p><p>GLICK: Yes, Harry, go quickly.</p><p>MEDVED: I'm not sure you want to take kids under 6 years old, because there are some terrifying elements to \"Up.\" Now, on Fandango, that's the place where people buy advanced tickets, we are seeing that \"Up\" is leading the way for ticketing this weekend, it's about 42 percent of all tickets sold on Fandango.</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>MEDVED: But \"The Hangover\" is gaining momentum. There was a surge of tickets last night. Those people you saw online last night, Alexis, they're all across the country. Thursday midnight shows were sold out last night.</p><p>I went to one last night and people came out of the theater saying, \"I want to see 'The Hangover' again.\"</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>MEDVED: So, I think you will be surprised. \"Hangover\" will not be number two. I think it will be number one.</p><p>GLICK: I have to leave it there, Harry and Bradley. I know what I'm doing this weekend if only I could get a baby-sitter. Gentlemen, thank you very much. I appreciate it.</p><p>JACOBS: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: We'll be right back. We're going to do a roundtable on jobs as jobs numbers are due out in half hour. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Good morning and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>We're about 30 minutes way from the release of the May employment report. Expectations are for a loss of another 520,000 jobs, sending the unemployment rate to 9.2 percent. We are live at the U.S. Labor Department in Washington, D.C., to break down those numbers.</p><p>Also, Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is going to join us for his analysis on those numbers. And Roger Ballou, the CDI Corp. CEO, is going to join me to break it all down.</p><p>And news this morning that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's top management, including perhaps CEO Vikram Pandit. We're going to get into those details in just a moment.</p><p>And on the jobs front, speaking of which, I will be talking to the labor secretary coming up later this morning on \"The Opening Bell\" at just about 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time. We'll get Hilda Solis' point of view on the jobs.</p><p>Let's look at the markets, though. We're in the green. We're at the highs of the morning. Dow up 45. S&amp;P up 5. Nasdaq up 5 as well. So across the board we're up about 0.5 percent.</p><p>All right, let's get a look at the markets. We have business contributor Gavin Gray and Connell McShane. Let's start with Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Alexis, thanks very much.</p><p>As you said, we are trading higher ahead of the open this morning and ahead, more importantly, of the jobs report because when you think about it, all things can change here half an hour from now. So, you know, and that's all we're going to be talking about a half an hour from now. So let me give you a couple of stocks individually to watch. Either way, no matter what the jobs report comes out at, these are going to be stocks to watch.</p><p>Apple, right behind me, is definitely one of them. There's a report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" about <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>this morning. Look at it going from below $144 to almost $147 in pre-market trading. So a nice little boost. The report in \"The Journal\" is Jobs is on track to come back on the job as the CEO there after taking medical leave by the end of the month. And there's even some speculation in that \"Journal\" article that he comes back earlier.</p><p>The big developer's conference next week. The Palm Pre coming out over the weekend. The speculation, and again this might be getting ahead of ourselves, is that Jobs maybe comes back ahead of schedule in order to announce a new iPhone. Either way, a lot of optimism about Apple.</p><p>One other quick stock to watch, a company called Quanta Services. PWR is the ticker on it. It is going to take the place of Ingersoll Rand in the S&amp;P 500. So Quanta, again, a power company that -- the index fund managers are going to have to buy this stock. It was up after hours. Ingersoll, by the way, is reincorporates itself. It's going to have its base in Ireland. With a name like Connell McShane, there's not (ph) any problem with having your base in Ireland. But the S&amp;P doesn't like that because you're supposed to be based in the United States. They make the exception for Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, which is where Quanta -- where Ingersoll was based before that. So they were allowed to be in the S&amp;P. Now they're leaving. Quanta takes its place. There you have it.</p><p>Gavin Gray over in Europe with a look at those overseas markets for us now.</p><p>Gavin, take it away.</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Connell, thanks very much indeed. I'm sure they'll make an exception for you, as you say.</p><p>Looking at the European markets, in Asia it was a 1 percent club today. It is in Europe as well pretty much. Starting off with the FTSE here in London. All waiting on announcements about Gordon Brown and his reshuffle. But up 1.5 percent at 67 points, 4,454. The CAC 40 in Paris, 3,347, up 35 points. The DAX hardly shifting at all today. Up just 33 points or 0.65 percent.</p><p>And despite that reshuffle in the U.K. cabinet, today we're getting details coming through in bits and pieces. Gordon Brown's position as prime minister really does remain in jeopardy. Some of the newspaper headlines today really damaging. Comes after four cabinet members have resigned in just four days, causing many politicians to question whether Mr. Brown has enough authority to continue at the head of the British government.</p><p>One thing we now believe is really pretty certain is the chancellor, the money man, the treasurer, Alistair Darling. He has apparently told Gordon Brown, I say as chancellor or I'm out. And we do think that he is going to stay as chancellor.</p><p>All this political uncertainty has been weighing heavily on the British pound. It slid against the dollar in recent days. Today it is down against both the dollar and the euro. And $1.61 will buy you one pound. And the dollar against the euro, though, is down, and $1.41 will buy you a euro.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, we could see the unemployment rate climb to 9.2 percent this morning with the release of the Labor Department's May employment report. Now while that rate may be up, job cuts may be down for the second month in a row with an estimated 520,000 job losses last month versus 539,000 lost in April. March, 699,000. Now, states are getting their hands on some of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help create employment opportunities. Is that enough? And what are state and local leaders doing right now with that money to create jobs?</p><p>Here's my take. Number one, we need to basically stem the tide on the job front and figure out what we're doing to address private sector jobs, particularly those that are created by small businesses. Number two, will the work -- will the work programs -- will they ultimately work to retain enough people? Those worker training programs. And number three, concern that the stimulus package is ultimately not enough to help the jobs situation. Perhaps time is the only cure. But keep in mind that the underemployed numbers are much more disconcerting and you've got to make sure you look at the big picture, not just the unemployed.</p><p>Joining me right now is Mayor Virg Bernero of Lansing, Michigan, Mayor R.T. Rybak of Minneapolis, and Steve Crowley, the host of \"American Scene\" radio program and the financial TV program \"Wall Street Cast.\"</p><p>Good morning, everybody. Good to see you guys.</p><p>STEVE CROWLEY, \"AMERICAN SCENE\" RADIO HOST: Thank you, Alexis. Thanks very much. This is great (ph).</p><p>GLICK: All right, Mayor Bernero, let me start with you. Let me walk through some of the numbers here. The unemployment rate, as you know, in Michigan, the highest in the country, 12.9 percent. I understand you can get a little less than $4 billion in the stimulus. Is it enough to help create and save jobs? What are you doing?</p><p>MAYOR VIRG BERNERO, (D) LANCING, MICHIGAN: Well, look, a lot of it is going into infrastructure. It's going into roads. It's going into retraining of workers. We're trying to get a business incubator up and going to generate new ideas and for business startups.</p><p>But, look, we've talked about this for months. The best stimulus is a stimulating job. People need jobs. They want long-term security. And so the temporary help is great. We appreciate that. But we need to restore health in the economy.</p><p>And, you know, Lansing dodged a bullet. We were very fortunate not to have any plant closures with GM. In fact, our factories may get a little more work. But still, in the long run, we need a healthy auto industry. We need to make sure that we're making the cars of the future in places like Lansing, Michigan.</p><p>And I think the economy, in terms of people starting to buy again, I mean they want that long-term future. And when you talk about retraining, I'm all for the retraining, but I've got e-mails from people all over the country that say, you know, I've been retrained two or three times and the job is eliminated. And so what are we going to retrain them in?</p><p>And you and I have talked about this. We need to have manufacturing. I'm not giving up. I don't think we can be a post manufacturing society. I think we have to find a way that we have manufacturing in this country, advanced manufacturing, and that means leveling the playing field on trade. Until we do that, we're not going to have a permanent recovery.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I mean, Mayor Rybak, I'm concerned about the training efforts too. I mean that's what I keep hearing as one of the cures to solve the problem here. And I'm concerned that it's not really going to truly impact job creation. It's great to learn a lot of other, you know, things to do and skills to have, but at the end of the day, it's not a job.</p><p>MAYOR R.T. RYBAK, (D) MINNEAPOLIS: Well, I totally agree with your point. I will say that in the middle of a recession, education and training is -- if you're ever going to do it, it's a good time to do it.</p><p>But first and foremost, we didn't just wake up to the retraining issue when the economy went south. We've been doing it for a number of years. When I took office, unemployment was 1 percent higher in the city than in the suburbs. Today it's lower in the city than the rest of the region. Very few cities can say that. The reason is because we've been in an ongoing training effort for hard to employ people.</p><p>Now when you hit a period of time like this, it's a big challenge. You have two things. You have, one, the fact that there are a lot of people who are out of work. So, for instance, some of the key construction trades, up to half the people will be sitting on the bench.</p><p>Meanwhile, we know that coming up is going to be a new economy that's going to be based a lot on clean energy, including some of the weatherization work that really takes skilled workers. So we have this tough problem of needing workers in the future, but if you train them for trades where there's high unemployment, you have a problem. I spent all yesterday morning meeting with trades and other folks trying to talk about that tough issue.</p><p>We do, however, have to say, you've got to create a job at the end of it. So we've put a lot of our stimulus dollars into creating those new clean energy jobs. We've put some significant investment into solar, trying to make sure that works. We are training people to do solar installation. We're training them to do green roof installation and are putting incentives in it to create more green roofs.</p><p>Now those are not going to bring back the manufacturing base of America. And I agree with the mayor very much so. I'm not giving up on making things in America.</p><p>I just got back from China. And part of what we need to do as well is to tap into a global economy. We brought a Danish med tech firm into Minneapolis and it's now moved into its headquarters here, 600 new jobs. That's part of it too.</p><p>But you have to home grow the economy. You have to be part of global economy. And you have to have trained workers. There's no one easy fix.</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>Steve, you talk to people every single day . . .</p><p>CROWLEY: We do.</p><p>GLICK: Nationally syndicated radio show. What are people saying to you about the jobs environment?</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, sometimes you can't get a job in your local area. Sometimes people have to move. We talked to one person who was a CPA/MBA, couldn't get a job in south Florida. If they would move to Houston, there's plenty of jobs. There's a shortage of CPA/MBAs. So sometimes you do have to retrain, go back to school. People that learn Chinese right now can get a job, I guarantee you.</p><p>GLICK: So, you know, Steve, you've been doing this for a very long time. Have you ever seen anything like this? </p><p>CROWLEY: No. No one has really seen anything like this. You have to go back to the '30s, you know, to really see something like this. This is an unbelievable time in American history. But I think it's getting a lot better. I think 12 to 18 months from now the market is predicting that the jobs market is going to be better.</p><p>GLICK: You know . . .</p><p>BERNERO: Let me say, Alexis, what's happened is the . . .</p><p>GLICK: Yes, Mayor Bernero, go ahead.</p><p>BERNERO: The chickens have come home to roost on this free trade. We've had unfettered free trade. It's unilateral, economic disarmament. And the last speaker, you know, I appreciate -- I hope he's right that things turn around, but there's a complete disconnect between the stock market, between Wall Street and main street, because most of the production in this country has been shipped overseas. We've taken the P out of GDP, Gross Domestic Product. We've replaced it with a C. We have Gross Domestic Consumption.</p><p>And we have move so much with these unfair trade policies. We've moved so much of our production overseas that what you can see is the stock market can recover, I think, because the production, most of it's overseas. And when you ship it to Malaysia and China and you can pollute the environment and exploit the workers and pay a lot less, I guess Wall Street can make more, but main street is hurting. And I don't see that turning around until we find a way to bring these jobs back to the United States.</p><p>And it's not that these jobs evaporated. That's a myth that these manufacturing jobs just evaporated into the air because of technology. Not at all. We have these jobs here in Lansing. The new factories are wonderful. They are robotic. And we have workers in them.</p><p>But more and more of these high-tech, high-advanced manufacturing jobs are going to places like Mexico and China. And we've got to find a way to reverse that and have fair trade that favors American workers, that allows American workers to compete fairly.</p><p>GLICK: Mayor Rybak, he raise as very important point. Several states are doing what they can to incentivize overseas operations to move here to the United States, or incentivize U.S. companies who garner the lions share of their revenues from international operations to stay in the United States. But does that then raise a question of protectionism?</p><p>RYBAK: Well, I don't think the issue is protectionism as much as trying to home grow an economy. I mean, look, there are ways to ship jobs from overseas. But the thing Americans have always done is they've created the job in the first place. We're an incubator of innovation. And if we continue to incubate, then we can have not only the ideas, but the manufacturing here.</p><p>Now an example is, we're putting some of our stimulus dollars into helping a company called Ken Kay Solar (ph). It's a new approach to doing solar that will hopefully make it cheaper to put it into homes. So that's a brain power idea. But we need to also make sure that the person power that's making it is done here as well.</p><p>I think there's a really important moment when American ingenuity then creates a product. We do that well and will continue to do that well. The point is, is once that product is ready to be made, that we have to make it here at home.</p><p>I think the mayor made a good point in this whole issue of the unfair competition of labor costs. As I say, I was in China. They're doing some wonderful things. But I sure as heck don't want my cousin or my constituent getting some of the wages that are being paid over there.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, right.</p><p>RYBAK: So I think we need to certainly level the playing field, but also recognize, hey, look, this is America. We're not on our knees. We know what we're doing. And we've done great things. And we're going to do them again. Let's just get back to the basics of invention, incubation and manufacturing. We can do this.</p><p>GLICK: You know, we heard yesterday some bright spots. We heard about Wal- Mart hiring 22,000 people.</p><p>CROWLEY: That's right.</p><p>GLICK: We've heard a couple of other companies start to say that they're beginning to hire again. That they're beginning to spend again. You and I yesterday talked about, you know, the ordering of jets and things of that nature.</p><p>CROWLEY: Right.</p><p>GLICK: Are we starting to see those signs of life? Are they starting to suggest perhaps a bottom? </p><p>CROWLEY: I think it will all start with a good glimmer of hope, don't you? But I -- you know, I really believe the small businesses, the nation's job maker, net/net, Alexis, all new jobs are created by small business. Apple Computer and Microsoft started as small businesses and now employ a lot of people.</p><p>But a lot of companies that employ fewer than 50 people are now starting to see the light. We're getting reports back that the CEOs of these smaller companies are saying, yes, business is picking up. We're starting to bring in our old employees that we let go. And people who we cut down to 20, 30 hours a week, we're bringing back to 40 hours a week.</p><p>So I think that's where the new jobs are going to be created. And even like cities like Lansing, which is a small business community too, I think that's where the real job generation is going to happen.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, you know, Mayor Bernero, I'm going to talk to the labor secretary coming up in the next hour and the thing that worries me is that the small business community, as Steve points out, which is something I talked in one of my talking points, is essential for private sector jobs. And what we saw in the last report is private sector jobs got hit so tremendously. Are we doing enough to help small businesses?</p><p>BERNERO: Look, look, number one, I mean, I just want to say, with all due respect, you know, you help prove my point with the Wal-Mart. I mean GM lays off 20,000 high-paying, top of the line, top of the food chain manufacturing jobs. Twenty thousand. Wal-Mart's hiring 20,000.</p><p>It's the Wal-Martization of our economy and that's part of what's killing us. I mean that's great that Wal-Mart's hiring, that will give some hope, but you're taking basically $26, $28 an hour jobs and going down to I don't know what Wal-Mart pays, you know, $10 maybe if you're lucky. So this is part of the problem. </p><p>Now as far as small business goes, one problem is the banking. We've helped banks at the top. OK. And, look, I'm not bashing Obama here. I mean the guy has inherited a mess and he's doing an admirable job with it.</p><p>But we've helped banks at the top. It hasn't trickled down to the community banks. The community banks, Steve's right, the small businesses where the growth is, we all know that, there can't be any growth because nobody can get a loan. The community banks have been shut out. While the banks in Wall Street are getting help, the community banks, you know what they're getting? More regulation from FDIC. They're getting tighter regulations, tighter standards. They're not getting any help. And the community banks weren't even part of the problem.</p><p>So this has got to be addressed by the administration. The community banks are being strangle held and they're the ones that are -- that know the people, that know the communities and know where the money should be given. And they didn't do anything wrong. They weren't involved in all the chicanery that Wall Street was, but they're getting punished by the FDIC. So this insanity has got to stop. We need our community banks help.</p><p>But the other thing, I want to just tell you, the small businesses are hurting. I've got e-mails and I've got people in my community, the small - - I can show you letters from union presidents and company presidents, small business presidents, that sound just the same. Main street America is hurting. Because when you wipe out manufacturing, you wipe out a lot of the small businesses. When I hear people say we're a service economy, what are we going to service? These small businesses are hurting because as so much manufacturing has left, the small businesses -- of course we're in Michigan. I mean a lot of our small businesses were auto related, tool and dye and this sort of thing.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>BERNERO: They're hurting. And I think this is true all across the country, though. You've had furniture makers and all sorts of small businesses that are struggling to survive. Again, I hate to sound like a one-note Nelly (ph), but with that foreign competition.</p><p>GLICK: You are incredible.</p><p>Mayor Rybak, I just have to ask you the last question. Are you going to run for governor?</p><p>RYBAK: Oh, I -- we'll figure that out tomorrow. But I want to say that going back to the point of . . .</p><p>GLICK: Oh, we'll figure it out tomorrow. You're -- the governor of your state is saying that he's going to run -- he's going to go for the White House.</p><p>RYBAK: Well, he's going to get his butt kicked by Barack Obama, but that's another thing.</p><p>The point of the matter is . . .</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>RYBAK: I want to talk about jobs here.</p><p>The point of the matter is, I absolutely strongly agree with the point that was just being made about make things in America. I do want to say, though, that when you hear that a retail company is adding jobs, we don't just want people behind the cash register, but speaking from the headquarters of Target and Best Buy here in Minneapolis, some phenomenal jobs are in that sector.</p><p>But the other thing that happens in the economy in a period of time like this is that as people go into transition, as sadly people leave a job and try to figure out what to do next, you do have innovation. And I think that's one of the things we've got to work with, with the lending community, and that is where sometimes the public sector needs to spur innovation. Someone leaves a company. They get fired. They get laid off. They start to think about it. They talk with their friend about what they've always wanted to do. This is when the new American jobs get created.</p><p>Now we can't be in la-la land about this. They've got to make things too. But I think innovation will help us at this point.</p><p>GLICK: All right, sounds like the role of governor looks appealing.</p><p>All right, Mayor Rybak, thank you so much. Mayor Bernero, and Steve, gentlemen, thank you very much.</p><p>All right, guys, we're going to take a quick break. We've got the jobs data coming out in just about 12 minutes. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Checking financial news now.</p><p>The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in its boardroom. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be bounced out. \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S. Bancorp CEO Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job. The feds, of course, own 34 percent of Citigroup.</p><p>And the FDIC putting its program to rid the nation's banks of toxic assets on hold. The legacy loans program was supposed to begin with a trial sale this month. The FDIC says banks have proven they can raise private capital without cleansing their balance sheets. Therefore, the FDIC says the program could come back later on in different form.</p><p>And the FDIC is very busy today. Also shutting down Silverton Bank. The troubled bank did attract interest from private equity folks, but the FDIC said it had to do what was cheapest for the insurance fund and ultimately shutting it down was cheaper. Silverton was not a retail bank. Most of its customers were actually other banks.</p><p>All right. Let's go over to Charles Payne and take a look at the Fox 50.</p><p>Charles.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, thanks a lot, Alexis.</p><p>Well, as you said, Citigroup, Apple, and Intel, they're all Fox 50 stocks and they're all making news this morning. Former Barclay's (ph) capital investment manager and financial analyst Vn Man (ph), he joins us now to break them all down.</p><p>And let's talk about this Citi thing because I don't think it's news that a lot of people want to see Vikram Pandit go. The bigger story here seems to be Sheila Bair versus Timothy Geithner and the FDIC not only saying we want to be in this game, we actually want more power.</p><p>VN MAN, FMR. BARCLAY'S CAPITAL INVESTMENT MANAGER: Yes, absolutely. I mean the -- what's going on here is the FDIC is essentially trying to get more power than the comptroller. But, you know, not since the days of Howard Stern fighting the FCC have we seen government versus the private sector. I mean this is really turning into a soap opera.</p><p>On one hand you've got Sheila Bair and she interrupted kind of Citigroup's ideas in the past. I don't know if you recall when she actually -- when Citigroup was trying to buy Wachovia and then Wells Fargo swept in there and bought Wachovia instead. And Sheila Bair backed Wells Fargo. And so, you know, there's kind of this struggle between . . .</p><p>PAYNE: There's definitely a power struggle going on there.</p><p>Let's talk about Apple here.</p><p>MAN: OK.</p><p>PAYNE: Big, big news. Obviously tomorrow the Pre comes out. But the bigger news for folks on the Apple stock is that <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is coming back. And it always feels like Caesar returning to Rome. So much excitement. The stock is indicating it will open higher here. What do you think is going to happen?</p><p>MANN: You know, everybody -- me included -- everybody wants to know they work for the best and the brightest. And <person><nameText>Steve Jobs, </nameText></person>he's not just a maverick. You know, he's a hero to the people he works for and a hero to the investors. So people want to know that he's coming back.</p><p>But what's interesting is, over the last five months, since he left in January, the stock has appreciated over 68 percent. So the market believes that Apple can continue to be successful, even without <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>there on a daily basis.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. And we do have the bid ask. It's up. Indicating up almost 3 points here at the open.</p><p>Having said that and the fact that you pointed out it's already up, as an investor, if an investor came to you this morning and said, should I buy this stock, what would you tell them?</p><p>MAN: You know, I love this stock. I mean I actually have my own iPhone. I'm a huge fan of the iPhone. And the new one is coming out supposedly. That's what we're hearing rumors is that it's going to come out at the worldwide development conference.</p><p>PAYNE: Let's talk about another big tech name.</p><p>MAN: Yes. Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Intel made a rare acquisition yesterday. A company called Wind River Systems. What does that tell you that Intel is starting to make some of these acquisitions?</p><p>MAN: You know, Intel has -- obviously they control the PC market, the server market in terms of their chips.</p><p>PAYNE: But it's sort of like a one trick pony.</p><p>MAN: Well, what this is doing, it's giving them access to customers. I mean who are the customers of Wind River? The customers are Apple. The customers are Sony, Panasonic. And this gives them access to those customers. So I think it's a good move.</p><p>PAYNE: Quickly before I take it back to Alexis. The stock closed at $11.70. The bid is $11.50. Does that tell you there could be another bid coming for this company?</p><p>MAN: Yes. I mean if they're making an offer of $11.50 and already, you know, since Wednesday you see it's trading up to $11.70 that means there's potentially somebody else or the market thinks that somebody else is going to step in there and offer something -- you know, a higher number.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot. We really appreciate it. That's fantastic.</p><p>MAN: Thank you. Thanks.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, Alexis, back over to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Charles, thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up, Chrysler is back in court today. Adam Shapiro is there live with the very latest.</p><p>And we are just minutes away from the May employment number. We're going to have that for you as it happens and a full break down. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: We've got some breaking auto news now. Dow Jones Newswire is reporting there will be no Opel launch in the United States due to a future Magna deal.</p><p>Chrysler heads backed to court today where the judge will hear from a group trying to block its deal with Fiat. Our own Fox Business' Adam Shapiro is live outside the courthouse with the details on both of these developments.</p><p>Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the latest, let's start with Opel real quick. There are Opels in the United States now. They actually build cars for Saturn and the Saturn Astra is one of them. With the news that Saturn may be sold to Penske Auto Group out of Detroit, you might still have some kind of contractual agreement where Opel would manufacture cars and be sold under the Saturn brand. So to say Opel won't be launched in the U.S. is accurate, but you can still get an Opel, it would just have a different name.</p><p>Now to Chrysler.</p><p>The appellate court, the three judge panel, will hear arguments starting at 2:00 as to why the deal with Fiat should be delayed. Keep in mind, it was Chrysler which asked for this emergency hearing. They're trying to get the panel to certify the sale so the deal can close before July 15th. But the Indiana state treasurer, along with 12 other parties, are trying to stop the deal and they've also petitioned to get the stay in place which now exists. They say, this is the exact quote, \"that the Indiana retirees and Indiana taxpayers have suffered losses because of unprecedented and illegal acts of the federal government.\"</p><p>Sources close to all of this say they expect a decision from the three- panel judges by late tonight, possibly early Saturday morning. So everybody will be watching to see if Chrysler and Fiat get the go ahead to close their deal or if it will be delayed. And if it's delayed past that July 15th date where they say they have to close, Fiat has the option to walk. And if they do walk, Chrysler has to come up with $35 million as a penalty for not closing many time.</p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: OK. Before I let you go, Adam, just to confirm here, the deadline is June 15th, right, not July 15th.</p><p>SHAPIRO: June 15th, not July. June 15th. I miss spoke. June 15th.</p><p>GLICK: OK, good. I just wanted to confirm. I want to confirm that.</p><p>The other thing here is, is if, in fact, Fiat were to walk, what happens with the role of the Treasury and the U.S. government in backstopping this debtor in possession financing?</p><p>SHAPIRO: That's a very good question. We'll try and get that one answered. But most people are not even addressing it. They expect it to close. But it would throw the entire deal with Chrysler up in the air because the U.S. government has said, without Fiat, there is no future for Chrysler.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Adam Shapiro, we will continue to keep a close eye on these developments throughout the morning. Thank you very much, Adam.</p><p>Well, we are just about a minute away from the jobs data. I want to bring up the futures right now as we take a look at this here. Expectations right now for unemployment to rise to 9.2 percent. It was 8.9 percent in April. Expectations are also for 520,000 job losses. We did lose 539,000 jobs last month.</p><p>Now keep in mind, though, we have seen upward revisions time and time again. And those jobs numbers, January, February, March, were well north of 600. In fact, back in January, 740,000 job losses. At this point, if we lose about 500,000, we will have lost 6.2 million job since the start of the recession according to the NABE. That was December of 2007.</p><p>As you can see, the futures are in the green. So we're looking up to be in positive territory here. But if we get something in the 500s, low 500s, the anticipation is that the market will rally on the news that perhaps job losses are beginning to subside.</p><p>Let's go to Rich Edson. He is at the Labor Department with the number.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: 345,000 jobs lost. 345,000 jobs lost. We've got an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent. That's the highest since 1983. There are 14.5 unemployed people in this country. That is the highest ever.</p><p>Again, 345,000 jobs lost last month. We had 539,000 jobs lost initially last month, April, excuse me. That number is now 504,000. In March, the initial number, 699,000 jobs lost. That is now 652,000 jobs lost.</p><p>Since the recession began in December of 2007, the unemployment rate has increased 4.5 percent and six million jobs have been lost.</p><p>Let's take a look at the private sector -- 338,000 jobs lost. Government fell 7,000 jobs. The federal government dropped 15,000 jobs.</p><p>Leisure and hospitality, get this, up 3,000 jobs. That's the first increase since December of 2007 when the recession began. Eight thousands of those jobs are food and drinking services.</p><p>Education and health services up 44,000 jobs. And credit intermediation, if you are looking for those refinance jobs, down 6,000. Those are people who do refis if you are looking for an indication of that.</p><p>Let's take a look at construction jobs, a little bit better than had been. Manufacturing jobs, 156,000. Let's start with that, 156,000 jobs lost for manufacturing. Motor vehicles and parts down 30,000.</p><p>And since December of 2007, there have been 1.8 million jobs lost because of manufacturing. That accounts for three-tenths of all jobs lost since there. Construction employment down 59,000. And believe it or not, that's about half the average of the previous six months.</p><p>Household wages averaging $18.54. That is up .1 percent, year over year up 3.1 percent.</p><p>Also, government was up 92,000 last month. It was originally thought to be up 72,000 -- excuse me, that's for the month of April. The month of April up 92,000, originally thought to be 72,000.</p><p>Alexis, we'll leave it there. Back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right. So, before I let you go, Rich, just to review this here right now, the 14.5 million people that are unemployed is the highest on which record? From what date?</p><p>EDSON: That was when record keeping began back in 1948. So it's the highest ever taken when they started all the way back in 1948.</p><p>GLICK: All right, terrific. And just before I let you go, any revisions? No revisions to unemployment rate, revisions downward for April and March in terms of non-farm payrolls?</p><p>EDSON: That's right. We lost fewer jobs in April and March. Originally, it was thought in April that we'd lost 539,000 jobs. That's now been revised to 504,000 jobs, so a difference of 35,000 jobs on the good side.</p><p>March, originally thought to be nearly 700,000, 699,000, we are now at 652,000 for the month of March. That is a change to the good side of 47,000.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Rich Edison, what a surprise. Thank you very much.</p><p>Let's break down the numbers.</p><p>Democratic Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is with us; Roger Ballou, the president and CEO of the professional service company CDI; and John Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Investor Services.</p><p>Gentlemen, I'm in a little bit of shock, a little surprised.</p><p>John, let me start with you. You're my resident economist here.</p><p>Why would the unemployment rate tick up from 8.9 percent to 9.4 percent and yet in non-farm payrolls we lost a little less than 350,000?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES: Well, you know, we first have to consider that these job estimates are taken from two separate different surveys. The unemployment rate is taken from a household survey. The count of jobs, number of jobs is taken from a survey of employers.</p><p>That being said, you know, one of the defining characteristics of this recession has been the record length of unemployment. So while fewer people are losing their jobs -- and we pick that up from the recent decline if first time jobless claims -- we still find that the number of people that are out of work or collecting state unemployment benefits continues to grow. This is a recession where it was very damaging to have lost your job because of the unusually long period of time it's taken to secure new employment if you are that lucky.</p><p>GLICK: All right. </p><p>Let me go to Congressman Sestak.</p><p>Are you surprised by the numbers?</p><p>REP. JOE SESTAK (D), PENNSYLVANIA: Actually, I am. I had expected them to be in the low 500,000s. In fact, when we ran the models several months ago, if we had gotten to the low 500,000s or just below it by July, we would have assumed everything was going according to script -- still intense, but not intensifying. What this data shows is that as compared to past recessions, employers laid off employees much more rapidly when you look at the data, which means that this stopping of the cratering of our economy may come to a halt a bit more rapidly.</p><p>I had expected unemployment to be about 9.2 percent. And he is right, overall, people who don't have any jobs and aren't seeking is about 16 percent. But think about what else is now happening.</p><p>The yields in the financial market have really come down. We also see that the housing market is beginning to see the bottom of housing prices falling. We also are seeing here that consumer spending is actually beginning to increase as the rebates come back.</p><p>In fact, if you compare May of this year, when our rebates came out from the stimulus bill, to a year ago, it's hard to compare, because remember, Alexis, a year ago in May, we also had a stimulus bill. But when you see the two, comparison, it appears as though consumer confidence is beginning to come back. We'll get to about 10 percent unemployment by the end of the year, but I don't think we're going to go above it, and then we're out of here, as Mr. Bernanke pointed out recently, and our economy begins to go again.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Roger, you are an outsourcing firm. You deal with part- time and full-time workforce. Have you been seeing improving trends, or is this data a surprise to you?</p><p>ROGER BALLOU, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CDI: Actually, this data is confirmatory of what we have been seeing throughout our business, our MRINetwork offices across he country and our CDI professional staffing organizations, where, if you look at it, there have been a lot of bright areas in the economy in spite of the losses of jobs.</p><p>For example, rural economies have continued to perform better than urban economies, where they are driven by more commodities, agriculture, things like that. Secondly, the service sector, if you look at health care, has actually been experiencing growth through this.</p><p>We saw what appeared to be the beginning of the end of the recession at the end of the first quarter in our numbers. We saw it confirmed in April. We see it confirmed again here in May.</p><p>So what we're seeing in this national data is confirmation of what our MRINetwork offices and our professional organizations that we serve have been seeing over the last two or three months. So the actual exact number I couldn't have predicted, but we did predict that it was beginning of the end of the recession occurring in this last part of the first quarter, first part of the second quarter.</p><p>GLICK: Gentlemen, I want to bring up for just a moment what the market is doing in reaction to this, because the market is reacting pretty favorably -- that would be putting it lightly -- to this news.</p><p>The market was up about 40 beforehand. The Dow now up 135 points. So we're up 1.5 percent. The S&amp;P right now is up 1.7 percent and Nasdaq up a percent. So we've rallied a full one percent in reaction to this.</p><p>Two points.</p><p>Congressman Sestak, let me first start with you on the president's fiscal stimulus package. He has tried to demonstrate in several speeches recently that the fiscal stimulus is starting to work its way into the economy. Money is being spent. I think he recently said about 100,000 jobs have been saved or created.</p><p>Is this proof in the pudding that in fact it is starting to work, and it was the necessary fuel that we needed to get everybody off the sidelines?</p><p>SESTAK: Yes, I believe it was one of the necessary tools. We also have to give a lot of credit to the TARP program and the TALF program, the second one, as you well know, to the Federal Reserve, because they have gotten the mother milk of our economy, credit, flowing again. And so there's a lot more confidence in the markets also.</p><p>But without a doubt, this economic stimulus bill intended to get money out there so people would spend it. A lot of it on retailing has started to work. Now what you are going to see is later this year, the construction money -- only about six percent of it has been spent thus far -- is really going to kick in just as the recession seems to be coming to a halt and is ready to come up. I think it's been well played.</p><p>GLICK: You know, John, it's interesting. I was speaking to Jim Rohr, the chairman and CEO of PNC, and the other day he said, \"Alexis, one of the greatest stimulus in this economy has been what the Fed has done because those who have been able to refinance on average has saved about $300 on monthly payments.\"</p><p>I wonder, is that stimulus generated by refi activity enough to offset the fact that as we sit here right now, oil is breaking above $70 a barrel, it's at a seven-month high, and so what was perceived as a tax credit because of declining gasoline and oil prices is now going to be a tax on consumers?</p><p>LONSKI: You know, we have to keep our eye on energy prices, but I believe that when consumers look at energy prices, they take a longer-term view. And they didn't believe that oil was going to stay at $40 to $50 per gallon.</p><p>Consumer spending proceeds on the assumption the price of crude oil will be in a range of $60 to $70 per barrel. So we are hitting the upper end of this range beyond which consumer spending might indeed suffer. And so it would behoove the administration to take any action necessary to prevent a replay of what happened in the first half of 2008, when the price of crude oil soared up to nearly $150 per barrel. If that happens again, then the wait for the next economic recovery will be longer than we currently anticipate.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>I mean, Roger, there's a lot of confluences of events right now that are beginning to signal that perhaps the global economy is starting to heal. The concern is -- and John brings up some great points -- is that inflation, things of that nature become a bigger concern and act as a tax on consumers or cause interest rates to rise.</p><p>What impact, if any, will all this have on the corporations that you talk to on a daily basis who are looking to slowly but surely begin to bring new employees into the fold?</p><p>BALLOU: Well, I think two things.</p><p>Congressman Sestak commented earlier that -- I think what you saw this time is a steeper quicker reduction in employment and inventories than we have ever seen before. I think that the information systems companies now used to control their inventories and their production capacity led them to react much, much more quickly. What I think that's going to lead to is a slower sustained recovery coming out of this, so it's going to be like a reverse hockey stick, where you saw a quicker downtick, but a gradual uptick that will come. </p><p>I also agree that I think the financial programs are the key driver of the uptick here. I don't think that much of the stimulus has kicked in yet, so I suspect that the bigger stimulus effect here has been the credit markets opening up, and that leading to enhanced consumer confidence and business confidence.</p><p>The other thing that's gone on is the global economy, where you see the Indian economy continuing to grow very, very strongly. You see the Chinese economy in resurgence based on their stimulus programs. So I think those things are contributing significantly to the uptick as well.</p><p>So, it is an interconnected global economy. In our case, I think the financial programs have been very, very critical to it. I also think the president himself has been instilling confidence through his communication, through his demeanor, through the programs that he's launched. And this is a very -- you know, people's psyches are fragile, but they also can move in a positive direction, very, very quickly, and I think you are beginning to see that occurring.</p><p>GLICK: Congressman Sestak, I'm going to give you the last word.</p><p>One of the things about the data shows that number of hours worked have dropped. Productivity, as we just saw yesterday, is rising.</p><p>One material concern out there is that we will see declining wages, that we've seen declining wages, but that it will be a bigger issue that the consumer will still remain fairly tapped out. And because we've figured out how to accomplish more with less workers, that some of those jobs may not come back.</p><p>How important is it to find those future jobs that will perhaps replace a lot of the millions of jobs of the six million that we have seen since the recession began?</p><p>SESTAK: This is an excellent point you make.</p><p>We have lost about a trillion dollars in our GDP as compared to our 2007 GDP high peak. And if we just have an economy, as was just mentioned, that grows slowly, and let's just say it grows at 2.5 percent, which was the average between 2001 and 2007, it will take us three years to soak up that $1 trillion of lost GDP capacity. Which means if we don't grow more rapidly, we won't be creating these jobs that you spoke about.</p><p>That's why the president's budget is absolutely critical. If he is -- and I believe he is -- intent upon in succeeding in retooling the economy in the types of jobs, the green energy jobs, the ability to reform our health care system, those parts of this budget will be absolutely critical.</p><p>Second, I go back that we have to do more in the entrepreneur incentives by the right tax incentives to get that extra bump to our economy above 2.5 percent growth in the next few years to come, or we won't create those jobs.</p><p>GLICK: Right. Good point.</p><p>SESTAK: Because China is growing this year 6.8 percent as we lose about five or six percent. So that's why this is important, your point.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys. We are going to leave it there. Terrific, terrific discussion.</p><p>I'm glad to see we've seen some relief in the numbers, but remember still a lot of people unemployed in this economy.</p><p>Congressman Sestak, Roger and John, thank you so much, gentlemen.</p><p>SESTAK: Thank you for having me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: A reminder, by the way please join me, 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time. I will be speaking to the labor secretary, Hilda Solis, in a \"First on Fox\" interview here to break down this May employment number. So please tune in for that. We'll get an opportunity to get her thoughts in just about 45 minutes.</p><p>All right. Coming up, more jobs lost. We're talking to students just entering the working world about their hunt for employment.</p><p>And of course we will head live to the New York Stock Exchange for a little bit of a preview on what is now a market that's looking pretty good.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: All week we have been taking a look at the nation's growing deficit as a result of government spending as something we called red ink. Now, MONEY FOR BREAKFAST teamed up with the college news service U-Wire to take a closer look at Generation Debt, the students of America who will inherit the current deficit</p><p>Some of those students told us the financial worries that are keeping them -- frankly, they're keeping them up at night. Take a listen to what they had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My biggest financial concern is just to find a job after I graduate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm more worried about people my parents' age who have just seen their retirement funds completely be gone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My parents' businesses since December, like, their sales have been halved. And that kind of really affects me because I'm in school now. I can't help them out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My personal biggest financial concern is just being able to live the life that we're expected to live as -- you know, again since I came from a background where my parents didn't necessarily have a lot of money, I think there was a big expectation for me coming to college and getting the job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: Well, as you heard, some of the students we spoke to say finding a job is their top worry. With roughly 1.5 million graduating seniors entering the workforce this year and a loss of another 500,000 -- well, now actually we have seen 350,000 jobs in May, according to the most recent survey -- what will they do? And is now the time to figure out other options?</p><p>Joining us right now, Emily Sutherland, who is heading into her senior year at Colorado State; Leah Finnegan, who graduated from the University of Texas this year; and Dean Van Tassell, who received his MBA from Pace University just two weeks ago.</p><p>Good morning, guys. Good to see you.</p><p>LEAH FINNEGAN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS GRADUATE: Good morning.</p><p>DEAN VAN TASSELL, RECEIVED MBA FROM PACE UNIVERSITY: Good morning.</p><p>EMILY SUTHERLAND, HEADING INTO SENIOR YEAR AT COLORADO STATE: Good morning.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Dean. Let me talk to you.</p><p>You just graduated two weeks ago from Pace University. You have been on the job hunt. What have you been experiencing?</p><p>VAN TASSELL: Well, first of all, thank you for having me on the program. And BB&amp;T Capital Markets loves Fox Business.</p><p>GLICK: Oh, that's good to know. Thanks.</p><p>VAN TASSELL: I have been applying to, let's see now, about 70 different investment banks, writing the HR departments, following with managing directors, trying to get my name out there as much as possible. I have a nice stack of rejection letters right now, so it's rough out there.</p><p>You know, you have to start making contingency plans. And it's -- you know, we're up to 9.4 percent. The only solace I have is that maybe the 9.4 percent unemployment is backwards looking, and the market seems to be shrugging it off today. So hopefully we will have second derivative fever and things will start to level out and pick up relatively soon.</p><p>GLICK: Leah, you just graduated from the University of Texas. You have a BA in American studies.</p><p>What kind of jobs have you been looking for?</p><p>FINNEGAN: I'm actually going into journalism, which is, you know, quite an experience at this time. And I applied to about 20 jobs, and I heard \"No\" from about five. And then I just didn't hear from the rest of them. So it's kind of like applying to a black hole.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, radio silence. </p><p>So what did you decide to do when you just weren't getting back any responses or you were just getting rejection notes without even, as I understand, getting an opportunity to even interview?</p><p>FINNEGAN: Well, my contingency plan was grad school, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go, and kind of applied on the lark and ended up getting into grad school and not getting into any jobs. So grad school it is.</p><p>GLICK: So you're going to Columbia?</p><p>FINNEGAN: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: My alma mater.</p><p>FINNEGAN: Oh, OK.</p><p>GLICK: Very excited. OK.</p><p>Now Emily, let me talk to you. I understand you are majoring in communications. You are going to be a senior this year at Colorado State.</p><p>When you listen to what's happening to Dean and Leah and I'm sure a lot of your other classmates, how is that impacting you? How nervous does it make you knowing that you are going into your senior year of college?</p><p>SUTHERLAND: Well, it makes me really nervous, of course. A lot of my friends have graduated. A lot of them have resulted in working at Starbucks and their degree has gotten them absolutely nowhere. So I just hope that things pick up so I actually do have job opportunities out there once I graduate.</p><p>GLICK: Dean, you smiled there. I mean, how many of your friends and colleagues have had to do that? Like, you might have had aspirations of working on Wall Street or working in a particular sector, but there's no opportunities and you have to get what you can get.</p><p>VAN TASSELL: I know a lot of people who would be lucky to get a job at Starbucks. It's hard.</p><p>I will probably have to go back to bartending for a little bit, but it seem just as competitive as Wall Street, if not more. You have a lot of people laid off and in the same position I'm in, so a lot of people just don't have any options, even contingency plans.</p><p>The number one thing I hear is there's a lot of government jobs out there, but the mentality of, I want to work on Wall Street, I'm very aggressive, I want to be in the financial markets than going into a government job, it's a bit different from what you have expected might be around after you graduate. So...</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>And Leah, how many other classmates of yours have said they are going to choose to continue to go back to school because that's really the only and best option?</p><p>FINNEGAN: A really good number. It is a very popular option right now. And I don't know, I'm kind of finding the whole experience a bit freeing, and I think a lot of people my peers are as well, that now we have this time right now to kind of relax and discover what we really want to do.</p><p>GLICK: Good point.</p><p>FINNEGAN: and then we have the rest of our lives to do it. So there's not so much pressure to be successful and make more than $100,000 right out of college.</p><p>GLICK: Great point.</p><p>I wish you all the best success. Leah, Dean and Emily, thank you guys so much.</p><p>VAN TASSELL: Thank you.</p><p>FINNEGAN: Thank you.</p><p>SUTHERLAND: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys. We're going to take a break. We will be right back with \"THE OPENING BELL\" in just a moment. We're just about five minutes away.</p><p>All right. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: All right. Welcome back. It's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>Connell, you were watching actually the bond market reaction to the jobs data. What did you see happen?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, a big move up in yields, which is really going to be the story that we're going to have to follow very, very closely, Alexis, when you think about it.</p><p>And Charles, you and I talked about this, the idea that hey, maybe the economy has bottomed out and things are starting to look better, but what about rising yields, rising mortgage rates, and other things? And does that cut off the recovery?</p><p>GLICK: It could be a tough bear market for the bonds.</p><p>PAYNE: Absolutely. And also, I was looking at equities. I thought the Dow and this type of number would be up 200, 300 points. I'm serious. I think we have a conflict here with the unemployment number being 9.4.</p><p>GLICK: I agree.</p><p>PAYNE: Two separate surveys -- the Household Survey saying, listen, it's tough, it's tougher than the way the businesses maybe are looking at it.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. You've got to wonder why the divergence.</p><p>And speaking of which, actually, I'm going to talk to Labor Secretary Hilda Solis coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time. So tune in. She will he' be joining us \"First on Fox.\"</p><p>All right, guys. We'll be right back.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Journal reporting Sheila Bair and the FDIC want a change and it could include CEO Vikram Pandit. Who might be tapped to replace him? And what do the people at Citigroup think?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the SEC charges Mozilo federal regulators charge Countrywide cofounder <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>with insider trading and securities fraud. What will happen to him next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're serving these stories and much more this morning on MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>Good morning and happy Friday. Welcome to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>Coming up this morning, much more on the latest on GM Saturn sale and that possible shakeup at Citigroup.</p><p>Plus the smart phone war is heating up as Palm gets ready to release its new device; it's called the Pre. And it goes public later today. We'll get a preview of that phone.</p><p>And all this as reports that <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is ready to return to the helm after a six-month medical hiatus. Could Apple be making a big announcement as early as next week?</p><p>Plus, the May unemployment numbers are due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. All eyes are on this number. Expectations are for a loss of another 520,000 jobs; unemployment to reach 9.2 percent. We'll see in just moments.</p><p>Roger Ballou, CDI Core President and CEO and Representative Joe Sestak from Pennsylvania are both going to join me to break down those numbers when they come out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>We'll also have a terrific roundtable discussion on where the jobs are being created in the state and local municipalities. Is the fiscal stimulus package actually helping create enough jobs?</p><p>Let's take a look at the futures right now as we get started. As you can see across the board we're in the green; right now the DOW up 36; S&amp;P up four; NASDAQ up three. So across the board we're up just fractionally.</p><p>Let's get directly to the markets. Fox Business contributor Gavin Gray is in for Mr. Ashley Webster in London. And Connell McShane is here with us right now. Let's get started with Connell here in New York -- Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning Alexis. Yes we're certainly watching those markets closely, you showed us the futures moving a little bit higher indicating we might get a higher open at the final trading day of the week.</p><p>But all of that can change of course; 8:30 a.m. Eastern time will be the big number on jobs. Now, speaking of jobs in a different -- speaking of it in a different way, <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is making big news at Apple.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning reporting he is on pace to take back the CEO position to come back on to the job as planned and with that said, from medical leave, the stock is getting a nice boost this morning.</p><p>All of that kind of plays into what Alexis was talking about a little while ago, the back and forth between Apple and Palm; Palm coming out over the weekend with its Pre. Not only might jobs come back as planned here but the idea is maybe he comes back a little earlier than planned.</p><p>There's a big developer's conference next week and the thinking is maybe Jobs comes back for that, announces a new iPhone. We'll see that getting a little bit ahead of ourselves but the \"Journal\" starting that speculation this morning.</p><p>Investors seem to like it. The Apple stock price as you see there up to 147 in change pre-market trading.</p><p>Ok, let's see what the European markets are up to this morning as we do now head over to Gavin Gray in London -- Gavin.</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Connell thanks very much indeed. Let's first of all have a look at the markets over here; all really waiting on particularly in Europe and Britain waiting really for the results of the cabinet reshuffle.</p><p>But let's kick off in London with the FTSE. That is currently up 67 points leading the way at 4,454; the CAC-40 now gaining of a bit of strength as well, up 28 points. And the DAX really hasn't moved much all morning. Just up 21 points or 0.4 of a percent.</p><p>As really as I said, eyes looking at Downing Street, waiting for this Cabinet reshuffle. We haven't had it confirmed yet but we do believe that the Alistair Darling who is the current Chancellor -- the moneyman is going to keep his position. It's rumored he told Gordon Brown I either have this job or I don't have a job in your cabinet. We do think that he is going to remain as Chancellor. One or two other movements, we believe a fourth Minister has resigned. That is the fourth in just four days.</p><p>And also a report that U.K. inflation continues to fall. A sign about that the Office of National Statistics says the price of manufactured goods has come down just 0.3 percent year on year, largely because of the oil price coming down in that last year, but of course oil is coming back up. But that is the biggest annual decline since June 2002.</p><p>Alexis back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Gavin thank you very much.</p><p>Well, auto news now. It is a hot topic.</p><p>Breaking news this morning the \"Wall Street Journal\" says auto dealer Roger Penske will reportedly buy the Saturn brand from General Motors. Sources say, Penske would buy vehicles from GM and Renault then sell them under the Saturn brand. No word yet on how much Penske is paying. An official announcement is to be made later today.</p><p>And the deal to sell Hummer to a Chinese company may have hit a bump in the road. Some experts say regulators in Beijing may block it because the Hummer brand goes against China's focus on fuel efficient vehicles.</p><p>And GM will finance a huge part of a private equity firm's buyout of parts maker Delphi. GM will provide $2.5 billion of the $3.6 billion -- that specific $3.6 billion price tag. In return GM buys back four Delphi plants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL PACINO, ACTOR: Something really wrong is going on here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are out of order.</p><p>PACINO: You're out of order, you're out of order. The whole trial is out of order. They are out of order.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: And there you have it. That was Al Pacino. I'm not sure if you remember in the courtroom black comedy \"And Justice For All\" which details chaos in the court system. And some think that's precisely what's going on today with the Chrysler bankruptcy hearing.</p><p>A judge in New York will hear arguments from a group trying to block the deal with Fiat. Opponents include a group of Indiana state pension funds and a dozen other parties.</p><p>Speaking of which, for more on what we can expect today, let's go directly down to lower Manhattan to our own Adam Shapiro who is standing outside the U.S. Court of Appeals.</p><p>And Adam I'm not sure it's quite Al Pacino style but it seems like it's getting pretty close.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it could be close, but the Indiana - - the lawyers for the Indiana State Treasurer Richard Murdock are going to be arguing on behalf of 100,000 Indiana pensioners, police officers as well as teachers that the sale to Fiat violates all kinds of bankruptcy law as well as the TARP law -- the law which created the Trouble Asset Relief Program. That's the argument they're going to make in court.</p><p>First, that senior secured lenders like the pensioners are being given a secondary position in this bankruptcy which is counter to Bankruptcy Law. Second, that the TARP was originally created to help financial institutions not automobile companies and that's a violation of the Troubled Asset Relief Program that was set up last year.</p><p>And that third, this is just a deal that is not good for the U.S. taxpayers. That's the argument they're going to make in court. And that argument lost. They didn't gain any ground with that argument when they presented it to Judge Arthur Gonzalez at the Bankruptcy Court.</p><p>They've also argued that this was a private plan agreed to before, they called it a Sub-Rosa plan, before Chrysler filed for bankruptcy, but again, Arthur Gonzalez said no that's just not the case. That's what the Appellate panel is going to hear; the three judges on the Appellate Court.</p><p>They're also going to be considering Chrysler's motion to certify the sale. If that happens, if the Indiana pensioners lose and Chrysler wins and the sale is certified, you can expect that sale to close almost immediately because Chrysler says it has to close the deal with Fiat by the 15th of June or else Fiat has the option to walk away from the table and worse it walks away with $35 million from Chrysler as a penalty for failing to close the deal.</p><p>So there's a lot riding on this decision today, Alexis.</p><p>One other thing in regards to that Hummer sale and the report that the Chinese are making perhaps a problem as to closing that deal because Hummers aren't fuel efficient. Hummer dealers will tell you that the H-3 which is the smaller Hummer -- it's built on the Chevy Colorado platform -- they'll tell you it gets better gas mileage on the highway than some of the import SUVs like the Lexus. So that's an argument that they are probably ready to fight.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Adam. I was just going to ask you about that, I appreciate it. All right, we'll check in with you a little later outside the court.</p><p>All right, well Chrysler is fighting two courtroom battles which Adam just talked about in its push to exit bankruptcy and merge with Fiat. In addition to today's hearing with the group of those Indiana state pensions and investment funds that are looking to block the deal. Close to 800 of the Chrysler's dealers are making their case in court. They made it yesterday to put the breaks on the plan.</p><p>For a closer look at the impact of the courtroom battles, Laurie Moncrieff is the president of Schmald Tool &amp; Die, an auto parts supplier that did business for Chrysler, and joining us on the phone Jim Anderer, the owner of Island Jeep in Long Island who is fighting in court to keep his business open.</p><p>Laurie, don't worry about the people behind you. I saw you telling people to keep quiet. Believe me I do that every single day. All right Laurie, tell me first of all, what does this delay mean to you and your business?</p><p>LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE: The manufacturers have been feeling the effects of what's been happening in the auto industry for quite some time. So quite frankly we're ready to get on with business.</p><p>The markets up here have been largely frozen because of what's going on in our economy in Michigan with the Detroit three. So in our opinion, we feel that moving forward quickly with the bankruptcy would be a help to the manufacturers.</p><p>GLICK: And Laurie, explain specifically what it is that you guys do and sort of where you fit into the food chain here in terms of how this impacts your business.</p><p>MONCRIEFF: We do precision machining and make dyes for the auto industry as well as many other industries. And quite frankly, all this upheaval is affecting a lot of industries besides just the auto industry.</p><p>GLICK: Great point.</p><p>Jim, I know you're joining us by phone. You've been kind enough to be here on several occasions. You're fighting to keep your dealership alive. You are one of those who received a pink slip. Tell me why the delay of this judgment of this decision could actually help you.</p><p>JIM ANDERER, PRESIDENT, ISLAND JEEP (via telephone): Hi, Alexis. Well, thanks for having me.</p><p>The delay helps me only in regard that it can possibly nix this deal. This is a bad deal for the American taxpayer. It's a bad deal for pretty much everybody involved, in my opinion.</p><p>I know that the vendor on the other line, you know, has her own agenda, and I'm sympathetic to that. But in my personal opinion this is a tragedy that's taking place in the American marketplace. It's putting 100,000 people out of work. It's really devastating to our economy right now. And I would like to see it nixed to be honest with you. I don't think it's a good deal...</p><p>GLICK: Ok, so Jim...</p><p>ANDERER: I think that Fiat is coming into this deal with no cash. And it's wrought with a lot of problems.</p><p>GLICK: Jim, you and I have talked about this before, and you have been in the courtroom. In fact you were in the courtroom yesterday speaking on behalf of those dealers who are being forced to shut down.</p><p>What convinces you that if the deal were not to go through with Fiat, that a liquidation of Chrysler would put you in a better position than if this deal were to go through?</p><p>ANDERER: Very simply that the market forces that would take place is exactly what should take place. The market forces would seek their own level which is the way it should be.</p><p>Ok, what's going on with this taxpayer bailout and all this other stuff? I mean, you know, give me a break. If -- whatever these particular brands are worth when they're in liquidation would be sold for what they are worth.</p><p>Ok I'm a stand-alone Jeep store. Jeep is never going to go away. It is going to be picked up by somebody. And whoever that is, is going to make a real go of it. But there's a false propping up of these brands is insanity. This is just not the way things should be done in a free marketplace.</p><p>GLICK: Laurie, let me switch to you for a moment. You actually feel that if they can make it through bankruptcy, that as suppliers, your position will be that much safer and more secure. Explain to people why that is.</p><p>LAURIE MONCRIEFF, PRESIDENT, SCHMALD TOOL &amp; DIE: Well, it's always a lot more risky to do business with a company prior to bankruptcy than after bankruptcy so we felt a huge disruption, and quite frankly in the tool and die industry, we felt a huge disruption for many, many years and we've seen this coming for many years.</p><p>We've known there's been instability in the market for many years. We were somewhat of the canary in the mines frankly in this economy and have been discussing the problems in tooling and in manufacturing since the early 2000 because we could feel that it was very unstable, and that the economy was not doing well quite frankly in the early 2002, 2003.</p><p>There were a lot of discussions about the problems in the market. So while many of the dealers and other segments of the auto industry quite frankly probably weren't even aware of the problems we were very much aware of it in our industry.</p><p>GLICK: So Laurie when you look at the current environment, I mean look, you live in Flint, Michigan. We're actually going to talk to Virg Bernero a little bit later on this morning.</p><p>What are people doing right now to either make sure that companies like you are diversifying your risk or finding other viable job opportunities because I imagine everything is tightened up in Michigan?</p><p>MONCRIEFF: Everything's not only tightened up. It's frozen in the market right now. And it's not just the auto industry, it's the financial markets are really playing a huge role. The state of Michigan has been basically red lined by a lot of banks so lines of credit are being pulled, very much a big problem with getting financing to operate your business.</p><p>And then even in other industries when you diversify, we're feeling a lot of difficulty in a lot of other industries that are not even part of the auto industry because the financial market up in Michigan is frozen, as I said. So we're very anxious for the market to be unfrozen, whatever it takes to do that.</p><p>We need financing. We need money to start flowing to survive. That's basically what we're doing up here in Flint is working very, very hard to survive this right now.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, Laurie, we wish you the very best. And Jim, you too. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to join us this morning.</p><p>ANDERER: Thanks, Alexis.</p><p>MONCRIEFF: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: Coming up, Countrywide's cofounder <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>charged with fraud by the SEC. The Judge is going to join us with his take.</p><p>And later the Palm Pre hits stores tomorrow. Will it take a bite out of Apple's iPhone? There's a lot of buzz about this. We're going to tell you about it in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: In court now, two executives from a defunct Seattle investment management firm are charged with running what prosecutors call one of the largest tax fraud schemes ever uncovered in the country. Quellos founder, Matthew Krane and CEO Jeffrey Greenstein and two others are charged with fraud, tax evasion and money laundering. Prosecutors say they created more than $1.3 billion in fraudulent losses for clients. Quellos used to be one of the world's biggest managers of mutual funds.</p><p>A jury not a judge will hear claims in a case between American International Group, AIG and Star International, the company controlled by Maurice Greenberg AIG's former CEO. The trial will now start June 15th. There are several lawsuits outstanding between AIG and Mr. Greenberg and sure wants Star to return AIG stocks and proceeds from stock sales. AIG received billions of dollars in federal bailout funds.</p><p>And the Securities and Exchange Commission charges former Countrywide CEO <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>with fraud and insider trading. Prosecutors say Mozilo and two other former executives misled investors about risky lending practices. The SEC also says Mozilo unloaded $140 million in Countrywide stock using insider information. It is the first case against a high-profile executive stemming from the sub prime mortgage meltdown. Mozilo has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer calls the SEC's allegations baseless.</p><p>Our fox news senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us right now for a look at the case. The judge is in the house and he's going to give us some explanations here. Judge, good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning Alexis. Good to see you.</p><p>GLICK: surprised by this announcement?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm surprised by this announcement. I expected -- and that would be standard operating procedure in a case like this -- an indictment rather than a civil lawsuit. This is a civil lawsuit the Securities and Exchange Commission says you didn't tell your opinion of your own products to your shareholders, and that caused them to acquire shares ignorant of what you thought of the products.</p><p>What did he think of them? Well the SEC got some e-mails, and in that he referred to his own products as toxic and poison. Now, that's the bad news that he said that in these e-mails. The good news for him is he was not indicted. He was not charged with a crime. The feds may still be investigating for that purpose.</p><p>But standard operating procedure in cases of fraud and insider trading is to indict and convict first and then to sue civilly. So the fact that they are suing him civilly, they are just looking for money and an order from a judge that he can never run a public company again. They are not looking to take away his freedom, tells me they don't have enough evidence to indict him or convict him.</p><p>GLICK: It's interesting because involved in this case also being charged with this as well is his chief operating officer and the CFO. All three of which are saying that number one, it's baseless. That they did divulge the proper information throughout the entire reporting process, and they say look the fact of the matter is the SEC has not done anything right in years, and they are using them as the poster child for what the SEC should have done over the past five years.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, the SEC's failures is a political argument that the court will not allow them to make to a jury. But the court will let them say this, \"Look, you have accused us of failing to share our opinions with everyone. You haven't us accused of failing to share facts.\"</p><p>This is not Enron or WorldCom where inaccurate data was given out. This is just a case where an opinion like toxic and poison wasn't shared with the public.</p><p>GLICK: Ok, but what is the chance, though, that when you read what the SEC is suggesting here, that this is brought on to suggest that it is very much like an Enron case, where they were not divulging material public information that could have affected decisions of shareholders, investors, etc.?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It is a question of law for the court to decide. Is it material information what the CEO's personal opinion is of his products? These are not facts now. They didn't hide numbers. They didn't cook books. They just held back these words like toxic and poison.</p><p>Flip side of this is, if this was really insider trading, they would have indicted him. But because they haven't indicted him, what it is, is using insider knowledge to sell; knowledge that anyone else could have gotten had they looked into the books.</p><p>GLICK: Let's bring up one of those e-mails dating back to 2006 because I want people to hear specifically what he said. \"In all my years in the business, I have never seen a more toxic product.\" That was one e-mail.</p><p>He also sent another e-mail regarding a certain kind of sub prime loan. And he said \"it is the most dangerous product in existence, and there can be nothing more toxic. Loans had been originated through our channels with disregard for process and compliance with guidelines.\" This is where he's talking about the fact that the procedure for getting loans was just way too simple.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know what the defense is? \"The government wanted us to do this and Fannie and Freddie took them off our backs and the shareholders are no longer at risk.\" That's the defense that he'll make and that's true.</p><p>The government did want those subprime loans given out and Fannie and Freddie did take them off the backs of Countrywide and others. That is inappropriate in my view believing in a free market. That's what the government did and that's why we have this crisis.</p><p>GLICK: Let's talk about one of the domino effects here. There's no doubt in my mind that Senator Christopher Dodd is climbing in a shell, perhaps in a bunker, as a result of this. He was one of those on the sort of Mozilo list of getting what some argue is a better mortgage. What do you make of this for Dodd?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: This is very bad news for Chris Dodd who already is suffering politically in Connecticut as a result of this. He's up for reelection in 2010.</p><p>Just as <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>kept from shareholders his opinion of his own product, Chris Dodd kept from voters the fact that <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo </nameText></person>gave him an absolute sweetheart deal.</p><p>What's the relationship between Chris Dodd and <person><nameText>Angelo Mozilo? </nameText></person>Chris Dodd is the chairman of the senate banking committee which regulates these things and writes the laws to control them. And he's accepting an enormous benefit that the public could never get from the CEO of one of the biggest companies he's writing the laws to regulate. The voters of Connecticut will have their say on this one, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, this is ugly. And then that whole issue with the AIG, the wording of the bonuses and the fiscal stimulus package. Oh my goodness.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Senator Dodd's also deep into that one.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. Judge, thank you very much. Great seeing you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Happy Friday. Have a great weekend.</p><p>GLICK: Happy Friday.</p><p>Also again I do want to say Mozilo has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer David Siegel calls the SEC allegations baseless. As for the other defendants, they attorney for David Sambol called this \"a baseless complaint that is a result of the political pressure the SEC is facing for the well-publicized enforcement failures.\"</p><p>And Eric Sieracki's attorney meanwhile says the SEC's case is \"without merit. Countrywide's stock performance was tied to the fortunes of the real estate and secondary markets for loans. Something all investors knew about.\"</p><p>I just wanted to clear up some statements from their attorneys.</p><p>Coming up, Charles Payne offers up his stock choices.</p><p>And President Obama meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel today; the president reassured the Europeans about the U.S. economy. We will tell you what he had to say when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Gavin Gray with a look at this morning's top news stories.</p><p>President Obama is meeting with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel today after bilateral meeting addressed in castle (ph), President Obama held a joint press conference with the German chancellor. The president reassured the Europeans about the U.S. economy. Take a listen to what he had to say here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In the United States we are working diligently to strengthen financial regulations, to ensure that a crisis like this doesn't happen again. And it is going to be very important to coordinate between Europe and the United States as we move to strengthen our financial regulatory systems.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAY: He'll be visiting Buchenwald concentration camp this morning. Before leaving for Paris, president Obama will meet with wounded soldiers at Landstuhl Medical Center.</p><p>In other news, investigators -- or rather reports of a setback for the search for Air France flight 447. France's Transportation Minister says French forces have found no evidence of an Airbus A-330 airplane that vanished over the Atlantic. He's urging extreme prudence about suspected debris fished from the ocean. The French Transportation Minister says he regrets an announcement by Brazilian teams that they had recovered plane debris from Air France flight 447. The jetliner was flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris; 228 people were on board.</p><p>AFP is reporting that former vice president Al Gore may be sent to North Korea to negotiate the release of two American journalists. Laura Ling and Euna Lee were arrested on March 17th near the North Korean border on charges they entered the country illegally and were engaged in hostile acts. Both women are reporters for Gore's California-based Current TV. They each could be sentenced to ten years in a labor camp.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Now back to New York and Charles Payne for a look at the stocks he's watching -- Charles, I'm listening.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you so much Gavin really appreciate it. Well folks it's going to be an exciting day today. Hopefully we will be to the upside.</p><p>A couple of stocks three stocks we're looking at. Manitowoc is one. This is one of these real hot equipment making stocks that obviously because of the economy has gotten hit real good. I think your risk reward now is really, really nice. Right here is where it broke the trend line recently. Now we're looking at a little resistance right around $7.80.</p><p>A break out there and I think you are pretty good. That takes you right here, that would be north of 10 buck; a huge percentage play. I love the fact that the risk reward is pretty good. In the March quarter they beat the street by almost 30 percent. Maybe that business is turning around. Certainly, the chart is attractive here.</p><p>Sina, I've probably mentioned this one now at least five times in the last year. As you can see, it is really starting to come on here to the point where it looks extremely, extremely attractive. This stock is breaking key resistance. I love the volume on it. I think if you don't have any China stocks, Baidu is my favorite. A lot of people are afraid to buy a stock that's almost $300 a share. This one might have room all the way up to $47 a share. It is one to take a look at. It is a reiteration.</p><p>And finally the stock that caught my eye more than any other yesterday. A company called Flir. The chart isn't so hot necessarily, it's been going down for a long time but I think it's hit a bottom and I think it's on the cusp of a major breakout.</p><p>By the way, this company has beaten the Street in each of the last four quarters and each time they beat by a larger margin. They make imaging systems for the military and of course for commercial use. I think the stock has room to $32 that would be almost 50 percent gain. I love the way it looked yesterday.</p><p>By the way, I have one pick on the Web that you have to go and take a look at today. Fox Business.com/moneyforbreakfast.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Mr. Payne, I look forward to it.</p><p>PAYNE: I'm pumped up about today, I'm hoping under 500,000. Keep our fingers crossed.</p><p>GLICK: Let's hope it is not too bad. Thank you very much Charles.</p><p>Coming up, we're going to go live to London for a look on how the overseas markets are trading. And Palm looking to take a bite out of Apple's bottom line with its new smart phone called the Pre. We're going to get a real live demonstration right here in studio and tell you why there's a lot of buzz about it. That's coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning, and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>Coming up: More on a report this morning from \"The Wall Street Journal\" that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's top management, including CEO Vikram Pandit. We're going to see who was mentioned as a possible replacement.</p><p>And Palm gets ready to release its Pre device tomorrow, looking to steal some of the success from Apple's iPhone. We're going to preview it in just a couple of minutes.</p><p>And what movie could possibly take down Pixar's \"Up\" from the top spot? Well, Universal and Warner Brothers have new releases. We're going to get those expectations both coming out today.</p><p>And we have the May employment report due out at 8:30. The expectation is for a loss of 520,000 jobs. We'll be live at the Labor Department.</p><p>And then, coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL\" at 9:35 a.m., I will be speaking with Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and get her reaction on the First on FOX to those job numbers.</p><p>All right. Let's take a look at the futures. We've been in the green throughout the morning. Let's see, are we still in the green? We are. OK, good news.</p><p>We're actually a little bit higher earlier this morning. The Dow up 41, S&amp;P up 5, NASDAQ up 5 as well. So, looking pretty good.</p><p>Let's get directly to financial news though -- we got a lot of that news. The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in its boardroom. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be bounced out. \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S. Bancorp CEO, Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job. The Feds own 34 percent of Citigroup.</p><p>And the FDIC is putting its program to rid the nation's banks of toxic assets on hold. The Legacy Loans Program was supposed to begin with trial sale this month, the FDIC says banks have proven they can raise private capital without cleansing their balance sheets. The FDIC says the program could come back in a different form.</p><p>And the FDIC is very busy today, also shutting down Silverton Bank. The troubled bank did attract investors from interest or from private equity guys. The FDIC says it had to do was cheapest for the insurance fund and shutting it down was cheaper. Silverton was not a retail bank. Most of its customers were actually other banks.</p><p>All right. Well, we've all been waiting for the big preview. The forefather of handheld phone is taking a run at Apple's iPhone to reclaim the spot as the king of the smartphone on the hill. Well, Palm will release its touch-screen Pre device tomorrow, exclusively on the Sprint network. And the phone offers a whole slew of slick new features.</p><p>With a look at it in some real details and whether or not it is going to be the necessary thing to boost Palm -- joining us right now is Lance Ulanoff. He's the editor-in-chief of PCMag.com. And FOX Business contributor Charles Payne, also WStreet.com founder is here with us as well to talk about the implications for the stocks of Palm and Apple.</p><p>All right. Lance, you've got the phone right in front of you. I'm very excited about this. How does it stack up? What are the things about the device that look so good?</p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, PC MAGAZINE EDITOR IN CHIEF: It stacks up pretty well. It is Sprint's best smartphone, bar none. It is gorgeous. It has many features you find on iPhone. It has a touch-screen, so I can add and drag around applications.</p><p>It has something the iPhone doesn't have, multitasking. So, if you are looking at the screen right now, I'm actually going through a bunch of different things that are running at once. So, it's a $199 phone after rebate. So, it starts at $299.</p><p>But it has something that the -- well, the iPhone doesn't have which is a QWERTY keyboard. So, this is one of the things that makes it so exciting. And you can use that QWERTY keyboard to do ubiquitous search, meaning the minute you start to type, it just starts to find whatever is on the phone.</p><p>One of the ways that it does that is it brings together all of your contacts from Google, Facebook, Exchange. It can search there. It can search throughout all of that.</p><p>It has a 3-megapixel camera. It plays video. And yes, it does have an accelerometer and what that means is you're going to be able to turn it to its side and you basically can play -- you can play videos in landscape mode.</p><p>GLICK: It looks really --</p><p>ULANOFF: It is.</p><p>GLICK: I'm entrenched. I'm watching --</p><p>ULANOFF: Oh, and, by the way -- and, by the way, it's got a really loud speaker.</p><p>GLICK: Wow. It's really awesome.</p><p>OK. So, let's talk about the big issue, which is the number of applications on the phone because I know I happen to have an iPhone.</p><p>ULANOFF: Right.</p><p>GLICK: And my kids adore it because it has so many different games on it. What are the applications like on this?</p><p>ULANOFF: Unfortunately, they are not coming out of the gate with a ton of applications. Right now, the iPhone has about 40,000 applications. This is going to start with about 20 or so. So, it's a -- it is far fewer and they are not really pushing the capabilities of this phone.</p><p>I've got Connect 4 up here, which is a lot of fun to play. I can drop in. I'm going to lose by the way. But I can drop in my checkers. But, except for touching it, you can't really shake it. You can't turn it over, shake out the chips, or anything like that.</p><p>There's Fandango. There's AP News. There's a NASCAR app, but not a NASCAR app where you drive a car, you just going to learn about what's going on if you are interested in NASCAR.</p><p>So, for somebody who's trying to decide between the iPhone and the Pre, well then, if you care about apps, there might not be much of a competition -- at least for now. But we do expect Palm to add in its app catalog a ton more apps very quickly.</p><p>GLICK: We are putting if here, Charles, the sort of what we're calling the tale of the tape here, which is the Palm Pre versus the Apple iPhone, walking through the carriers, the size of the memory, the screen, the applications, the cost -- all those things combined.</p><p>A lot of people believe, Charles, that this is do-or-die for Palm. This is their last opportunity to get out there and dazzle the community.</p><p>How important is it for them, and do you think they are doing what they need to do?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, there's no doubt that this is do-or-die. This is the bottom of 9th, two -- you know, two men out, two strikes against you, and you got to hit a home run. You can't hit a base. You can't bunt this thing.</p><p>The one thing, though, is that Wall Street has bid this stock up tremendously. Look at this chart. It's a mind-boggling move.</p><p>GLICK: Well, because the buzz on this phone has been very hot.</p><p>PAYNE: The buzz is hot but it's not like the buzz on the iPhone, where we saw people standing at midnight at the Apple Store waiting around in a line. I mean, this -- when the stock goes from like a buck to 13 bucks, that's huge, you know? So, ironically, of course, Apple's stock hasn't suffered too much.</p><p>And that's what I think you got going on here, too, a couple of things from the market's point of view. Maybe the smartphone category is big enough and is growing enough for there to be more than one winner. And maybe this won't be an iPhone killer, but perhaps, it will do well enough - - although the stock though, at this point, has had one heck of a move. And, you know, Wall Street, we get --</p><p>GLICK: The Palm's stock or Apple stock?</p><p>PAYNE: Palm stock.</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>PAYNE: Palm stock. Apple stock is still down from its high, although it's made a heck of a move recently from the lows of 88, 87. But still, I think on Wall Street, we tend to get extremely excited about things like this and we pump up these stocks. And I don't know that Palm can live up -- Palm Pre can live to the hype, at least not initially out of the gate.</p><p>GLICK: Lance, you made a facial expression when Charles talked about demand for the Pre. I hear that they are not releasing that many, and so, they think demand will be really hot.</p><p>ULANOFF: Well, I've heard that too. The CEO came out and said they might not be a lot of them out there. But I've also heard that there will be people waiting on lines, that there already is some guy waiting out there. And there are people who are telling me they are going to try and get it on Saturday because they are afraid there won't be enough at each store. But I have to say, Sprint has been working on this a long time. I'd be shocked if there aren't enough of these Pres to go around.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I mean, it's interesting Walter Mossberg, you know, from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he wrote a whole piece on it as well, and it was interesting to hear some of his points of view because a lot of people are looking to next week with Apple -- to see whether or not they are going to come out with a new iPhone. They are going to dazzle us, because a lot of their initial two-year contracts are set to expire coming up this summer. So, if they come out with one, this could be perfectly timed.</p><p>How crucial is it -- and, Lance, will <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>show up?</p><p>ULANOFF: We're all talking about that. You know, Wozniak, his former co-founder said he looked robust which is great news. We always expect surprises from Apple at every one of these major events. But I think this is going to be unique, because the third thing -- <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>has this habit in these events of going one more thing and he pulls it out of his back pocket.</p><p>I think the one more thing at this event is <person><nameText>Steve Jobs. </nameText></person>You have announcement, announcement -- <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>walks out with whatever the new iPhone is. I really think that could happen because he is a showman. He knows how to pull something like this thing off.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>ULANOFF: And there's going to be hot product out there. I don't know what it is, but it doesn't diminish what Palm has accomplished with the Pre, because I have to tell you -- this is a home run.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Charles, Tim Cook had done a terrific job in the role .</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GLICK: . of <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>obviously left in terms of running day-to- day operations. The stock is up 68 percent versus NASDAQ, which is up a little bit over 20 percent since left due to health concerns in January.</p><p>What will this mean if he does come back for Apple's stock?</p><p>PAYNE: Oh, it's a cherry on top of it. But more than that -- you know, listen, I don't think there's a CEO that's so identified with this company as Steven Jobs is with Apple. And listen, Apple already, early this morning, is indicating it's going to be up 3 or 4 points at the open today. And this is ahead of the Pre coming out tomorrow.</p><p>So, there's a lot of excitement about <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>coming in and doing something spectacular.</p><p>GLICK: We didn't even get to Sprint and AT&amp;T and Verizon. There's too much to talk about. But it looks so cool. It really does.</p><p>PAYNE: By the way, I think this is more important -- it might be as equally as important for Sprint as it is .</p><p>GLICK: As it is for Palm.</p><p>PAYNE: Palm -- absolutely.</p><p>GLICK: Great point. Lance, thank you very much for breaking it in.</p><p>ULANOFF: It's a pleasure.</p><p>GLICK: You must be having fun with that.</p><p>ULANOFF: I am.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: He is grinning from ear to ear with this phone.</p><p>ULANOFF: I still want to keep it.</p><p>GLICK: OK. The control room would like you to go visit them because there are several purchasers, including my executive producer, who wants to buy that immediately.</p><p>ULANOFF: I'm taking bids.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>All right. Coming up: We'll check the latest news headlines. And Warner Brothers is looking to cash in on a major hangover this weekend. We're going to preview the weekend box-office when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GAVIN GREY, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Gavin Grey in London with a look at this morning's top news stories.</p><p>House Republican leaders are suggesting more than $23 billion in budget cuts. Overall, the proposal includes cuts in no less than 37 programs. One example is eliminating transportation enhancements and this measure alone would save $833 million a year. It would take place over the next five years. The plan has been sent now to the White House.</p><p>And the State Supreme Court in South Carolina is ordering the state's governor to accept federal bailout money. Mark Sanford had refused to take the money designated to South Carolina over the next two years. But this court decision ends months of wrangling with legislators who accused him of playing politics with people's lives. Sanford says he will not appeal the decision and plans to sign the paperwork on Monday.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the FOX Business Network. Now, let's get back to New York and Alexis Glick.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>My favorite topic, let's get right to sports business right now. Star architect Frank Gehry won't be working on the $4 billion Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, New York, anymore. Developer brace Ratner is trying to trim $200 million in costs. Ellerbe Becket will take his place.</p><p>Ratner is blaming the economic downturn and litigation being brought on by project opponents. Ratner hopes to have the new arena opened for the New Jersey Nets by 2010, 2011.</p><p>The Big Unit joins baseball 300-win club. Pitcher Randy Johnson becoming only the 24th pitcher in history to win 300 games as the San Francisco Giants beat the Washington Nationals five to one. Johnson who is 45 years old has pitched for 16 in a 22-year career. Incredible.</p><p>And Charles Hayward, the president and CEO of the New York Racing Association said the absence of Rachel Alexandra would likely cost the Belmont Stakes significantly in attendance. With Rachel Alexandra in the race, Hayward estimated a crowd of between 80,000 to 90,000. Without her, he believes the crowd will be 50,000 to 60,000. Last year, when Big Brown was going for the Triple Crown, the attendance was 94,476.</p><p>Speaking of which, here now with a little preview of Belmont Stakes is FOX News reporter Rick Leventhal, who is live in Belmont Park.</p><p>Rick, pretty cool thing to be doing. I'm jealous. What's it looking like for tomorrow?</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, don't be too jealous because we're getting rained on right now. Attendance is near zero by the way because there's no races going on. However, Chip Woolley, the trainer of Mine That Bird you probably recognize from the Kentucky Derby is kind enough to join us for an exclusive one-on-one.</p><p>Now, they are saying attendance may be done because Rachel Alexandra who won the Preakness isn't running this race. You said that you believe that's possible?</p><p>CHIP WOOLLEY, MINE THAT BIRD TRAINER: Sure, she's a great filly and it would be good for in racing in general if she was here. But, in this game, you have to do what's best for the horse. And if they didn't feel like it was a best thing for her, it's better they don't run her.</p><p>And that, you know, racing -- racing will take care of itself. But we have to -- the horses have to come first.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Mine That Bird finished at close second to Rachel Alexandra. Are you disappointed that you didn't have a chance at a rematch on this longer track?</p><p>WOOLLEY: You know, a little bit disappointed I suppose. Really, I mean, it's -- for me, it's better she's not in here because that's one less horse you have to beat. And let's face it. If you don't have to beat them, you don't want to, you know? You want to limit the field to who you run at. So, I don't mind her not being here.</p><p>She's a great filly and you got to respect her a lot. So, really, for me, it's probably better she's not in for the racing game. It might be better that she would be here.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Your horse was on the track. It still is, I believe, on the track?</p><p>WOOLLEY: It just went off.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: It just went off. So, you just watched the horse working out in these conditions, which hopefully tomorrow, it will be sunny and drier. But how -- but how does Mine That Bird look today?</p><p>WOOLLEY: He looked great this morning. Just got over the ground really, really well. So we're real happy with where we're at. It looks like we got in here in good shape. And we're looking forward to running.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: You said he looked like a million bucks.</p><p>WOOLLEY: At least a million.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: That's the purse.</p><p>WOOLLEY: Yes, sir. Hopefully, we can get some of it, and hopefully, he'll have his best race in him tomorrow.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: So, Chip, if I were a betting man -- which I might be, by the way -- would you suggest I put money on your horse?</p><p>WOOLLEY: I will never make a suggestion like that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Chip Woolley, the trainer of Mine That Bird -- thanks so much for being with us. And get well soon.</p><p>WOOLLEY: Nice to meet you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: All right. Nice to meet you, too. So, that's the story.</p><p>And here's another look at Belmont Park and the track, which is very muddy. But again, they are expecting sunshine tomorrow. And if you were on the fence about whether to come here or not, I'm told there will be sunny skies and it should be a great day for racing.</p><p>GLICK: If you were a betting man, is that the cat calling the kettle black or what?</p><p>LEVENTHAL: I didn't want to come out and say it, but, you know, I might put a couple dollars on the race.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Rick, I'll e-mail you later to do the same for me. Great interview. Thanks so much for seeing you.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: OK. I look forward to it. Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Coming up: We're going to give you the box office preview for the weekend.</p><p>And this weekend, once again, you can pitch your business idea to a venture capitalist live right here on the FOX Business Network. Start emailing your pitches at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:YourMoney@FOXBusiness.com\">YourMoney@FOXBusiness.com</email> Lucky ones will get to sell their idea live on-air during on \"Your Questions, Your Money\" with Dagen McDowell and Robert Gray this Saturday, 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.</p><p>Stay with us. Movies -- coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: This weekend, Will Ferrell is going to be battling dinosaurs, bugs and one massive headache. The PG-13 time travel comedy, \"Land of the Lost\" from General Electric's Universal Pictures is going against Warner Brothers \"The Hangover,\" an R-rated bachelor party that shows what happens in Las Vegas may leave you with a tiger, a baby, and a missing groom. Yes, that's right.</p><p>Here to tell us how the films will do and if either of them can capture the upward mobility of Walt Disney's-Pixar's \"Up,\" joining me right now is Bradley Jacobs. He is the senior editor of \"Us Weekly.\"</p><p>Good morning, Bradley. Good to see you.</p><p>BRADLEY JACOBS, US WEEKLY SENIOR EDITOR: Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: No, wait a second. Is \"Hangover\" PG-13 or R?</p><p>JACOBS: That's definitely R-rated.</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>JACOBS: R-rated movie.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, because -- OK, because I heard there's a lot of profanity. I just wasn't sure if it was -- OK. Anyhow, I was saying to you before that I was at the movies yesterday evening, and I came out and there were these massive lines down the block. I understand there were midnight showings of \"Hangover.\" What's the buzz?</p><p>JACOBS: It had some of the best buzz of the year. You know, for a movie with no big stars, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, the concept is really key here. Four guys, a bachelor party that goes wrong, a missing groom, there's a baby in the mix. There's a stripper in the mix.</p><p>I saw it a couple of weeks ago. I really loved it. I think it is going to be hugely successful. R-rated summer movies are kind of the rare thing. So, you got -- you got the college students, you got --</p><p>GLICK: That's why I said, \"Are you sure it's R, are you sure it's not PG-13\"?</p><p>JACOBS: I am absolutely sure.</p><p>GLICK: Are you sure?</p><p>JACOBS: I am doubly sure that \"Land of the Lost\" is PG-13, and that's more of a kids' movie although it's PG-13. So, it's not really for 4-year-olds, it's not really for 6-year-olds. It's sort of, you know, for people in the PG-13 era, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds.</p><p>I think the battle between these two is really interesting.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, it is interesting. I do want to bring in Harry Medved, also from Fandango.com.</p><p>Because, Harry, I know you've been looking at \"The Land of the Lost\" pre-sales (ph) and there are just completely non-existent. Bradley was telling me the reviews are just horrific.</p><p>You tell me, Harry, what did they get wrong with \"Land of the Lost\"? Will anybody go see it?</p><p>HARRY MEDVED, FANDANGO.COM: Well, you know, people are saying on Fandango, the user reviews are saying it's perfect for 13 year olds of all ages, especially if you're for bathroom humor, because it is PG-13. But there's plenty of dinosaur manure, dinosaur urine, masturbation jokes and frequent uses of the S-word for any 13-year-old to wallow in.</p><p>Now, parents may not be too excited about it. But at least it's not the R-rated comedy of \"The Hangover\" that Bradley was just talking about.</p><p>GLICK: But, Bradley, look, this is box-office projections for these movies that are coming out of here. And \"Land of the Lost\" is getting some, you know, at least some decent -- I mean, not great, but decent projections. Is that because of Will Ferrell, you know, you just -- </p><p>JACOBS: Will Ferrell is a huge star. They run commercials everywhere, marketing everywhere for this film. They just want to get butts in seats in the first few days before the word really spreads about it.</p><p>But I actually think those productions may be wrong and you could see \"Hangover\" end up number two this weekend.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. I mean, I was saying to you .</p><p>JACOBS: I do, too.</p><p>GLICK: I was saying to you before, like, oh, my God, I had never seen a movie marketed more than this one, oh my goodness. OK. How does this stack up against up, against \"Star Trek\"? You know, we had some big blockbusters last summer. You know, who turns out to be the big ones this summer?</p><p>JACOBS: Well, \"Up\" had a huge weekend last weekend, and I wouldn't be surprised if \"Up\" were number one again this weekend. It would be the first time in more than a year that an animated movie has been number one two weekends in a row. But \"Up,\" you have that magic thing where the critics love it and audiences love it -- which is very rare.</p><p>I saw it here in 3-D last weekend. I want to see it again. And I think that there is incredible word of mouth for that film, because it's one of those things where you can take your family. You can take kids. You can take teenagers. You can take your friend.</p><p>You know, it's really in that magical place. So, I think that will be number one.</p><p>MEDVED: You know --</p><p>GLICK: Yes, Harry, go quickly.</p><p>MEDVED: I'm not sure you want to take kids under 6 years old, because there are some terrifying elements to \"Up.\" Now, on Fandango, that's the place where people buy advanced tickets, we are seeing that \"Up\" is leading the way for ticketing this weekend, it's about 42 percent of all tickets sold on Fandango.</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>MEDVED: But \"The Hangover\" is gaining momentum. There was a surge of tickets last night. Those people you saw online last night, Alexis, they're all across the country. Thursday midnight shows were sold out last night.</p><p>I went to one last night and people came out of the theater saying, \"I want to see `The Hangover' again.\"</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>MEDVED: So, I think you will be surprised. \"Hangover\" will not be number two. I think it will be number one.</p><p>GLICK: I have to leave it there, Harry and Bradley. I know what I'm doing this weekend if only I could get a baby-sitter. Gentlemen, thank you very much. I appreciate it.</p><p>JACOBS: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: We'll be right back. We're going to do a roundtable on jobs as jobs numbers are due out in half hour. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Good morning and welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>We're about 30 minutes way from the release of the May employment report. Expectations are for a loss of another 520,000 jobs, sending the unemployment rate to 9.2 percent. We are live at the U.S. Labor Department in Washington, D.C., to break down those numbers.</p><p>Also, Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is going to join us for his analysis on those numbers. And Roger Ballou, the CDI Corp. CEO, is going to join me to break it all down.</p><p>And news this morning that the FDIC is pushing for a shakeup of Citigroup's top management, including perhaps CEO Vikram Pandit. We're going to get into those details in just a moment.</p><p>And on the jobs front, speaking of which, I will be talking to the labor secretary coming up later this morning on \"The Opening Bell\" at just about 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time. We'll get Hilda Solis' point of view on the jobs.</p><p>Let's look at the markets, though. We're in the green. We're at the highs of the morning. Dow up 45. S&amp;P up 5. Nasdaq up 5 as well. So across the board we're up about 0.5 percent.</p><p>All right, let's get a look at the markets. We have business contributor Gavin Gray and Connell McShane. Let's start with Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Alexis, thanks very much.</p><p>As you said, we are trading higher ahead of the open this morning and ahead, more importantly, of the jobs report because when you think about it, all things can change here half an hour from now. So, you know, and that's all we're going to be talking about a half an hour from now. So let me give you a couple of stocks individually to watch. Either way, no matter what the jobs report comes out at, these are going to be stocks to watch.</p><p>Apple, right behind me, is definitely one of them. There's a report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" about <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>this morning. Look at it going from below $144 to almost $147 in pre-market trading. So a nice little boost. The report in \"The Journal\" is Jobs is on track to come back on the job as the CEO there after taking medical leave by the end of the month. And there's even some speculation in that \"Journal\" article that he comes back earlier.</p><p>The big developer's conference next week. The Palm Pre coming out over the weekend. The speculation, and again this might be getting ahead of ourselves, is that Jobs maybe comes back ahead of schedule in order to announce a new iPhone. Either way, a lot of optimism about Apple.</p><p>One other quick stock to watch, a company called Quanta Services. PWR is the ticker on it. It is going to take the place of Ingersoll Rand in the S&amp;P 500. So Quanta, again, a power company that -- the index fund managers are going to have to buy this stock. It was up after hours. Ingersoll, by the way, is reincorporates itself. It's going to have its base in Ireland. With a name like Connell McShane, there's not (ph) any problem with having your base in Ireland. But the S&amp;P doesn't like that because you're supposed to be based in the United States. They make the exception for Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, which is where Quanta -- where Ingersoll was based before that. So they were allowed to be in the S&amp;P. Now they're leaving. Quanta takes its place. There you have it.</p><p>Gavin Gray over in Europe with a look at those overseas markets for us now.</p><p>Gavin, take it away.</p><p>GAVIN GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Connell, thanks very much indeed. I'm sure they'll make an exception for you, as you say.</p><p>Looking at the European markets, in Asia it was a 1 percent club today. It is in Europe as well pretty much. Starting off with the FTSE here in London. All waiting on announcements about Gordon Brown and his reshuffle. But up 1.5 percent at 67 points, 4,454. The CAC 40 in Paris, 3,347, up 35 points. The DAX hardly shifting at all today. Up just 33 points or 0.65 percent.</p><p>And despite that reshuffle in the U.K. cabinet, today we're getting details coming through in bits and pieces. Gordon Brown's position as prime minister really does remain in jeopardy. Some of the newspaper headlines today really damaging. Comes after four cabinet members have resigned in just four days, causing many politicians to question whether Mr. Brown has enough authority to continue at the head of the British government.</p><p>One thing we now believe is really pretty certain is the chancellor, the money man, the treasurer, Alistair Darling. He has apparently told Gordon Brown, I say as chancellor or I'm out. And we do think that he is going to stay as chancellor.</p><p>All this political uncertainty has been weighing heavily on the British pound. It slid against the dollar in recent days. Today it is down against both the dollar and the euro. And $1.61 will buy you one pound. And the dollar against the euro, though, is down, and $1.41 will buy you a euro.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Gavin, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, we could see the unemployment rate climb to 9.2 percent this morning with the release of the Labor Department's May employment report. Now while that rate may be up, job cuts may be down for the second month in a row with an estimated 520,000 job losses last month versus 539,000 lost in April. March, 699,000. Now, states are getting their hands on some of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help create employment opportunities. Is that enough? And what are state and local leaders doing right now with that money to create jobs?</p><p>Here's my take. Number one, we need to basically stem the tide on the job front and figure out what we're doing to address private sector jobs, particularly those that are created by small businesses. Number two, will the work -- will the work programs -- will they ultimately work to retain enough people? Those worker training programs. And number three, concern that the stimulus package is ultimately not enough to help the jobs situation. Perhaps time is the only cure. But keep in mind that the underemployed numbers are much more disconcerting and you've got to make sure you look at the big picture, not just the unemployed.</p><p>Joining me right now is Mayor Virg Bernero of Lansing, Michigan, Mayor R.T. Rybak of Minneapolis, and Steve Crowley, the host of \"American Scene\" radio program and the financial TV program \"Wall Street Cast.\"</p><p>Good morning, everybody. Good to see you guys.</p><p>STEVE CROWLEY, \"AMERICAN SCENE\" RADIO HOST: Thank you, Alexis. Thanks very much. This is great (ph).</p><p>GLICK: All right, Mayor Bernero, let me start with you. Let me walk through some of the numbers here. The unemployment rate, as you know, in Michigan, the highest in the country, 12.9 percent. I understand you can get a little less than $4 billion in the stimulus. Is it enough to help create and save jobs? What are you doing?</p><p>MAYOR VIRG BERNERO, (D) LANCING, MICHIGAN: Well, look, a lot of it is going into infrastructure. It's going into roads. It's going into retraining of workers. We're trying to get a business incubator up and going to generate new ideas and for business startups.</p><p>But, look, we've talked about this for months. The best stimulus is a stimulating job. People need jobs. They want long-term security. And so the temporary help is great. We appreciate that. But we need to restore health in the economy.</p><p>And, you know, Lansing dodged a bullet. We were very fortunate not to have any plant closures with GM. In fact, our factories may get a little more work. But still, in the long run, we need a healthy auto industry. We need to make sure that we're making the cars of the future in places like Lansing, Michigan.</p><p>And I think the economy, in terms of people starting to buy again, I mean they want that long-term future. And when you talk about retraining, I'm all for the retraining, but I've got e-mails from people all over the country that say, you know, I've been retrained two or three times and the job is eliminated. And so what are we going to retrain them in?</p><p>And you and I have talked about this. We need to have manufacturing. I'm not giving up. I don't think we can be a post manufacturing society. I think we have to find a way that we have manufacturing in this country, advanced manufacturing, and that means leveling the playing field on trade. Until we do that, we're not going to have a permanent recovery.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I mean, Mayor Rybak, I'm concerned about the training efforts too. I mean that's what I keep hearing as one of the cures to solve the problem here. And I'm concerned that it's not really going to truly impact job creation. It's great to learn a lot of other, you know, things to do and skills to have, but at the end of the day, it's not a job.</p><p>MAYOR R.T. RYBAK, (D) MINNEAPOLIS: Well, I totally agree with your point. I will say that in the middle of a recession, education and training is -- if you're ever going to do it, it's a good time to do it.</p><p>But first and foremost, we didn't just wake up to the retraining issue when the economy went south. We've been doing it for a number of years. When I took office, unemployment was 1 percent higher in the city than in the suburbs. Today it's lower in the city than the rest of the region. Very few cities can say that. The reason is because we've been in an ongoing training effort for hard to employ people.</p><p>Now when you hit a period of time like this, it's a big challenge. You have two things. You have, one, the fact that there are a lot of people who are out of work. So, for instance, some of the key construction trades, up to half the people will be sitting on the bench.</p><p>Meanwhile, we know that coming up is going to be a new economy that's going to be based a lot on clean energy, including some of the weatherization work that really takes skilled workers. So we have this tough problem of needing workers in the future, but if you train them for trades where there's high unemployment, you have a problem. I spent all yesterday morning meeting with trades and other folks trying to talk about that tough issue.</p><p>We do, however, have to say, you've got to create a job at the end of it. So we've put a lot of our stimulus dollars into creating those new clean energy jobs. We've put some significant investment into solar, trying to make sure that works. We are training people to do solar installation. We're training them to do green roof installation and are putting incentives in it to create more green roofs.</p><p>Now those are not going to bring back the manufacturing base of America. And I agree with the mayor very much so. I'm not giving up on making things in America.</p><p>I just got back from China. And part of what we need to do as well is to tap into a global economy. We brought a Danish med tech firm into Minneapolis and it's now moved into its headquarters here, 600 new jobs. That's part of it too.</p><p>But you have to home grow the economy. You have to be part of global economy. And you have to have trained workers. There's no one easy fix.</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>Steve, you talk to people every single day . . .</p><p>CROWLEY: We do.</p><p>GLICK: Nationally syndicated radio show. What are people saying to you about the jobs environment?</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, sometimes you can't get a job in your local area. Sometimes people have to move. We talked to one person who was a CPA/MBA, couldn't get a job in south Florida. If they would move to Houston, there's plenty of jobs. There's a shortage of CPA/MBAs. So sometimes you do have to retrain, go back to school. People that learn Chinese right now can get a job, I guarantee you.</p><p>GLICK: So, you know, Steve, you've been doing this for a very long time. Have you ever seen anything like this?</p><p>CROWLEY: No. No one has really seen anything like this. You have to go back to the '30s, you know, to really see something like this. This is an unbelievable time in American history. But I think it's getting a lot better. I think 12 to 18 months from now the market is predicting that the jobs market is going to be better.</p><p>GLICK: You know . . .</p><p>BERNERO: Let me say, Alexis, what's happened is the . . .</p><p>GLICK: Yes, Mayor Bernero, go ahead.</p><p>BERNERO: The chickens have come home to roost on this free trade. We've had unfettered free trade. It's unilateral, economic disarmament. And the last speaker, you know, I appreciate -- I hope he's right that things turn around, but there's a complete disconnect between the stock market, between Wall Street and main street, because most of the production in this country has been shipped overseas. We've taken the P out of GDP, Gross Domestic Product. We've replaced it with a C. We have Gross Domestic Consumption.</p><p>And we have move so much with these unfair trade policies. We've moved so much of our production overseas that what you can see is the stock market can recover, I think, because the production, most of it's overseas. And when you ship it to Malaysia and China and you can pollute the environment and exploit the workers and pay a lot less, I guess Wall Street can make more, but main street is hurting. And I don't see that turning around until we find a way to bring these jobs back to the United States.</p><p>And it's not that these jobs evaporated. That's a myth that these manufacturing jobs just evaporated into the air because of technology. Not at all. We have these jobs here in Lansing. The new factories are wonderful. They are robotic. And we have workers in them.</p><p>But more and more of these high-tech, high-advanced manufacturing jobs are going to places like Mexico and China. And we've got to find a way to reverse that and have fair trade that favors American workers, that allows American workers to compete fairly.</p><p>GLICK: Mayor Rybak, he raise as very important point. Several states are doing what they can to incentivize overseas operations to move here to the United States, or incentivize U.S. companies who garner the lions share of their revenues from international operations to stay in the United States. But does that then raise a question of protectionism?</p><p>RYBAK: Well, I don't think the issue is protectionism as much as trying to home grow an economy. I mean, look, there are ways to ship jobs from overseas. But the thing Americans have always done is they've created the job in the first place. We're an incubator of innovation. And if we continue to incubate, then we can have not only the ideas, but the manufacturing here.</p><p>Now an example is, we're putting some of our stimulus dollars into helping a company called Ken Kay Solar (ph). It's a new approach to doing solar that will hopefully make it cheaper to put it into homes. So that's a brain power idea. But we need to also make sure that the person power that's making it is done here as well.</p><p>I think there's a really important moment when American ingenuity then creates a product. We do that well and will continue to do that well. The point is, is once that product is ready to be made, that we have to make it here at home.</p><p>I think the mayor made a good point in this whole issue of the unfair competition of labor costs. As I say, I was in China. They're doing some wonderful things. But I sure as heck don't want my cousin or my constituent getting some of the wages that are being paid over there.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, right.</p><p>RYBAK: So I think we need to certainly level the playing field, but also recognize, hey, look, this is America. We're not on our knees. We know what we're doing. And we've done great things. And we're going to do them again. Let's just get back to the basics of invention, incubation and manufacturing. We can do this.</p><p>GLICK: You know, we heard yesterday some bright spots. We heard about Wal- Mart hiring 22,000 people.</p><p>CROWLEY: That's right.</p><p>GLICK: We've heard a couple of other companies start to say that they're beginning to hire again. That they're beginning to spend again. You and I yesterday talked about, you know, the ordering of jets and things of that nature. </p><p>CROWLEY: Right.</p><p>GLICK: Are we starting to see those signs of life? Are they starting to suggest perhaps a bottom?</p><p>CROWLEY: I think it will all start with a good glimmer of hope, don't you? But I -- you know, I really believe the small businesses, the nation's job maker, net/net, Alexis, all new jobs are created by small business. Apple Computer and Microsoft started as small businesses and now employ a lot of people.</p><p>But a lot of companies that employ fewer than 50 people are now starting to see the light. We're getting reports back that the CEOs of these smaller companies are saying, yes, business is picking up. We're starting to bring in our old employees that we let go. And people who we cut down to 20, 30 hours a week, we're bringing back to 40 hours a week.</p><p>So I think that's where the new jobs are going to be created. And even like cities like Lansing, which is a small business community too, I think that's where the real job generation is going to happen.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, you know, Mayor Bernero, I'm going to talk to the labor secretary coming up in the next hour and the thing that worries me is that the small business community, as Steve points out, which is something I talked in one of my talking points, is essential for private sector jobs. And what we saw in the last report is private sector jobs got hit so tremendously. Are we doing enough to help small businesses?</p><p>BERNERO: Look, look, number one, I mean, I just want to say, with all due respect, you know, you help prove my point with the Wal-Mart. I mean GM lays off 20,000 high-paying, top of the line, top of the food chain manufacturing jobs. Twenty thousand. Wal-Mart's hiring 20,000.</p><p>It's the Wal-Martization of our economy and that's part of what's killing us. I mean that's great that Wal-Mart's hiring, that will give some hope, but you're taking basically $26, $28 an hour jobs and going down to I don't know what Wal-Mart pays, you know, $10 maybe if you're lucky. So this is part of the problem.</p><p>Now as far as small business goes, one problem is the banking. We've helped banks at the top. OK. And, look, I'm not bashing Obama here. I mean the guy has inherited a mess and he's doing an admirable job with it.</p><p>But we've helped banks at the top. It hasn't trickled down to the community banks. The community banks, Steve's right, the small businesses where the growth is, we all know that, there can't be any growth because nobody can get a loan. The community banks have been shut out. While the banks in Wall Street are getting help, the community banks, you know what they're getting? More regulation from FDIC. They're getting tighter regulations, tighter standards. They're not getting any help. And the community banks weren't even part of the problem.</p><p>So this has got to be addressed by the administration. The community banks are being strangle held and they're the ones that are -- that know the people, that know the communities and know where the money should be given. And they didn't do anything wrong. They weren't involved in all the chicanery that Wall Street was, but they're getting punished by the FDIC. So this insanity has got to stop. We need our community banks help.</p><p>But the other thing, I want to just tell you, the small businesses are hurting. I've got e-mails and I've got people in my community, the small - - I can show you letters from union presidents and company presidents, small business presidents, that sound just the same. Main street America is hurting. Because when you wipe out manufacturing, you wipe out a lot of the small businesses. When I hear people say we're a service economy, what are we going to service? These small businesses are hurting because as so much manufacturing has left, the small businesses -- of course we're in Michigan. I mean a lot of our small businesses were auto related, tool and dye and this sort of thing.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>BERNERO: They're hurting. And I think this is true all across the country, though. You've had furniture makers and all sorts of small businesses that are struggling to survive. Again, I hate to sound like a one-note Nelly (ph), but with that foreign competition.</p><p>GLICK: You are incredible.</p><p>Mayor Rybak, I just have to ask you the last question. Are you going to run for governor? </p><p>RYBAK: Oh, I -- we'll figure that out tomorrow. But I want to say that going back to the point of . . .</p><p>GLICK: Oh, we'll figure it out tomorrow. You're -- the governor of your state is saying that he's going to run -- he's going to go for the White House.</p><p>RYBAK: Well, he's going to get his butt kicked by Barack Obama, but that's another thing.</p><p>The point of the matter is . . .</p><p>GLICK: Wow.</p><p>RYBAK: I want to talk about jobs here.</p><p>The point of the matter is, I absolutely strongly agree with the point that was just being made about make things in America. I do want to say, though, that when you hear that a retail company is adding jobs, we don't just want people behind the cash register, but speaking from the headquarters of Target and Best Buy here in Minneapolis, some phenomenal jobs are in that sector.</p><p>But the other thing that happens in the economy in a period of time like this is that as people go into transition, as sadly people leave a job and try to figure out what to do next, you do have innovation. And I think that's one of the things we've got to work with, with the lending community, and that is where sometimes the public sector needs to spur innovation. Someone leaves a company. They get fired. They get laid off. They start to think about it. They talk with their friend about what they've always wanted to do. This is when the new American jobs get created.</p><p>Now we can't be in la-la land about this. They've got to make things too. But I think innovation will help us at this point.</p><p>GLICK: All right, sounds like the role of governor looks appealing.</p><p>All right, Mayor Rybak, thank you so much. Mayor Bernero, and Steve, gentlemen, thank you very much.</p><p>All right, guys, we're going to take a quick break. We've got the jobs data coming out in just about 12 minutes. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Checking financial news now.</p><p>The FDIC is putting pressure on Citigroup to make some changes in its boardroom. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says CEO Vikram Pandit could be bounced out. \"The Journal\" says officials reached out to former U.S. Bancorp CEO Jerry Grundhofer to see if he wanted the job. The feds, of course, own 34 percent of Citigroup.</p><p>And the FDIC putting its program to rid the nation's banks of toxic assets on hold. The legacy loans program was supposed to begin with a trial sale this month. The FDIC says banks have proven they can raise private capital without cleansing their balance sheets. Therefore, the FDIC says the program could come back later on in different form.</p><p>And the FDIC is very busy today. Also shutting down Silverton Bank. The troubled bank did attract interest from private equity folks, but the FDIC said it had to do what was cheapest for the insurance fund and ultimately shutting it down was cheaper. Silverton was not a retail bank. Most of its customers were actually other banks.</p><p>All right. Let's go over to Charles Payne and take a look at the Fox 50.</p><p>Charles.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, thanks a lot, Alexis.</p><p>Well, as you said, Citigroup, Apple, and Intel, they're all Fox 50 stocks and they're all making news this morning. Former Barclay's (ph) capital investment manager and financial analyst Vn Man (ph), he joins us now to break them all down.</p><p>And let's talk about this Citi thing because I don't think it's news that a lot of people want to see Vikram Pandit go. The bigger story here seems to be Sheila Bair versus Timothy Geithner and the FDIC not only saying we want to be in this game, we actually want more power.</p><p>VN MAN, FMR. BARCLAY'S CAPITAL INVESTMENT MANAGER: Yes, absolutely. I mean the -- what's going on here is the FDIC is essentially trying to get more power than the comptroller. But, you know, not since the days of Howard Stern fighting the FCC have we seen government versus the private sector. I mean this is really turning into a soap opera.</p><p>On one hand you've got Sheila Bair and she interrupted kind of Citigroup's ideas in the past. I don't know if you recall when she actually -- when Citigroup was trying to buy Wachovia and then Wells Fargo swept in there and bought Wachovia instead. And Sheila Bair backed Wells Fargo. And so, you know, there's kind of this struggle between . . .</p><p>PAYNE: There's definitely a power struggle going on there.</p><p>Let's talk about Apple here.</p><p>MAN: OK.</p><p>PAYNE: Big, big news. Obviously tomorrow the Pre comes out. But the bigger news for folks on the Apple stock is that <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is coming back. And it always feels like Caesar returning to Rome. So much excitement. The stock is indicating it will open higher here. What do you think is going to happen?</p><p>MANN: You know, everybody -- me included -- everybody wants to know they work for the best and the brightest. And <person><nameText>Steve Jobs, </nameText></person>he's not just a maverick. You know, he's a hero to the people he works for and a hero to the investors. So people want to know that he's coming back.</p><p>But what's interesting is, over the last five months, since he left in January, the stock has appreciated over 68 percent. So the market believes that Apple can continue to be successful, even without <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>there on a daily basis.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. And we do have the bid ask. It's up. Indicating up almost 3 points here at the open.</p><p>Having said that and the fact that you pointed out it's already up, as an investor, if an investor came to you this morning and said, should I buy this stock, what would you tell them?</p><p>MAN: You know, I love this stock. I mean I actually have my own iPhone. I'm a huge fan of the iPhone. And the new one is coming out supposedly. That's what we're hearing rumors is that it's going to come out at the worldwide development conference.</p><p>PAYNE: Let's talk about another big tech name.</p><p>MAN: Yes. Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Intel made a rare acquisition yesterday. A company called Wind River Systems. What does that tell you that Intel is starting to make some of these acquisitions?</p><p>MAN: You know, Intel has -- obviously they control the PC market, the server market in terms of their chips.</p><p>PAYNE: But it's sort of like a one trick pony.</p><p>MAN: Well, what this is doing, it's giving them access to customers. I mean who are the customers of Wind River? The customers are Apple. The customers are Sony, Panasonic. And this gives them access to those customers. So I think it's a good move.</p><p>PAYNE: Quickly before I take it back to Alexis. The stock closed at $11.70. The bid is $11.50. Does that tell you there could be another bid coming for this company?</p><p>MAN: Yes. I mean if they're making an offer of $11.50 and already, you know, since Wednesday you see it's trading up to $11.70 that means there's potentially somebody else or the market thinks that somebody else is going to step in there and offer something -- you know, a higher number.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot. We really appreciate it. That's fantastic.</p><p>MAN: Thank you. Thanks.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, Alexis, back over to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Charles, thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up, Chrysler is back in court today. Adam Shapiro is there live with the very latest.</p><p>And we are just minutes away from the May employment number. We're going to have that for you as it happens and a full break down. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: We've got some breaking auto news now. Dow Jones Newswire is reporting there will be no Opel launch in the United States due to a future Magna deal.</p><p>Chrysler heads backed to court today where the judge will hear from a group trying to block its deal with Fiat. Our own Fox Business' Adam Shapiro is live outside the courthouse with the details on both of these developments.</p><p>Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the latest, let's start with Opel real quick. There are Opels in the United States now. They actually build cars for Saturn and the Saturn Astra is one of them. With the news that Saturn may be sold to Penske Auto Group out of Detroit, you might still have some kind of contractual agreement where Opel would manufacture cars and be sold under the Saturn brand. So to say Opel won't be launched in the U.S. is accurate, but you can still get an Opel, it would just have a different name.</p><p>Now to Chrysler.</p><p>The appellate court, the three judge panel, will hear arguments starting at 2:00 as to why the deal with Fiat should be delayed. Keep in mind, it was Chrysler which asked for this emergency hearing. They're trying to get the panel to certify the sale so the deal can close before July 15th. But the Indiana state treasurer, along with 12 other parties, are trying to stop the deal and they've also petitioned to get the stay in place which now exists. They say, this is the exact quote, \"that the Indiana retirees and Indiana taxpayers have suffered losses because of unprecedented and illegal acts of the federal government.\"</p><p>Sources close to all of this say they expect a decision from the three- panel judges by late tonight, possibly early Saturday morning. So everybody will be watching to see if Chrysler and Fiat get the go ahead to close their deal or if it will be delayed. And if it's delayed past that July 15th date where they say they have to close, Fiat has the option to walk. And if they do walk, Chrysler has to come up with $35 million as a penalty for not closing many time.</p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: OK. Before I let you go, Adam, just to confirm here, the deadline is June 15th, right, not July 15th.</p><p>SHAPIRO: June 15th, not July. June 15th. I miss spoke. June 15th.</p><p>GLICK: OK, good. I just wanted to confirm. I want to confirm that.</p><p>The other thing here is, is if, in fact, Fiat were to walk, what happens with the role of the Treasury and the U.S. government in backstopping this debtor in possession financing?</p><p>SHAPIRO: That's a very good question. We'll try and get that one answered. But most people are not even addressing it. They expect it to close. But it would throw the entire deal with Chrysler up in the air because the U.S. government has said, without Fiat, there is no future for Chrysler.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Adam Shapiro, we will continue to keep a close eye on these developments throughout the morning. Thank you very much, Adam.</p><p>Well, we are just about a minute away from the jobs data. I want to bring up the futures right now as we take a look at this here. Expectations right now for unemployment to rise to 9.2 percent. It was 8.9 percent in April. Expectations are also for 520,000 job losses. We did lose 539,000 jobs last month.</p><p>Now keep in mind, though, we have seen upward revisions time and time again. And those jobs numbers, January, February, March, were well north of 600. In fact, back in January, 740,000 job losses. At this point, if we lose about 500,000, we will have lost 6.2 million job since the start of the recession according to the NABE. That was December of 2007.</p><p>As you can see, the futures are in the green. So we're looking up to be in positive territory here. But if we get something in the 500s, low 500s, the anticipation is that the market will rally on the news that perhaps job losses are beginning to subside.</p><p>Let's go to Rich Edson. He is at the Labor Department with the number.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: 345,000 jobs lost. 345,000 jobs lost. We've got an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent. That's the highest since 1983. There are 14.5 unemployed people in this country. That is the highest ever.</p><p>Again, 345,000 jobs lost last month. We had 539,000 jobs lost initially last month, April, excuse me. That number is now 504,000. In March, the initial number, 699,000 jobs lost. That is now 652,000 jobs lost.</p><p>Since the recession began in December of 2007, the unemployment rate has increased 4.5 percent and six million jobs have been lost.</p><p>Let's take a look at the private sector -- 338,000 jobs lost. Government fell 7,000 jobs. The federal government dropped 15,000 jobs.</p><p>Leisure and hospitality, get this, up 3,000 jobs. That's the first increase since December of 2007 when the recession began. Eight thousands of those jobs are food and drinking services.</p><p>Education and health services up 44,000 jobs. And credit intermediation, if you are looking for those refinance jobs, down 6,000. Those are people who do refis if you are looking for an indication of that.</p><p>Let's take a look at construction jobs, a little bit better than had been. Manufacturing jobs, 156,000. Let's start with that, 156,000 jobs lost for manufacturing. Motor vehicles and parts down 30,000.</p><p>And since December of 2007, there have been 1.8 million jobs lost because of manufacturing. That accounts for three-tenths of all jobs lost since there. Construction employment down 59,000. And believe it or not, that's about half the average of the previous six months.</p><p>Household wages averaging $18.54. That is up .1 percent, year over year up 3.1 percent.</p><p>Also, government was up 92,000 last month. It was originally thought to be up 72,000 -- excuse me, that's for the month of April. The month of April up 92,000, originally thought to be 72,000.</p><p>Alexis, we'll leave it there. Back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right. So, before I let you go, Rich, just to review this here right now, the 14.5 million people that are unemployed is the highest on which record? From what date?</p><p>EDSON: That was when record keeping began back in 1948. So it's the highest ever taken when they started all the way back in 1948.</p><p>GLICK: All right, terrific. And just before I let you go, any revisions? No revisions to unemployment rate, revisions downward for April and March in terms of non-farm payrolls?</p><p>EDSON: That's right. We lost fewer jobs in April and March. Originally, it was thought in April that we'd lost 539,000 jobs. That's now been revised to 504,000 jobs, so a difference of 35,000 jobs on the good side.</p><p>March, originally thought to be nearly 700,000, 699,000, we are now at 652,000 for the month of March. That is a change to the good side of 47,000.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Rich Edison, what a surprise. Thank you very much.</p><p>Let's break down the numbers.</p><p>Democratic Congressman Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania is with us; Roger Ballou, the president and CEO of the professional service company CDI; and John Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Investor Services.</p><p>Gentlemen, I'm in a little bit of shock, a little surprised.</p><p>John, let me start with you. You're my resident economist here.</p><p>Why would the unemployment rate tick up from 8.9 percent to 9.4 percent and yet in non-farm payrolls we lost a little less than 350,000?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES: Well, you know, we first have to consider that these job estimates are taken from two separate different surveys. The unemployment rate is taken from a household survey. The count of jobs, number of jobs is taken from a survey of employers.</p><p>That being said, you know, one of the defining characteristics of this recession has been the record length of unemployment. So while fewer people are losing their jobs -- and we pick that up from the recent decline if first time jobless claims -- we still find that the number of people that are out of work or collecting state unemployment benefits continues to grow. This is a recession where it was very damaging to have lost your job because of the unusually long period of time it's taken to secure new employment if you are that lucky.</p><p>GLICK: All right.</p><p>Let me go to Congressman Sestak.</p><p>Are you surprised by the numbers?</p><p>REP. JOE SESTAK (D), PENNSYLVANIA: Actually, I am. I had expected them to be in the low 500,000s. In fact, when we ran the models several months ago, if we had gotten to the low 500,000s or just below it by July, we would have assumed everything was going according to script -- still intense, but not intensifying. What this data shows is that as compared to past recessions, employers laid off employees much more rapidly when you look at the data, which means that this stopping of the cratering of our economy may come to a halt a bit more rapidly.</p><p>I had expected unemployment to be about 9.2 percent. And he is right, overall, people who don't have any jobs and aren't seeking is about 16 percent. But think about what else is now happening.</p><p>The yields in the financial market have really come down. We also see that the housing market is beginning to see the bottom of housing prices falling. We also are seeing here that consumer spending is actually beginning to increase as the rebates come back.</p><p>In fact, if you compare May of this year, when our rebates came out from the stimulus bill, to a year ago, it's hard to compare, because remember, Alexis, a year ago in May, we also had a stimulus bill. But when you see the two, comparison, it appears as though consumer confidence is beginning to come back. We'll get to about 10 percent unemployment by the end of the year, but I don't think we're going to go above it, and then we're out of here, as Mr. Bernanke pointed out recently, and our economy begins to go again.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Roger, you are an outsourcing firm. You deal with part- time and full-time workforce. Have you been seeing improving trends, or is this data a surprise to you?</p><p>ROGER BALLOU, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CDI: Actually, this data is confirmatory of what we have been seeing throughout our business, our MRINetwork offices across he country and our CDI professional staffing organizations, where, if you look at it, there have been a lot of bright areas in the economy in spite of the losses of jobs.</p><p>For example, rural economies have continued to perform better than urban economies, where they are driven by more commodities, agriculture, things like that. Secondly, the service sector, if you look at health care, has actually been experiencing growth through this.</p><p>We saw what appeared to be the beginning of the end of the recession at the end of the first quarter in our numbers. We saw it confirmed in April. We see it confirmed again here in May.</p><p>So what we're seeing in this national data is confirmation of what our MRINetwork offices and our professional organizations that we serve have been seeing over the last two or three months. So the actual exact number I couldn't have predicted, but we did predict that it was beginning of the end of the recession occurring in this last part of the first quarter, first part of the second quarter.</p><p>GLICK: Gentlemen, I want to bring up for just a moment what the market is doing in reaction to this, because the market is reacting pretty favorably -- that would be putting it lightly -- to this news.</p><p>The market was up about 40 beforehand. The Dow now up 135 points. So we're up 1.5 percent. The S&amp;P right now is up 1.7 percent and Nasdaq up a percent. So we've rallied a full one percent in reaction to this.</p><p>Two points.</p><p>Congressman Sestak, let me first start with you on the president's fiscal stimulus package. He has tried to demonstrate in several speeches recently that the fiscal stimulus is starting to work its way into the economy. Money is being spent. I think he recently said about 100,000 jobs have been saved or created.</p><p>Is this proof in the pudding that in fact it is starting to work, and it was the necessary fuel that we needed to get everybody off the sidelines?</p><p>SESTAK: Yes, I believe it was one of the necessary tools. We also have to give a lot of credit to the TARP program and the TALF program, the second one, as you well know, to the Federal Reserve, because they have gotten the mother milk of our economy, credit, flowing again. And so there's a lot more confidence in the markets also.</p><p>But without a doubt, this economic stimulus bill intended to get money out there so people would spend it. A lot of it on retailing has started to work. Now what you are going to see is later this year, the construction money -- only about six percent of it has been spent thus far -- is really going to kick in just as the recession seems to be coming to a halt and is ready to come up. I think it's been well played.</p><p>GLICK: You know, John, it's interesting. I was speaking to Jim Rohr, the chairman and CEO of PNC, and the other day he said, \"Alexis, one of the greatest stimulus in this economy has been what the Fed has done because those who have been able to refinance on average has saved about $300 on monthly payments.\"</p><p>I wonder, is that stimulus generated by refi activity enough to offset the fact that as we sit here right now, oil is breaking above $70 a barrel, it's at a seven-month high, and so what was perceived as a tax credit because of declining gasoline and oil prices is now going to be a tax on consumers?</p><p>LONSKI: You know, we have to keep our eye on energy prices, but I believe that when consumers look at energy prices, they take a longer-term view. And they didn't believe that oil was going to stay at $40 to $50 per gallon.</p><p>Consumer spending proceeds on the assumption the price of crude oil will be in a range of $60 to $70 per barrel. So we are hitting the upper end of this range beyond which consumer spending might indeed suffer. And so it would behoove the administration to take any action necessary to prevent a replay of what happened in the first half of 2008, when the price of crude oil soared up to nearly $150 per barrel. If that happens again, then the wait for the next economic recovery will be longer than we currently anticipate.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>I mean, Roger, there's a lot of confluences of events right now that are beginning to signal that perhaps the global economy is starting to heal. The concern is -- and John brings up some great points -- is that inflation, things of that nature become a bigger concern and act as a tax on consumers or cause interest rates to rise.</p><p>What impact, if any, will all this have on the corporations that you talk to on a daily basis who are looking to slowly but surely begin to bring new employees into the fold?</p><p>BALLOU: Well, I think two things.</p><p>Congressman Sestak commented earlier that -- I think what you saw this time is a steeper quicker reduction in employment and inventories than we have ever seen before. I think that the information systems companies now used to control their inventories and their production capacity led them to react much, much more quickly. What I think that's going to lead to is a slower sustained recovery coming out of this, so it's going to be like a reverse hockey stick, where you saw a quicker downtick, but a gradual uptick that will come.</p><p>I also agree that I think the financial programs are the key driver of the uptick here. I don't think that much of the stimulus has kicked in yet, so I suspect that the bigger stimulus effect here has been the credit markets opening up, and that leading to enhanced consumer confidence and business confidence.</p><p>The other thing that's gone on is the global economy, where you see the Indian economy continuing to grow very, very strongly. You see the Chinese economy in resurgence based on their stimulus programs. So I think those things are contributing significantly to the uptick as well.</p><p>So, it is an interconnected global economy. In our case, I think the financial programs have been very, very critical to it. I also think the president himself has been instilling confidence through his communication, through his demeanor, through the programs that he's launched. And this is a very -- you know, people's psyches are fragile, but they also can move in a positive direction, very, very quickly, and I think you are beginning to see that occurring.</p><p>GLICK: Congressman Sestak, I'm going to give you the last word.</p><p>One of the things about the data shows that number of hours worked have dropped. Productivity, as we just saw yesterday, is rising.</p><p>One material concern out there is that we will see declining wages, that we've seen declining wages, but that it will be a bigger issue that the consumer will still remain fairly tapped out. And because we've figured out how to accomplish more with less workers, that some of those jobs may not come back.</p><p>How important is it to find those future jobs that will perhaps replace a lot of the millions of jobs of the six million that we have seen since the recession began?</p><p>SESTAK: This is an excellent point you make.</p><p>We have lost about a trillion dollars in our GDP as compared to our 2007 GDP high peak. And if we just have an economy, as was just mentioned, that grows slowly, and let's just say it grows at 2.5 percent, which was the average between 2001 and 2007, it will take us three years to soak up that $1 trillion of lost GDP capacity. Which means if we don't grow more rapidly, we won't be creating these jobs that you spoke about. </p><p>That's why the president's budget is absolutely critical. If he is -- and I believe he is -- intent upon in succeeding in retooling the economy in the types of jobs, the green energy jobs, the ability to reform our health care system, those parts of this budget will be absolutely critical.</p><p>Second, I go back that we have to do more in the entrepreneur incentives by the right tax incentives to get that extra bump to our economy above 2.5 percent growth in the next few years to come, or we won't create those jobs.</p><p>GLICK: Right. Good point.</p><p>SESTAK: Because China is growing this year 6.8 percent as we lose about five or six percent. So that's why this is important, your point.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys. We are going to leave it there. Terrific, terrific discussion.</p><p>I'm glad to see we've seen some relief in the numbers, but remember still a lot of people unemployed in this economy.</p><p>Congressman Sestak, Roger and John, thank you so much, gentlemen.</p><p>SESTAK: Thank you for having me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: A reminder, by the way please join me, 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time. I will be speaking to the labor secretary, Hilda Solis, in a \"First on Fox\" interview here to break down this May employment number. So please tune in for that. We'll get an opportunity to get her thoughts in just about 45 minutes.</p><p>All right. Coming up, more jobs lost. We're talking to students just entering the working world about their hunt for employment.</p><p>And of course we will head live to the New York Stock Exchange for a little bit of a preview on what is now a market that's looking pretty good.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: All week we have been taking a look at the nation's growing deficit as a result of government spending as something we called red ink. Now, MONEY FOR BREAKFAST teamed up with the college news service U-Wire to take a closer look at Generation Debt, the students of America who will inherit the current deficit</p><p>Some of those students told us the financial worries that are keeping them -- frankly, they're keeping them up at night. Take a listen to what they had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My biggest financial concern is just to find a job after I graduate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm more worried about people my parents' age who have just seen their retirement funds completely be gone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My parents' businesses since December, like, their sales have been halved. And that kind of really affects me because I'm in school now. I can't help them out. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My personal biggest financial concern is just being able to live the life that we're expected to live as -- you know, again since I came from a background where my parents didn't necessarily have a lot of money, I think there was a big expectation for me coming to college and getting the job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: Well, as you heard, some of the students we spoke to say finding a job is their top worry. With roughly 1.5 million graduating seniors entering the workforce this year and a loss of another 500,000 -- well, now actually we have seen 350,000 jobs in May, according to the most recent survey -- what will they do? And is now the time to figure out other options?</p><p>Joining us right now, Emily Sutherland, who is heading into her senior year at Colorado State; Leah Finnegan, who graduated from the University of Texas this year; and Dean Van Tassell, who received his MBA from Pace University just two weeks ago.</p><p>Good morning, guys. Good to see you.</p><p>LEAH FINNEGAN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS GRADUATE: Good morning.</p><p>DEAN VAN TASSELL, RECEIVED MBA FROM PACE UNIVERSITY: Good morning.</p><p>EMILY SUTHERLAND, HEADING INTO SENIOR YEAR AT COLORADO STATE: Good morning.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Dean. Let me talk to you.</p><p>You just graduated two weeks ago from Pace University. You have been on the job hunt. What have you been experiencing?</p><p>VAN TASSELL: Well, first of all, thank you for having me on the program. And BB&amp;T Capital Markets loves Fox Business.</p><p>GLICK: Oh, that's good to know. Thanks.</p><p>VAN TASSELL: I have been applying to, let's see now, about 70 different investment banks, writing the HR departments, following with managing directors, trying to get my name out there as much as possible. I have a nice stack of rejection letters right now, so it's rough out there.</p><p>You know, you have to start making contingency plans. And it's -- you know, we're up to 9.4 percent. The only solace I have is that maybe the 9.4 percent unemployment is backwards looking, and the market seems to be shrugging it off today. So hopefully we will have second derivative fever and things will start to level out and pick up relatively soon.</p><p>GLICK: Leah, you just graduated from the University of Texas. You have a BA in American studies.</p><p>What kind of jobs have you been looking for?</p><p>FINNEGAN: I'm actually going into journalism, which is, you know, quite an experience at this time. And I applied to about 20 jobs, and I heard \"No\" from about five. And then I just didn't hear from the rest of them. So it's kind of like applying to a black hole.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, radio silence.</p><p>So what did you decide to do when you just weren't getting back any responses or you were just getting rejection notes without even, as I understand, getting an opportunity to even interview?</p><p>FINNEGAN: Well, my contingency plan was grad school, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go, and kind of applied on the lark and ended up getting into grad school and not getting into any jobs. So grad school it is.</p><p>GLICK: So you're going to Columbia?</p><p>FINNEGAN: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: My alma mater.</p><p>FINNEGAN: Oh, OK.</p><p>GLICK: Very excited. OK.</p><p>Now Emily, let me talk to you. I understand you are majoring in communications. You are going to be a senior this year at Colorado State. </p><p>When you listen to what's happening to Dean and Leah and I'm sure a lot of your other classmates, how is that impacting you? How nervous does it make you knowing that you are going into your senior year of college?</p><p>SUTHERLAND: Well, it makes me really nervous, of course. A lot of my friends have graduated. A lot of them have resulted in working at Starbucks and their degree has gotten them absolutely nowhere. So I just hope that things pick up so I actually do have job opportunities out there once I graduate.</p><p>GLICK: Dean, you smiled there. I mean, how many of your friends and colleagues have had to do that? Like, you might have had aspirations of working on Wall Street or working in a particular sector, but there's no opportunities and you have to get what you can get.</p><p>VAN TASSELL: I know a lot of people who would be lucky to get a job at Starbucks. It's hard.</p><p>I will probably have to go back to bartending for a little bit, but it seem just as competitive as Wall Street, if not more. You have a lot of people laid off and in the same position I'm in, so a lot of people just don't have any options, even contingency plans.</p><p>The number one thing I hear is there's a lot of government jobs out there, but the mentality of, I want to work on Wall Street, I'm very aggressive, I want to be in the financial markets than going into a government job, it's a bit different from what you have expected might be around after you graduate. So...</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>And Leah, how many other classmates of yours have said they are going to choose to continue to go back to school because that's really the only and best option?</p><p>FINNEGAN: A really good number. It is a very popular option right now. And I don't know, I'm kind of finding the whole experience a bit freeing, and I think a lot of people my peers are as well, that now we have this time right now to kind of relax and discover what we really want to do.</p><p>GLICK: Good point.</p><p>FINNEGAN: and then we have the rest of our lives to do it. So there's not so much pressure to be successful and make more than $100,000 right out of college.</p><p>GLICK: Great point.</p><p>I wish you all the best success. Leah, Dean and Emily, thank you guys so much.</p><p>VAN TASSELL: Thank you.</p><p>FINNEGAN: Thank you.</p><p>SUTHERLAND: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys. We're going to take a break. We will be right back with \"THE OPENING BELL\" in just a moment. We're just about five minutes away.</p><p>All right. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: All right. Welcome back. It's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>Connell, you were watching actually the bond market reaction to the jobs data. What did you see happen?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, a big move up in yields, which is really going to be the story that we're going to have to follow very, very closely, Alexis, when you think about it.</p><p>And Charles, you and I talked about this, the idea that hey, maybe the economy has bottomed out and things are starting to look better, but what about rising yields, rising mortgage rates, and other things? And does that cut off the recovery?</p><p>GLICK: It could be a tough bear market for the bonds.</p><p>PAYNE: Absolutely. And also, I was looking at equities. I thought the Dow and this type of number would be up 200, 300 points. I'm serious. I think we have a conflict here with the unemployment number being 9.4.</p><p>GLICK: I agree.</p><p>PAYNE: Two separate surveys -- the Household Survey saying, listen, it's tough, it's tougher than the way the businesses maybe are looking at it.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. You've got to wonder why the divergence.</p><p>And speaking of which, actually, I'm going to talk to Labor Secretary Hilda Solis coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time. So tune in. She will he' be joining us \"First on Fox.\"</p><p>All right, guys. We'll be right back.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

He also offered a primer on Chubb's InsurTech perspectives, strategy and progress.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: How was this year's ITC event?</emphasis></p><p>Ringsted: The event was excellent. The agenda covered the use of technology by every corner of the insurance industry and provided the opportunity for an intense few days of meetings by the Chubb team with existing and potential InsurTech partners. This was helped by a record attendance, ranging from small startups to Big Tech such as Microsoft and Google. This year, there was also a greater emphasis on using technology to improve the customer experience.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: What did you learn from it?</emphasis></p><p>Ringsted: As expected, there was a great deal of focus on technology and innovation at ITC, and the industry's use of the latest capabilities in AI, data analytics, machine learning, robotics, IoT, etc. Listening to the discussions and the potential for tech-driven change, I believe we are all still working with the same core set of insurance business principles that have stood the test of time, namely disciplined underwriting and keeping our promise to pay claims. Technology is helping to make welcome changes in the customer experience, including the ability to buy and service their policies as well as assist insurers with their decision-making and operations. However, we need to remain focused on our fundamentals and not lose sight of the importance of the human touch with our customers, especially in time of need. I saw a greater recognition of the need for this balance between tech and the human touch at this year's ITC .</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: Why were you there?</emphasis></p><p>Ringsted: For Chubb, ITC offers a great opportunity to network, deepen existing relationships with partners and vendors, explore new partnership opportunities, understand the competitive landscape and learn about new market and technology trends. Aside from the structured sessions and meetings, I found equally valuable the corridor discussions and introductions that would otherwise take months to replicate. I also really enjoy setting aside time to meet with the \"grassroots\" InsurTechs, which always provides a fresh and energetic view on the underlying pulse of the entrepreneurs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: How goes Chubb's innovation evolution?</emphasis></p><p>Ringsted: We have a clear strategy to lead and thrive in the Digital Age and continue to execute on those objectives. Our efforts are in three areas-doing the simple things smarter in our operations, the use of data analytics to improve claims and underwriting decision making and digitizing our product, services and the overall customer experience.</p><p>We are becoming an increasingly digitally integrated organization by investing $1 billion annually on new innovation and improving legacy technology to provide anytime, anywhere access and processing, as well as new front-end capabilities including improved customer experience and an expanding ecosystem of digital distribution partners. Chubb's global scale provides us access to new markets, ideas and capabilities which is allowing us to sign major distribution partnership agreements, digitally enhance the customer experience and reimagine our product offering.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: Where do you see the InsurTech innovation landscape in five years?</emphasis></p><p>Ringsted: InsurTech is here to stay. Today we are focused on what is most visible right in front of us, such as improving the customer experience on the front end and better use of data analytics to improve decision making and operational effectiveness. The industry of tomorrow will need to meet a growing demand for new products and services. Insurance will need new products to help address secular challenges such as healthcare, ageing, urbanization, and climate change. New industries are emerging with new insurance needs such as the gig economy, mobility and shared workspaces. InsurTech will provide collaboration opportunities and competition, both welcome, for the industry as it solves its old challenges and rises to meet the new.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: What's the easiest thing for carriers seeking to incorporate innovation into their routines?</emphasis></p><p>Ringsted: It's important to have clarity and a sense of business purpose. Innovation spawned in a vacuum will have a harder chance to succeed and provide true business impact. Not every bet will succeed and that it is about learning fast (not failing fast) and adapting quickly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: What's the biggest challenge for carriers seeking to incorporate innovation into their routines?</emphasis></p><p>Ringsted: Building solutions for each partner can be time, resource and cost intensive. Patience is required.</p><p>In our plans, we factor in the time spent with partners, negotiating with vendors and contractually agreeing to intellectual property rights, data ownership, handling of breaches, etc. to stand up new digital products and services. Issues are not new nor are they a result of innovation occurring in the insurance space. Existing laws and regulations on insurance product and also around privacy, IP, data protection, data localization, etc. must be complied with regardless of the technology or platform utilized.</p><p>A trustworthy, longstanding carrier brand like Chubb underscores the importance of the \"last mile\" execution to ensure that quality, trust and security are incorporated into the innovation collaboration with InsurTech.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: Are carriers keeping up with InsurTech changes?</emphasis></p><p>Ringsted: Speaking from a Chubb perspective, I believe we are keeping up. We retain a focus on our business objectives that allows us to filter through to the companies that can potentially provide material benefit to us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: If carriers need to approach InsurTech innovation differently, what should they do?</emphasis></p><p>Ringsted: The InsurTech industry is both vibrant and broad in terms of opportunity. Clearly there is a balance to be had-the \"Goldilocks conundrum.\" Those companies that are not engaged with InsurTech are likely to be missing out. At the same time, those companies that are heavily engaged across the sector need to be sure that the effort matches the business benefit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRMNGT-cm199238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRMNGT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB3-SGT1-DY07-D003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465779</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1129\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Wells Media Group, Inc.

Not for the alleged problems Franken outlines, but the \"Big Brother\" government remedies he proposes.</p><p>Franken warns of the \"outsized role that the major tech companies\" \u2013 primarily Google, Facebook and Twitter \u2013 \"play in so many aspects of our lives.\" He goes on to accuse these companies of failing \"to take commonsense precautions to prevent the spread of propaganda, misinformation, and hate speech.\"</p><p> Of course, by \"commonsense precautions\" Franken is really proposing government-sanctioned, if not imposed, censorship. And what Franken personally considers to be propaganda, misinformation and hate speech might very well not be considered such by others.</p><p> As the old saying goes, one man's trash is another man's treasure.</p><p> Indeed, in reading Franken's manifesto I came to conclusion that it, itself, is government propaganda by a government official that is filled with misinformation.</p><p> For example, Franken claims it's \"alarming\" that these three tech companies \"have unprecedented power to guide Americans' access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism.\"</p><p> You mean like the unprecedented power ABC, NBC and CBS had on television before the advent of cable TV?</p><p> \"(A)s the wealth of information available on the internet has grown,\" Franken wrote, \"big tech has taken it upon itself to sort through all the viewpoints, news, and entertainment, and decide for us what we should read, watch, buy, or even how we should engage in civil society.\"</p><p> For decades the Big Three television networks took it upon themselves to sort through all the viewpoints, news, and entertainment and decide for us what we should watch.</p><p> But now, thanks to the very technology Franken seeks to regulate and censor, Americans have thousands upon thousands of options and alternatives which the people themselves sort through and determine for themselves what viewpoints, news and entertainment they choose to read, watch or listen to.</p><p> Why would anyone ever want the government to take that away from us?</p><p> In conclusion, Franken asks, \"What role should these companies play in our lives?\"</p><p> Wrong question. The real question is what role the GOVERNMENT should play in our lives.</p><p> Thank you very much, but I can decide for myself what role Google, Facebook and Twitter play in my life. And I have no interest whatsoever in returning to the Stone Age days when the Big Three TV networks decided what I should watch.</p><p> Mr. Franken is free to make suggestions and recommendations as to what I should read, watch, or listen to.

His wise words raise an even more profound point, especially considering the recent returns of plastic waste from Indonesia.</p><p>Why isn't Australia funding research into recycling generally?

Over the three years or so Mr. Mzengeza has held the stock in the CIBC Global Technology fund, the company has gone from a peripheral e-commerce startup to one of the country's largest public companies, with the share price rising nearly tenfold.</p><p>And it's still early days for Shopify, Mr. Mzengeza said, suggesting he expects the holding to continue driving excess returns.</p><p>The CIBC Global Technology fund was recently recognized for industry-best performance by the Lipper Fund Awards, which ranks Canadian portfolio managers across several different categories.</p><p>In the global equity category, the CIBC fund's average annual return of 19.8 per cent over the past three years outperformed all peers. Mr. Mzengeza spoke to The Globe and Mail about how he goes about beating the market.</p><p>What is your approach with this fund?</p><p>We try to invest early in the lifecycle of secular themes. Right now we're looking at 5G, AI, machine learning, cloud, payments and e-commerce. And we try to find those names which are not as well followed.</p><p>Do you avoid the FAANG stocks?</p><p>We're staying away from Facebook and Alphabet, not just because of valuation, but because of regulatory risk around the business model.</p><p>Are you worried about another tech stock bubble?</p><p>The fundamental strength of these businesses is better than the last time around. They generate free cash flow, they generate profit, they're continuously growing. Valuations may be stretched, so we have allocated more towards health care, where there is more of a value tilt. And we've raised some cash that we can deploy if there is a sell-off.</p><p>Is Shopify's valuation stretched?</p><p>Right now, $183-billion of commerce goes through the Shopify platform. And their revenue is only $1.6-billion. Can they take a bigger share of that revenue base? I believe that they can. We're still at the very early stages of e-commerce penetration. As a good analogy, if you put $1,000 in Amazon when it IPO'd 25 years ago, that would be worth more than $1-million.</p><p>Amazon went public early on in its evolution. With startups staying private for longer, is it more challenging to tap into the earlier stages of a company's growth?</p><p>That has made it challenging. Some of the companies we would have wanted to invest in at an earlier stage, like Uber or Lyft, we haven't been able to do that. But we're still seeing plenty of early-stage companies. We've participated in a few IPOs this year, including Zoom Video Communications and PagerDuty. Both of those performed pretty well out of the gate. And we sold out when valuations became a bit stretched.</p><p>Any other Canadian names in the fund besides Shopify?</p><p>You have better opportunities outside Canada. If you're looking for a leading company within a sector, I struggle to find any other companies within Canada beyond Shopify.</p><p>The fund seems to have a heavy weighting in payment technology.</p><p>Fiserv and Global Payments are unique opportunities because of the fact that the payment industry is going through consolidation. Fiserv bought First Data and Global Payments bought TSYS and we think there's an opportunity for outsized synergies from both those acquisitions. As for Mastercard, we own it because of the fact they're moving from from cash and cheques to digital payments. And Mastercard has done a good job of outgrowing Visa.</p><p>How are you navigating the AI space?</p><p>We're in the phase when people are building up the infrastructure that's going to enable AI. If you think about this as a gold rush, we want to be with the people who are supplying the picks and axes and not the people who are actually getting the gold out of the ground. Our main investment in AI is Nvidia, which makes their GPUs available for AI and machine learning, and they're a leader in that segment.</p><p>Any other big tech themes you like right now?</p><p>We have a position in IAC, which owns about 80 per cent of Match. It's going to spin out that investment. And we think Match as an asset is undervalued. It owns the likes of Tinder, Hinge and a lot of other online dating websites. Another one is gaming. We hold Activision Blizzard, which owns the Overwatch League. Our other big investment in the space is Tencent, which is one of the biggest video game developers in the world. They own League of Legends and they own part of Epic Games, which owns Fortnite. The younger generation is more interested in spending their downtime playing video games, but also interacting with their friends through that medium.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-cibc-global-technology-fund-manager-discusses-his-vision-for-beating/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-cibc-global-technology-fund-manager-discusses-his-vision-for-beating/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20191105ellipsis_BBVYU7H56VA2PNNJ3K26SOUEQM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH7-D691-F072-J48D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><timeReceived>GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 4 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 00:01: Unparseable date: \"00:01\" GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Over the three years or so Mr. Mzengeza has held the stock in the CIBC Global Technology fund, the company has gone from a peripheral e-commerce startup to one of the country's largest public companies, with the share price rising nearly tenfold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it's still early days for Shopify, Mr. Mzengeza said, suggesting he expects the holding to continue driving excess returns.</p><p>The CIBC Global Technology fund was recently recognized for industry-best performance by the Lipper Fund Awards, which ranks Canadian portfolio managers across several different categories.</p><p>In the global equity category, the CIBC fund's average annual return of 19.8 per cent over the past three years outperformed all peers. Mr. Mzengeza spoke to The Globe and Mail about how he goes about beating the market.</p><p>What is your approach with this fund?</p><p>We try to invest early in the life cycle of secular themes. Right now we're looking at 5G, AI, machine learning, cloud, payments and ecommerce. And we try to find those names which are not as well followed.</p><p>Do you avoid the FAANG stocks?</p><p>We're staying away from Facebook and Alphabet, not just because of valuation, but because of regulatory risk around the business model.</p><p>Are you worried about another tech stock bubble?</p><p>The fundamental strength of these businesses is better than the last time around. They generate free cash flow, they generate profit, they're continuously growing. Valuations may be stretched, so we have allocated more towards health care, where there is more of a value tilt. And we've raised some cash that we can deploy if there is a sell-off.</p><p>Is Shopify's valuation stretched?</p><p>Right now, $183-billion of commerce goes through the Shopify platform. And their revenue is only $1.6-billion. Can they take a bigger share of that revenue base? I believe that they can. We're still at the very early stages of e-commerce penetration. As a good analogy, if you put $1,000 in Amazon when it IPO'd 25 years ago, that would be worth more than $1-million.</p><p>Amazon went public early on in its evolution. With startups staying private for longer, is it more challenging to tap into the earlier stages of a company's growth?</p><p>That has made it challenging.</p><p>Some of the companies we would have wanted to invest in at an earlier stage, like Uber or Lyft, we haven't been able to do that. But we're still seeing plenty of earlystage companies. We've participated in a few IPOs this year, including Zoom Video Communications and PagerDuty. Both of those performed pretty well out of the gate. And we sold out when valuations became a bit stretched.</p><p>Any other Canadian names in the fund besides Shopify?</p><p>You have better opportunities outside Canada. If you're looking for a leading company within a sector, I struggle to find any other companies within Canada beyond Shopify.</p><p>The fund seems to have a heavy weighting in payment technology.</p><p>Fiserv and Global Payments are unique opportunities because of the fact that the payment industry is going through consolidation. Fiserv bought First Data and Global Payments bought TSYS and we think there's an opportunity for outsized synergies from both those acquisitions. As for Mastercard, we own it because of the fact they're moving from from cash and cheques to digital payments. And Mastercard has done a good job of outgrowing Visa.</p><p>How are you navigating the AI space?</p><p>We're in the phase when people are building up the infrastructure that's going to enable AI. If you think about this as a gold rush, we want to be with the people who are supplying the picks and axes and not the people who are actually getting the gold out of the ground. Our main investment in AI is Nvidia, which makes their GPUs available for AI and machine learning, and they're a leader in that segment.</p><p>Any other big tech themes you like right now?</p><p>We have a position in IAC, which owns about 80 per cent of Match.</p><p>It's going to spin out that investment. And we think Match as an asset is undervalued. It owns the likes of Tinder, Hinge and a lot of other online dating websites. Another one is gaming. We hold Activision Blizzard, which owns the Overwatch League. Our other big investment in the space is Tencent, which is one of the biggest video-game developers in the world. They own League of Legends and they own part of Epic Games, which owns Fortnite. The younger generation is more interested in spending their downtime playing video games, but also interacting with their friends through that medium.</p><p>For a full list of the 2019 Lipper Fund mutual fund and ETF winners: tgam.ca/lipper-fundwinners For a list of the 2019 Lipper group winners: tgam.ca/lippergroup-winners</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20191115rbgilippermzengeza</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH8-2W41-JCRP-C078-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, is expected to be far reaching and comes at a moment when Democrats and Republicans find themselves in rare alignment on the idea that the tech industry has been too unregulated for too long. The sentiment spurred a sharp sell-off in tech stocks to start the week.</p><p>Cicilline told reporters the investigation won\u2019t target one specific tech company, but rather focus on the broad belief that the \u201cinternet is broken.\u201d He pointed out problematic practices at</p><p>tech giants such as Google, which has faced sanctions in Europe for prioritizing its services over rivals\u2019 in searches, and Facebook, which he criticized for cloning and acquiring competitors to ensure its continued dominance in social networking.</p><p>Amazon and Apple also could figure into the committee\u2019s early plans, he said, noting that the goal is a broader look at the industry.</p><p>\u201cIn a lot of ways, there was a reluctance in the early days of the Internet to interfere,\u201d the Democratic lawmaker said. \u201cIt was creating so much value in the lives of people that [some felt] you should get out of the way and allow it to flourish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver time,\u201d Cicilline said, \u201cpeople have recognized there are some real dangers here.\u201d</p><p>Cicilline said Democrats would hold hearings, seek documents \\x97 by subpoena, if necessary \\x97 and depose witnesses that could include the leaders of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest companies, who might also be asked to testify publicly. His office said that tech companies, for all their innovations, had created \u201cescalating crises,\u201d from eroding Americans\u2019 privacy rights to choking off ad revenue from cash-strapped local news outlets.</p><p>In recent days, the Trump administration has signaled that it, too, has set its sights on Silicon Valley, taking early steps to divvy up future competition oversight of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The efforts by the U.S. government\u2019s two antitrust enforcement agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, could pave the way for more formal probes of each company\u2019s practices, though the agencies\u2019 exact interests aren\u2019t known.</p><p>Still, the early efforts won support even among Democratic presidential candidates, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who long has called for breaking up big tech. Over the weekend, congressional Republicans also praised the Trump administration for turning its attention to the industry. \u201cThis is very big news, and overdue,\u201d tweeted Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.</p><p>Amazon, Apple and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment, and Google declined comment. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The broad, bipartisan focus on Silicon Valley presents the whole of the tech industry with what could be its greatest political test after years of enjoying relatively smooth sailing in the nation\u2019s capital. Even when world regulators had sought to challenge these companies\u2019 business practices \\x97 Europe has fined Google $9 billion in just the last three years, for example \\x97 Washington had remained a staunch ally of Facebook, Google and their peers.</p><p>The 2016 election, however, began to erode that political goodwill, as members of Congress began to realize the extent to which malicious actors could capitalize on social networks with vast, perhaps unchallenged reach to spread falsehoods in real time. A flood of privacy violations, particularly at Facebook, further reinforced for some lawmakers the feeling that big tech giants had enriched themselves on their users\u2019 personal information \\x97 and left people with little option for alternative services to use.</p><p>\u201cFor a while, tech could do no wrong. They were the font of all innovation, and good things, and progress and democracy,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that counts Apple and Microsoft on its board of directors. \u201cAnd now the bloom is off the rose.\u201d</p><p>Atkinson, however, emphasized that the industry had produced some of consumers\u2019 most well-liked services, from Facebook\u2019s messaging apps to Amazon\u2019s lightning-fast delivery of goods that previously had taken weeks. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why this is such a hard sell,\u201d he said. \u201cMost consumers just don\u2019t see a problem.\u201d</p><p>On Monday, Cicilline called it a \u201cmonopoly moment\u201d for the tech industry, likening his committee\u2019s investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and their tech peers to past congressional probes of airlines and phone providers, each of which resulted in a fine-tuning of the nation\u2019s antitrust laws. Over the next 18 months, he said, the House Judiciary Committee and its top antitrust panel would focus their review on crafting their own recommendations.</p><p>\u201cThe open Internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online,\u201d said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the full Judiciary Committee. \u201cBut there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications.\u201d</p><p>This fresh antitrust scrutiny helped drive down tech stocks Monday. Facebook stock was down more than 7%, Google fell by 6%, Amazon dropped 4% and Apple 1%, a small loss that came on the same day the iPhone giant unveiled a slew of new software updates at its annual developer conference.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>WASHINGTON</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>WASHINGTON \\x97 House Democrats plan a sweeping review of Facebook, Google and other technology giants to determine whether they\u2019ve become so large and powerful that they stifle competition and harm consumers, marking a new, unprecedented antitrust threat for an industry that\u2019s increasingly under siege by Congress, the White House and 2020 presidential candidates.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>The probe, announced Monday by Rep.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., is poised to introduce legislation that would allow publishers to join together to negotiate collectively with online platforms like Facebook and Google.</p><p>A spokesman confirmed Cicilline\u2019s plan for introducing legislation, which was also announced in an Op-Ed piece in The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The proposed law would amend anti-trust laws to create a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for publishers, allowing them to collaborate in their negotiations with big tech platforms, according to the News Media Alliance, which represents almost 2,000 news organizations.</p><p>The alliance says that by joining together, news publishers can gain leverage they need and recapture advertising revenue that they deserve.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that the money generated by news audiences is flowing primarily to Google and Facebook, and not to the reporters and publishers who produce excellent journalism,\u201d the Alliance\u2019s president, David Chavern, wrote in the editorial.</p><p>Calling Google and Facebook a \u201cDuopoly,\u201d the News Alliance asserts that the two online Goliaths are capturing 83 percent of all digital advertising revenue growth and 73 percent of all U.S. digital advertising.</p><p>The Alliance warns that fake news, especially in small communities, could overcome the flow of information without the presence of trusted news sources.</p><p>A spokesman for Cicilline, Richard Luchette, said that Cicilline is expected to introduce the legislation next week, possibly as soon as Tuesday.</p><p>He said he was unable to provide a copy of the bill\u2019s text, but the name of the legislation is the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act.</p><p>It\u2019s not clear how the law will define a news publisher.</p><p>\u201cThis bill will create a limited, well-tailored safe harbor to allow news publishers to negotiate a better deal with a dominant platform,\u201d Luchette said.</p><p>Chavern writes that governments in other countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and South Korea, are recognizing \u201cthe danger\u201d of Facebook and Google serving as \u201cprimary and defacto regulators of the news business.\u201d</p><p>In 2017, the Pew Research Center reported that two-thirds of adults were getting news through social media.</p><p>\u201cA free and open press, particularly local press, is essential to our vibrant and healthy democracy,\u201d said Cicilline\u2019s spokesman. \u201cBut today, the control of information online \\x97 including the pathways for working Americans to access trustworthy news, commerce, and content \\x97 has become increasingly centralized among just a few online platforms with significant and durable power.\u201d</p><p>Representatives of both Google and Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Default No
