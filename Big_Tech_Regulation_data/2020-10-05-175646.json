David Cicilline.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But when Cicilline asked Pichai to explicitly  rule out launching a tool for surveillance and censorship in China,  the Google executive demurred.  We always think it s in our duty to explore possibilities to give users access to information,  Pichai said.</p><p>The exchange highlights the delicate balancing act that Google has been forced to perform since an August <url normalizedValue=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/\"> report </url> from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Intercept </emphasis>revealed the existence of Project Dragonfly, the tech giant s prototype for a search app that complies with China s repressive online censorship and surveillance practices. Though Pichai was excruciatingly circumspect in his responses Tuesday, the final takeaway was clear eight years after quitting China over the country s human-rights violations, Google is looking to reap billions in ad revenue by bringing its search service back to the world s largest marketplace.</p><p>But as Washington gears up for a wider conflict with both China and Silicon Valley, lawmakers are warning Google of serious consequences should it kowtow to the Chinese government s demands. The company is already fending off an employee uprising over Project Dragonfly, and may struggle to weather any slings and arrows lobbed from Washington.</p><p>Some lawmakers are urging the company to back off or face blowback.  They will be enhancing the ability of the government to crack down on dissidents, crack down on free speech, crack down on human rights,  Cicilline told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis>.  And it is completely inconsistent with the stated values of this company; it is inconsistent with American values. So I think we have to do everything we can to prevent them from doing it. </p><p>Congress doesn t have the best track record for following through on threats levied against powerful tech firms. But in this case, experts believe Washington has several tools at its disposal to punish Google, should it move forward with Project Dragonfly. </p><p>As anti-tech sentiment rises, legislation requiring a company s foreign partners to respect online freedom could find a firmer footing than it has in the past. Concerns about Chinese espionage and theft of intellectual property have prompted a review of U.S. export controls, with potentially disastrous consequences for Google s other Chinese operations. And as Congress mulls new rules on privacy and considers rolling back big tech s liability protections, anything that angers lawmakers could come back to bite Google down the line. </p><p>Project Dragonfly is  certainly not going to help the perception of Google as a responsible, or not-so-responsible, actor on the Hill,  said Cynthia Wong, the senior internet researcher at Human Rights Watch.</p><p>While the exact contours of Project Dragonfly remain sketchy, leaks from disgruntled Google employees some of whom have resigned in protest over the project indicate that it s being designed to conform with some of the Chinese government s most repressive practices. Phrases such as  human rights,   student protest,  and  Nobel prize  are reportedly blacklisted, as are derogatory phrases about Xi Jinping and other top officials of the Chinese Communist Party. </p><p>Perhaps more troubling, reports from current and former Google employees indicate that the app could allow Chinese officials to track an individual s searches, further expanding the government s surveillance powers. On Tuesday, lawmakers were unable to pin down Pichai on whether the prototype was developed with input from the Chinese government.</p><p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers have blasted Project Dragonfly, with Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Mark Warner leading the charge in the Senate. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy briefly testified ahead of Pichai on Tuesday, urging him to consider China s repressive practices and asking him what has changed since the company pulled its search engine out of the country in 2010.</p><p>Should Google remain committed to the project, there s little consensus on Capitol Hill over the next steps.  So far as what remedies exist from a legislative standpoint to address it, that s something we still have to think through,  Rubio told reporters Thursday.</p><p>Some experts see an opening for a revival of the Global Online Freedom Act, a piece of legislation that s languished on Capitol Hill for well over a decade. The bill would enhance Congress s powers to censure tech companies that do business with repressive governments and restrict the transfer of sensitive technologies to those countries. While it hasn t gained much traction in the past, Wong believes that Project Dragonfly and rising worries over tech platforms more generally could give it a boost.</p><p> I do think there are legislative solutions,  said Cicilline, floating a potential bill modeled on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. businesses from bribing foreign officials. </p><p>Danny O Brien, the international director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, echoed that comparison.  What we re really looking for here is a know-your-customer model,  O Brien said,  but a know-your-customer model when your customer is a foreign government. </p><p>Google could also face stricter technology-export controls as a result of Project Dragonfly, a threat that McCarthy made explicit when referencing the  next generation  cloud-computing and artificial-intelligence technologies that the company has begun developing on Chinese soil  technology that the administration considers a national priority. </p><p>Daniel Castro, vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, thinks a tightening of export controls by Congress or the Commerce Department  can have a big impact on a company like Google, particularly as it relates to their ability to compete with foreign companies that are in this space. </p><p>But perhaps the most dangerous aspect of Project Dragonfly for Google is the long-term ill will it could engender on Capitol Hill. With lawmakers set to take up legislation on both privacy and content liability in the next Congress, bipartisan anger over Google s behavior abroad could cause Congress to throw the book at the search giant here at home.</p><p> Over time, you re either collecting a lot of allies or you re collecting a lot of enemies,  Castro said.  And in some of these cases, it seems like the enemies are starting to grow quite large. And that is worrisome when it comes to other types of regulation or laws that might come down the line in the future. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-675257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY7-78S1-JBNW-34RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1134\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai[2] avoided the customary product metric bragging. It's a sign of the tech backlash, and the new regulatory scrutiny facing companies like Google[3] and Facebook[4]. But don't believe everything you see on stage. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[5] Remember when developer conferences were for tech companies to brag about how big they were? It's kind of the point of a developer conference. The reason that companies spend so much time and money putting on a show is to make the case that they've got the biggest, baddest platform on the block; the one that software developers had better swear fealty to if they want to succeed in the business. That was before the Big Tech backlash. Before Donald Trump's drive-by tweet attacks. And before Facebook[6] was setting aside $3 billion to pay government fines for violating user privacy. Just how dramatically the times have changed was on full display Tuesday at Google's I/O developers conference[7] \u2014 a splashy event that the company once kicked off by having a Google founder jump out of a plane. There was no skydiving kicking off Google's 2019 conference. But there also wasn't something else: no bragging about size. Compare this to a couple of years ago. This is Google CEO Sundar Pichai's keynote during the 2017 I/O event:\"Every single day users watch over 1 billion hours of video on YouTube,\" Pichai boasted back in 2017. \"Every single day users navigate over 1 billion kilometers on Google maps.\" Google's unstoppable growth was not just a key talking point, it was the underlying theme of the event just two years ago. New products, like Google Drive, were booming, he showed:For the past two years, however, Pichai has kept the bar charts and eye-popping numbers out of his opening presentation. On Tuesday, when Pichai delivered his keynote, he didn't mention user numbers for any Google products. The closest thing to cross Pichai's lips that even hinted at Google's size was this altruism:  \"We feel so privileged to be developing products for billions of users.And with that scale comes a deep sense of responsibility to create things that improve people's lives.\" The latest update about the number of people using Google's Android software (there are now 2.5 billion of them) was announced one hour into the event, when a Google product director was giving an overview of the new Android features.It was, in other words, a very different kind of I/O. The chest-thumping and braggadocio were on the backburner, and the skydiving Sergeys of yore were nowhere to be seen. This isn't to defend the circus-like spectacle of some of the past events, or to say that Google didn't have show off any cool technology at this year's event (the update to Google Lens and the live text capture features were very cool). But does anybody really think Google has fundamentally changed, or that it doesn't care about how big and dominant its products are? Google is still a profit-driven, advertising-supported business that feeds its bottom line with users and their data. And it's a fierce competitor that's never shied away from using its heft to conquer new markets and crush its rivals. Sure, Google's proclamations that it intends to be more responsible about privacy, AI ethics and \"digital well being\" are to be commended. But its attempt to play down its power is nothing more than showmanship, and it's a much less interesting show to watch.NOW WATCH: I tried the $1,980 Samsung Galaxy Fold and it's impressive for a

This is thanks to a new partnership with Citigroup and Stanford University Credit Union. </p><p>The name of this project is \"Cache\". This news comes out of the Wall Street Journal[2] this morning, and there's very little information about how this would work for Google.The product will be branded as coming from these banksIn a smart move, Google will be branding this product as coming from Citigroup and Stanford University Credit Union. That's very smart, since many are pretty skeptical of how much Google already knows about them. And likely wouldn't be as willing to give Google access to their money. The two banks are going to be in charge of the financial backend and regulatory compliance. A Google executive did speak with WSJ about this project, and said that Cache is designed \"to help more people do more stuff in a digital way online.\"He also said that this project could be used to offer loyalty card programs. It goes without saying that checking accounts do offer up a ton of valuable data. Data that Google is going to want for its advertising business. Checking accounts would tell Google about your spending habits and what you spend money on. As well as how much you earn. But, Google is saying that it won't be selling checking account financial data to advertisers. It also said that it doesn't do that with Google Pay data currently.Yet another big tech company getting into bankingIn recent years, we've seen a number of tech companies start their own banking services. Including Apple with its credit card, which it is doing with Goldman Sachs. We've also seen some other start ups like M1Finance, Robinhood and Credit Karma get into this space. Though, those are a bit different, since they are already in the financial industry. It's the next big cash cow for these companies, especially now that we are buying less smartphones. This is how companies like Apple and Google are going to keep making money. Though, Google having access to all of that information is going to be a bit worrysome. While they say that they are not going to sell that data to advertisers, there's really no way to see whether they are or not. And if they aren't selling that data, then they are likely using it to better target ads.

The company has asked[2] the regulatory body to keep the specifics of the test under wraps, saying that \"if subject to public disclosure, would cause significant commercial, economic, and competitive harm.\" \"Google proposes to conduct experimental propagation testing in the 6GHz band to produce technical information relevant to the utility of these frequencies for providing reliable broadband connections,\" the company writes. </p><p>It's unclear exactlywhat Google is trying to test, though. The company expects the tests to take up to 24 months. It has requested permission to test in 26 cities across 17 states. Those include: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. Google wants to conduct tests in only one or two cities in most of the states. However, in its home state, California, it plans to test in seven cities, including Los Angeles, the home to Google's Venice office, and San Bruno, where YouTube has its headquarters.Google wants to test in the 6GHz bandThe FCC voted to open up a section of the 6GHz band for unlicensed use in April this year. The idea was that this would usher in faster Wi-Fi. While many big tech companies welcomed the decision, some voiced concerns as well. Notably, AT&amp;#38;T said that this opens up risks of interference with the existing infrastructure. Google is wary of these fears and promises to conduct tests \"without harmful interference to other authorized users\". The company may even limit to indoor operation in some areas to avoid interference if need be. It would conduct tests in the 5650 MHz to 7125 MHz range. There are a number of possibilities for what Google might want to test in the 6GHz spectrum. The spectrum could be used for 5G, vehicle-to-vehicle Wi-Fi communication, IoT, and more. 6GHz Wi-Fi would also allow for significantly faster and more reliable connections. Wi-Fi 6E routers[3], that might run at 6GHz, are expected to come later this year. However, given Google's expected time frame to complete the tests, it appears to be planning for something more than that. The mention of \"broadband\" in the filing suggests it has something to do with wireless internet. The filing names Andrew Clegg as the technical contact. Clegg leads Google's Citizens Broadband Radio Service spectrum sharing efforts. Perhaps, Google is working on future internet services using the 6GHz spectrum, possibly under its Fiber WebPass banner. There are many speculations and we're curious to know what it might be. Hopefully, we'll get to know a little more about it in the coming months when Google begins the \"secret\" tests.

The company has asked the regulatory body to keep the specifics of the test under wraps, saying that \"if subject to public disclosure, would cause significant commercial, economic, and competitive harm.\"   \"Google proposes to conduct experimental propagation testing in the 6GHz band to produce technical information relevant to the utility of these frequencies for providing reliable broadband connections,\" the company writes. It's unclear exactly what Google is trying to test, though.   The company expects the tests to take up to 24 months. It has requested permission to test in 26 cities across 17 states. Those include: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia.  Google wants to conduct tests in only one or two cities in most of the states. However, in its home state, California, it plans to test in seven cities, including Los Angeles, the home to Google's Venice office, and San Bruno, where YouTube has its headquarters.  Google wants to test in the 6GHz band  The FCC voted to open up a section of the 6GHz band for unlicensed use in April this year. The idea was that this would usher in faster Wi-Fi. While many big tech companies welcomed the decision, some voiced concerns as well. Notably, AT&amp;T said that this opens up risks of interference with the existing infrastructure.   Google is wary of these fears and promises to conduct tests \"without harmful interference to other authorized users\". The company may even limit to indoor operation in some areas to avoid interference if need be. It would conduct tests in the 5650 MHz to 7125 MHz range.  There are a number of possibilities for what Google might want to test in the 6GHz spectrum. The spectrum could be used for 5G, vehicle-to-vehicle Wi-Fi communication, IoT, and more. 6GHz Wi-Fi would also allow for significantly faster and more reliable connections.   Wi-Fi 6E routers , that might run at 6GHz, are expected to come later this year. However, given Google's expected time frame to complete the tests, it appears to be planning for something more than that.   The mention of \"broadband\" in the filing suggests it has something to do with wireless internet. The filing names Andrew Clegg as the technical contact. Clegg leads Google's Citizens Broadband Radio Service spectrum sharing efforts.  Perhaps, Google is working on future internet services using the 6GHz spectrum, possibly under its Fiber WebPass banner. There are many speculations and we're curious to know what it might be. Hopefully, we'll get to know a little more about it in the coming months when Google begins the \"secret\" tests.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42865666716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MB-XDD1-F07F-84JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"515\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>AndroidHeadlines</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Fitbit's stock had surged as much as 30 percent earlier this week on reports that Alphabet had put in an offer. The deal is expected to close in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google will pay $7.35 a share for the fitness tracker, helping it advance its ambitions for wearable technology. The company does not make its own smartwatch.</p><p>Fitbit stock surged 16 percent after the announcement. Like comparable products manufactured by Garmin, Apple and Samsung, the Fitbit gives consumers immediate access to ever-more-specific slices of fitness data - from their daily step count to their heart rate to how well they sleep. Yet the data has also become a treasure trove for employers and insurance companies, complicating the relationships between workers and their bosses.</p><p>\"Fitbit has been a true pioneer in the industry and has created terrific products, experiences and a vibrant community of users,\" said Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google. \"We're looking forward to working with the incredible talent at Fitbit, and bringing together the best hardware, software and AI, to build wearables to help even more people around the world.\"</p><p>Even though the deal could grant Google a big boost in a market where it has long lagged, it could also raise regulatory headaches for the tech giant. The companies indicated in their securities filings they would probably need to obtain approval from antitrust watchdogs to consummate the merger - a process that arrives precisely as all of Silicon Valley is under the political microscope in Washington for being too big and powerful.</p><p>Google in particular is the subject of competition investigations by federal and state officials, which are focused in large part on its advertising business. As part of its merger terms, Google has agreed to pay $250 million to Fitbit if it can't secure regulators' blessings, a move that some analysts saw as a critical warning sign.</p><p>\"This deal is going to get a bright spotlight from regulators in the Beltway, which speaks to such a high termination fee,\" said Daniel Ives, managing director for equity research at Wedbush Securities. \"Google knows politicians and regulators have the company in their sights with another battle now on the horizon in this Big Tech versus Beltway theme.\"</p><p>Regulators could be particularly interested in privacy: Google collects a trove of data about the users of its services - including its search and email systems - and smartphones and smart-home devices. In doing so, the company often has found itself in the crosshairs of Congress and a slew of government agencies around the world for failing to protect that personal information.</p><p>Fitbit, however, stressed that health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads.</p><p>\"Strong privacy and security guidelines have been part of Fitbit's DNA since day one, and this will not change,\" the company said in its Friday release. \"Fitbit will continue to put users in control of their data and will remain transparent about the data it collects and why.\"</p><p>Antitrust regulators have been \"slow to the game\" when it comes to looking at how data plays into fortifying monopoly power, said Sally Hubbard, the director of enforcement strategy at Open Markets Institute, which has advocated for tougher competition enforcement against tech giants.</p><p>\"That's a source of their dominance,\" Hubbard said. \"The reason no one else can really challenge Google in targeted advertising is because no one has the surveillance network Google has. ... So I think antitrust enforcers need to take a really hard look at whether they should allow Google to acquire another unique data set.\"</p><p>Apple has posed serious competition for Fitbit. At the end of last year, Apple owned roughly half the world's smartwatch market in terms of units shipped.</p><p>When reporting company earnings in July, Fitbit lowered its guidance for the year, citing lagging sales of the new lightweight model, Versa Lite. Fitbit has more than 28 million active users worldwide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-286f977ae1594d6b9b64a69e61f2df70</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDB-49D1-JB4M-V3PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><timeReceived>1:34 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001VZA</classCode><className>GARMIN LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The government agency reportedly fought for jurisdiction over the deal with the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees a task force that monitors anticompetitive behavior in Silicon Valley. Google's[2] broader business practices are already under investigation by the Department of Justice[3]as well as by a group of50 state attorneys general[4]. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[5] Google's acquisition of Fitbit last month prompted immediate concerns about the tech giant's new access to sensitive health data, amid government scrutiny over its already-broad access to a range of private data on its consumers. Now, the tech giant will face a government probe over $2.1 billion deal, according to a new report. </p><p>The Department of Justice will review the Fitbit acquisition in addition to its investigation into Google's broader business practices, the New York Post's Josh Kosman reported Tuesday[6]. Companies considering mergers are required to file proposals with both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, so that either antitrust agency can review the deal. Many of Google's past deals have been reviewed by the FTC, which oversees a task force that monitors anticompetitive behavior in Silicon Valley, but the DOJ reportedly fought for jurisdiction to review the Fitbit deal and argued that reviewing the merger fit in with the government agency's broader antitrust investigation of the tech giant. Fitbit makes smartwatches and fitness wristbands that are capable of tracking a wearer's sleeping habits, heart rate, and other personal information. The acquisition would give Google one of the leading companies in the growing market for wearable computing devices. According to market research firm IDC, Apple was the No.1 maker of wearable devices worldwide in the third quarter, with a 35% share of the market. Fitbit was ranked fifth by market share. The Department of Justice did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The FTC declined to comment. A Google spokesperson said that it was normal for mergers to be reviewed by the government, but declined to comment on reports that government concerns surrounding Google's business practices had magnified scrutiny over the Fitbit deal. Both the Department of Justice[7] and a group of 50 state attorneys general[8] are already investigating whether the company has engaged in anticompetitive practices. Google's acquisition of Fitbit at the beginning of November, announced amid the government investigations of its business practices, quickly came under fire from US lawmakers. Republican senator Josh Hawley tweeted an immediate criticism[9], asking why Google should be able to acquire more companies amid an ongoing Department of Justice investigation, and House Representative David Cicilline, heading the House antitrust investigation into big tech, told Bloomberg[10] that the deal threatened \"to further entrench [Google's] market power online.\" The deal is expected to close in 2020, pending regulatory approval and other closing conditions, Fitbit said at the time.NOW WATCH: Most maps of Louisiana aren't entirely right.

In addition to knowingly and illegally harvesting the information from kids without receiving parental consent, regulators said YouTube made millions of dollars by using the data collected from children to deliver targeted ads to them.</p><p>The $136 million penalty is the largest civil fine obtained by the FTC in a case involving the 1998 privacy law.</p><p>\u201cYouTube touted its popularity with children to prospective corporate clients,\u201d FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement. \u201cYet when it came to complying with COPPA, the company refused to acknowledge that portions of its platform were clearly directed to kids. There\u2019s no excuse for YouTube\u2019s violations of the law.\u201d</p><p>The proposed settlement, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, also requires Google and YouTube to implement a system that allows YouTube channel owners to identify content directed toward children to ensure the platform is complying with federal law. Google and YouTube are also required to notify channel owners that content aimed at children may be subject to the measure and the companies must provide annual training for employees who work with YouTube\u2019s channel owners.</p><p>Under the settlement, approved by the FTC in a 3-2 party-line vote, YouTube is required to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children.</p><p>Simons and Commissioner Christine Wilson said in a joint statement the fine and settlement send a \u201cstrong message\u201d to platforms and content providers that they need to comply with federal law. But Democrats on the panel warned that while the penalty is record-setting, it could do little to deter content creators who believe the monetary incentives for harvesting children\u2019s data outweigh the risks of being caught for violating the law.</p><p>\u201cThis order will make YouTube safer for children than it has been, but, without a backstop to catch inappropriately designated content, it will not make YouTube safe enough,\u201d Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said. \u201cMore action is needed.\u201d</p><p>The $170 million penalty and settlement with Google comes as federal regulators have ramped up enforcement of big tech companies for privacy violations. In July, the FTC, which oversees enforcement of federal privacy rules, reached a settlement with Facebook over the social media giant\u2019s mishandling of user data. Facebook agreed to pay a $5 billion fine as a result of the privacy missteps, though the agreement and the monetary penalty were met with criticisms they did not go far enough.</p><p>Photo Caption:Antalya, Turkey - May 6, 2011: iPad is on the Apple Macbook Pro.

Why it matters: Regulators around the world have been threatening[1] Google with broad-based policies that would force it to pay publishers on policymakers' terms. Google aims to get ahead of that threat by introducing its own payout terms, while also strengthening its relationship with the embattled[2] publishing community. </p><p>\"We've heard loud and clear that we need to do more to support publications around world. Today's news is part of that solution.\"Google's VP of product management for newsBrad Bender Details: The new program, to be announced in full later this year, consists of two aspects: Google will pay select publishers to distribute their work \u2014 whether it be video, audio, images or text \u2014 as a part of a new news product, details of which have not been made public.Google will also offer to pay for free access for users to read paywalled articles on a publisher's site where available, to help those publishers grow their audiences. Google has already signed partnership agreements with local and national publications in Germany, Australia and Brazil, and plans to expand to other countries in the next few months. Examples of the publishers that have signed on include Der Spiegel, FAZ, Die Zeit, Tagesspiegel and Rheinische Post in Germany; Schwartz Media, the Conversation, Private media, Solstice Media in Australia; and A Gazeta and Diarios Associados[3](which owns a slew of regional and local publications) in Brazil. For now, all Google is saying about the new product is that it is an \"enhanced\" storytelling experience that will exist in Google News and \"Discover,\" its curated list of articles that appears on Android phones. Google will pick from a list of select publishers from various perspectives to be a part of the new product. Bender says that for now, Google is focused on local and regional publishers that \"create uniquely valuable coverage in communities.\"Asked if Google would include controversial hyper-partisan publishers in the mix, Bender said that Google would work to ensure a variety of publishers with different viewpoints, including political viewpoints, would be represented, without specifying more. He noted that the product will allow users to \"go deeper into a complex story or issue\" and will help users discover new news brands. The big picture: Regulators around the world, encouraged by news industry interest groups, have been pushing to introduce legislation that would require tech giants like Google and rival Facebook to pay publishers directly for their work. Google has resisted the idea, and has even threatened to pull Google News out of Europe[4] should the EU impose such policies. But upon realizing that the trend is probably inevitable, Google seems to be taking a more forward-leaning approach towards paying publishers, to be able to at least do so on its own terms.Most notably, Google is currently facing immediate pressure from regulators in Australia[5] and France[6] over paying publishers. Bender says Google is engaging with lawmakers from both countries about the new product. Be smart: Efforts to pay publishers directly for content by big tech companies have shown mixed results, based on implementation and publisher relationships. While some platforms, like Snapchat and Twitter, seem to have developed stable relationships with the news industry, others \u2014 primarily Facebook \u2014 have struggled to strike the right balance.Facebook has for years been criticized[7] by the news industry for paying publishers to create news products, like live video and Instant Articles, only to pull back payment after the products fail to catch on.Sources have told[8] Axios that Facebook plans to spend roughly $90 million in total funding news efforts on Facebook, which includes news shows on its new video tab, Watch, as well as content for its new News tab. What's next: Bender says Google is currently engaged in discussions with more partners in the three launch countries and is in talks with publishers in about half a dozen other countries.

And the firm challenged a 100,000 ($109,901; \u00a388,376) euro fine that CNIL had tried to impose.</p><p>\"Currently, there is no obligation under EU law, for a search engine operator who grants a request for de-referencing made by a data subject... to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine,\" the European Court of Justice ruling said.</p><p>What is the right to be forgotten?</p><p>Also known as the \"right to erasure\", the rule gives EU citizens the power to demand data about them be deleted.</p><p>In the case of search engines, Europeans have had the right to request links to pages containing sensitive personal information about them be removed since 2014.</p><p>But the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force in 2018, added further obligations.</p><p>Members of the public can make a request to any organisation \"verbally or in writing\" and the recipient has one month to respond. They then have a\u00a0range of considerations to weigh up to decide\u00a0whether they are compelled to comply or not.</p><p>Google had argued that the obligation could be abused by authoritarian governments trying to cover up human rights abuses were it to be applied outside of Europe.</p><p>\"Since 2014, we've worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people's rights of access to information and privacy,\" the firm said in a statement following the ECJ ruling.</p><p>\"It's good to see that the court agreed with our arguments.\"</p><p>The tech firm had been supported by Microsoft, Wikipedia's owner the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and the UK freedom of expression campaign group Article 19, among others.</p><p>ECJ adviser Maciej Szpunar had also concluded that the right to be forgotten be limited to Europe in a non-binding recommendation to the court earlier this year.</p><p>Google fights plan to extend 'right to be forgotten'<br/>Google backed on limiting search results over right to be forgotten<br/>The secrets of controlling your internet profile</p><p>There has been a lot of interest in the case since, had the ruling gone the other way, it could have been viewed as an attempt by Europe to police a US tech giant beyond the EU's borders.</p><p>Those wanting to read the full ruling were frustrated in the hour following its release because the ECJ's own website crashed.</p><p>The court also issued a related second ruling, which said that links do not automatically have to be removed just because they contain information about a person's sex life or a criminal conviction.</p><p>Instead, it ruled that such listings could be kept where \"strictly necessary\" for people's freedom of information rights to be preserved. However, it indicated a high threshold should be applied and that such results should fall down search result listings over time.</p><p>\"The obligation to demote search results in some cases is particularly interesting as an example of the courts directly interfering with the algorithms used by big tech companies,\" commented Peter Church from the law firm Linklaters.</p><p>Geoblocked results</p><p>Google has applied the right to be forgotten since May 2014, when the ECJ first determined that under some circumstances European citizens could force search firms to delist webpages containing sensitive information about them from queries made using their names.</p><p>The idea is to hide sensitive information - such the fact a person once committed a criminal offence or had an extra-marital affair - if the details are judged to be \"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive\".</p><p>Google has said that since that time\u00a0it has received more than 845,000 requests to remove a total of 3.3 million web addresses, with about 45% of the links ultimately getting delisted.</p><p>This involves both removing the results from its European sites - such as Google.fr, Google.co.uk and Google.de - as well as restricting results from its other sites - such as Google.com - if it detects a search is being carried out from within Europe.</p><p>However, this means that users can still circumvent the action if they use a virtual private network (VPN) or other tool to mask their location.</p><p>Notably, the ECJ ruling said that delistings must \"be accompanied by measures which effectively prevent or, at the very least, seriously discourage an internet user\" from being able to access the results from one of Google's non-EU sites.</p><p>\"It will be for the national court to ascertain whether the measures put in place by Google Inc meet those requirements.\"</p><p>News sites, including the BBC, are exempt from the rule, but may find that links to some of their old articles no longer appear on Google or other search engines.</p><p>The right to be forgotten should still apply to the UK if it leaves the EU, with or without a deal, at least in the short to medium-term.</p><p>\"How it's applied might diverge over time, as UK courts no longer follow ECJ decisions and the Supreme Court in the UK wrestles with these points instead,\" a spokesman for Linklaters told the BBC.</p><p>\"But day one, we're going to have a UK version of the GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation], including a right to be forgotten.\"</p><p>By Leo Kelion</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/32/156941738128.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/32/156941738128.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-154872714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4D-PKK1-F11P-X2T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"973\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yerepouni Daily News.

Now a new law may further strain that relationship between the global and economic forces. European Parliament lawmakers on Tuesday announced sweeping changes to copyright rules with the passing ofArticle 13[2]. The laws would make platforms like YouTube liable for potential copyright infringement. </p><p>The changes may also require sites like Google Newsto potential pay publishers for using certain content. If approved, it wouldbe the first major amendment made to copyright laws since 2001. These are changes that had been pushed for by several media companies, record labels and artists for nearly two years. The argument from their side was that these changes are necessary to ensure certain copyright protections and that everyone is paid fairly. Much like thenet neutrality controversy in the U.S.[3],the law has been opposed by the tech industry, with a crux of their argument being the need to build expensive filters and stop linking to or referencing publications. It had also spurned opposition from internet activists, arguing that it could lead to censorship. They also warned that because the law is so broad, it could hit material not protected by copyright, including parody or quotations. Critics argued it could even kill off memes. Julia Reda, a member ofPirate Party MEPwho helped lead protests against Article 13, told Fortune[4] that this would be \"a severe blow to freedom of expression and diversity of voices online.\" However, proponents of the lawhave said that Article 13 won't be asrestrictive and rigid as it might seem. Eleonora Rosati, a lawyer and copyright expert at the University of Southampton, told CNN[5] that \"Some of the concepts are meant to be flexible, so that they will give room for flexible interpretation ... but of course that also leaves room for significant uncertainty.\" The proposal is expected to be endorsed by the European Council and will take roughly two years to be properly implemented. Trump has signed a resolution to repeal the internet privacy regulations introduced by the FCC, which restricted internet service providers from using any user's sensitive information without consent.

The hatred.\"</p><p> Meanwhile, the White House announced it would host a Social Media Summit on July 11 for \"digital leaders,\" focusing on \"opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\"</p><p> Top tech platforms Google and YouTube have responded by reiterating their denials of politically motivated chicanery, while conservatives who have raised alarm for years about online censorship and discrimination insist the time for talk is over.</p><p> The Media Research Center repeated its call Wednesday for a Justice Department investigation into bias at the social media giants, saying \"they are simply too powerful for ordinary citizens to challenge.\"</p><p> \"It's an ongoing problem, and some members of Congress recognize the problem, but nothing is getting done. And that's the real problem,\" said Dan Gainor, vice president of the center. \"We are now in the election cycle, and this latest report raises questions about whether or not this will be a fair election.\"</p><p> The Project Veritas video showed Google executive Jen Gennai saying that everyone, including the voters and news media, \"got screwed in 2016,\" and that Google has been working on \"what happened there and how do we prevent it from happening again.\"</p><p> Ms. Gennai admitted in a Monday post to using \"imprecise language\" but insisted the idea that she was a \"powerful executive\" confirming that Google was trying to fix the 2020 election was \"absolute, unadulterated nonsense.\"</p><p> Mr. Trump saw it differently. \"Let me tell you, they're trying to rig the election,\" he said. \"That's what we should be looking at, not the witch hunt, the phony witch hunt.\"</p><p> In an online statement, YouTube said that \"we apply our policies fairly and without political bias. All creators are held to the same standard.\" Likewise Google, which owns YouTube.</p><p> \"We build our products with extraordinary care and safeguards to be a trustworthy source of information for everyone, without any regard for political viewpoint,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"Our rating guidelines are publicly visible for all to see.\"</p><p> At a House hearing Wednesday on online terrorism and misinformation, however, Big Tech's objectivity came under fire from Republicans, who grilled social media representatives about whether their platforms are blocking right-of-center content in the name of fighting extremism.</p><p> \"We're here today to discuss extremist content, violent threats, terrorist recruiting tactics, instigation of violence. Yet the same justification your platform uses to quell true extremism is often used to silence and restrict voices that you disagree with,\" said Rep. Clay Higgins, Louisiana Republican. \"We don't like it.\"</p><p> Rep. Debbie Lesko, Arizona Republican, said the tech dominance reminded her of the dystopian world depicted in the George Orwell novel \"1984.\"</p><p> \"At a previous briefing on this, one of the members said, 'Well, I think President Trump's tweets incite terrorism,'\" said Rep. Debbie Lesko, Arizona Republican. \"Well, are we now going to ban what President Trump says because somebody thinks that it incites terrorism? This is some really scary stuff, and I'm very concerned.\"</p><p> Among the examples was a leaked internal Google email posted Tuesday by Project Veritas describing such conservative figures as Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson and PragerU, run by Dennis Prager, as \"nazis.\" Both Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Prager are Jewish.</p><p> Rep. Dan Crenshaw, Texas Republican, said it revealed \"that labeling the mainstream conservative media as Nazis is a premise upon which you operate. It's not even a question.\"</p><p> \"Two of three of these people are Jewish, very religious Jews, and yet you think they're Nazis,\" said Mr. Crenshaw. \"It begs the question: 'What kind of education do people at Google have so they think that religious Jews are Nazis?'\"</p><p>Google global director of communications Derek Slater insisted the platform was reliable.</p><p> \"When we're designing our products, again we're designing them for everyone,\" Mr. Slater said. \"We have robust set of guidelines making sure we're developing relevant, trustworthy information.\"</p><p> Mr. Higgins argued that Google and YouTube are \"developing quite a poor reputation in our nation, with a clear history of repetitively silencing and banning voices.\"</p><p> \"Mr. Slater, God bless you. Google's in a bind. Today, America's watching,\" Mr. Higgins said. \"Today, America is taking a step back. We're looking at the services, we're looking at the platforms we use, and we're finding to our horror that they can't be trusted.\"</p><p>Congress has recently moved to take action on the growing power of Big Tech. A House subcommittee is investigating possible antitrust violations, while Sen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, introduced last week the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, which would remove automatic immunity from liable claims.</p><p> Figuring out how to strike a balance between interfering with the free market and stopping political bias has long bedeviled Republicans, who recoil from federal regulation.</p><p> Others have suggested filing Federal Election Commission complaints about possible meddling.</p><p> At the very least, said Craig Strazzeri, chief marketing officer for PragerU, conservatives need to do more than complain.</p><p> PragerU filed federal and state lawsuits after YouTube restricted more than 100 of its five-minute videos, including those with titles like, \"Gun Rights are Women's Rights,\" \"Do Not Commit Adultery\" and \"Is the Death Penalty Ever Moral?\"</p><p> \"In general, I think it's important to fight back,\" Mr. Strazzeri said. \"I think what Big Tech realizes is, they think conservatives will just give up. It's important to fight back both in the courtroom and the court of public opinion. That's why we ultimately decided to sue them.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-17451DD0CD6F3D50</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF6-5RC1-DXVP-V2T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1088\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>27 June 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Nor is he a fan of the press. On August 28th, President Donald Trump took a swipe at both by accusing Google of rigging its search results in favour of \"Fake News\". As evidence, the president claimed that 96% of search results for \"Trump News\" were articles from the \"National Left-Wing Media\". Larry Kudlow, the president's economic adviser, said that the Trump administration is considering regulating how Google presents its results.</p><p>That the White House might retaliate against a company that, it thinks, is not serving the public enough flattering stories, is the kind of norm-flouting that has become normal in 2018. That aside, is Mr Trump right to think the California-based search giant is somehow suppressing conservative thought? The 96% statistic he cited appears to have come from PJ Media, a blog. Paula Bolyard, the post's author, conducted her analysis by searching for \"Trump\" on Google's news tool. Out of the first 100 of her results, only five articles came from what she deemed conservative publications.</p><p>In an attempt to answer the question, The Economist wrote a program that searched for \"Trump\" on Google News every day so far in 2018. We used a browser in Dallas that was cleared of clues about previous searches. We then matched the results with web-traffic statistics from Alexa, an analytics company owned by Amazon, to see how popular each site is (more popular sites show up more often in Google News). Next, we marked a number of news publications as right-leaning or not.</p><p>Our analysis finds that, even after accounting for how popular their websites are, fewer articles from right-leaning outlets show up on Google (see chart). To get around the problem that more of America's reality-based news outlets are left-of-centre, just as conspiracy theorists currently lean right, we then built a model which incorporates data from the Knight Foundation on how trustworthy Americans think each publication is. After controlling for trustworthiness and volume of Trump articles published, we found there was no evidence that ideology influences Google News results.</p><p>Google's search algorithm takes account of the popularity of articles and how user-friendly websites are, among many other variables. It may be that conservative publications write fewer eye-catching articles about the president. As the chart shows, the results are skewed by the popularity of three outlets that have done some of the best reporting on this presidency. A final possibility is that liberals, despite their horror, are simply more compelled to read about Mr Trump than conservatives are.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-5M7F94I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T52-NTC1-JBKN-B1B3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Two days after being picked as Biden\u2019s running mate , those connections are already under fire from prominent conservatives, who have long accused Democrats of cozying up to Silicon Valley .   \u2014 Too close for comfort? \u201cFirst Wall Street, now #BigTech lines up for Biden/Harris. The ruling class strikes back,\u201d tweeted Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), an outspoken tech critic and ally of President Donald Trump, in response to a Recode article titled, \u201cKamala Harris is the choice Joe Biden needed to win over Silicon Valley.\u201d Fox News host Laura Ingraham reacted to the piece with similar derision, tweeting , \u201cTalk about people who don\u2019t care about the Midwest.\u201d Other Republicans expressed skepticism about a former Harris aide now working for Twitter.   \u2014 Some on the left aren\u2019t too thrilled about those ties either: \u201cHarris\u2019s connection to Big Tech generally and to Facebook in particular is a demerit, and deeply concerns me,\u201d tweeted Hal Singer , an antitrust scholar and the managing Director at Econ One. \u201cShe could diffuse tensions on the Left by recusing herself from all matters concerning platform regulation.\u201d   BIG TECH BRACES FOR A BIG NIGHT \u2014 Election night will be a major test for Facebook, Google, Twitter and other internet companies. An industry coalition has been game-planning for the myriad ways it could play out, including delayed results due to an increase in mail-in ballots, Nancy reports . That could mean a decisive winner may not be declared for several days, if not longer, creating uncertainty that provides fertile ground for misinformation.   \u2014 Facebook debuted its Voter Information Center Thursday , a key part of its plan to register 4 million voters before the U.S. presidential election. In a sign of the times, the center also contains information about mail-in voting, the spread of coronavirus and other issues that have attracted political controversy in the run up to November.   \u2014  Of course, Facebook\u2019s efforts aren\u2019t just a get-out-the-vote drive. They\u2019re also a cornerstone in the company\u2019s plans to combat election misinformation and interference, which a number of researchers and critics contend it has not done enough to halt since 2016 . \u201cOne of the best ways to combat misinformation is to make sure that people proactively have accurate, authoritative information,\u201d said Emily Dalton Smith, Facebook\u2019s director of social impact product. Facebook recently began adding links to reliable voting information on election-related posts, and the company is now appending those labels to political and issue-based ads as well.   \u2014 Meanwhile, over at Google, the internet search giant outlined its own get-out-the-vote and misinformation mitigation efforts in a pair of blog posts published Thursday. Google-owned YouTube, for instance, will now remove content that contains hacked information that could interfere in the democratic process, as well as videos that encourage others to muck up election day, such as by deliberately creating long lines to discourage others from voting. The company is also updating its library of election ads to include new information, among other changes.   \u2014 Plus: Twitter plans to expand its rules against misleading information about mail-in ballots and early voting, a move that could have major implications for the social media platform\u2019s handling of tweets by Trump and his allies. Read the full report here .    FCC FENDS OFF LEGAL CHALLENGE OVER 5G \u2014 A federal appeals court sided with the Federal Communications Commission and industry groups in a legal dispute with local governments over who can regulate the installation of 5G infrastructure. In 2018, the FCC passed orders limiting the fees local authorities can charge and the amount of time they can take approving the installation of small-cell sites for 5G networks. Big telecom companies argued the process would be too onerous and expensive otherwise, and further delay the U.S. in its quest to build out next-generation wireless infrastructure.   \u2014 The court determined the FCC\u2019s orders were largely in line with its Congressionally sanctioned authority. In a statement, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who spearheaded the orders, called the victory \u201ca significant win for America\u2019s 5G leadership.\u201d FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the ruling affirms the agency\u2019s plans for deploying equipment more quickly to keep the U.S. competitive in the global 5G race. \u201cThe wind is at our backs,\u201d his statement read. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce agreed and, in its own statement , called on Congress to permanently streamline permitting for internet infrastructure.   TIKTOK EMPLOYEES TO TAKE ON EO \u2014 Employees of the popular video app are raising funds online to file a lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s executive order over fears it may require the company to stop paying them. In a video explaining the case, Patrick S. Ryan -- a security program manager who joined TikTok this year after nine years at Google -- said TikTok\u2019s 1,500 U.S. employees are likely to lose their paychecks after Sept. 20 since the order bars \u201cany transaction by any person.\u201d Ryan, who is a lawyer, donated $5,000 of his own money but said employees need about $30,000 to file for a federal injunction that would allow TikTok to continue to pay its workers beyond next month.   \u2014 EO impact : Mike Godwin, a lawyer who is helping TikTok employee\u2019s with their effort, said the Trump administration didn\u2019t fully consider the executive order\u2019s impact. \u201cThere are 1,500 lawful American workers who have a right to be paid for their work for TikTok who might not be paid for the work under the executive order,\u201d he said. The White House declined to comment and the Commerce Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.   STREAMING SERVICES WIN LATEST MUSIC ROYALTY TUSSLE \u2014 Streaming services Spotify, Amazon, Google and Pandora won a partial victory this week with a key appeals court overturning the royalties that online music services must pay to songwriters. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated part of a decision by the Copyright Royalty Board that set royalty rates for streaming music services for 2018 through 2022. The board will now have to reconsider the rates, which could drag the process on for months or even years.   \u2014 Copyright Royalty Board : The board, part of the Library of Congress, determines the rates that digital services must pay songwriters and musicians if the groups can\u2019t reach an agreement on their own. Its decision significantly increased the amount of money that digital services must pay, leading streaming groups as well as the National Music Publishers Association to appeal.   \u2014 The court\u2019s decision : The D.C. Circuit found the retroactive nature of the rates was reasonable, but the appeals court said the board didn\u2019t do enough to explain parts of its decision or give enough notice that it intended to modify the way rates are calculated.   \u2014 Reactions : NMPA CEO David Israelite noted that the court didn\u2019t reject the idea of an increase for songwriters and the board could adopt a similar rate structure if it provides fuller explanations. \u201cWe believe these things are easily done by the CRB,\u201d he said. Spotify and Amazon didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.

A party that once stood for free trade has a president who loves tariffs. A party that championed free enterprise has a president out to punish companies he doesn't like. A party that stood for the rule of law has a president who attacks his own Justice Department. </p><p><br/>And now this. <br/><br/>A party that has long preached limited government, free expression and deregulation now has an administration pondering a politically motivated investigation of social media intended to justify a new wave of regulations. <br/><br/>Without question, social media companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as well as Google, the web's dominant search engine, have amassed great power in recent years and have had an almost unimaginable impact on politics and culture. <br/><br/>Facebook, a company founded in a dorm 14 years ago, has recently been hiring linguists and artificial intelligence experts all around the world to keep its platform from becoming a medium of violence and spreader of lies. <br/><br/>Facebook is being used as a propaganda vehicle for both sides in a Libyan civil war and has been accused of aiding the cause of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Closer to home, it was used by the Russian government to spread misinformation during the 2016 presidential election. <br/><br/>Twitter has long been the social media weapon of choice for conspiracy theorists and provocateurs such as Alex Jones. Jones is peddler of lies, most notably that the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 was a hoax. He also likes to wrap himself in constitutionalism, arguing that his First Amendment right to peddle sickening fantasies requires tech companies to provide an audience. <br/><br/>One by one, social media companies have come to the conclusion that they have no obligation to amplify his voice and that, as a matter of self-interest, they should not. On Thursday, Twitter became the last major company to ban or greatly limit him from its platform. <br/><br/>Enter Big Government: GOP edition. <br/><br/>Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last week that he would convene a meeting with states to discuss ways social media companies stifle free expression. This comes after some Republican members of Congress and the president complained tech companies were stifling conservative voices. <br/><br/>Do social media companies stifle some legitimate speech? Almost certainly they do. But if people have a beef with that, they should take it up with the various companies, not run to the government. <br/><br/>What they will find is that such tech companies restrict speech in a limited number of instances to protect the quality of their product, and thus to make more money. They don't want to be a garbage bucket of falsehoods or megaphone of hate speech because that would drive away their customers. <br/><br/>Social media companies are money-grubbing capitalists out to make a buck. Surely, Republicans can see the value in that, even in the Trump era. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>photo Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-102819951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7Y-74G1-JC8N-K160-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gannett Company, Inc.

We'll be talking with a Republican who won a special election in California.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And our exclusive report on the potential for massive voter fraud in our midterm elections, the vulnerability of electronic voting systems to fraud and the role of Venezuela in those elections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANNOUNCER: This is LOU DOBBS TONIGHT, news, debate and opinion for Wednesday, June 7th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Live in New York, Lou Dobbs.</p><p>DOBBS: Good evening, everybody.</p><p>Tonight, voters sent President Bush and the U.S. Congress a powerful message, saying amnesty for illegal aliens and our lack of border security is unacceptable. Republican Brian Bilbray defeated his Democratic opponent in a special election in southern California after saying border security must be the country's top priority.</p><p>President Bush today insisted his amnesty plan is not amnesty and that his way is the only patriotic way to solve our illegal immigration and border security crisis.</p><p>John King tonight in Del Mar, California, reports on Brian Bilbray's election victory, its likely impact on the national debate on illegal immigration.</p><p>Ed Henry reports from the White House on the president's increasingly desperate battle to save his so-called comprehensive immigration reform plan.</p><p>And Lisa Sylvester reports from Washington tonight on one congressman's plan to make our immigration laws mirror the laws of Mexico.</p><p>We turn first to John King in Del Mar for a report on the Bilbray victory -- John.</p><p>JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lou what is stunning about this victory is not that Brian Bilbray won -- this is an overwhelmingly Republican district, so he was supposed to win in the eyes of many -- but how he won. This Republican candidate for Congress won by directly attacking the immigration views of the Republican president of the United states. As the votes began to turn in his favor last night, Bilbray told us in an interview that he was in trouble until he decided to emphasize border security first and foremost when it comes to immigration reform, and not only paint his Democratic opponent as soft on illegal immigration, but to also paint the Republican president as just as soft, maybe more so.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN BILBRAY (R), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN-ELECT: The president proposing amnesty was absolutely a big problem. And, in fact, it wasn't until I was able to highlight the fact that I did not agree with my friends in the Senate or my friend in the White House on amnesty, that they really saw the polls start supporting me strongly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: And now, even as the president of the United States travels the country trying to build public support for an immigration compromise on his terms, Bilbray says the lesson of his election will be that he will now go to other Republicans, incumbents in the House, Republican challengers around the country, and say that if they want to win this election, they should emphasize border security first and they should stand up to the president and his allies in this fight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILBRAY: Don't listen to the Senate and don't listen to the White House. They mean well, but they are not listening to the people. And those of us in the House of Representatives by nature are the voice of the people, and the people really have spoken quite clearly, I think, in this election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Now, most House conservatives that view the president's plan as amnesty were in no mood to compromise to begin with, but they are immediately taking from Bilbray's victory a sign that they should not compromise at all, that they should hold firm to their position heading into the November elections, which, of course, will significantly undermine the president's effort to broker a compromise this year.</p><p>We should be clear, though. Even as Mr. Bilbray and Republicans celebrate holding this seat, there are signs of trouble for the Republicans. Not just a feud between this candidate and the White House on immigration.</p><p>Mr. Bilbray got 49 percent of the vote. His democratic challenger got 45 percent. That's nine points better than she did in the election of 2004.</p><p>So Republicans say they definitely realize that this is an example of how they will have trouble motivating the conservative base to turn out in this midterm election year, but, Lou, I'll tell you this, as they study ways to try to turn out those voters, Mr. Bilbray now joining the growing Republican chorus that says one thing not to do is to cut a deal with the president on his terms when it comes to immigration -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: John, thank you very much.</p><p>John King from Del Mar, California.</p><p>The winner, Brian Bilbray, joins us here later in this broadcast.</p><p>In Arizona, Governor Janet Napolitano vetoed legislation that was intended to crack down on illegal immigration. That legislation passed by both houses of the Arizona legislature would have granted state police the power to arrest illegal aliens on criminal trespass charges and would have tightened penalties against employers of illegal aliens, and would have denied new state benefits to illegal aliens.</p><p>The speaker of the Arizona House says Governor Napolitano is thwarting the will of her people with her veto. But Napolitano, who is up for re-election this year, says the bill \"offers no constructive new ideas and instead filled with unworkable or unconstitutional provisions.\"</p><p>This is Governor Napolitano's 115th veto since she took office only three and a half years ago.</p><p>President Bush today acknowledged that the battle over illegal alien amnesty is the ultimate stumbling block, as he put it, to his so-called comprehensive immigration reform. During a visit to Nebraska, the president blasted critics of his amnesty agenda. President Bush said harsh, ugly rhetoric can divide the country and make us forget the values that made America great.</p><p>Ed Henry reports from the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED HENRY, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): One day after alleging his critics are using the word amnesty as a scare tactic, President Bush fired back at conservatives calling for massive deportation of immigrants.</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It makes no sense at all to say we can find people and, you know, run them out of the country. For some, I guess, that sounds appealing. It's impractical. It's not going to work. And it's not necessary, in my judgment.</p><p>HENRY: The president asserted again he's not for amnesty, insisting his plan does not let illegal immigrants off the hook.</p><p>BUSH: You have got to pay a fine for being here illegally. You have got to learn the English language pay your debt to society. And if you choose to be a citizen, you can, just you wait in line at the back, not in the beginning.</p><p>HENRY: While pushing back on amnesty, the president is offering conservatives some olive branches, talking tough on border security at a Tuesday stop in New Mexico. And after touring a Catholic charity center Wednesday in Nebraska, the president stressed the need for assimilation, teaching immigrants American values and culture before they earn citizenship.</p><p>BUSH: I saw a place where people were learning to speak English and learning the civic lessons of what it means to be an American citizen.</p><p>HENRY: But the president stumped the students when he asked how many father/son teams have served as President of the United States. After noting his own father was the nation's 41st president, Mr. Bush revealed the other duo.</p><p>BUSH: Juan Adams, Isolito Juan Q (ph).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HENRY: The president said he's still hopeful that the impasse over immigration reform can be broken, but right now, that looks like an uphill battle against many in his own party -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed, thank you very much.</p><p>Ed Henry from the White House.</p><p>In Congress, there's rising anger tonight over Mexico's blatant interference in our national debate in illegal immigration and our border security. Congressman John Linder is sick of the Mexican government's hypocrisy. He says it's time for the United States government to demand more respect from the government of Mexico. And to make his point, Congressman Linder has introduced legislation that would make our immigration laws mirror those immigration laws of Mexico.</p><p>Lisa Sylvester reports from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): President Bush has been talking up border security this week. But at least one lawmaker says, if the White House were serious about solving the nation's illegal immigration crisis, it would follow Mexico's lead. Yes, Mexico. The United States' southern neighbor has some of the toughest illegal immigration laws on the books.</p><p>Representative John Linder has introduced legislation that would adopt restrictions similar to Mexico's.</p><p>REP. JOHN LINDER (R), GEORGIA: Well, I thought I would put a bill in the hopper that just totally mimics what Mexico has, with tough punishments, felonies, deportation, and let's get it in the mix and talk about it.</p><p>SYLVESTER: Among the provisions, the government would tightly regulate the entry and exit through U.S. borders, whether through land, water or air. The Department of Homeland Security would create a national population registry and maintain a record of every person who is not a U.S. citizen or national.

FOR AMERICAN IMMIGRATION REFORM: Why should Mexico be able to make these demands on us for amnesty when it has its own very tight and highly enforced immigration controls? Why can't we just have the same immigration laws that Mexico does? And I think people really deserve an answer to that question.</p><p>SYLVESTER: The legislation is a long shot on Capitol Hill.

Illegal aliens are stealing the identities of American citizens so they can remain and work in this country illegally. One northern California woman says her identity was stolen more than 200 times by illegal aliens. Casey Wian has her story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Audra Schmierer has been a stay-at-home mom for six years. Now that her son is in school, she wants to return to work. So she applied to a temp agency.</p><p>AUDRA SCHMIERER, ID THEFT VICTIM: They called me three or for hours later and said, \"Mrs. Schmierer, I don't understand why you're applying. You already work here.\"</p><p>WIAN: At a big tech company, a similar experience.</p><p>SCHMIERER: There's my driver's license, my passport, my Social Security card. I gave them everything. And she said, \"Well, really, how can you actually prove you are you? What if those people have the same documentation you do?\"</p><p>WIAN: Schmierer has discovered more than 200 illegal aliens throughout the United States are doing jobs Americans supposedly won't do by using her Social Security number. They work in fast-food chains, cosmetic companies, even receive dividends from Microsoft.</p><p>SCHMIERER: I started to gather all this information and really found out how extreme the situation was. It's scary.</p><p>WIAN: Her ordeal began last year with a bill from the IRS for nearly $16,000 in back taxes for a job in Texas. She lives in Dublin, California.</p><p>SCHMIERER: My husband was actually quite upset. He asked me when I had ever been to Texas.</p><p>WIAN: She tracked down the illegal alien whose phony tax return triggered the IRS bill. He told her he bought her Social Security number and a fake green card at this Texas flea market.</p><p>SCHMIERER: I don't under how illegal aliens can come across here and commit a felony -- identity theft is a felony -- and be excused from that felony to continue living their life when I cannot live my life.</p><p>WIAN: By January, Schmierer faced a $1 million IRS bill. She was temporarily detained by Customs, returning from a foreign business trip with her husband. And her Social Security account now shows a zero balance, erasing 14 years of work before her marriage.</p><p>SCHMIERER: Social Security right now sends me to IRS. IRS sends me to Social Security. Every now and then, they'll send me to the FTC, whom I have a case with.</p><p>No one wants to do anything about it. Right now, I have nowhere to go.</p><p>WIAN: Schmierer spends several hours a day trying to clear her name. The IRS has cancelled her bill, but Social Security won't give her a new number. She says all 35 employers she's contacted have refused to take action against the workers using her number.</p><p>SCHMIERER: It's cheap labor, and they don't care.</p><p>WIAN: Neither do most senators. John Ensign brought Schmierer's case to their attention, and they still approved Social Security benefits for illegal aliens using stolen identifies.</p><p>SEN. JOHN ENSIGN (R), NEVADA: The crime of identity theft and Social Security fraud are not victimless crimes. The victims of these crimes are American citizens and legal immigrants.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WIAN: And in this case, the victim is the granddaughter of a World War II veteran who emigrated legally to the United States from Guadalajara, Mexico.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Social Security Administration says it investigates reports of fraud but wouldn't say if it's investigating any of the cases related to Audra Schmierer. The IRS says it can't penalize employers who believe they are accepting legitimate Social Security numbers -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Of course not. Not in the system that has been created by our elected officials.</p><p>Casey, we can only hope that every one of those senators who voted for amnesty so proudly are watching her story and your report here tonight. We thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>Casey Wian from Los Angeles.</p><p>Tonight, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have shut down a New York City-based operation that sold fake marriage documents to illegal aliens in order to help them obtain green cards. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says one of the leaders of that operation is none other than a federal immigration employee.</p><p>Officials say conspirators made more than $1 million in profits. Thirty people are under arrest tonight for taking part in the operation.</p><p>The Veterans Affairs Administration tonight admits that its identity theft crisis is much wider, much bigger than previously disclosed. The VA now says the names, birth dates and Social Security numbers of more than two million military employees were stolen from the computer of a Veterans Affairs' employee earlier this year.</p><p>That includes nearly 80 percent of the U.S. active duty military force. This is a significant increase from what the VA reported over the weekend, when it disclosed the data from only 50,000 active duty personnel had been stolen.</p><p>When this crisis broke last month, the VA said only personal data from millions of military veterans had been stolen, and it waited almost two weeks to offer its report and alert the public.</p><p>A battle is shaping up in Texas between supporters of illegal immigration and the sheriff of El Paso County. Illegal immigration and open borders advocates say the sheriff is using racial profiling to enforce immigration law. The sheriff says he's enforcing the law.</p><p>Bill Tucker reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL TUCKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It's stops like these that have forced a showdown between El Paso County Sheriff Leo Samaniego and the Border Network for Human Rights. Sheriff Samaniego says his deputies are just enforcing the law.</p><p>SHERIFF LEO SAMANIEGO, EL PASO COUNTY, TEXAS: The law in the state of Texas allows a driver's license checkpoint. You can check insurance and, you know, if you come across something else, of course, you have the right to enforce whatever law is being broken.</p><p>TUCKER: The Border Network for Human Rights sees it differently. They say the stops are checkpoints meant to catch illegal aliens.</p><p>They call them intimidating exercises in racial profiling by a department which is roughly 75 percent Hispanic, and they say they've collective signatures demanding that Sheriff Samaniego resign. Yet, while calling for the sheriff's resignation, the group did not return repeated phone calls. But the head of the Texas Senate Hispanic Caucus has been speaking out.</p><p>State Senator Juan Hinojosa sent a letter to Texas Governor Perry reminding him, \"The mere illegal presence of someone in the United States is a civil immigration violation, but not a criminal offense.\" Hinojosa goes on to say that, \"Sheriff Samaniego's raid and roadblock approach to immigrants undercuts the ability of local law enforcement to ensure the public safety, because it discourages both legal and illegal immigrants from seeking help from the police.\"</p><p>The sheriff says the charge doesn't hold water.</p><p>SAMANIEGO: If you have a group that's complaining about us doing our job, of course they are going to throw in all kinds of insinuations. If they have something to hide, then, by all means, they should be afraid. Because we're out there.</p><p>We're enforcing the law. And, you know, if you're a law-abiding citizen, you have no reason whatsoever to worry about what we're doing.</p><p>TUCKER: Sheriff Samaniego is the head of the Texas Border Sheriffs Coalition.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TUCKER: The sheriff's office is crying foul over the charges, saying they are motivated by politics, noting they are mostly driven from the offices of one state senator, Ellet Shapley (ph), a candidate that the sheriff refused to support in his re-election bid.</p><p>And Lou, as it turns out, not every member of the Texas Hispanic Caucus is pleased about that letter. They were not aware of and it some of them did not approve it before it went to Texas Governor Rick Perry.</p><p>DOBBS: The letter from Hinojosa?</p><p>TUCKER: Correct.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, State Senator Hinojosa has a lot of explaining to do, it seems to me. He's outrageous. And it seems to me like the people of El Paso County should be very proud of a sheriff that -- who is doing his job at a time when not many are, frankly. He's -- we've gotten to know him pretty well over the course of the past couple of years.</p><p>What's the reaction in the press there?</p><p>TUCKER: The press there has come out in favor of him. There was a column on Sunday just recently in \"The El Paso Times,\" where a columnist came out and said, \"Sheriff Leo Samaniego screwed up bad.\" What was he thinking trying to enforce the law, in essence, and warning citizens that they should be careful, because they are going to be looking for a new sheriff.</p><p>DOBBS: And there is one little point here. The sheriff's department is receiving state funds for the purpose of...</p><p>TUCKER: Enforcing the law.</p><p>DOBBS: Enforcing the law, immigration law included.</p><p>Thank you very much, Bill Tucker. It's remarkable. You've got to love Texas.</p><p>That brings us to our poll tonight. If you had to base your vote in November on one of these issues, which would it be: border security, illegal immigration, the war in Iraq, gay marriage, the economy?</p><p>We know it's unrealistic to suggest that there only be one, but we're curious to see what that one issue would be. And if you would, please cast your vote at LouDobbs.com. We'll have the results later here in the broadcast.</p><p>Coming up next, after you cast your ballot, who counts the vote? You may be surprised. They live in Caracas, Venezuela. American democracy for sale. In fact, it's been sold. Our special report coming up.</p><p>Brian Bilbray wins a seat in Congress by promising to boost border security and block amnesty for illegal aliens. He's our guest here next.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Straightforwardly, electronic voting machines are putting our democracy at risk, vulnerable to fraud. As we've been reporting on this broadcast, a Venezuelan company owns one of the leading supplier of electronic voting machines, and that company has ties to the government of Venezuela's strongman, Hugo Chavez.</p><p>Kitty Pilgrim reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This vote was cast in yesterday's primaries in New Mexico. This vote was cast in Venezuela's recall election in 2004. The same company, Smartmatic, owns the electronic voting systems used in both elections.</p><p>Many experts say those voting machines were manipulated in Venezuela to give President Hugo Chavez a victory. Exit polls done by the U.S. firm Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland had Chavez losing 41 percent to 59 percent. But the next day, Chavez declared victory, reversing the score, saying he won 59 percent of the vote.</p><p>GUSTAVO COLONEL, FMR. VENEZUELAN CONGRESS MEMBER: Everything was computed in favor of the government. So, the only explanation is that the Smartmatic machines had been programmed in that way.</p><p>PILGRIM: A Harvard mathematician crunched the numbers on the Venezuelan election.</p><p>RICARDO HAUSMANN, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: I think that the preponderance of the evidence is that there was a fraud in the election. It had to be the Smartmatic system.</p><p>All these machines talk to a central computer and report on their results. And in that -- in that mechanism, as they communicate with the center, the central machine can report everything.</p><p>PILGRIM: Antonio Mujica (ph) and his partner Alfredo Anzola (ph) received a small business loan from the Venezuelan government only months before the recall election. These corporate registration documents from Venezuela show the Venezuelan government owned 28 percent of the stock of another company they started, Vista (ph), which adapted voting software for the Smartmatic machines in the 2004 elections.</p><p>The same document shows a Chavez government minister, Omar Mantillo (ph), was on the board of directors. The Chavez government gave Vista, Smartmatic and another company a $91 million contract to run voting machines for the 2004 election.</p><p>The next year, the owners of Smartmatic bought Sequoia, one of the top electronic voting system companies in the United States, for $16 million. That company provided some of the electronic voting machines in yesterday's primary elections.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PILGRIM: Smartmatic says its machines provide error-proof elections, but watchdog groups some members of Congress are saying there's no way this situation should remain unexamined. They want the Treasury Department to review the sale of Sequoia to Smartmatic, and they say that the integrity of the U.S. voting system is at stake.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let's be clear. It is absolutely demonstrable that with the use of electronic voting machines in which we do not have verifiable receipts and a way of independently auditing those votes -- democracy is at risk anyway as we approach the midterm elections. To have the involvement of a Venezuelan government-owned company involved in Smartmatic and Sequoia is -- is absurd. And the idiots at the United States Treasury who are refusing to investigate this and who permitted the sale to go ahead should be held accountable.</p><p>PILGRIM: It is truly unbelievable, Lou. And it absolutely needs to be re-examined.</p><p>DOBBS: Where is the State Department in this?</p><p>PILGRIM: We put in calls to the State Department, and they have not really responded in any way. They say they can't really comment on this.</p><p>DOBBS: They can't really comment? Can they do anything?</p><p>PILGRIM: I'm not sure.</p><p>DOBBS: Kitty, thank you very much.</p><p>Remarkable. Terrific reporting.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Taking a look now at some of your thoughts.</p><p>Julie in South Carolina, \"Lou, where can I get a copy of the gay agenda? I've never seen a copy of it and neither have any of my gay or lesbian friends.\"</p><p>Dan in Florida, \"I really do believe if we focused on health car and the approximately 50 million Americans who don't have health insurance instead of gay marriage, then the mental health of this country will improve.\"</p><p>Ella in North Carolina, \"Broken borders, broken promises, broken presidency, broken Congress. And I'm broke, born in the USA and looking for one of the jobs Americans won't do.\"</p><p>And Dixie in Oregon, I'm tired of hearing that illegals do the work that Americans won't. Yesterday, President Bush said foreign workers put roofs on in August. I have never heard of an American roofer that wouldn't put a roof on in August. Those statements are wrong and insulting to Americans.\"</p><p>We'll have more of your thoughts coming up here.

Google's Chinese Web site blocks topics communist authorities disapprove of such as democracy, Taiwan, human rights.</p><p>Now Google's co-founder, Sergey Brin, says the company compromised its principles by caving in to the communist government and its censors. He even says Google may change its policies and pull out of the market. We invited Sergey Brin to join us on the broadcast, to discuss the principles, upheld and broken.

Senator <person><nameText>Ben Nelson </nameText></person>of Nebraska isn't buying any of it. He's our guest.</p><p>And Republican Brian Bilbray ran against the president's amnesty agenda and won. He's headed for Congress tonight. He's our guest. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: In a moment, I'll be talking with Brian Bilbray, the winner of the special election in southern California and what his victory means for the president's amnesty program.</p><p>But, first, other important stories tonight. Six more of our troops have been killed in the war in Iraq, four were killed fighting insurgents and two were killed in what the military calls non-combat related. 2,481 of our troops have now been killed in this war. The United States today said Iran must stop enriching nuclear fuel during any negotiations on its nuclear weapons program, but it appears Iran could possibly be allowed to resume nuclear activities in the future.</p><p>And President Bush's efforts to convince Congress to support a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage failed. Supporters of the proposed amendment failed to win enough votes in a key procedural vote.</p><p>Tonight Brian Bilbray is heading back to Washington after winning yesterday's special congressional election in California's San Diego County. Bilbray, a former Republican Congressman beat Democratic opponent Francine Busby, 50 percent to 45.</p><p>He ran on a strict border security, anti-amnesty platform. His victory is evidence that illegal immigration will be a determinative issue in some, at least, in this year's midterm congressional elections. Brian Bilbray joins us tonight from San Diego. Good to have you with us, Mr. Congressman-elect.</p><p>BRIAN BILBRAY (R), CONGRESSMAN-ELECT OF CALIFORNIA: Thank you very much, Mr. Dobbs. DOBBS: The issue of border security, the issue of illegal immigration, in your judgment, how important to the outcome of the election?</p><p>BILBRAY: Absolutely essential. I mean, to the point of my campaign signs had written right across them tough on illegal immigration. I made it very clear the difference between my opponent and myself. She supported the amnesty proposal of the Senate, and I supported Mr. Sensenbrenner, that she supported Social Security benefits for illegals and I totally opposed it. And she supported automatic citizenship for the children of illegal aliens and I was the original sponsor of the birth right citizenship bill to stop that procedure.</p><p>DOBBS: The issues in San Diego, obviously, also go to Duke Cunningham's corruption and his sentencing for those misdeeds. There was an expectation, at least in the Democratic party, that the, quote, culture of corruption of Washington, D.C. would certainly enliven and enhance the campaign of Busby. How do the voters of San Diego county react to that issue?</p><p>BILBRAY: They react to the issue that the greatest scandal was not about Cunningham but actually about 11 million to 12 million illegal aliens in this country, demanding that law abiding Americans change our laws and that if you really want to talk about a culture of corruption, if you give amnesty to 11 million to 12 million, which we'll end up with 30 million or 40 million people here, because somebody broke the law, that's the way you create a culture of corruption, by rewarding people who have broken our immigration laws.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let me, if I may, ask you to watch and listen to this statement today, and our audience here to President Bush's words on amnesty. If we could roll that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm against amnesty. And, I understand words in politics and words are trying to frighten people, but if the comprehensive approach I've outlined when people think about it, it makes a lot of sense.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: The president today, Mr. Bilbray, your reaction. He says he's not talking about amnesty.</p><p>BILBRAY: If you look in the law dictionary, Black's, and look at what the '86 law said, and it said they paid a fine, they have to learn the language, they have to go through a process, exactly what's being proposed today. The law dictionary calls it amnesty.</p><p>And I don't think there's much more we have to say about that. It's almost the basis, I guess the Sonny Bono who is a good friend of mine, when I served in Congress, said what don't you get, what don't you understand about illegal? I guess the time has come that we have to tell people to look at the Black's legal dictionary and say what it is it you don't understand about amnesty.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you have been unequivocal and as clear as someone could ask you to be about the issue of a fence along our southern border, saying it should be built from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico. What do you think the prospects will be for that occurring?</p><p>BILBRAY: Well, Mr. Dobbs, you got to understand I grew up on the Mexican border. I grew up right north of Tijuana, and I saw the crime and the problems before Duncan Hunter built the fence in the neighbors down there.</p><p>One of the most dangerous neighborhoods in America, the Tijuana River Valley, is now one of the safest, because Mr. Hunter was brave enough to get the United States government and the National Guard to build a fence there, and I think we should build it, when and where we need it, everywhere we need it.</p><p>DOBBS: Brian Bilbray, congratulations on your victory.</p><p>BILBRAY: Thank you very much.</p><p>DOBBS: Still ahead, President Bush in Nebraska today, as we've reported, pushing amnesty for illegal aliens. He won't find support from senator <person><nameText>Ben Nelson, </nameText></person>one of only four Democrats to oppose the Senate amnesty legislation. Senator Nelson will be here next.</p><p>Three of the nation's top political analysts join me to examine election results. Illegal immigration, the role of wedge issues in the upcoming midterm elections and campaigns. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: President Bush today in Nebraska pushing amnesty for illegal aliens, but Senator <person><nameText>Ben Nelson, </nameText></person>Democrat of Nebraska, says the president's amnesty push is a danger to this nation, and it must be defeated.</p><p>Senator Nelson is one of only four Democrats who voted against the Senate's so-called comprehensive immigration reform legislation last month, joining Senator Robert Byrd, Senator Byron Dorgan and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan to reject the illegal alien amnesty bill. Senator Nelson joins us tonight from Capitol Hill.</p><p>Senator, good to have you here.</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>BEN NELSON </nameText></person>(D), NEBRASKA: It's my pleasure, Lou. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: The president today making much in your home state of the fact that amnesty isn't amnesty. How do you react?</p><p>NELSON: Well, I just have to, quote, let's say, Senator Grassley and former Attorney General Meese, who were back here in '86, when the amnesty bill was passed, and they said it was amnesty then, and it's amnesty now. So I think that we're -- it's more than being worried about words. You have to focus on what it is that they are trying to do. And what we are going to have is a bill that the Senate passed that you can't square with the House version in conference. There are problems that are already arising in the conference.</p><p>And if you don't do that, we're not going to secure our borders so you're going to have more illegal immigrants coming across the borders, you're going to have more meth in Nebraska, and that's a big issue. Eighty percent of our meth comes from Mexico.</p><p>DOBBS: Mexico is the principal source -- not only in Nebraska, but nationwide ...</p><p>NELSON: Nationwide.</p><p>DOBBS: ... of meth, of heroin, cocaine and marijuana. And we still do not have our borders secured four-and-a-half, almost five years now after September 11. The United States Congress, the United States Senate, the president of the United States, have not seen fit to secure our borders on purely national security grounds, leaving illegal immigration out of it. How in the world are American voters to react, whether Republican or Democrat?</p><p>NELSON: Well, I think, you know, what the American people are asking for is to shut the back door to illegal immigration so you can open the front door to legal immigration. But to do that, you've got to secure the borders first.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>NELSON: And this do-everything bill that seems to be hanging up the conference is going to end up where we don't have any action to secure our borders.</p><p>DOBBS: Senator, let me show you something, and all of us something, and ask you to listen to this. This is what the president was saying today, in your -- in Nebraska, about employment of illegal aliens.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Amnesty means you are automatically a citizen. I don't think that makes sense. It's not fair to those who have waited legally. We got a lot of people waiting to be citizens here, and they've done -- they've adhered to our laws, and they are in line.</p><p>They are in a citizenship line, and I think it would be unfair to those who have been here legally to say to those who have been here illegally that these folks get ahead of you in line. That doesn't make any sense to me, if we're a country that's going to uphold laws.</p><p>I guarantee you many employers here in the state of Nebraska, people in the agricultural sector, people in the hospitality sector, understand the need to have a rational plan that will enable them to have somebody here on a temporary basis to do the jobs Americans aren't doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Senator, your reaction to the president's comments?</p><p>NELSON: Well, I think the president is trying to impress upon the American people how important immigrant labor is, but we can have that immigrant labor legally as opposed to illegally, and that's what I think we're all trying to do.</p><p>Shut the back door to illegal immigration through securing the borders and open the front door. We understand the need that we have in this great country for legal immigration, for the work that they are doing. But we need to make sure that it's legal.</p><p>DOBBS: You're a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. We have taken a look at a number of studies, because one of the protests is that we need guest-worker programs and that we have to have low- wage competition, the lowest end of the wage scale in this country, so that people can benefit from labor that is, frankly -- let's be honest about it -- being exploited here, illegal aliens in particular.</p><p>But our review of the research shows that if you raised wages by about $7 an hour, above the $9 right now in produce in particular, that would add 10 cents to a head of lettuce in this country. Isn't that a small price to pay for the dignity of the workers, whether they are from Mexico, the United States, wherever they may be from, and consumers in this country?</p><p>NELSON: Well, we're caught in an unusual situation. Obviously, we want to be competitive in the world with our agriculture, and so they are very concerned about having the cost of -- the input costs go up and they want to keep it at the lowest possible level.</p><p>But I do think that you the could bring workers in, and at a reasonable level of compensation, still accomplish, as you're suggesting. But, that's a very difficult thing, and it's going to take some time with agriculture to be able to make this work. But, we can do it with legal immigration, not with illegal immigration.</p><p>DOBBS: And that depends, as we've discussed, on the reforming immigration based on the ability to control it, which can only be founded on control and security of our borders and ports.</p><p>NELSON: There is a way to do this, and that is to split the whole immigration legislation into two pieces.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>NELSON: The border security first, that piece could be put in place. And then the rest of it could be held in abeyance until the border is secured.</p><p>DOBBS: But, senator now ...</p><p>NELSON: Then you can work your way through it. DOBBS: ... senator Kennedy and Senator McCain and Senator Specter and Senator Frist, the president, they would be in horror that you wouldn't be talking about comprehensive then.</p><p>NELSON: I have a great deal of respect for the president and my colleagues, I just happen to disagree, but I think you can do this.</p><p>DOBBS: Senator, I think you're right. There's so much that could be done with just a little reason and some leadership. Hopefully, somebody's listening to you. Senator <person><nameText>Ben Nelson, </nameText></person>thanks for being here.</p><p>NELSON: Thank you, Lou. It's great to be you.</p><p>DOBBS: A reminder now to vote in our poll. If you had to base your vote in November on one of these issues -- we know it's unrealistic but for the purpose of sort of trying to understand what everybody's thinking right now, if you had to base your vote on one issue right now, what it would be?

He ran very hard on the issue. His opponent was pretty weak on the issue. But, more important, it is a Republican district and he ran on Republican issues. He also talked about fiscal control. He ran away from the president. Asked Cheney not to come into the district and he said I'm going to be the kind of Republican that I was when I was there with Newt Gingrich.</p><p>DOBBS: And John McCain stiffed the guy, while at the same time endorsing him, he was supposed to make an appearance, Juan, he went away to talk about immigration to a Hispanic activist group rather than joining up with Bilbray, because he wouldn't support the McCain/Kennedy bill.</p><p>JUAN GONZALEZ, NEW YORK DAILY NEWS: But I don't think that the Bilbray vote was exactly a mandate in a strong Republican district. He spent twice as much money as the Democratic candidate.</p><p>DOBBS: Whether we are talking about Bilbray, any other election of the president of the United States, I'm not one of those guys, Juan, who believes in mandates for any election.</p><p>GONZALEZ: But what I'm saying is that I'm shocked that on the platform that he ran, such a heavily Republican district with so much money, that he barely got 50 percent of the vote.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes but my gosh, he had started out with 15 percent of the primary, right? Fifteen percent in the primary. He built quite a -- just about 35 percent to get there. That was a pretty remarkable performance.</p><p>DIANA WEST, WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, I think what would have been significant, Lou, is had he lost, then we would have been able to say border security is not a winning issue, and running against the president is not...</p><p>DOBBS: ... Is a bad idea?</p><p>WEST: Right. And there was a third candidate in the race who got just five percent of the vote, but he was also a border security...</p><p>DOBBS: Right. But the minutemen and others backed away from that independent candidate. But the issue is culture of corruption. What's going on here, Juan? Is there just so much corruption in both parties that that's not going to play?</p><p>GONZALEZ: Yes, I don't think that sticks. Democrats don't go very far hanging corruption on the Republicans when the culture of Washington is corruption for both parties. So I don't think that is one that's going to get much traction, for any candidates.</p><p>ROLLINS: The only thing that was very telling, is with the exception of Iowa, voter turnout was dramatically low. Big gubernatorial primary in California, dismal turnout. I think voters across this country are really perturbed at the whole process and the way that they're showing it \"I'm not going to participate.\" And if this continues in November, and November may very well turn out into an anti-incumbent, it may, \"I don't like any of them, I'm not going to vote for any or them or I'm going to vote against them, who are there.\"</p><p>DOBBS: You might be a mistake being anti-incumbent, but it would be a smaller mistake. Dana, the president, the secretary of state coming out with a plan for Iran, with, of course, Russia, China, and the European Union offering nuclear technology to Iran so long as they don't enrich uranium. Good idea?</p><p>WEST: Bad idea. In fact, I personally voted against it in 2004, because John Kerry had the same idea. It was in his prescription for what I will do as president.</p><p>DOBBS: Now say that again.</p><p>WEST: It was quite shocking. John Kerry promised that as president, he would provide peaceful, so-called, nuclear technology to Iran in concert with other powers. And in order to ferret out their true intentions. So now we see this replaying two years later in a Bush term, and it's terrible.</p><p>DOBBS: We're going to be back with Diana West, Juan Gonzalez and Ed Rollins in just one moment. We'll have the results of our polls. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: We're back with our panel, Juan Gonzalez, let me ask you. Going forward the president is saying his amnesty plan isn't amnesty. He's saying that 6,000 national guardsmen on the border is enough. How is this going to play?</p><p>GONZALEZ: My view of this bill right now, we agree on one thing. I think the Senate bill should be killed. Both bills should be killed. I think that at this stage, that the concessions that have already been made by the Senate in their version of immigration reform are so extreme at this point that I favor...</p><p>DOBBS: The concessions?</p><p>GONZALEZ: ... yes, I favor defeating the bill. I favor defeating the bill and let the elections go on in November and revisit this issue with a new Congress next year. Because the bill that's going to come out of the Sensenbrenner/King reconciliation is going to be much closer to the Sensenbrenner/King bill than it is the current Senate version, if anything comes out.</p><p>DOBBS: What about Senator <person><nameText>Ben Nelson's</nameText></person> idea? Let's secure the borders first and then deal with illegal immigration? You won't go for that?</p><p>GONZALEZ: Well, you're acting as if the two things are separate. The reason why there has been such an increase in illegal immigration is because we don't have a clear and open policy of getting more illegal immigrants here.</p><p>How many times have we deported millions of Mexicans? 1950s, Operation Wetback. 1930s, a few million Mexicans were sent back then. The immigration policy constantly changes depending on the political forces at play in Washington.</p><p>DOBBS: Diana West, I want to give you the last word.</p><p>WEST: Well, I think that immigration policies change according to the needs of the country.</p><p>ROLLINS: The last -- I'm sorry.</p><p>DOBBS: Go ahead.</p><p>WEST: Well, and I think the needs of the country are yet to be determined, which is why there is so much turmoil over this bill.</p><p>DOBBS: Ed once awhile, you get the last word.</p><p>ROLLINS: The last word is that election yesterday will basically embolden Republicans in the House and they're not going to back off where they are, so it's the Sensenbrenner bill or it's nothing.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Better nothing.</p><p>DOBBS: Better nothing says Juan Gonzalez. Ed Rollins, thank you very much for being here. Juan, thank you very much, Diana West, thank you very much, appreciate it.</p><p>WEST: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Finally tonight, the results of our poll. And 24 percent of you say if you had to base your vote in November on one of these issues, and we understand it's unrealistic to even suggest such a thing, but it would be based on border security -- 47 percent said illegal immigration, 21 percent said the war in Iraq, one percent gay marriage, eight percent said the economy. Now those are interesting results and we appreciate you taking the time to vote.</p><p>Taking a look at a few more of your thoughts.</p><p>Marshall in Oklahoma: Lou, I wonder if it would improve the current catch and release program if illegals were held accountable for not returning to their hearings. I know it was just a dream.</p><p>And Joseph in California: Lou, you need to work on expanding your vocabulary. It seems that recently you've been using the word \"insane\" entirely too much.</p><p>I apologize.</p><p>Ed Marcella in Florida: What a great president we have. He secured our borders and saved our marriages, all in one day. Mission accomplished again.</p><p>And Jeff in Arizona: Lou, is it our immigration system that's broken or the Congress and the office of the president? Enforce our borders, ports and laws. Could it be any more simple?</p><p>Thank you for your thoughts, send them to us at LouDobbs.com. Each of you whose e-mail is read here receives a copy of my book, \"Exporting America.\" We thank you for being with us here tonight. Please join us tomorrow when Ann Coulter will join me.</p><p>She's launched a blistering attack against the September 11th widows and other outrageous statements. We'll find out why. Please join us.

He will be in now for Trish.  Ashley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX NEWS HOST:  That's what I tell everybody.  I don't know  if anyone believes it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  I believe it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEBSTER:  Thank you very much, Neil.</p><p>Well, we will see that finalized version of the Republican tax bill in just  a few hours from now.  Lawmakers making last minute changes, specifically  the child tax credit, following Senator Marco Rubio's threat to vote no on  that bill if the credit is not expanded.  But it is still a little bit  unclear if this is enough to secure a yes vote from Rubio.  We'll talk  about that.</p><p>But the uncertainty over tax reform having little impact on the market  today, as you can see another nice rally, the Dow up a 156 points, 24,664.   Remarkable.  Good afternoon, everybody.  I'm Ashley Webster.  In today for  Trish Regan to the -- and we begin now with \"The Intelligence Report.</p><p>Let's get right to it.  Republicans can only afford, we know this, to lose  two GOP senators if they want to get this tax bill passed.</p><p>And well, there are a handful that, well, we could see are on the fence  right now, including Senators Mike Lee, Bob Corker, what about Jeff Flake?   So the question is, can they get it done?  We'll be asking former Utah  Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  He is here in the studio with us.</p><p>Plus, President Trump, blasting the FBI handling of the Hillary Clinton  email scandal.  The President even calling that probe rig and that he's  ever seen anything like this before.  I have more on that in just a few  minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to our very own Adam Shapiro for the latest on this tax  reform fight.  The clock is ticking.  Adam, is this thing going to get  through?</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  When you speak to talk to people  at the administration and on Capitol Hill that's a very simple yes.  They  expect it to pass.</p><p>Now, where we stand right now, we do expect Marco Rubio to vote yes on this  bill because he has gotten a decisional $300 for the child tax credit  refund that he wanted.  This would come against through payroll taxes on  the first -- what is it?  Roughly zero to $25,000 in income.  In simple  terms, if you don't have federal income tax liability he wanted to increase  the amount you would get back for a child tax credit.</p><p>So he is seems to have achieve that.  And as a member of the Conference  Committee, the source close to conference committee, he told me we'll give  him what he wants and he'll be yes.</p><p>The other two though, the undecided are Senator Flake and Senator Corker.   Even if they were to vote no, that still may not be enough to kill the bill  and there is all kind of calculations that go into it.  But everyone is  expecting a yes next week.</p><p>Now, what we know at this point, according to Representative Jordan as well  a Kevin Brady, the Conference Committee is done.  They have signed the  report.  It is closed, and we will find out when it is filed publicly at  5:30, the exact details in there that they will vote upon next week.  But  here is what Kevin Brady said just moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  I'm  confident at end of the day, the Senate will approve this Conference  Committee report because, no one should be defending the status quo in this  horrible tax code.  Americans have had to live for with for too long.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  But the key question everybody has, as exactly what kind of  changes were made?  For instance, we know the top income tax bracket was  lowered to 37 percent but what about other tax brackets, remember, the  Senate version had seven brackets whereas the House had four brackets.</p><p>Well, President Trump says, he has been kept the prize of everything that's  going on with the bill.  And here is what he said before he went to speak  at FBI graduation ceremony this morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have seen it.  I think  it's going to do very, very well.  I think that we are going to be in a  position to pass something as early as next week which will be monumental.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think they will be great.  They're great people.  They want to  see it done.  We're putting in a tremendous child tax credit.  And it is  increasing on a daily basis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So the bottom line answer to your question is everybody at least  on the administration and on Capitol Hill with an R next to their name, an  R for Republican is expecting this to pass.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We shall see, yes.  Adam, thank you very much for the latest.</p><p>Joining me now here at the studio, Fox News Contributor and former Utah  Congressman Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>Jason, thank you so much for being here.  We just got a note from Chad  Pergram, the Senior Producer for Fox News, he says Jeff Flake, Bob Corker,  Mike Lee, all three still undecided on this bill.  What do you think, how  does this play out?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh I think ultimately Marco Rubio,  Jeff Flake and Mike Lee will be a yes.  I don't think they will going to be  the last person standing putting up a blockade on this.  I think -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Would you want to be as a no -- </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think they will.  I think the child tax credit is  actually the way it is structured is bad public policy but nevertheless  they did coalesce and get behind that, and support it, and expand it.  But  the ones who watch are Corker, Collins and McCain.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Only lose two as we talked about -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Ultimately I do think it happens.  And I think by the time you  get to the end of the day Tuesday, perhaps Wednesday, it will have passed.   But hours later the funding of government will be the issue -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  The appropriations.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  The euphoric high that will being tax reform passing will be  demolished within hours when they get to the reality of how to fund the  government.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I want to get that in a minute.  But I want to get back to Marco  Rubio.  Some of this red line from him came out of nowhere.  Were you  surprised?  I think or Republican leadership was a little surprised?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, we always knew that Mike Lee and Marco Rubio were very  intent on doing it.  They did put it up for a vote and it failed.  But they  held the line.  And it's the way you get attention is hold out a no vote.   You keep saying no, no.  And suddenly the White House and everybody from  leadership and the -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  --- Ways and Means and Senate Finance come over and say what can  we do?  And he managed to get another $300 in there.  And for those  families it will make a difference, but again I think the public policy  side of it is wrong.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So this gets through.  Bob Corker's opposition has been the  expense.  What are we doing about spending as the deficit gets larger and  larger?  As conservative, are you worried about that?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, I wish he was more concern about the deficit on the  spending side.  I don't think you have to justify allowing the American  people to hold their own money in their own pockets.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But what you do have to do is make tough choices, and stop  spending so much money.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And this Republican Congress, House and Senate have been  terrible in actually cutting spending.  Name anything that they have cut?   And the answer is zero.  There is nothing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You're right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  There is nothing and I think that it is wrong to say, well, you  know, if times get tough that we raise taxes.  That's exactly the wrong  time to raise taxes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But you have to curve back spending up which they have done  nothing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So listen, this is going to be the first major legislative  success for the GOP if they can get this done.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We believe they will.  You never know.  It ain't over until it's  over.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Going into next year, I think attention will probably turns to  infrastructure.  Any issues with that?  Should that get through?  That  shouldn't be a big political football, should it?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, you've increased defense spending now to $664 billion.   And I do think the continuing resolution will fund that through the end of  September of 2018.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You have the infrastructure spending that you have to do as a  supplemental, they call it, it's like the term in Congress for the disaster  relief because of Irma and other hurricanes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yeah.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  That's going to approach $100 billion over time.  I don't know  where you go back and say, now we're going to infuse, you know, tens, if  not 100 plus billion dollars in infrastructure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It all sounds great until you actually look at the red line and  you see -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  You have to pay for it.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  How you pay for it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Is that where you bring in the private sector.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, you do want to have public/private partnerships.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But the government has to kick in to pay a lot?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.  And states also have to be involved.  But you have to  figure out where to go, to make those hard choices and say, instead of  spending money here, let's spend it over here.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  That's going to be a contentious discussion.  Although I do  think Democrats want to come to the table on that, because it is something  they do want.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Do you miss it?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I miss part of the fight.  I miss the people.  You know, I have  good friend there that -- you know from Tim Scott to Trey Gowdy and John  Radcliffe, and Mia Love and other, I miss interacting with but -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  What don't you miss?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Fund-raising.  I hate fund-raising.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You're always in that move?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'd always -- and got a better balance to my life and -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  -- and nice little perch here with my relationship with Fox so.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's nice.  But, you know, listen, a lot of people from it  across this country look and say, why is it so dysfunctional?  Is it  dysfunctional?  Certainly appears to be a lot of the time.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I think in part it was structured that way by our founders.</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It's not supposed to be a glide path to making this pass an  easy.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Sure.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You got 535 people with big egos all wanting to make decisions  and have their hands in the pot.  It's an ugly sausage-making process.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But it seems the environment is so much more contentious as it  has been.  I know it has been over the years, since day one, but it does  seem very much either you're with us or you're not.  There is not a lot of  compromise.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I wish people would stick to their principle whether their party  was in power or not in power.  Because I see both sides of the aisle  suddenly they flip on a principle -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Because now they're in the minority.  You know, and that just  drives you nuts.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You got your life back financially.  That's the most important  thing.  Jason, thank you very much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Turning to our other top story now, President Trump blasting the  FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal.  The President even  calling that probe rigged.  He used that word.  And that he has never seen  anything like it before.</p><p>Well, for the very latest bring let's in our own Blake Burman, he's been  following this from the White House.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Ashley.  And I asked  the President earlier today as he was leaving the White House whether or  not he thought the special counsel is biased, which is what many  Republicans here in Washington up on Capitol Hill have alleged.</p><p>The President was not willing earlier today to engage in that possibility  when I asked him about it.  However, he did use it as a launching pad to  sharply criticize the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email  investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Whatever you want to call it, you going to make up your own  determination, but they have found tremendous things on the other side.   When you look at the Hillary Clinton investigation that was -- you know,  I've been saying it for a long time.  That was a rigged system, folks.   That was a rigged system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now those comments came a day after Senator Ron Johnson claimed in  a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray, that James Comey's July statement  which eventually cleared Clinton from any criminal wrongdoing had been  watered down with three edits.  One edit said, it was \"possible that  hostile actors\" gained access to Clinton's private server, a downgrade from  \"reasonably likely.\"</p><p>Now Ashley, it is unclear exactly who made those edits, why they made those  edits and when they made those edits.  Senator Johnson in that letter said,  he did not know exactly when the edits were made, those exact dates.  So on  one hand it could have just been potentially the normal investigative work  as more information comes in, you make changes to your findings.  Or it  could have been as some have suggested that the FBI was in it, some at  least to help out Hillary Clinton.  Ashley?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, indeed.  All right, Blake Burman, thank you very much for  the latest on this.</p><p>Joining me now, Criminal Defense Attorney and former prosecutor, David  Bruno and American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.</p><p>Thank you both, gentlemen, for being here.  David, let me begin with you.</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Sure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You say that the underlying conduct by Director Comey and his  officials is troubling and may be criminal.  Where does the line get  crossed a bit for it to be criminal?</p><p>BRUNO:  Well, right now, there is an inspector general investigation that  is going on and we will be getting the report shortly.  But the most  troubling aspect of this is the edits that we just heard about in the  memorandum.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BRUNO:  Because one of the edits took away the language in the federal  statute that would have made a crime for Hillary Clinton to abuse the  classified documents.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BRUNO:  And that's gross negligence.  It was originally included and for  whatever reason by whoever it was modified, it was redacted and it was  changed to careless.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right, which got Hillary Clinton off the hook, essentially.</p><p>BRUNO:  Sure.  If you get away from gross negligence into carelessness,  it's no longer a federal crime.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, Ned, let me get to you, I was reading your talking  points, you have some strong views on this.  You were saying look, you talk  about Mueller's team, a partisan pack of wolves.  You say -- </p><p>NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  That's right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- the findings are chilling.  Kind if expand on that a little  bit.  What was the moats troubling aspect of this?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, first of all, I mean, I think it's becoming very clear over  the last couple weeks that Mueller's team is partisan pack of wolves.  When  you look at Peter Strzok, when you look at Andrew Weissmann, when you look  at Jeannie Rhee and now you look at Aaron Zebley, I mean, I'm very hard  press to think that these people are objective and I think our biases to  influence a lot of our decisions as human being.</p><p>So to say that it's person I think it's understatement but even more so,  Ashley, I think what we're seeing it the unfolding -- unwrapping of what I  think is one of the biggest political crimes we've seen in our history, in  which our government and a political party colluded together to undermine  and to destroy and nullify the election of the other party.</p><p>And so I think when we look at this, all of the American people, they  should find this chilling.  They should be deeply concerned about what's  taking place inside of their government and I there's more to come, Ashley.   I think we're going to see more revelations coming out in the coming weeks  in which people will start to fully understand, this is not good.</p><p>And I will say this, if Mike Pompeo and Jeff Sessions and Christopher Wray  are concerned about the constitution and the civil liberties of the  American people, they will protect those and not the institution.  They  should be more concerned about our freedom than protecting institutions.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, David, look, we all have our own opinions, our own  political leanings, if you like, and OK, so these FBI investigators have  their own political likes but the line seems to me -- there were certain  excerpts from some of these texts or emails where they say look, they make  reference to the point that we need some sort of insurance policy just to  make sure this guy, i.e., Donald Trump doesn't get elected.  To me that  crosses the line.</p><p>BRUNO:  Yes.  OK.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, we can't take the risk.  You know, to Ned's point,  there's almost, you know -- people talk about the deep state conspiracy, I  mean, this really smells -- doesn't smell right, let me put it that way.</p><p>BRUNO:  I agree with you.  There is nothing wrong with a bias so long as it  doesn't result in actions that are against the law.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right?</p><p>BRUNO:  Right, so -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Change the course of history maybe.</p><p>BRUNO:  So generally speaking the fact that one has a political affiliation  is not a problem, however, if it goes to the next step and like you said,  in the August text messages with agent Strzok talks about an insurance  policy.  And it also talks about a discussion in Andrew's office.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>BRUNO:  That could be Andrew McCabe.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.</p><p>BRUNO:  About the election which could be a hatch violation.  Hatch  violations are when the government talks about political affairs or gets  involved in political actions.  Possible hatch violation if that in fact  took place.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So Ned, I mean, you obviously believe we should have an  investigation of the investigators.  I mean, how should this be playing  out?  Should Mueller be coming out and addressing this right away?</p><p>RYUN:  I think when this -- Well, I do.  At this point though, I was  talking with the former DOJ official, and he said I still actually respect  Mueller but I will find any of his findings, not believable.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>RYUN:  And so I think you've got a credibility problem.  But Ashley, even  more importantly what do we even talking about with this investigation as a  whole?  I believe it was started on false pretenses, a fake dossier that  spun all of this up.  And so I would actually argue that the instigation as  a whole, regardless of the partisan nature of the team is illegitimate in  of itself.  And so I think we need to start having that conversations  about, is this investigation even a legitimate one moving forward?</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  What do you say, David?</p><p>BRUNO:  Well, I talked about the inspector general before.  Right now the  inspector general is reviewing the Hillary Clinton FBI investigation.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BRUNO:  And the inspector general's office is the watchdog over the DOJ.   So if there is any impropriety going on in the Mueller investigation right  now, there will be a review at some point by the inspector general.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Ned, you know, what we want and what we're not getting is we want  some sunlight on this.  And we want transparency.</p><p>RYUN:  That's right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  How do we do that?  What should be done from this point forward?</p><p>RYUN:  We declassify.  I think the only way that the people of America can  start to trust the DOJ and the FBI again, is I think we need to have some  extreme transparency.  I think we need to go back and declassify a lot of  what took place over the last eight years.</p><p>I know that people again, the heads of these departments right now might  not be comfortable doing that, but Ashley, I that is only way we can get  back to having trust and faith in these institutions is to really  declassify.  What happened with Clinton and Loretta Lynch on that tarmac in  Arizona?  What really did happened with Comey's clearing of Hillary  Clinton?  What happened with Peter Strzok?  The only way we get to that we  have to declassify.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And of course, David, in the background of all of this is we have  the Russia investigation.  The collusion which the President addressed  earlier today when you're saying, there is no collusion.  What have you  found so far?  They haven't anything, right?</p><p>BRUNO:  Right.  I mean, well, we don't know, right?  We have multiple  indictments -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  We've been going on for a long time.</p><p>BRUNO:  We have a couple indictments.  We have to two police (ph), one by  George Papadopoulos and Mike Flynn.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But directly link to -- </p><p>BRUNO:  Right.  And that is pending.  It's going on.  We don't know.  We  will see at this point, absolutely.  We have not seen any collusion or  conspiracy that goes right to the White House.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, Ned, how long does this go on for?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, this -- but the point I want to make is, we've had this thing  going on for at least a year-and-a-half, almost two yes.  And I've made  this argument to people.  Use your common sense.  You had heads of  intelligence agencies that didn't like Trump.  You have a deep state  bureaucracy that doesn't like Trump.  And yet, the opposition party, the  mainstream media that doesn't like him.  If there was actually something  there, don't you think we would have heard of it right now?</p><p>And so I'd argue, again there is nothing evidence there is many evidence  that never will be evidence, of the fairy tale of Trump-Russia collusion.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, we have to leave it right there.  David, Ned, thank  you so much.  Great conversation.  I really appreciate it.</p><p>BRUNO:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Take a look at the market today and by the way, nice rally going  on, the Dow up 163 points.  We're at 24,670 on the Dow.  The S&amp;P up one  percent, the Nasdaq also going great guns, up at more than one percent, up  6938 on the Nasdaq.</p><p>All right, we'll have more on the markets and so much more after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Now, check it out, stocks broadly higher today with the Dow up  triple digits.  We had session highs just a few seconds ago.  In fact,  there is a new Intraday record for the Dow.  It seems like we say it every  day.  Investor reacting to some positive earnings and retail sales, and  guess what?  Our very own Nicole Petallides live at always at the New York  Stock Exchange, with more on a buying spree this Friday, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  That's right.  It is heavy volume.   It is quadruple-witching.  And we have some rebalancing.  I'm just telling  you it's going to be a really heavy volume day.</p><p>In addition to that, right now we're up 160 points on the Dow Jones  Industrial average, near our session highs.  We're clocking in another  winning week, right?  So the Dow will be up four weeks in a row and at the  close, it will be our 69th record, which will tied the all-time amount of  closing records for any given year, which is back in 1995.  If we have one  more after this, Ash, we will go down in history as most records ever.</p><p>We're talking a looking, not only as the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P which  have up arrows.  But you can see, since Election Day, the Dow Jones  Industrial average up about 35 percent, the S&amp;P up about 25 percent.  So we  certainly have enjoyed a nice run.  It was a lot obviously built in on tax  reform and the overall, which certainly seems to going well today, on the  latest amendments that have been made on the child tax reform to appeal  Rubio and Lee -- Senators Rubio and Lee.</p><p>So that's -- while taking a look at Costco, and Adobe, both of which had  positive quarterly earnings, look at Costco up 3.5 percent, Adobe 1.6  percent, new high there by the way for Costco taking a look at some of the  other retailers, big picture cracks up 17 percent, getting an upgrade over  at Stifel, Nicolaus and just talking about their exposure abroad and that  does well.</p><p>Remember when the stock is 75 bucks about 10 years ago?  Forget that, how  about you focus on this, great day today, Under Armour some positive  comments there from the analysts as well and also foot locker getting an  upgrade and getting the margins, going forward we'll watch the margins.   You can see that too was a winner.</p><p>Overall, we will say that Moody has talked about the run up, recent run-up  that we've seen in retail.  It might be exhaustive.  So we'll see that the  latest retail sales numbers, Ashley, were pretty great.  I mean, they were  showing straight to people, spending on things that they don't really need,  furniture, electronics, sporting good, books, music.  So the latest numbers  were pretty good showing holiday shoppers were hitting the stores.  Back to  you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I always need electronics.  I'm just saying, I'm a kind of gadget  guy, Nicole.  So it's always an excuse to buy electronics.  I love it.   Anyway, thank you so much.  Great stuff.  Who knows, Dow 25,000 by  Christmas?  Maybe.</p><p>Meanwhile, backlash today over the roll back of Obama-era net neutrality  rules, with all the hysteria out there, you think, well the internet as we  know it is coming to an end.  Our own Deirdre Bolton is here to cut through  all the noise.  And she will be next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  We are just getting word from our colleagues at Fox News that  Marco Rubio is indeed a yes now on the tax bill.  He got what he wanted, a  bump in that refund on the child tax credit.  He is in on board, we are  told, still, we don't know about Bob Corker, Mike Lee, Jeff Flake, Susan  Collins, still some questions to be answered.  But Marco Rubio essentially  got what he wanted.  Now he says yes to the tax bill.</p><p>Also the FCC voting to end net neutrality rules guarantying equal access to  the internet.  Now most experts say, these changes won't have much impact  in the short term.  Others are resorting to complete hysteria.</p><p>CNN actually reported this as, the \"End of the internet.\"  Sentiments  shared by Senator Bernie Sanders who tweeted Congress and the courts need  to fight back.</p><p>Meanwhile, others have said this is attack on LBGT community.  Some on  Twitter even said we will going to die.</p><p>I kid you not.  Deirdre Bolton is here now.  Deirdre --</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, we're all going to die  at some point but it is not in direct relation to repeal of -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  But should we be in a panic?  Come on.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, listen, it is not the end of the internet as we know with the  soundtrack, right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  But it is the beginning of a huge fight.</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p>BOLTON:  So you have 20 states attorney generals, they've lined up to sue  the FCC calling the agency's move, a violation of the law and a serious  threat to the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>So here is a map.  We made a list of states that are beginning to take a  legal action against the FCC.  So I'm not going to read all the names.  But  you can see them, north, south, east, west more adding themselves as we  speak.</p><p>So the tech community going bonkers.  Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg,  Microsoft's Brad Smith, execs from Google, Airbnb, a whole list, speaking  out.  This is Netflix's statement as further tweet this morning.  \"We're  disappointed in the decision to gut net neutrality protections that ushered  in an unprecedented era of innovation, creativity and civic engagement.   This is the beginning of a longer legal battle.  Netflix stands with  innovators, large and small, to oppose this misguided FCC order.\"</p><p>Now Netflix, other big tech companies, they're taking a stand on the vote  on principle because the service providers such as Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T,  they can charge Netflix more money because Netflix uses more internet  capacity when we all binge watch our shows.  But it doesn't matter, Netflix  can pay.</p><p>So the reason big tech is fighting the FCC is because big tech says the  vote kills innovation.  So for example, if there is future competitor out  there to Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix trying to build itself up now, a  fledgling company, the arguments goes would not even be able to get off the  ground and afford the fees that a Verizon, or a Comcast, or an AT&amp;T would  have the power to demand.</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, he calls Silicon Valley a bunch of hypocrites.  Here  is part of his statement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AJIT PAI, FCC CHAIRMAN:  Companies likes Facebook, and Amazon, and Netflix,  and Google, became global giants precisely because the government wasn't  involved.  That's part of reason why I think so much of this hysteria is  simply misplaced.  As we will see going forward, getting this regulatory  system, right, means better, faster cheaper internet access for all  Americans across the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  So that is the FCC Chair.  So actually he's kind of like -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Ajit Pai -- so basically he says, this will enable, get  government out of the way.</p><p>BOLTON:  Yeah.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It will enable the internet providers to get more money, if I  want to pay for faster internet.  I can, it's not like, the internet is  going away.</p><p>BOLTON:  So that's exactly the point.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I can pay more if I want to.</p><p>BOLTON:  So he has two offshoots.  That first statement is very true.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  Actually Portugal is a live experiment in that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p>BOLTON:  So people there, they pay for tiered internet access much as we  pay for tiered cable access.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  It's essentially the same system, just with a different product.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Got it.</p><p>BOLTON:  Ajit Pai's second point, he is libertarian.  So he just by  definition, by philosophy is for less regulation.  And he says, Verizon,  Comcast, AT&amp;T, the service providers.  He said they don't really have a  financial incentive to invest or to build in underserved areas, be they  rural or low income earner -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Right, this would give them the money to do it?</p><p>BOLTON:  Well, I think his argument is that if they can make money and  other ways charging Netflix or Facebook, then they will take that money,  and build out broadband and maybe areas that are not as well-served.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So bottom line is, it is not the end of world as we know it.  We  are all going to die at some point but not as a result of the FCC -- OK,  very good.  Deirdre, thank you very much.  Good stuff.</p><p>U.N.

When you think of  a company, right, and their stock price, if they produce x-amount of units  one year and the same amount of units the next year and the stock price  goes up, and the economic doubles and economic productivity hasn't changed,  the capital haven't changed with the company, we say that company is  overvalued.  But Bitcoin is not a company.  It's a network.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  By the way you can watch the entire interview with the twins  tonight on \"Wall Street Week\" right here on Fox Business at 8:00 p.m.  Eastern Time.  Don't miss that.</p><p>U.S. envoy Nikki Haley says the Trump administration now has proof that  Iran is expanding its nuclear program and meddling in the Yemeni Civil War.   And that came in the form of a charred piece of recovered ballistic  missile.  Take a look at that press conference in Washington yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.:  When you look at this missile,  this is terrifying, this is absolutely terrifying.  And this is why it has  to stop.  We have said multiple times, that this is not just about the  nuclear program.  This is about everything else they're doing because Iran  believes that they have been given a pass.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  So, did Iran really violate the nuclear deal?  Here to discuss,  Fox News Foreign Affairs analyst Dr. Walid Phares.  Walid, thank you so  much for joining us.</p><p>So I notice that you said from Nikki Haley's conversations yesterday was  one of the most advanced policy declarations on Iran by U.S. officials to  date.  Explain.</p><p>DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANALYST:  It was really because  Ambassador Haley after the speech of President in Riyadh a few months ago  has pushed the explanation of what the U.S. position is very clearly.</p><p>Number one, Iran is now plotted to have been using those missiles through  the militias via Yemen.  And, you look at the video that the public has  seen, and you see the actual missiles.  So that is a very important point.</p><p>Number two, there is an interpretation, an American interpretation that  those missiles are now deployed outside of Iran, which means that one of  the actions that the U.S. is seeking from the international community and  from the allies is to stop the shipping of those missiles and other  equipment outside Iran which will tell me more about what's behind the  horizons.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It seems like the U.S. is a little bit alone on this.  I will get  into Saudi Arabia in a minute but you know, the Europeans, they continue to  take this softly, softly approach, and believe that the U.S. is off kilter  here because at least we have the Iranians locked date in some sort of a  nuclear deal.  But my thought on that, it is not a good deal in the first  place and they are clearly violating it.</p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, it is tot a good deal.  We all know that,  most of us who criticized the deal, the administration and many members of  the U.S. Congress.  But what the Ambassador Haley has done, it's claim that  OK, we have the criticism of the Iran dial.  That's not what I'm talking  about right now.</p><p>I'm talking about the missiles.  And the minute she did that we'll going to  have with us, maybe for the Arab and Muslim countries in the coalition.   We're going to have with us France.  Imagine that the President of France  was also addressing missiles issue and maybe the U.K. and with them a  number of eastern European and the central European countries concerned  about those missiles.</p><p>Guess what?  Some countries in Latin American, Africa, East Asia, all of  these countries can come with us on the objection to the missiles  regardless of the issue of the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What is your interpretation, what is been going on in Saudi  Arabia, in particularly the Crown Prince, the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammad  bin Salman, who's very anti-Iran and very strong on this, and by all  accounts has been communicating with Israel.  I mean, could we have a  Saudi-Israel alliance to take on Iran?  I mean, they are very, very  aggressive in this field?</p><p>PHARES:  I have been monitoring -- many observers have been analyzing the  changes that have been taking place in Saudi Arabia.  Even use a term which  may not apply but could, enlighten us, Perestroika and Glasnost.  It's when  the Soviet Union started to changed course, unfortunately for them they  collapsed.</p><p>What is happening here is that MBS, Mohammad bin Salman is trying to move  Saudi Arabia in different direction.  That is not easy.  It's not done  overnight.</p><p>So number one they canceled the power of religious belief, (ph) which was  the must difficult thing to change and after that, giving rights to women.   More important geopolitically, indeed, you're right he is mobilizing Saudi  power and his allies in the peninsula and Arab allies against the expansion  of Iranian military force in the region.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very quickly, I have 10 seconds, Walid, but we're seeing Iran's  influence spread out, aren't we?  We're seeing it take over some of the  vacuum in Syria and Iraq?</p><p>PHARES:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  How concerned are you, how much dominance or at least the growth,  if you like, of Iran outside of its own borders?</p><p>PHARES:  Very quickly I have been very concerned for the last maybe nine  years.  Now that I see that there is an Arab coalition forming now, now  that I see that we have a bridge with that coalition, I think we are now in  the beginning of the phase to push back against Iran.  This is just  starting right now.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very good.  We have to leave it right there.  But it's great  stuff.  Dr. Walid Phares.  Thank you so much, I appreciate it.</p><p>PHARES:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Thank you.</p><p>Americans spent much more than the economists predicted so far this holiday  season.  Confidence is high apparently.  Good news for the economy and, of  course, the retailers, our very own Jeff Flock in the Chicago among the  crowds.  There he is, very festive scene.  We'll be going to Jeff, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Guess what?  Consumers going on a shopping spree last month with  retail sales jumping nearly one percent in November, on line even better.   The big win is of course as we know, the online retailers as well as  electronics, I can't get enough of those and furniture.  Not so much.</p><p>Now, is this a sign of more good things to come for consumer in 2018?  Who  better to ask Jeff Flock, who is live among the throngs of shoppers in  Chicago.  Jeff?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FBN CHICAGO-BASED REPORTER:  State Street, out in front of what  used to be called Marshall Fields.  And I'll tell you, totally, Ashley, I  came here on Christmas seasons past, I almost wrecked a picture of Santa  Claus thus far.</p><p>We have come here before, and State Street has not been crowded.  Today,  I'll tell you, maybe you can see the Christmas spirit definitely in full  swing.  And today, not just for retailers that -- actual stores, brick-and- mortar, but today this is what they call a free shipping Friday.</p><p>More than 900 retailers around the country offering free shipping on all  orders today.  You don't even have to have a minimum order, which you have  to for a lot of folks.  These retailers, everybody from Macy's, to Target,  J.C. Penney, Saks, the whole bunch 900 plus.  If you go to free shipping  day.com we get a full list.</p><p>Now back out here on State Street, maybe you see the beautiful windows used  to be Marshall Fields.  It is now Macy's.  And Macy's has done really well.   Take a look at the stocks over the course of the past months of multiple  retailers.  Macy's actually top of the list, up 25 in the last month.   Nordstrom up 16 percent.  Walmart up nine percent.</p><p>Why?  Well, maybe it's because, so long people are getting paychecks.  It  used to be 2009, November 2009, unemployment was about 10 percent.</p><p>Now we're about 4.1 percent.  And I'll tell you, believe me, Ashley, heard  of the little drummer boys you got a whole bunch of them out here today,  very talented folks, entertaining the shoppers along State Street as they  look at the Marshall Fields windows (INAUDIBLE) decades along State Street.</p><p>What's known as today, the most wonderful time of the year for retailers?   Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Fantastic job, Jeff Flock.  Great drumming.  I have a headache.   But it was wonderful, very, very good indeed.  They were talented.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, Star Wars: The Last Jedi opening today to rave reviews  and what is expected to be Blockbuster tickets sales, the force is strong  with this one.  We could see a record opening weekend.  We've got a preview  for you, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  For the finalized tax bill is supposed to be released around 5:30  made public.  It wasn't good enough for our own Blake Burman.  He managed  to get his hand on it right now.  Blake, what are you seeing in that bill?</p><p>BURMAN:  And as of it, it's coming to from several sources here in  Washington and the first thing that jumps out, which not going to put all  the numbers up right now, we were just given them.</p><p>The first thing that jumps up is seven different brackets, that being 10,  12, 22, 24, 32, 35, 37.  The original Senate bill is what won out here.   Because what the individual side of this is the same as what first appeared  in the individual Senate bill.  The tweaks that are made to it are on side,  where it's those who are married or filing jointly.</p><p>The top end rate has gotten a lot of talk, on individual side.  It will be  $500,000 at 37 percent.  On the married filing jointly side, it will be  600,000 and above.  That number has dropped substantially from the initial  Senate plan.  It was initially at a million dollars.  So that got slashed  some 40 percent, where the tinkering is, again it's on the married filing  jointly side, when you start to play with brackets in between, there some  numbers raid, some numbers lowered but the headline here is what we are  getting from expect posted publicly here at 5:30.  The seven brackets, and  it appears, not appears, what happened in the Senate bill and initially,  won out here.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, certainly appears that way.  Great stuff, Blake Burman,  thank you very much.</p><p>Of course, they'll be pouring tomorrow that bill as he gets the time to do  that.  But those are the headline numbers that you saw just the -- Blake,  thank you very much.</p><p>The \"Star Wars\" franchise is certainly a force to be reckoned with, as we  know that, the latest chapter in the legendary series, The Last Jedi, now  in theaters and on track for me as the largest movie opening ever.</p><p>Joining me now to discuss all the light saber swinging action, comScore  Incorporated Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian.  Paul, thank you for  joining me, have you seen the movie?  I assume you have.  Is it a home run?</p><p>PAUL DERGARABEDIAN, COMSCORE'S SENIOR MEDIA ANALYST:  I sure have.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It is a home run?</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  It's a total home run.  I saw the movie, of course, this is  the follow-up to 2015's, \"The Force Awakens\" which opened in North America  to the biggest debut ever, $248 million.</p><p>Now, that long two years ago, had a 57 million preview night on Thursday.   This film had the second biggest Thursday preview with 45 million.  So the  Last Jedi is off to rollicking start, and could join the 200 million club  for opening weekend in North America.  Not only has three films on the list  right now, this could be the 4th.  So a huge deal for the movie industry  this weekend.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Am I right, Paul that it's two and a half hour long or did I  misread that?  And it has going to be good to occupy for two and a half  hours?</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  Yes, I already say a great movie can't be long enough and  if it's a terrible move, anything over now would be, you know, you'd suffer  thought that.  But I think what we're seeing in the comScore data, we do exit polling.  So we have a service called post-track.  And  this is movie is showing five out of five stars.  You can't get higher than  that in our survey.  82 percent definite recommend.  So that means  audiences are loving it.  The critics are loving it.  And that's how you  get to a billion dollars in worldwide Box Office and beyond.</p><p>And we're already showing that the film has earned $106 million in two  days, globally.  And now it's poised for a massive weekend worldwide.  And  it really a global business -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Indeed, it is.</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  And the \"Star Wars\" franchise is a global phenomenon, and  this sets us on really strong pace for the rest of the bock office share,  which we have about two weeks left.</p><p>You know, \"Star Wars\" fanatics are very fiercely protective of the  property.  You know that very quickly, Paul.</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  Right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It seems like Disney is doing a good job with continuing this  franchise.</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  Yeah, they are.  I mean, you know, it's a huge amount of  responsibility to take this on with the first movie opening in 1977.  The  franchise just in theaters worldwide up to this point about $7.5 billion,  you add the merchandising on to that.  And then, of course, we have next  Memorial Day, the Han Solo movie.  And two years from now will be episode  nine, the next installment in this new trilogy, and the final installment  in this new trilogy.  So this is the gift that keeps on giving to Disney.   This is a long term play.  We're talking about decades long, you know,  everyone's kids and their grand kids will be seeing \"Star Wars\" movies for  the next many decades.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Wow.  I think you're all right there.  Paul Dergarabedian.  Paul,  thank you very much.  I will two and a half hours -- </p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  Thank you, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I'll take your advice.  I will go and watch it.  Thank you so  much.</p><p>As we get ready to hand over to Liz Claman.  The Dow up 157 points.  What a  great way to finish the week.  The Dow at 24,666, ominously, but there you  go, good day for the market.  Our time is up.  Liz Claman, over to you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I don't know  if anyone believes it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CAVUTO:  I believe it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WEBSTER:  Thank you very much, Neil.</p><p> Well, we will see that finalized version of the Republican tax bill in just  a few hours from now.  Lawmakers making last minute changes, specifically  the child tax credit, following Senator Marco Rubio's threat to vote no on  that bill if the credit is not expanded.  But it is still a little bit  unclear if this is enough to secure a yes vote from Rubio.  We'll talk  about that.</p><p> But the uncertainty over tax reform having little impact on the market  today, as you can see another nice rally, the Dow up a 156 points, 24,664.   Remarkable.  Good afternoon, everybody.  I'm Ashley Webster.  In today for  Trish Regan to the -- and we begin now with \"The Intelligence Report.</p><p> Let's get right to it.  Republicans can only afford, we know this, to lose  two GOP senators if they want to get this tax bill passed.</p><p> And well, there are a handful that, well, we could see are on the fence  right now, including Senators Mike Lee, Bob Corker, what about Jeff Flake?   So the question is, can they get it done?  We'll be asking former Utah  Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  He is here in the studio with us.</p><p> Plus, President Trump, blasting the FBI handling of the Hillary Clinton  email scandal.  The President even calling that probe rig and that he's  ever seen anything like this before.  I have more on that in just a few  minutes.</p><p> But first, let's go to our very own Adam Shapiro for the latest on this tax  reform fight.  The clock is ticking.  Adam, is this thing going to get  through?</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  When you speak to talk to people  at the administration and on Capitol Hill that's a very simple yes.  They  expect it to pass.</p><p> Now, where we stand right now, we do expect Marco Rubio to vote yes on this  bill because he has gotten a decisional $300 for the child tax credit  refund that he wanted.  This would come against through payroll taxes on  the first -- what is it?  Roughly zero to $25,000 in income.  In simple  terms, if you don't have federal income tax liability he wanted to increase  the amount you would get back for a child tax credit.</p><p> So he is seems to have achieve that.  And as a member of the Conference  Committee, the source close to conference committee, he told me we'll give  him what he wants and he'll be yes.</p><p> The other two though, the undecided are Senator Flake and Senator Corker.   Even if they were to vote no, that still may not be enough to kill the bill  and there is all kind of calculations that go into it.  But everyone is  expecting a yes next week.</p><p> Now, what we know at this point, according to Representative Jordan as well  a Kevin Brady, the Conference Committee is done.  They have signed the  report.  It is closed, and we will find out when it is filed publicly at  5:30, the exact details in there that they will vote upon next week.  But  here is what Kevin Brady said just moments ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  I'm  confident at end of the day, the Senate will approve this Conference  Committee report because, no one should be defending the status quo in this  horrible tax code.  Americans have had to live for with for too long.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  But the key question everybody has, as exactly what kind of  changes were made?  For instance, we know the top income tax bracket was  lowered to 37 percent but what about other tax brackets, remember, the  Senate version had seven brackets whereas the House had four brackets.</p><p> Well, President Trump says, he has been kept the prize of everything that's  going on with the bill.  And here is what he said before he went to speak  at FBI graduation ceremony this morning.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have seen it.  I think  it's going to do very, very well.  I think that we are going to be in a  position to pass something as early as next week which will be monumental.</p><p> (OFF-MIC)</p><p> TRUMP:  I think they will be great.  They're great people.  They want to  see it done.  We're putting in a tremendous child tax credit.  And it is  increasing on a daily basis.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  So the bottom line answer to your question is everybody at least  on the administration and on Capitol Hill with an R next to their name, an  R for Republican is expecting this to pass.</p><p> WEBSTER:  We shall see, yes.  Adam, thank you very much for the latest.</p><p> Joining me now here at the studio, Fox News Contributor and former Utah  Congressman Jason Chaffetz.</p><p> Jason, thank you so much for being here.  We just got a note from Chad  Pergram, the Senior Producer for Fox News, he says Jeff Flake, Bob Corker,  Mike Lee, all three still undecided on this bill.  What do you think, how  does this play out?</p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh I think ultimately Marco Rubio,  Jeff Flake and Mike Lee will be a yes.  I don't think they will going to be  the last person standing putting up a blockade on this.  I think -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  Would you want to be as a no -- </p><p> CHAFFETZ:  I don't think they will.  I think the child tax credit is  actually the way it is structured is bad public policy but nevertheless  they did coalesce and get behind that, and support it, and expand it.  But  the ones who watch are Corker, Collins and McCain.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Only lose two as we talked about -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Ultimately I do think it happens.  And I think by the time you  get to the end of the day Tuesday, perhaps Wednesday, it will have passed.   But hours later the funding of government will be the issue -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  The appropriations.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  The euphoric high that will being tax reform passing will be  demolished within hours when they get to the reality of how to fund the  government.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I want to get that in a minute.  But I want to get back to Marco  Rubio.  Some of this red line from him came out of nowhere.  Were you  surprised?  I think or Republican leadership was a little surprised?</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Well, we always knew that Mike Lee and Marco Rubio were very  intent on doing it.  They did put it up for a vote and it failed.  But they  held the line.  And it's the way you get attention is hold out a no vote.   You keep saying no, no.  And suddenly the White House and everybody from  leadership and the -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  --- Ways and Means and Senate Finance come over and say what can  we do?  And he managed to get another $300 in there.  And for those  families it will make a difference, but again I think the public policy  side of it is wrong.</p><p> WEBSTER:  So this gets through.  Bob Corker's opposition has been the  expense.  What are we doing about spending as the deficit gets larger and  larger?  As conservative, are you worried about that?</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Well, I wish he was more concern about the deficit on the  spending side.  I don't think you have to justify allowing the American  people to hold their own money in their own pockets.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  But what you do have to do is make tough choices, and stop  spending so much money.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  And this Republican Congress, House and Senate have been  terrible in actually cutting spending.  Name anything that they have cut?   And the answer is zero.  There is nothing.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You're right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  There is nothing and I think that it is wrong to say, well, you  know, if times get tough that we raise taxes.  That's exactly the wrong  time to raise taxes.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  But you have to curve back spending up which they have done  nothing.</p><p> WEBSTER:  So listen, this is going to be the first major legislative  success for the GOP if they can get this done.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p> WEBSTER:  We believe they will.  You never know.  It ain't over until it's  over.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Right.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Going into next year, I think attention will probably turns to  infrastructure.  Any issues with that?  Should that get through?  That  shouldn't be a big political football, should it?</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Well, you've increased defense spending now to $664 billion.   And I do think the continuing resolution will fund that through the end of  September of 2018.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  You have the infrastructure spending that you have to do as a  supplemental, they call it, it's like the term in Congress for the disaster  relief because of Irma and other hurricanes.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yeah.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  That's going to approach $100 billion over time.  I don't know  where you go back and say, now we're going to infuse, you know, tens, if  not 100 plus billion dollars in infrastructure.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  It all sounds great until you actually look at the red line and  you see -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  You have to pay for it.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  How you pay for it.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Is that where you bring in the private sector.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Well, you do want to have public/private partnerships.</p><p> WEBSTER:  But the government has to kick in to pay a lot?</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Yes.  And states also have to be involved.  But you have to  figure out where to go, to make those hard choices and say, instead of  spending money here, let's spend it over here.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  That's going to be a contentious discussion.  Although I do  think Democrats want to come to the table on that, because it is something  they do want.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Do you miss it?</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  I miss part of the fight.  I miss the people.  You know, I have  good friend there that -- you know from Tim Scott to Trey Gowdy and John  Radcliffe, and Mia Love and other, I miss interacting with but -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  What don't you miss?</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Fund-raising.  I hate fund-raising.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You're always in that move?</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  I'd always -- and got a better balance to my life and -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  -- and nice little perch here with my relationship with Fox so.</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's nice.  But, you know, listen, a lot of people from it  across this country look and say, why is it so dysfunctional?  Is it  dysfunctional?  Certainly appears to be a lot of the time.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  I think in part it was structured that way by our founders.</p><p> WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  It's not supposed to be a glide path to making this pass an  easy.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Sure.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  You got 535 people with big egos all wanting to make decisions  and have their hands in the pot.  It's an ugly sausage-making process.</p><p> WEBSTER:  But it seems the environment is so much more contentious as it  has been.  I know it has been over the years, since day one, but it does  seem very much either you're with us or you're not.  There is not a lot of  compromise.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  I wish people would stick to their principle whether their party  was in power or not in power.  Because I see both sides of the aisle  suddenly they flip on a principle -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Because now they're in the minority.  You know, and that just  drives you nuts.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You got your life back financially.  That's the most important  thing.  Jason, thank you very much.  I appreciate it.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Turning to our other top story now, President Trump blasting the  FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal.  The President even  calling that probe rigged.  He used that word.  And that he has never seen  anything like it before.</p><p> Well, for the very latest bring let's in our own Blake Burman, he's been  following this from the White House.  Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Ashley.  And I asked  the President earlier today as he was leaving the White House whether or  not he thought the special counsel is biased, which is what many  Republicans here in Washington up on Capitol Hill have alleged.</p><p> The President was not willing earlier today to engage in that possibility  when I asked him about it.  However, he did use it as a launching pad to  sharply criticize the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email  investigation.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Whatever you want to call it, you going to make up your own  determination, but they have found tremendous things on the other side.   When you look at the Hillary Clinton investigation that was -- you know,  I've been saying it for a long time.  That was a rigged system, folks.   That was a rigged system.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  Now those comments came a day after Senator Ron Johnson claimed in  a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray, that James Comey's July statement  which eventually cleared Clinton from any criminal wrongdoing had been  watered down with three edits.  One edit said, it was \"possible that  hostile actors\" gained access to Clinton's private server, a downgrade from  \"reasonably likely.\"</p><p> Now Ashley, it is unclear exactly who made those edits, why they made those  edits and when they made those edits.  Senator Johnson in that letter said,  he did not know exactly when the edits were made, those exact dates.  So on  one hand it could have just been potentially the normal investigative work  as more information comes in, you make changes to your findings.  Or it  could have been as some have suggested that the FBI was in it, some at  least to help out Hillary Clinton.  Ashley?</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, indeed.  All right, Blake Burman, thank you very much for  the latest on this.</p><p> Joining me now, Criminal Defense Attorney and former prosecutor, David  Bruno and American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.</p><p> Thank you both, gentlemen, for being here.  David, let me begin with you.</p><p> DAVID BRUNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Sure.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You say that the underlying conduct by Director Comey and his  officials is troubling and may be criminal.  Where does the line get  crossed a bit for it to be criminal?</p><p> BRUNO:  Well, right now, there is an inspector general investigation that  is going on and we will be getting the report shortly.  But the most  troubling aspect of this is the edits that we just heard about in the  memorandum.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BRUNO:  Because one of the edits took away the language in the federal  statute that would have made a crime for Hillary Clinton to abuse the  classified documents.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BRUNO:  And that's gross negligence.  It was originally included and for  whatever reason by whoever it was modified, it was redacted and it was  changed to careless.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right, which got Hillary Clinton off the hook, essentially.</p><p> BRUNO:  Sure.  If you get away from gross negligence into carelessness,  it's no longer a federal crime.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right, Ned, let me get to you, I was reading your talking  points, you have some strong views on this.  You were saying look, you talk  about Mueller's team, a partisan pack of wolves.  You say -- </p><p> NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  That's right.</p><p> WEBSTER:  -- the findings are chilling.  Kind if expand on that a little  bit.  What was the moats troubling aspect of this?</p><p> RYUN:  Well, first of all, I mean, I think it's becoming very clear over  the last couple weeks that Mueller's team is partisan pack of wolves.  When  you look at Peter Strzok, when you look at Andrew Weissmann, when you look  at Jeannie Rhee and now you look at Aaron Zebley, I mean, I'm very hard  press to think that these people are objective and I think our biases to  influence a lot of our decisions as human being.</p><p> So to say that it's person I think it's understatement but even more so,  Ashley, I think what we're seeing it the unfolding -- unwrapping of what I  think is one of the biggest political crimes we've seen in our history, in  which our government and a political party colluded together to undermine  and to destroy and nullify the election of the other party.</p><p> And so I think when we look at this, all of the American people, they  should find this chilling.  They should be deeply concerned about what's  taking place inside of their government and I there's more to come, Ashley.   I think we're going to see more revelations coming out in the coming weeks  in which people will start to fully understand, this is not good.</p><p> And I will say this, if Mike Pompeo and Jeff Sessions and Christopher Wray  are concerned about the constitution and the civil liberties of the  American people, they will protect those and not the institution.  They  should be more concerned about our freedom than protecting institutions.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You know, David, look, we all have our own opinions, our own  political leanings, if you like, and OK, so these FBI investigators have  their own political likes but the line seems to me -- there were certain  excerpts from some of these texts or emails where they say look, they make  reference to the point that we need some sort of insurance policy just to  make sure this guy, i.e., Donald Trump doesn't get elected.  To me that  crosses the line.</p><p> BRUNO:  Yes.  OK.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You know, we can't take the risk.  You know, to Ned's point,  there's almost, you know -- people talk about the deep state conspiracy, I  mean, this really smells -- doesn't smell right, let me put it that way.</p><p> BRUNO:  I agree with you.  There is nothing wrong with a bias so long as it  doesn't result in actions that are against the law.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right?</p><p> BRUNO:  Right, so -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  Change the course of history maybe.</p><p> BRUNO:  So generally speaking the fact that one has a political affiliation  is not a problem, however, if it goes to the next step and like you said,  in the August text messages with agent Strzok talks about an insurance  policy.  And it also talks about a discussion in Andrew's office.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, that's right.</p><p> BRUNO:  That could be Andrew McCabe.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Correct.</p><p> BRUNO:  About the election which could be a hatch violation.  Hatch  violations are when the government talks about political affairs or gets  involved in political actions.  Possible hatch violation if that in fact  took place.</p><p> WEBSTER:  So Ned, I mean, you obviously believe we should have an  investigation of the investigators.  I mean, how should this be playing  out?  Should Mueller be coming out and addressing this right away?</p><p> RYUN:  I think when this -- Well, I do.  At this point though, I was  talking with the former DOJ official, and he said I still actually respect  Mueller but I will find any of his findings, not believable.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> RYUN:  And so I think you've got a credibility problem.  But Ashley, even  more importantly what do we even talking about with this investigation as a  whole?  I believe it was started on false pretenses, a fake dossier that  spun all of this up.  And so I would actually argue that the instigation as  a whole, regardless of the partisan nature of the team is illegitimate in  of itself.  And so I think we need to start having that conversations  about, is this investigation even a legitimate one moving forward?</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  What do you say, David?</p><p> BRUNO:  Well, I talked about the inspector general before.  Right now the  inspector general is reviewing the Hillary Clinton FBI investigation.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BRUNO:  And the inspector general's office is the watchdog over the DOJ.   So if there is any impropriety going on in the Mueller investigation right  now, there will be a review at some point by the inspector general.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Ned, you know, what we want and what we're not getting is we want  some sunlight on this.  And we want transparency.</p><p> RYUN:  That's right.</p><p> WEBSTER:  How do we do that?  What should be done from this point forward?</p><p> RYUN:  We declassify.  I think the only way that the people of America can  start to trust the DOJ and the FBI again, is I think we need to have some  extreme transparency.  I think we need to go back and declassify a lot of  what took place over the last eight years.</p><p> I know that people again, the heads of these departments right now might  not be comfortable doing that, but Ashley, I that is only way we can get  back to having trust and faith in these institutions is to really  declassify.  What happened with Clinton and Loretta Lynch on that tarmac in  Arizona?  What really did happened with Comey's clearing of Hillary  Clinton?  What happened with Peter Strzok?  The only way we get to that we  have to declassify.</p><p> WEBSTER:  And of course, David, in the background of all of this is we have  the Russia investigation.  The collusion which the President addressed  earlier today when you're saying, there is no collusion.  What have you  found so far?  They haven't anything, right?</p><p> BRUNO:  Right.  I mean, well, we don't know, right?  We have multiple  indictments -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  We've been going on for a long time.</p><p> BRUNO:  We have a couple indictments.  We have to two police (ph), one by  George Papadopoulos and Mike Flynn.</p><p> WEBSTER:  But directly link to -- </p><p> BRUNO:  Right.  And that is pending.  It's going on.  We don't know.  We  will see at this point, absolutely.  We have not seen any collusion or  conspiracy that goes right to the White House.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, Ned, how long does this go on for?</p><p> RYUN:  Well, this -- but the point I want to make is, we've had this thing  going on for at least a year-and-a-half, almost two yes.  And I've made  this argument to people.  Use your common sense.  You had heads of  intelligence agencies that didn't like Trump.  You have a deep state  bureaucracy that doesn't like Trump.  And yet, the opposition party, the  mainstream media that doesn't like him.  If there was actually something  there, don't you think we would have heard of it right now?</p><p> And so I'd argue, again there is nothing evidence there is many evidence  that never will be evidence, of the fairy tale of Trump-Russia collusion.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right, we have to leave it right there.  David, Ned, thank  you so much.  Great conversation.  I really appreciate it.</p><p> BRUNO:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Take a look at the market today and by the way, nice rally going  on, the Dow up 163 points.  We're at 24,670 on the Dow.  The S&amp;P up one  percent, the Nasdaq also going great guns, up at more than one percent, up  6938 on the Nasdaq.</p><p> All right, we'll have more on the markets and so much more after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Now, check it out, stocks broadly higher today with the Dow up  triple digits.  We had session highs just a few seconds ago.  In fact,  there is a new Intraday record for the Dow.  It seems like we say it every  day.  Investor reacting to some positive earnings and retail sales, and  guess what?  Our very own Nicole Petallides live at always at the New York  Stock Exchange, with more on a buying spree this Friday, Nicole.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  That's right.  It is heavy volume.   It is quadruple-witching.  And we have some rebalancing.  I'm just telling  you it's going to be a really heavy volume day.</p><p> In addition to that, right now we're up 160 points on the Dow Jones  Industrial average, near our session highs.  We're clocking in another  winning week, right?  So the Dow will be up four weeks in a row and at the  close, it will be our 69th record, which will tied the all-time amount of  closing records for any given year, which is back in 1995.  If we have one  more after this, Ash, we will go down in history as most records ever.</p><p> We're talking a looking, not only as the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P which  have up arrows.  But you can see, since Election Day, the Dow Jones  Industrial average up about 35 percent, the S&amp;P up about 25 percent.  So we  certainly have enjoyed a nice run.  It was a lot obviously built in on tax  reform and the overall, which certainly seems to going well today, on the  latest amendments that have been made on the child tax reform to appeal  Rubio and Lee -- Senators Rubio and Lee.</p><p> So that's -- while taking a look at Costco, and Adobe, both of which had  positive quarterly earnings, look at Costco up 3.5 percent, Adobe 1.6  percent, new high there by the way for Costco taking a look at some of the  other retailers, big picture cracks up 17 percent, getting an upgrade over  at Stifel, Nicolaus and just talking about their exposure abroad and that  does well.</p><p> Remember when the stock is 75 bucks about 10 years ago?  Forget that, how  about you focus on this, great day today, Under Armour some positive  comments there from the analysts as well and also foot locker getting an  upgrade and getting the margins, going forward we'll watch the margins.   You can see that too was a winner.</p><p> Overall, we will say that Moody has talked about the run up, recent run-up  that we've seen in retail.  It might be exhaustive.  So we'll see that the  latest retail sales numbers, Ashley, were pretty great.  I mean, they were  showing straight to people, spending on things that they don't really need,  furniture, electronics, sporting good, books, music.  So the latest numbers  were pretty good showing holiday shoppers were hitting the stores.  Back to  you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I always need electronics.  I'm just saying, I'm a kind of gadget  guy, Nicole.  So it's always an excuse to buy electronics.  I love it.   Anyway, thank you so much.  Great stuff.  Who knows, Dow 25,000 by  Christmas?  Maybe.</p><p> Meanwhile, backlash today over the roll back of Obama-era net neutrality  rules, with all the hysteria out there, you think, well the internet as we  know it is coming to an end.  Our own Deirdre Bolton is here to cut through  all the noise.  And she will be next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  We are just getting word from our colleagues at Fox News that  Marco Rubio is indeed a yes now on the tax bill.  He got what he wanted, a  bump in that refund on the child tax credit.  He is in on board, we are  told, still, we don't know about Bob Corker, Mike Lee, Jeff Flake, Susan  Collins, still some questions to be answered.  But Marco Rubio essentially  got what he wanted.  Now he says yes to the tax bill.</p><p> Also the FCC voting to end net neutrality rules guarantying equal access to  the internet.  Now most experts say, these changes won't have much impact  in the short term.  Others are resorting to complete hysteria.</p><p>CNN actually reported this as, the \"End of the internet.\"  Sentiments  shared by Senator Bernie Sanders who tweeted Congress and the courts need  to fight back.</p><p> Meanwhile, others have said this is attack on LBGT community.  Some on  Twitter even said we will going to die.</p><p> I kid you not.  Deirdre Bolton is here now.  Deirdre --</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, we're all going to die  at some point but it is not in direct relation to repeal of -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  But should we be in a panic?  Come on.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, listen, it is not the end of the internet as we know with the  soundtrack, right.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> BOLTON:  But it is the beginning of a huge fight.</p><p> WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p> BOLTON:  So you have 20 states attorney generals, they've lined up to sue  the FCC calling the agency's move, a violation of the law and a serious  threat to the free exchange of ideas.</p><p> So here is a map.  We made a list of states that are beginning to take a  legal action against the FCC.  So I'm not going to read all the names.  But  you can see them, north, south, east, west more adding themselves as we  speak.</p><p> So the tech community going bonkers.  Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg,  Microsoft's Brad Smith, execs from Google, Airbnb, a whole list, speaking  out.  This is Netflix's statement as further tweet this morning.  \"We're  disappointed in the decision to gut net neutrality protections that ushered  in an unprecedented era of innovation, creativity and civic engagement.   This is the beginning of a longer legal battle.  Netflix stands with  innovators, large and small, to oppose this misguided FCC order.\"</p><p> Now Netflix, other big tech companies, they're taking a stand on the vote  on principle because the service providers such as Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T,  they can charge Netflix more money because Netflix uses more internet  capacity when we all binge watch our shows.  But it doesn't matter, Netflix  can pay.</p><p> So the reason big tech is fighting the FCC is because big tech says the  vote kills innovation.  So for example, if there is future competitor out  there to Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix trying to build itself up now, a  fledgling company, the arguments goes would not even be able to get off the  ground and afford the fees that a Verizon, or a Comcast, or an AT&amp;T would  have the power to demand.</p><p> FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, he calls Silicon Valley a bunch of hypocrites.  Here  is part of his statement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AJIT PAI, FCC CHAIRMAN:  Companies likes Facebook, and Amazon, and Netflix,  and Google, became global giants precisely because the government wasn't  involved.  That's part of reason why I think so much of this hysteria is  simply misplaced.  As we will see going forward, getting this regulatory  system, right, means better, faster cheaper internet access for all  Americans across the country.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  So that is the FCC Chair.  So actually he's kind of like -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  Ajit Pai -- so basically he says, this will enable, get  government out of the way.</p><p> BOLTON:  Yeah.</p><p> WEBSTER:  It will enable the internet providers to get more money, if I  want to pay for faster internet.  I can, it's not like, the internet is  going away.</p><p> BOLTON:  So that's exactly the point.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I can pay more if I want to.</p><p> BOLTON:  So he has two offshoots.  That first statement is very true.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  Actually Portugal is a live experiment in that.</p><p> WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p> BOLTON:  So people there, they pay for tiered internet access much as we  pay for tiered cable access.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  It's essentially the same system, just with a different product.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Got it.</p><p> BOLTON:  Ajit Pai's second point, he is libertarian.  So he just by  definition, by philosophy is for less regulation.  And he says, Verizon,  Comcast, AT&amp;T, the service providers.  He said they don't really have a  financial incentive to invest or to build in underserved areas, be they  rural or low income earner -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  Right, this would give them the money to do it?</p><p> BOLTON:  Well, I think his argument is that if they can make money and  other ways charging Netflix or Facebook, then they will take that money,  and build out broadband and maybe areas that are not as well-served.</p><p> WEBSTER:  So bottom line is, it is not the end of world as we know it.  We  are all going to die at some point but not as a result of the FCC -- OK,  very good.  Deirdre, thank you very much.  Good stuff.</p><p>U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley presenting missile fragments that she says are  indisputable evidence that Iran is violating U.N. resolutions and called  out the regime as a threat to peace and security to the entire world.  Dr.  Walid Phares is here next to talk about that.  Don't go away.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  More breaking news for on that tax reform bill.  Mississippi  Senator Thad Cochran's office announcing the senator will be in Washington  next week to vote on the Republican tax reform bill.  The senator had been  in hospital for treatment for a non-melanoma lesion on his face.  No word  whether the Arizona Senator John McCain who is also in the hospital that is  will be present for the vote but Thad Cochran will be there.  That's what  we've been told.</p><p> All right, in other news, Prime Minister Theresa May announcing the U.K.  will lead the E.U. of March 2019.  This as E.U. leaders agree to move on to  the second stage of Brexit talks, which will focus on trade and future  relations.</p><p> And CSX corps shares dropping after CEO takes unexpected medical leave,  shrinking out nearly $6 billion a market value on that news.  The leave  comes as customers and regulators have questioned the company's turn around  plan.</p><p> And Bitcoin hits another all-time high, almost hitting $18,000.  Bitcoin  has risen nearly 80 percent in just December alone.  This has made  billionaires out of the Winklevoss twins famous claiming they invented  Facebook.  Maria sat down with them and also about the concerns of a  Bitcoin bubble.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAMERON WINKLEVOSS, AMERICAN ROWER AND ENTREPRENEUR:  But the bubble  framework is really not correct to put against Bitcoin.  When you think of  a company, right, and their stock price, if they produce x-amount of units  one year and the same amount of units the next year and the stock price  goes up, and the economic doubles and economic productivity hasn't changed,  the capital haven't changed with the company, we say that company is  overvalued.  But Bitcoin is not a company.  It's a network.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEBSTER:  By the way you can watch the entire interview with the twins  tonight on \"Wall Street Week\" right here on Fox Business at 8:00 p.m.  Eastern Time.  Don't miss that.</p><p>U.S. envoy Nikki Haley says the Trump administration now has proof that  Iran is expanding its nuclear program and meddling in the Yemeni Civil War.   And that came in the form of a charred piece of recovered ballistic  missile.  Take a look at that press conference in Washington yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.:  When you look at this missile,  this is terrifying, this is absolutely terrifying.  And this is why it has  to stop.  We have said multiple times, that this is not just about the  nuclear program.  This is about everything else they're doing because Iran  believes that they have been given a pass.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEBSTER:  So, did Iran really violate the nuclear deal?  Here to discuss,  Fox News Foreign Affairs analyst Dr. Walid Phares.  Walid, thank you so  much for joining us.</p><p> So I notice that you said from Nikki Haley's conversations yesterday was  one of the most advanced policy declarations on Iran by U.S. officials to  date.  Explain.</p><p> DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANALYST:  It was really because  Ambassador Haley after the speech of President in Riyadh a few months ago  has pushed the explanation of what the U.S. position is very clearly.</p><p> Number one, Iran is now plotted to have been using those missiles through  the militias via Yemen.  And, you look at the video that the public has  seen, and you see the actual missiles.  So that is a very important point.</p><p> Number two, there is an interpretation, an American interpretation that  those missiles are now deployed outside of Iran, which means that one of  the actions that the U.S. is seeking from the international community and  from the allies is to stop the shipping of those missiles and other  equipment outside Iran which will tell me more about what's behind the  horizons.</p><p> WEBSTER:  It seems like the U.S. is a little bit alone on this.  I will get  into Saudi Arabia in a minute but you know, the Europeans, they continue to  take this softly, softly approach, and believe that the U.S. is off kilter  here because at least we have the Iranians locked date in some sort of a  nuclear deal.  But my thought on that, it is not a good deal in the first  place and they are clearly violating it.</p><p> PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, it is tot a good deal.  We all know that,  most of us who criticized the deal, the administration and many members of  the U.S. Congress.  But what the Ambassador Haley has done, it's claim that  OK, we have the criticism of the Iran dial.  That's not what I'm talking  about right now.</p><p> I'm talking about the missiles.  And the minute she did that we'll going to  have with us, maybe for the Arab and Muslim countries in the coalition.   We're going to have with us France.  Imagine that the President of France  was also addressing missiles issue and maybe the U.K. and with them a  number of eastern European and the central European countries concerned  about those missiles.</p><p> Guess what?  Some countries in Latin American, Africa, East Asia, all of  these countries can come with us on the objection to the missiles  regardless of the issue of the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p> WEBSTER:  What is your interpretation, what is been going on in Saudi  Arabia, in particularly the Crown Prince, the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammad  bin Salman, who's very anti-Iran and very strong on this, and by all  accounts has been communicating with Israel.  I mean, could we have a  Saudi-Israel alliance to take on Iran?  I mean, they are very, very  aggressive in this field?</p><p> PHARES:  I have been monitoring -- many observers have been analyzing the  changes that have been taking place in Saudi Arabia.  Even use a term which  may not apply but could, enlighten us, Perestroika and Glasnost.  It's when  the Soviet Union started to changed course, unfortunately for them they  collapsed.</p><p> What is happening here is that MBS, Mohammad bin Salman is trying to move  Saudi Arabia in different direction.  That is not easy.  It's not done  overnight.</p><p> So number one they canceled the power of religious belief, (ph) which was  the must difficult thing to change and after that, giving rights to women.   More important geopolitically, indeed, you're right he is mobilizing Saudi  power and his allies in the peninsula and Arab allies against the expansion  of Iranian military force in the region.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Very quickly, I have 10 seconds, Walid, but we're seeing Iran's  influence spread out, aren't we?  We're seeing it take over some of the  vacuum in Syria and Iraq?</p><p> PHARES:  Yes.</p><p> WEBSTER:  How concerned are you, how much dominance or at least the growth,  if you like, of Iran outside of its own borders?</p><p> PHARES:  Very quickly I have been very concerned for the last maybe nine  years.  Now that I see that there is an Arab coalition forming now, now  that I see that we have a bridge with that coalition, I think we are now in  the beginning of the phase to push back against Iran.  This is just  starting right now.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Very good.  We have to leave it right there.  But it's great  stuff.  Dr. Walid Phares.  Thank you so much, I appreciate it.</p><p> PHARES:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Thank you.</p><p> Americans spent much more than the economists predicted so far this holiday  season.  Confidence is high apparently.  Good news for the economy and, of  course, the retailers, our very own Jeff Flock in the Chicago among the  crowds.  There he is, very festive scene.  We'll be going to Jeff, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Guess what?  Consumers going on a shopping spree last month with  retail sales jumping nearly one percent in November, on line even better.   The big win is of course as we know, the online retailers as well as  electronics, I can't get enough of those and furniture.  Not so much.</p><p> Now, is this a sign of more good things to come for consumer in 2018?  Who  better to ask Jeff Flock, who is live among the throngs of shoppers in  Chicago.  Jeff?</p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FBN CHICAGO-BASED REPORTER:  State Street, out in front of what  used to be called Marshall Fields.  And I'll tell you, totally, Ashley, I  came here on Christmas seasons past, I almost wrecked a picture of Santa  Claus thus far.</p><p> We have come here before, and State Street has not been crowded.  Today,  I'll tell you, maybe you can see the Christmas spirit definitely in full  swing.  And today, not just for retailers that -- actual stores, brick-and- mortar, but today this is what they call a free shipping Friday.</p><p> More than 900 retailers around the country offering free shipping on all  orders today.  You don't even have to have a minimum order, which you have  to for a lot of folks.  These retailers, everybody from Macy's, to Target,  J.C. Penney, Saks, the whole bunch 900 plus.  If you go to free shipping  day.com we get a full list.</p><p> Now back out here on State Street, maybe you see the beautiful windows used  to be Marshall Fields.  It is now Macy's.  And Macy's has done really well.   Take a look at the stocks over the course of the past months of multiple  retailers.  Macy's actually top of the list, up 25 in the last month.   Nordstrom up 16 percent.  Walmart up nine percent.</p><p> Why?  Well, maybe it's because, so long people are getting paychecks.  It  used to be 2009, November 2009, unemployment was about 10 percent.</p><p> Now we're about 4.1 percent.  And I'll tell you, believe me, Ashley, heard  of the little drummer boys you got a whole bunch of them out here today,  very talented folks, entertaining the shoppers along State Street as they  look at the Marshall Fields windows (INAUDIBLE) decades along State Street.</p><p> What's known as today, the most wonderful time of the year for retailers?   Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Fantastic job, Jeff Flock.  Great drumming.  I have a headache.   But it was wonderful, very, very good indeed.  They were talented.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right, Star Wars: The Last Jedi opening today to rave reviews  and what is expected to be Blockbuster tickets sales, the force is strong  with this one.  We could see a record opening weekend.  We've got a preview  for you, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  For the finalized tax bill is supposed to be released around 5:30  made public.  It wasn't good enough for our own Blake Burman.  He managed  to get his hand on it right now.  Blake, what are you seeing in that bill?</p><p> BURMAN:  And as of it, it's coming to from several sources here in  Washington and the first thing that jumps out, which not going to put all  the numbers up right now, we were just given them.</p><p> The first thing that jumps up is seven different brackets, that being 10,  12, 22, 24, 32, 35, 37.  The original Senate bill is what won out here.   Because what the individual side of this is the same as what first appeared  in the individual Senate bill.  The tweaks that are made to it are on side,  where it's those who are married or filing jointly.</p><p> The top end rate has gotten a lot of talk, on individual side.  It will be  $500,000 at 37 percent.  On the married filing jointly side, it will be  600,000 and above.  That number has dropped substantially from the initial  Senate plan.  It was initially at a million dollars.  So that got slashed  some 40 percent, where the tinkering is, again it's on the married filing  jointly side, when you start to play with brackets in between, there some  numbers raid, some numbers lowered but the headline here is what we are  getting from expect posted publicly here at 5:30.  The seven brackets, and  it appears, not appears, what happened in the Senate bill and initially,  won out here.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, certainly appears that way.  Great stuff, Blake Burman,  thank you very much.</p><p> Of course, they'll be pouring tomorrow that bill as he gets the time to do  that.  But those are the headline numbers that you saw just the -- Blake,  thank you very much.</p><p> The \"Star Wars\" franchise is certainly a force to be reckoned with, as we  know that, the latest chapter in the legendary series, The Last Jedi, now  in theaters and on track for me as the largest movie opening ever.</p><p> Joining me now to discuss all the light saber swinging action, comScore  Incorporated Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian.  Paul, thank you for  joining me, have you seen the movie?  I assume you have.  Is it a home run?</p><p> PAUL DERGARABEDIAN, COMSCORE'S SENIOR MEDIA ANALYST:  I sure have.</p><p> WEBSTER:  It is a home run?</p><p> DERGARABEDIAN:  It's a total home run.  I saw the movie, of course, this is  the follow-up to 2015's, \"The Force Awakens\" which opened in North America  to the biggest debut ever, $248 million.</p><p> Now, that long two years ago, had a 57 million preview night on Thursday.   This film had the second biggest Thursday preview with 45 million.  So the  Last Jedi is off to rollicking start, and could join the 200 million club  for opening weekend in North America.  Not only has three films on the list  right now, this could be the 4th.  So a huge deal for the movie industry  this weekend.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Am I right, Paul that it's two and a half hour long or did I  misread that?  And it has going to be good to occupy for two and a half  hours?</p><p> DERGARABEDIAN:  Yes, I already say a great movie can't be long enough and  if it's a terrible move, anything over now would be, you know, you'd suffer  thought that.  But I think what we're seeing in the comScore data, we do exit polling.  So we have a service called post-track.  And  this is movie is showing five out of five stars.  You can't get higher than  that in our survey.  82 percent definite recommend.  So that means  audiences are loving it.  The critics are loving it.  And that's how you  get to a billion dollars in worldwide Box Office and beyond.</p><p> And we're already showing that the film has earned $106 million in two  days, globally.  And now it's poised for a massive weekend worldwide.  And  it really a global business -- </p><p> WEBSTER:  Indeed, it is.</p><p> DERGARABEDIAN:  And the \"Star Wars\" franchise is a global phenomenon, and  this sets us on really strong pace for the rest of the bock office share,  which we have about two weeks left.</p><p> You know, \"Star Wars\" fanatics are very fiercely protective of the  property.  You know that very quickly, Paul.</p><p> DERGARABEDIAN:  Right.</p><p> WEBSTER:  It seems like Disney is doing a good job with continuing this  franchise.</p><p> DERGARABEDIAN:  Yeah, they are.  I mean, you know, it's a huge amount of  responsibility to take this on with the first movie opening in 1977.  The  franchise just in theaters worldwide up to this point about $7.5 billion,  you add the merchandising on to that.  And then, of course, we have next  Memorial Day, the Han Solo movie.  And two years from now will be episode  nine, the next installment in this new trilogy, and the final installment  in this new trilogy.  So this is the gift that keeps on giving to Disney.   This is a long term play.  We're talking about decades long, you know,  everyone's kids and their grand kids will be seeing \"Star Wars\" movies for  the next many decades.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Wow.  I think you're all right there.  Paul Dergarabedian.  Paul,  thank you very much.  I will two and a half hours -- </p><p> DERGARABEDIAN:  Thank you, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I'll take your advice.  I will go and watch it.  Thank you so  much.</p><p> As we get ready to hand over to Liz Claman.  The Dow up 157 points.  What a  great way to finish the week.  The Dow at 24,666, ominously, but there you  go, good day for the market.  Our time is up.

He will be in now for Trish.  Ashley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX NEWS HOST:  That's what I tell everybody.  I don't know  if anyone believes it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  I believe it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEBSTER:  Thank you very much, Neil.</p><p>Well, we will see that finalized version of the Republican tax bill in just  a few hours from now.  Lawmakers making last minute changes, specifically  the child tax credit, following Senator Marco Rubio's threat to vote no on  that bill if the credit is not expanded.  But it is still a little bit  unclear if this is enough to secure a yes vote from Rubio.  We'll talk  about that.</p><p>But the uncertainty over tax reform having little impact on the market  today, as you can see another nice rally, the Dow up a 156 points, 24,664.   Remarkable.  Good afternoon, everybody.  I'm Ashley Webster.  In today for  Trish Regan to the -- and we begin now with \"The Intelligence Report.</p><p>Let's get right to it.  Republicans can only afford, we know this, to lose  two GOP senators if they want to get this tax bill passed.</p><p>And well, there are a handful that, well, we could see are on the fence  right now, including Senators Mike Lee, Bob Corker, what about Jeff Flake?   So the question is, can they get it done?  We'll be asking former Utah  Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  He is here in the studio with us.</p><p>Plus, President Trump, blasting the FBI handling of the Hillary Clinton  email scandal.  The President even calling that probe rig and that he's  ever seen anything like this before.  I have more on that in just a few  minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to our very own Adam Shapiro for the latest on this tax  reform fight.  The clock is ticking.  Adam, is this thing going to get  through?</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  When you speak to talk to people  at the administration and on Capitol Hill that's a very simple yes.  They  expect it to pass.</p><p>Now, where we stand right now, we do expect Marco Rubio to vote yes on this  bill because he has gotten a decisional $300 for the child tax credit  refund that he wanted.  This would come against through payroll taxes on  the first -- what is it?  Roughly zero to $25,000 in income.  In simple  terms, if you don't have federal income tax liability he wanted to increase  the amount you would get back for a child tax credit.</p><p>So he is seems to have achieve that.  And as a member of the Conference  Committee, the source close to conference committee, he told me we'll give  him what he wants and he'll be yes.</p><p>The other two though, the undecided are Senator Flake and Senator Corker.   Even if they were to vote no, that still may not be enough to kill the bill  and there is all kind of calculations that go into it.  But everyone is  expecting a yes next week.</p><p>Now, what we know at this point, according to Representative Jordan as well  a Kevin Brady, the Conference Committee is done.  They have signed the  report.  It is closed, and we will find out when it is filed publicly at  5:30, the exact details in there that they will vote upon next week.  But  here is what Kevin Brady said just moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  I'm  confident at end of the day, the Senate will approve this Conference  Committee report because, no one should be defending the status quo in this  horrible tax code.  Americans have had to live for with for too long.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  But the key question everybody has, as exactly what kind of  changes were made?  For instance, we know the top income tax bracket was  lowered to 37 percent but what about other tax brackets, remember, the  Senate version had seven brackets whereas the House had four brackets.</p><p>Well, President Trump says, he has been kept the prize of everything that's  going on with the bill.  And here is what he said before he went to speak  at FBI graduation ceremony this morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have seen it.  I think  it's going to do very, very well.  I think that we are going to be in a  position to pass something as early as next week which will be monumental.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think they will be great.  They're great people.  They want to  see it done.  We're putting in a tremendous child tax credit.  And it is  increasing on a daily basis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So the bottom line answer to your question is everybody at least  on the administration and on Capitol Hill with an R next to their name, an  R for Republican is expecting this to pass.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We shall see, yes.  Adam, thank you very much for the latest.</p><p>Joining me now here at the studio, Fox News Contributor and former Utah  Congressman Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>Jason, thank you so much for being here.  We just got a note from Chad  Pergram, the Senior Producer for Fox News, he says Jeff Flake, Bob Corker,  Mike Lee, all three still undecided on this bill.  What do you think, how  does this play out?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh I think ultimately Marco Rubio,  Jeff Flake and Mike Lee will be a yes.  I don't think they will going to be  the last person standing putting up a blockade on this.  I think -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Would you want to be as a no -- </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think they will.  I think the child tax credit is  actually the way it is structured is bad public policy but nevertheless  they did coalesce and get behind that, and support it, and expand it.  But  the ones who watch are Corker, Collins and McCain.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Only lose two as we talked about -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Ultimately I do think it happens.  And I think by the time you  get to the end of the day Tuesday, perhaps Wednesday, it will have passed.   But hours later the funding of government will be the issue -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  The appropriations.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  The euphoric high that will being tax reform passing will be  demolished within hours when they get to the reality of how to fund the  government.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I want to get that in a minute.  But I want to get back to Marco  Rubio.  Some of this red line from him came out of nowhere.  Were you  surprised?  I think or Republican leadership was a little surprised?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, we always knew that Mike Lee and Marco Rubio were very  intent on doing it.  They did put it up for a vote and it failed.  But they  held the line.  And it's the way you get attention is hold out a no vote.   You keep saying no, no.  And suddenly the White House and everybody from  leadership and the -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  --- Ways and Means and Senate Finance come over and say what can  we do?  And he managed to get another $300 in there.  And for those  families it will make a difference, but again I think the public policy  side of it is wrong.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So this gets through.  Bob Corker's opposition has been the  expense.  What are we doing about spending as the deficit gets larger and  larger?  As conservative, are you worried about that?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, I wish he was more concern about the deficit on the  spending side.  I don't think you have to justify allowing the American  people to hold their own money in their own pockets.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But what you do have to do is make tough choices, and stop  spending so much money.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And this Republican Congress, House and Senate have been  terrible in actually cutting spending.  Name anything that they have cut?   And the answer is zero.  There is nothing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You're right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  There is nothing and I think that it is wrong to say, well, you  know, if times get tough that we raise taxes.  That's exactly the wrong  time to raise taxes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But you have to curve back spending up which they have done  nothing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So listen, this is going to be the first major legislative  success for the GOP if they can get this done.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We believe they will.  You never know.  It ain't over until it's  over.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Going into next year, I think attention will probably turns to  infrastructure.  Any issues with that?  Should that get through?  That  shouldn't be a big political football, should it?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, you've increased defense spending now to $664 billion.   And I do think the continuing resolution will fund that through the end of  September of 2018.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You have the infrastructure spending that you have to do as a  supplemental, they call it, it's like the term in Congress for the disaster  relief because of Irma and other hurricanes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yeah.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  That's going to approach $100 billion over time.  I don't know  where you go back and say, now we're going to infuse, you know, tens, if  not 100 plus billion dollars in infrastructure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It all sounds great until you actually look at the red line and  you see -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  You have to pay for it.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  How you pay for it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Is that where you bring in the private sector.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, you do want to have public/private partnerships.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But the government has to kick in to pay a lot?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.  And states also have to be involved.  But you have to  figure out where to go, to make those hard choices and say, instead of  spending money here, let's spend it over here.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  That's going to be a contentious discussion.  Although I do  think Democrats want to come to the table on that, because it is something  they do want.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Do you miss it?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I miss part of the fight.  I miss the people.  You know, I have  good friend there that -- you know from Tim Scott to Trey Gowdy and John  Radcliffe, and Mia Love and other, I miss interacting with but -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  What don't you miss?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Fund-raising.  I hate fund-raising.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You're always in that move?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I'd always -- and got a better balance to my life and -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  -- and nice little perch here with my relationship with Fox so.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's nice.  But, you know, listen, a lot of people from it  across this country look and say, why is it so dysfunctional?  Is it  dysfunctional?  Certainly appears to be a lot of the time.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I think in part it was structured that way by our founders.</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  It's not supposed to be a glide path to making this pass an  easy.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Sure.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You got 535 people with big egos all wanting to make decisions  and have their hands in the pot.  It's an ugly sausage-making process.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But it seems the environment is so much more contentious as it  has been.  I know it has been over the years, since day one, but it does  seem very much either you're with us or you're not.  There is not a lot of  compromise.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I wish people would stick to their principle whether their party  was in power or not in power.  Because I see both sides of the aisle  suddenly they flip on a principle -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Because now they're in the minority.  You know, and that just  drives you nuts.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You got your life back financially.  That's the most important  thing.  Jason, thank you very much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Turning to our other top story now, President Trump blasting the  FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal.  The President even  calling that probe rigged.  He used that word.  And that he has never seen  anything like it before.</p><p>Well, for the very latest bring let's in our own Blake Burman, he's been  following this from the White House.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Ashley.  And I asked  the President earlier today as he was leaving the White House whether or  not he thought the special counsel is biased, which is what many  Republicans here in Washington up on Capitol Hill have alleged.</p><p>The President was not willing earlier today to engage in that possibility  when I asked him about it.  However, he did use it as a launching pad to  sharply criticize the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email  investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Whatever you want to call it, you going to make up your own  determination, but they have found tremendous things on the other side.   When you look at the Hillary Clinton investigation that was -- you know,  I've been saying it for a long time.  That was a rigged system, folks.   That was a rigged system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now those comments came a day after Senator Ron Johnson claimed in  a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray, that James Comey's July statement  which eventually cleared Clinton from any criminal wrongdoing had been  watered down with three edits.  One edit said, it was \"possible that  hostile actors\" gained access to Clinton's private server, a downgrade from  \"reasonably likely.\"</p><p>Now Ashley, it is unclear exactly who made those edits, why they made those  edits and when they made those edits.  Senator Johnson in that letter said,  he did not know exactly when the edits were made, those exact dates.  So on  one hand it could have just been potentially the normal investigative work  as more information comes in, you make changes to your findings.  Or it  could have been as some have suggested that the FBI was in it, some at  least to help out Hillary Clinton.  Ashley?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, indeed.  All right, Blake Burman, thank you very much for  the latest on this.</p><p>Joining me now, Criminal Defense Attorney and former prosecutor, David  Bruno and American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.</p><p>Thank you both, gentlemen, for being here.  David, let me begin with you.</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Sure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You say that the underlying conduct by Director Comey and his  officials is troubling and may be criminal.  Where does the line get  crossed a bit for it to be criminal?</p><p>BRUNO:  Well, right now, there is an inspector general investigation that  is going on and we will be getting the report shortly.  But the most  troubling aspect of this is the edits that we just heard about in the  memorandum.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BRUNO:  Because one of the edits took away the language in the federal  statute that would have made a crime for Hillary Clinton to abuse the  classified documents.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BRUNO:  And that's gross negligence.  It was originally included and for  whatever reason by whoever it was modified, it was redacted and it was  changed to careless.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right, which got Hillary Clinton off the hook, essentially.</p><p>BRUNO:  Sure.  If you get away from gross negligence into carelessness,  it's no longer a federal crime.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, Ned, let me get to you, I was reading your talking  points, you have some strong views on this.  You were saying look, you talk  about Mueller's team, a partisan pack of wolves.  You say -- </p><p>NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  That's right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- the findings are chilling.  Kind if expand on that a little  bit.  What was the moats troubling aspect of this?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, first of all, I mean, I think it's becoming very clear over  the last couple weeks that Mueller's team is partisan pack of wolves.  When  you look at Peter Strzok, when you look at Andrew Weissmann, when you look  at Jeannie Rhee and now you look at Aaron Zebley, I mean, I'm very hard  press to think that these people are objective and I think our biases to  influence a lot of our decisions as human being.</p><p>So to say that it's person I think it's understatement but even more so,  Ashley, I think what we're seeing it the unfolding -- unwrapping of what I  think is one of the biggest political crimes we've seen in our history, in  which our government and a political party colluded together to undermine  and to destroy and nullify the election of the other party.</p><p>And so I think when we look at this, all of the American people, they  should find this chilling.  They should be deeply concerned about what's  taking place inside of their government and I there's more to come, Ashley.   I think we're going to see more revelations coming out in the coming weeks  in which people will start to fully understand, this is not good.</p><p>And I will say this, if Mike Pompeo and Jeff Sessions and Christopher Wray  are concerned about the constitution and the civil liberties of the  American people, they will protect those and not the institution.  They  should be more concerned about our freedom than protecting institutions.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, David, look, we all have our own opinions, our own  political leanings, if you like, and OK, so these FBI investigators have  their own political likes but the line seems to me -- there were certain  excerpts from some of these texts or emails where they say look, they make  reference to the point that we need some sort of insurance policy just to  make sure this guy, i.e., Donald Trump doesn't get elected.  To me that  crosses the line.</p><p>BRUNO:  Yes.  OK.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, we can't take the risk.  You know, to Ned's point,  there's almost, you know -- people talk about the deep state conspiracy, I  mean, this really smells -- doesn't smell right, let me put it that way.</p><p>BRUNO:  I agree with you.  There is nothing wrong with a bias so long as it  doesn't result in actions that are against the law.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right?</p><p>BRUNO:  Right, so -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Change the course of history maybe.</p><p>BRUNO:  So generally speaking the fact that one has a political affiliation  is not a problem, however, if it goes to the next step and like you said,  in the August text messages with agent Strzok talks about an insurance  policy.  And it also talks about a discussion in Andrew's office.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>BRUNO:  That could be Andrew McCabe.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.</p><p>BRUNO:  About the election which could be a hatch violation.  Hatch  violations are when the government talks about political affairs or gets  involved in political actions.  Possible hatch violation if that in fact  took place.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So Ned, I mean, you obviously believe we should have an  investigation of the investigators.  I mean, how should this be playing  out?  Should Mueller be coming out and addressing this right away?</p><p>RYUN:  I think when this -- Well, I do.  At this point though, I was  talking with the former DOJ official, and he said I still actually respect  Mueller but I will find any of his findings, not believable.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>RYUN:  And so I think you've got a credibility problem.  But Ashley, even  more importantly what do we even talking about with this investigation as a  whole?  I believe it was started on false pretenses, a fake dossier that  spun all of this up.  And so I would actually argue that the instigation as  a whole, regardless of the partisan nature of the team is illegitimate in  of itself.  And so I think we need to start having that conversations  about, is this investigation even a legitimate one moving forward?</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  What do you say, David?</p><p>BRUNO:  Well, I talked about the inspector general before.  Right now the  inspector general is reviewing the Hillary Clinton FBI investigation.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BRUNO:  And the inspector general's office is the watchdog over the DOJ.   So if there is any impropriety going on in the Mueller investigation right  now, there will be a review at some point by the inspector general.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Ned, you know, what we want and what we're not getting is we want  some sunlight on this.  And we want transparency.</p><p>RYUN:  That's right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  How do we do that?  What should be done from this point forward?</p><p>RYUN:  We declassify.  I think the only way that the people of America can  start to trust the DOJ and the FBI again, is I think we need to have some  extreme transparency.  I think we need to go back and declassify a lot of  what took place over the last eight years.</p><p>I know that people again, the heads of these departments right now might  not be comfortable doing that, but Ashley, I that is only way we can get  back to having trust and faith in these institutions is to really  declassify.  What happened with Clinton and Loretta Lynch on that tarmac in  Arizona?  What really did happened with Comey's clearing of Hillary  Clinton?  What happened with Peter Strzok?  The only way we get to that we  have to declassify.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And of course, David, in the background of all of this is we have  the Russia investigation.  The collusion which the President addressed  earlier today when you're saying, there is no collusion.  What have you  found so far?  They haven't anything, right?</p><p>BRUNO:  Right.  I mean, well, we don't know, right?  We have multiple  indictments -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  We've been going on for a long time.</p><p>BRUNO:  We have a couple indictments.  We have to two police (ph), one by  George Papadopoulos and Mike Flynn.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But directly link to -- </p><p>BRUNO:  Right.  And that is pending.  It's going on.  We don't know.  We  will see at this point, absolutely.  We have not seen any collusion or  conspiracy that goes right to the White House.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, Ned, how long does this go on for?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, this -- but the point I want to make is, we've had this thing  going on for at least a year-and-a-half, almost two yes.  And I've made  this argument to people.  Use your common sense.  You had heads of  intelligence agencies that didn't like Trump.  You have a deep state  bureaucracy that doesn't like Trump.  And yet, the opposition party, the  mainstream media that doesn't like him.  If there was actually something  there, don't you think we would have heard of it right now?</p><p>And so I'd argue, again there is nothing evidence there is many evidence  that never will be evidence, of the fairy tale of Trump-Russia collusion.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, we have to leave it right there.  David, Ned, thank  you so much.  Great conversation.  I really appreciate it.</p><p>BRUNO:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Take a look at the market today and by the way, nice rally going  on, the Dow up 163 points.  We're at 24,670 on the Dow.  The S&amp;P up one  percent, the Nasdaq also going great guns, up at more than one percent, up  6938 on the Nasdaq.</p><p>All right, we'll have more on the markets and so much more after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Now, check it out, stocks broadly higher today with the Dow up  triple digits.  We had session highs just a few seconds ago.  In fact,  there is a new Intraday record for the Dow.  It seems like we say it every  day.  Investor reacting to some positive earnings and retail sales, and  guess what?  Our very own Nicole Petallides live at always at the New York  Stock Exchange, with more on a buying spree this Friday, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  That's right.  It is heavy volume.   It is quadruple-witching.  And we have some rebalancing.  I'm just telling  you it's going to be a really heavy volume day.</p><p>In addition to that, right now we're up 160 points on the Dow Jones  Industrial average, near our session highs.  We're clocking in another  winning week, right?  So the Dow will be up four weeks in a row and at the  close, it will be our 69th record, which will tied the all-time amount of  closing records for any given year, which is back in 1995.  If we have one  more after this, Ash, we will go down in history as most records ever.</p><p>We're talking a looking, not only as the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P which  have up arrows.  But you can see, since Election Day, the Dow Jones  Industrial average up about 35 percent, the S&amp;P up about 25 percent.  So we  certainly have enjoyed a nice run.  It was a lot obviously built in on tax  reform and the overall, which certainly seems to going well today, on the  latest amendments that have been made on the child tax reform to appeal  Rubio and Lee -- Senators Rubio and Lee.</p><p>So that's -- while taking a look at Costco, and Adobe, both of which had  positive quarterly earnings, look at Costco up 3.5 percent, Adobe 1.6  percent, new high there by the way for Costco taking a look at some of the  other retailers, big picture cracks up 17 percent, getting an upgrade over  at Stifel, Nicolaus and just talking about their exposure abroad and that  does well.</p><p>Remember when the stock is 75 bucks about 10 years ago?  Forget that, how  about you focus on this, great day today, Under Armour some positive  comments there from the analysts as well and also foot locker getting an  upgrade and getting the margins, going forward we'll watch the margins.   You can see that too was a winner.</p><p>Overall, we will say that Moody has talked about the run up, recent run-up  that we've seen in retail.  It might be exhaustive.  So we'll see that the  latest retail sales numbers, Ashley, were pretty great.  I mean, they were  showing straight to people, spending on things that they don't really need,  furniture, electronics, sporting good, books, music.  So the latest numbers  were pretty good showing holiday shoppers were hitting the stores.  Back to  you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I always need electronics.  I'm just saying, I'm a kind of gadget  guy, Nicole.  So it's always an excuse to buy electronics.  I love it.   Anyway, thank you so much.  Great stuff.  Who knows, Dow 25,000 by  Christmas?  Maybe.</p><p>Meanwhile, backlash today over the roll back of Obama-era net neutrality  rules, with all the hysteria out there, you think, well the internet as we  know it is coming to an end.  Our own Deirdre Bolton is here to cut through  all the noise.  And she will be next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  We are just getting word from our colleagues at Fox News that  Marco Rubio is indeed a yes now on the tax bill.  He got what he wanted, a  bump in that refund on the child tax credit.  He is in on board, we are  told, still, we don't know about Bob Corker, Mike Lee, Jeff Flake, Susan  Collins, still some questions to be answered.  But Marco Rubio essentially  got what he wanted.  Now he says yes to the tax bill.</p><p>Also the FCC voting to end net neutrality rules guarantying equal access to  the internet.  Now most experts say, these changes won't have much impact  in the short term.  Others are resorting to complete hysteria.</p><p>CNN actually reported this as, the \"End of the internet.\"  Sentiments  shared by Senator Bernie Sanders who tweeted Congress and the courts need  to fight back.</p><p>Meanwhile, others have said this is attack on LBGT community.  Some on  Twitter even said we will going to die.</p><p>I kid you not.  Deirdre Bolton is here now.  Deirdre --</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, we're all going to die  at some point but it is not in direct relation to repeal of -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  But should we be in a panic?  Come on.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, listen, it is not the end of the internet as we know with the  soundtrack, right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  But it is the beginning of a huge fight.</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p>BOLTON:  So you have 20 states attorney generals, they've lined up to sue  the FCC calling the agency's move, a violation of the law and a serious  threat to the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>So here is a map.  We made a list of states that are beginning to take a  legal action against the FCC.  So I'm not going to read all the names.  But  you can see them, north, south, east, west more adding themselves as we  speak.</p><p>So the tech community going bonkers.  Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg,  Microsoft's Brad Smith, execs from Google, Airbnb, a whole list, speaking  out.  This is Netflix's statement as further tweet this morning.  \"We're  disappointed in the decision to gut net neutrality protections that ushered  in an unprecedented era of innovation, creativity and civic engagement.   This is the beginning of a longer legal battle.  Netflix stands with  innovators, large and small, to oppose this misguided FCC order.\"</p><p>Now Netflix, other big tech companies, they're taking a stand on the vote  on principle because the service providers such as Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T,  they can charge Netflix more money because Netflix uses more internet  capacity when we all binge watch our shows.  But it doesn't matter, Netflix  can pay.</p><p>So the reason big tech is fighting the FCC is because big tech says the  vote kills innovation.  So for example, if there is future competitor out  there to Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix trying to build itself up now, a  fledgling company, the arguments goes would not even be able to get off the  ground and afford the fees that a Verizon, or a Comcast, or an AT&amp;T would  have the power to demand.</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, he calls Silicon Valley a bunch of hypocrites.  Here  is part of his statement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AJIT PAI, FCC CHAIRMAN:  Companies likes Facebook, and Amazon, and Netflix,  and Google, became global giants precisely because the government wasn't  involved.  That's part of reason why I think so much of this hysteria is  simply misplaced.  As we will see going forward, getting this regulatory  system, right, means better, faster cheaper internet access for all  Americans across the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  So that is the FCC Chair.  So actually he's kind of like -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Ajit Pai -- so basically he says, this will enable, get  government out of the way.</p><p>BOLTON:  Yeah.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It will enable the internet providers to get more money, if I  want to pay for faster internet.  I can, it's not like, the internet is  going away.</p><p>BOLTON:  So that's exactly the point.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I can pay more if I want to.</p><p>BOLTON:  So he has two offshoots.  That first statement is very true.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  Actually Portugal is a live experiment in that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.</p><p>BOLTON:  So people there, they pay for tiered internet access much as we  pay for tiered cable access.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  It's essentially the same system, just with a different product.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Got it.</p><p>BOLTON:  Ajit Pai's second point, he is libertarian.  So he just by  definition, by philosophy is for less regulation.  And he says, Verizon,  Comcast, AT&amp;T, the service providers.  He said they don't really have a  financial incentive to invest or to build in underserved areas, be they  rural or low income earner -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Right, this would give them the money to do it?</p><p>BOLTON:  Well, I think his argument is that if they can make money and  other ways charging Netflix or Facebook, then they will take that money,  and build out broadband and maybe areas that are not as well-served.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So bottom line is, it is not the end of world as we know it.  We  are all going to die at some point but not as a result of the FCC -- OK,  very good.  Deirdre, thank you very much.  Good stuff.</p><p>U.N.

Don't miss that.</p><p>U.S. envoy Nikki Haley says the Trump administration now has proof that  Iran is expanding its nuclear program and meddling in the Yemeni Civil War.   And that came in the form of a charred piece of recovered ballistic  missile.  Take a look at that press conference in Washington yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.:  When you look at this missile,  this is terrifying, this is absolutely terrifying.  And this is why it has  to stop.  We have said multiple times, that this is not just about the  nuclear program.  This is about everything else they're doing because Iran  believes that they have been given a pass.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  So, did Iran really violate the nuclear deal?  Here to discuss,  Fox News Foreign Affairs analyst Dr. Walid Phares.  Walid, thank you so  much for joining us.</p><p>So I notice that you said from Nikki Haley's conversations yesterday was  one of the most advanced policy declarations on Iran by U.S. officials to  date.  Explain.</p><p>DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANALYST:  It was really because  Ambassador Haley after the speech of President in Riyadh a few months ago  has pushed the explanation of what the U.S. position is very clearly.</p><p>Number one, Iran is now plotted to have been using those missiles through  the militias via Yemen.  And, you look at the video that the public has  seen, and you see the actual missiles.  So that is a very important point.</p><p>Number two, there is an interpretation, an American interpretation that  those missiles are now deployed outside of Iran, which means that one of  the actions that the U.S. is seeking from the international community and  from the allies is to stop the shipping of those missiles and other  equipment outside Iran which will tell me more about what's behind the  horizons.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It seems like the U.S. is a little bit alone on this.  I will get  into Saudi Arabia in a minute but you know, the Europeans, they continue to  take this softly, softly approach, and believe that the U.S. is off kilter  here because at least we have the Iranians locked date in some sort of a  nuclear deal.  But my thought on that, it is not a good deal in the first  place and they are clearly violating it.</p><p>PHARES:  Absolutely.  I mean, it is tot a good deal.  We all know that,  most of us who criticized the deal, the administration and many members of  the U.S. Congress.  But what the Ambassador Haley has done, it's claim that  OK, we have the criticism of the Iran dial.  That's not what I'm talking  about right now.</p><p>I'm talking about the missiles.  And the minute she did that we'll going to  have with us, maybe for the Arab and Muslim countries in the coalition.   We're going to have with us France.  Imagine that the President of France  was also addressing missiles issue and maybe the U.K. and with them a  number of eastern European and the central European countries concerned  about those missiles.</p><p>Guess what?  Some countries in Latin American, Africa, East Asia, all of  these countries can come with us on the objection to the missiles  regardless of the issue of the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What is your interpretation, what is been going on in Saudi  Arabia, in particularly the Crown Prince, the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammad  bin Salman, who's very anti-Iran and very strong on this, and by all  accounts has been communicating with Israel.  I mean, could we have a  Saudi-Israel alliance to take on Iran?  I mean, they are very, very  aggressive in this field?</p><p>PHARES:  I have been monitoring -- many observers have been analyzing the  changes that have been taking place in Saudi Arabia.  Even use a term which  may not apply but could, enlighten us, Perestroika and Glasnost.  It's when  the Soviet Union started to changed course, unfortunately for them they  collapsed.</p><p>What is happening here is that MBS, Mohammad bin Salman is trying to move  Saudi Arabia in different direction.  That is not easy.  It's not done  overnight.</p><p>So number one they canceled the power of religious belief, (ph) which was  the must difficult thing to change and after that, giving rights to women.   More important geopolitically, indeed, you're right he is mobilizing Saudi  power and his allies in the peninsula and Arab allies against the expansion  of Iranian military force in the region.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very quickly, I have 10 seconds, Walid, but we're seeing Iran's  influence spread out, aren't we?  We're seeing it take over some of the  vacuum in Syria and Iraq?</p><p>PHARES:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  How concerned are you, how much dominance or at least the growth,  if you like, of Iran outside of its own borders?</p><p>PHARES:  Very quickly I have been very concerned for the last maybe nine  years.  Now that I see that there is an Arab coalition forming now, now  that I see that we have a bridge with that coalition, I think we are now in  the beginning of the phase to push back against Iran.  This is just  starting right now.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very good.  We have to leave it right there.  But it's great  stuff.  Dr. Walid Phares.  Thank you so much, I appreciate it.</p><p>PHARES:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Thank you.</p><p>Americans spent much more than the economists predicted so far this holiday  season.

Nordstrom up 16 percent.  Walmart up nine percent.</p><p>Why?  Well, maybe it's because, so long people are getting paychecks.  It  used to be 2009, November 2009, unemployment was about 10 percent.</p><p>Now we're about 4.1 percent.  And I'll tell you, believe me, Ashley, heard  of the little drummer boys you got a whole bunch of them out here today,  very talented folks, entertaining the shoppers along State Street as they  look at the Marshall Fields windows (INAUDIBLE) decades along State Street.</p><p>What's known as today, the most wonderful time of the year for retailers?   Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Fantastic job, Jeff Flock.  Great drumming.  I have a headache.   But it was wonderful, very, very good indeed.  They were talented.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, Star Wars: The Last Jedi opening today to rave reviews  and what is expected to be Blockbuster tickets sales, the force is strong  with this one.  We could see a record opening weekend.  We've got a preview  for you, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  For the finalized tax bill is supposed to be released around 5:30  made public.  It wasn't good enough for our own Blake Burman.  He managed  to get his hand on it right now.  Blake, what are you seeing in that bill?</p><p>BURMAN:  And as of it, it's coming to from several sources here in  Washington and the first thing that jumps out, which not going to put all  the numbers up right now, we were just given them.</p><p>The first thing that jumps up is seven different brackets, that being 10,  12, 22, 24, 32, 35, 37.  The original Senate bill is what won out here.   Because what the individual side of this is the same as what first appeared  in the individual Senate bill.  The tweaks that are made to it are on side,  where it's those who are married or filing jointly.</p><p>The top end rate has gotten a lot of talk, on individual side.  It will be  $500,000 at 37 percent.  On the married filing jointly side, it will be  600,000 and above.  That number has dropped substantially from the initial  Senate plan.  It was initially at a million dollars.  So that got slashed  some 40 percent, where the tinkering is, again it's on the married filing  jointly side, when you start to play with brackets in between, there some  numbers raid, some numbers lowered but the headline here is what we are  getting from expect posted publicly here at 5:30.  The seven brackets, and  it appears, not appears, what happened in the Senate bill and initially,  won out here.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, certainly appears that way.  Great stuff, Blake Burman,  thank you very much.</p><p>Of course, they'll be pouring tomorrow that bill as he gets the time to do  that.  But those are the headline numbers that you saw just the -- Blake,  thank you very much.</p><p>The \"Star Wars\" franchise is certainly a force to be reckoned with, as we  know that, the latest chapter in the legendary series, The Last Jedi, now  in theaters and on track for me as the largest movie opening ever.</p><p>Joining me now to discuss all the light saber swinging action, comScore  Incorporated Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian.  Paul, thank you for  joining me, have you seen the movie?  I assume you have.  Is it a home run?</p><p>PAUL DERGARABEDIAN, COMSCORE'S SENIOR MEDIA ANALYST:  I sure have.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It is a home run?</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  It's a total home run.  I saw the movie, of course, this is  the follow-up to 2015's, \"The Force Awakens\" which opened in North America  to the biggest debut ever, $248 million.</p><p>Now, that long two years ago, had a 57 million preview night on Thursday.   This film had the second biggest Thursday preview with 45 million.  So the  Last Jedi is off to rollicking start, and could join the 200 million club  for opening weekend in North America.  Not only has three films on the list  right now, this could be the 4th.  So a huge deal for the movie industry  this weekend.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Am I right, Paul that it's two and a half hour long or did I  misread that?  And it has going to be good to occupy for two and a half  hours?</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  Yes, I already say a great movie can't be long enough and  if it's a terrible move, anything over now would be, you know, you'd suffer  thought that.  But I think what we're seeing in the comScore data, we do exit polling.  So we have a service called post-track.  And  this is movie is showing five out of five stars.  You can't get higher than  that in our survey.  82 percent definite recommend.  So that means  audiences are loving it.  The critics are loving it.  And that's how you  get to a billion dollars in worldwide Box Office and beyond.</p><p>And we're already showing that the film has earned $106 million in two  days, globally.  And now it's poised for a massive weekend worldwide.  And  it really a global business -- </p><p>WEBSTER:  Indeed, it is.</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  And the \"Star Wars\" franchise is a global phenomenon, and  this sets us on really strong pace for the rest of the bock office share,  which we have about two weeks left.</p><p>You know, \"Star Wars\" fanatics are very fiercely protective of the  property.  You know that very quickly, Paul.</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  Right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It seems like Disney is doing a good job with continuing this  franchise.</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  Yeah, they are.  I mean, you know, it's a huge amount of  responsibility to take this on with the first movie opening in 1977.  The  franchise just in theaters worldwide up to this point about $7.5 billion,  you add the merchandising on to that.  And then, of course, we have next  Memorial Day, the Han Solo movie.  And two years from now will be episode  nine, the next installment in this new trilogy, and the final installment  in this new trilogy.  So this is the gift that keeps on giving to Disney.   This is a long term play.  We're talking about decades long, you know,  everyone's kids and their grand kids will be seeing \"Star Wars\" movies for  the next many decades.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Wow.  I think you're all right there.  Paul Dergarabedian.  Paul,  thank you very much.  I will two and a half hours -- </p><p>DERGARABEDIAN:  Thank you, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I'll take your advice.  I will go and watch it.  Thank you so  much.</p><p>As we get ready to hand over to Liz Claman.  The Dow up 157 points.  What a  great way to finish the week.  The Dow at 24,666, ominously, but there you  go, good day for the market.  Our time is up.  Liz Claman, over to you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I don't know if anyone believes it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO: I believe it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEBSTER: Thank you very much, Neil.</p><p>Well, we will see that finalized version of the Republican tax bill in just a few hours from now. Lawmakers making last minute changes, specifically the child tax credit, following <person><nameText>Senator Marco Rubio's </nameText></person>threat to vote no on that bill if the credit is not expanded. But it is still a little bit unclear if this is enough to secure a yes vote from Rubio. We'll talk about that.</p><p>But the uncertainty over tax reform having little impact on the market today, as you can see another nice rally, the Dow up a 156 points, 24,664. Remarkable. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Ashley Webster. In today for Trish Regan to the -- and we begin now with \"The Intelligence Report.</p><p>Let's get right to it. Republicans can only afford, we know this, to lose two GOP senators if they want to get this tax bill passed.</p><p>And well, there are a handful that, well, we could see are on the fence right now, including Senators Mike Lee, Bob Corker, what about <person><nameText>Jeff Flake? </nameText></person>So the question is, can they get it done? We'll be asking former Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz. He is here in the studio with us.</p><p>Plus, <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>blasting the FBI handling of the <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>email scandal. The President even calling that probe rig and that he's ever seen anything like this before. I have more on that in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first, let's go to our very own Adam Shapiro for the latest on this tax reform fight. The clock is ticking. Adam, is this thing going to get through?</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: When you speak to talk to people at the administration and on Capitol Hill that's a very simple yes. They expect it to pass.</p><p>Now, where we stand right now, we do expect <person><nameText>Marco Rubio </nameText></person>to vote yes on this bill because he has gotten a decisional $300 for the child tax credit refund that he wanted. This would come against through payroll taxes on the first -- what is it? Roughly zero to $25,000 in income. In simple terms, if you don't have federal income tax liability he wanted to increase the amount you would get back for a child tax credit.</p><p>So he is seems to have achieve that. And as a member of the Conference Committee, the source close to conference committee, he told me we'll give him what he wants and he'll be yes.</p><p>The other two though, the undecided are Senator Flake and Senator Corker. Even if they were to vote no, that still may not be enough to kill the bill and there is all kind of calculations that go into it. But everyone is expecting a yes next week.</p><p>Now, what we know at this point, according to Representative Jordan as well a Kevin Brady, the Conference Committee is done. They have signed the report. It is closed, and we will find out when it is filed publicly at 5:30, the exact details in there that they will vote upon next week. But here is what Kevin Brady said just moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE: I'm confident at end of the day, the Senate will approve this Conference Committee report because, no one should be defending the status quo in this horrible tax code. Americans have had to live for with for too long.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: But the key question everybody has, as exactly what kind of changes were made? For instance, we know the top income tax bracket was lowered to 37 percent but what about other tax brackets, remember, the Senate version had seven brackets whereas the House had four brackets.</p><p>Well, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>says, he has been kept the prize of everything that's going on with the bill. And here is what he said before he went to speak at FBI graduation ceremony this morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have seen it. I think it's going to do very, very well. I think that we are going to be in a position to pass something as early as next week which will be monumental.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>TRUMP: I think they will be great. They're great people. They want to see it done. We're putting in a tremendous child tax credit. And it is increasing on a daily basis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: So the bottom line answer to your question is everybody at least on the administration and on Capitol Hill with an R next to their name, an R for Republican is expecting this to pass.</p><p>WEBSTER: We shall see, yes. Adam, thank you very much for the latest.</p><p>Joining me now here at the studio, Fox NewsContributor and former Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>Jason, thank you so much for being here. We just got a note from Chad Pergram, the Senior Producer for Fox News, he says <person><nameText>Jeff Flake, </nameText></person>Bob Corker, Mike Lee, all three still undecided on this bill. What do you think, how does this play out?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWSCONTRIBUTOR: Oh I think ultimately <person><nameText>Marco Rubio, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Jeff Flake </nameText></person>and Mike Lee will be a yes. I don't think they will going to be the last person standing putting up a blockade on this. I think --</p><p>WEBSTER: Would you want to be as a no --</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I don't think they will. I think the child tax credit is actually the way it is structured is bad public policy but nevertheless they did coalesce and get behind that, and support it, and expand it. But the ones who watch are Corker, Collins and McCain.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Only lose two as we talked about --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Ultimately I do think it happens. And I think by the time you get to the end of the day Tuesday, perhaps Wednesday, it will have passed. But hours later the funding of government will be the issue --</p><p>WEBSTER: The appropriations.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: The euphoric high that will being tax reform passing will be demolished within hours when they get to the reality of how to fund the government.</p><p>WEBSTER: I want to get that in a minute. But I want to get back to <person><nameText>Marco Rubio. </nameText></person>Some of this red line from him came out of nowhere. Were you surprised? I think or Republican leadership was a little surprised?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, we always knew that Mike Lee and <person><nameText>Marco Rubio </nameText></person>were very intent on doing it. They did put it up for a vote and it failed. But they held the line. And it's the way you get attention is hold out a no vote. You keep saying no, no. And suddenly the White House and everybody from leadership and the --</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --- Ways and Means and Senate Finance come over and say what can we do? And he managed to get another $300 in there. And for those families it will make a difference, but again I think the public policy side of it is wrong.</p><p>WEBSTER: So this gets through. Bob Corker's opposition has been the expense. What are we doing about spending as the deficit gets larger and larger? As conservative, are you worried about that?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, I wish he was more concern about the deficit on the spending side. I don't think you have to justify allowing the American people to hold their own money in their own pockets.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: But what you do have to do is make tough choices, and stop spending so much money.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: And this Republican Congress, House and Senate have been terrible in actually cutting spending. Name anything that they have cut? And the answer is zero. There is nothing.</p><p>WEBSTER: You're right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: There is nothing and I think that it is wrong to say, well, you know, if times get tough that we raise taxes. That's exactly the wrong time to raise taxes.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: But you have to curve back spending up which they have done nothing.</p><p>WEBSTER: So listen, this is going to be the first major legislative success for the GOP if they can get this done.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER: We believe they will. You never know. It ain't over until it's over.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Right.</p><p>WEBSTER: Going into next year, I think attention will probably turns to infrastructure. Any issues with that? Should that get through? That shouldn't be a big political football, should it?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, you've increased defense spending now to $664 billion. And I do think the continuing resolution will fund that through the end of September of 2018.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You have the infrastructure spending that you have to do as a supplemental, they call it, it's like the term in Congress for the disaster relief because of Irma and other hurricanes.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yeah.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: That's going to approach $100 billion over time. I don't know where you go back and say, now we're going to infuse, you know, tens, if not 100 plus billion dollars in infrastructure.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It all sounds great until you actually look at the red line and you see --</p><p>WEBSTER: You have to pay for it.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: How you pay for it.</p><p>WEBSTER: Is that where you bring in the private sector.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, you do want to have public/private partnerships.</p><p>WEBSTER: But the government has to kick in to pay a lot?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes. And states also have to be involved. But you have to figure out where to go, to make those hard choices and say, instead of spending money here, let's spend it over here.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: That's going to be a contentious discussion. Although I do think Democrats want to come to the table on that, because it is something they do want.</p><p>WEBSTER: Do you miss it?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I miss part of the fight. I miss the people. You know, I have good friend there that -- you know from Tim Scott to Trey Gowdy and John Radcliffe, and Mia Love and other, I miss interacting with but --</p><p>WEBSTER: What don't you miss?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Fund-raising. I hate fund-raising.</p><p>WEBSTER: You're always in that move?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'd always -- and got a better balance to my life and --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: -- and nice little perch here with my relationship with Fox so.</p><p>WEBSTER: That's nice. But, you know, listen, a lot of people from it across this country look and say, why is it so dysfunctional? Is it dysfunctional? Certainly appears to be a lot of the time.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I think in part it was structured that way by our founders.</p><p>WEBSTER: OK.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It's not supposed to be a glide path to making this pass an easy.</p><p>WEBSTER: Sure.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You got 535 people with big egos all wanting to make decisions and have their hands in the pot. It's an ugly sausage-making process.</p><p>WEBSTER: But it seems the environment is so much more contentious as it has been. I know it has been over the years, since day one, but it does seem very much either you're with us or you're not. There is not a lot of compromise.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I wish people would stick to their principle whether their party was in power or not in power. Because I see both sides of the aisle suddenly they flip on a principle --</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Because now they're in the minority. You know, and that just drives you nuts.</p><p>WEBSTER: You got your life back financially. That's the most important thing. Jason, thank you very much. I appreciate it.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: Turning to our other top story now, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>blasting the FBI's handling of the <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>email scandal. The President even calling that probe rigged. He used that word. And that he has never seen anything like it before.</p><p>Well, for the very latest bring let's in our own Blake Burman, he's been following this from the White House. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, there, Ashley. And I asked the President earlier today as he was leaving the White House whether or not he thought the special counsel is biased, which is what many Republicans here in Washington up on Capitol Hill have alleged.</p><p>The President was not willing earlier today to engage in that possibility when I asked him about it. However, he did use it as a launching pad to sharply criticize the FBI's handling of the <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>email investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Whatever you want to call it, you going to make up your own determination, but they have found tremendous things on the other side. When you look at the <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>investigation that was -- you know, I've been saying it for a long time. That was a rigged system, folks. That was a rigged system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Now those comments came a day after Senator Ron Johnson claimed in a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray, that James Comey's July statement which eventually cleared Clinton from any criminal wrongdoing had been watered down with three edits. One edit said, it was \"possible that hostile actors\" gained access to Clinton's private server, a downgrade from \"reasonably likely.\"</p><p>Now Ashley, it is unclear exactly who made those edits, why they made those edits and when they made those edits. Senator Johnson in that letter said, he did not know exactly when the edits were made, those exact dates. So on one hand it could have just been potentially the normal investigative work as more information comes in, you make changes to your findings. Or it could have been as some have suggested that the FBI was in it, some at least to help out <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>Ashley?</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, indeed. All right, Blake Burman, thank you very much for the latest on this.</p><p>Joining me now, Criminal Defense Attorney and former prosecutor, David Bruno and American Majority CEO Ned Ryun.</p><p>Thank you both, gentlemen, for being here. David, let me begin with you.</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Sure.</p><p>WEBSTER: You say that the underlying conduct by Director Comey and his officials is troubling and may be criminal. Where does the line get crossed a bit for it to be criminal?</p><p>BRUNO: Well, right now, there is an inspector general investigation that is going on and we will be getting the report shortly. But the most troubling aspect of this is the edits that we just heard about in the memorandum.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>BRUNO: Because one of the edits took away the language in the federal statute that would have made a crime for <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>to abuse the classified documents.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>BRUNO: And that's gross negligence. It was originally included and for whatever reason by whoever it was modified, it was redacted and it was changed to careless.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right, which got <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>off the hook, essentially.</p><p>BRUNO: Sure. If you get away from gross negligence into carelessness, it's no longer a federal crime.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right, Ned, let me get to you, I was reading your talking points, you have some strong views on this. You were saying look, you talk about Mueller's team, a partisan pack of wolves. You say --</p><p>NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO: That's right.</p><p>WEBSTER: -- the findings are chilling. Kind if expand on that a little bit. What was the moats troubling aspect of this?</p><p>RYUN: Well, first of all, I mean, I think it's becoming very clear over the last couple weeks that Mueller's team is partisan pack of wolves. When you look at Peter Strzok, when you look at Andrew Weissmann, when you look at Jeannie Rhee and now you look at Aaron Zebley, I mean, I'm very hard press to think that these people are objective and I think our biases to influence a lot of our decisions as human being.</p><p>So to say that it's person I think it's understatement but even more so, Ashley, I think what we're seeing it the unfolding -- unwrapping of what I think is one of the biggest political crimes we've seen in our history, in which our government and a political party colluded together to undermine and to destroy and nullify the election of the other party.</p><p>And so I think when we look at this, all of the American people, they should find this chilling. They should be deeply concerned about what's taking place inside of their government and I there's more to come, Ashley. I think we're going to see more revelations coming out in the coming weeks in which people will start to fully understand, this is not good.</p><p>And I will say this, if Mike Pompeo and Jeff Sessions and Christopher Wray are concerned about the constitution and the civil liberties of the American people, they will protect those and not the institution. They should be more concerned about our freedom than protecting institutions.</p><p>WEBSTER: You know, David, look, we all have our own opinions, our own political leanings, if you like, and OK, so these FBI investigators have their own political likes but the line seems to me -- there were certain excerpts from some of these texts or emails where they say look, they make reference to the point that we need some sort of insurance policy just to make sure this guy, i.e., <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>doesn't get elected. To me that crosses the line.</p><p>BRUNO: Yes. OK.</p><p>WEBSTER: You know, we can't take the risk. You know, to Ned's point, there's almost, you know -- people talk about the deep state conspiracy, I mean, this really smells -- doesn't smell right, let me put it that way.</p><p>BRUNO: I agree with you. There is nothing wrong with a bias so long as it doesn't result in actions that are against the law.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right?</p><p>BRUNO: Right, so --</p><p>WEBSTER: Change the course of history maybe.</p><p>BRUNO: So generally speaking the fact that one has a political affiliation is not a problem, however, if it goes to the next step and like you said, in the August text messages with agent Strzok talks about an insurance policy. And it also talks about a discussion in Andrew's office.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, that's right.</p><p>BRUNO: That could be Andrew McCabe.</p><p>WEBSTER: Correct.</p><p>BRUNO: About the election which could be a hatch violation. Hatch violations are when the government talks about political affairs or gets involved in political actions. Possible hatch violation if that in fact took place.</p><p>WEBSTER: So Ned, I mean, you obviously believe we should have an investigation of the investigators. I mean, how should this be playing out? Should Mueller be coming out and addressing this right away?</p><p>RYUN: I think when this -- Well, I do. At this point though, I was talking with the former DOJ official, and he said I still actually respect Mueller but I will find any of his findings, not believable.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>RYUN: And so I think you've got a credibility problem. But Ashley, even more importantly what do we even talking about with this investigation as a whole? I believe it was started on false pretenses, a fake dossier that spun all of this up. And so I would actually argue that the instigation as a whole, regardless of the partisan nature of the team is illegitimate in of itself. And so I think we need to start having that conversations about, is this investigation even a legitimate one moving forward?</p><p>WEBSTER: That's a good point. What do you say, David?</p><p>BRUNO: Well, I talked about the inspector general before. Right now the inspector general is reviewing the <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>FBI investigation.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>BRUNO: And the inspector general's office is the watchdog over the DOJ. So if there is any impropriety going on in the Mueller investigation right now, there will be a review at some point by the inspector general.</p><p>WEBSTER: Ned, you know, what we want and what we're not getting is we want some sunlight on this. And we want transparency.</p><p>RYUN: That's right.</p><p>WEBSTER: How do we do that? What should be done from this point forward?</p><p>RYUN: We declassify. I think the only way that the people of America can start to trust the DOJ and the FBI again, is I think we need to have some extreme transparency. I think we need to go back and declassify a lot of what took place over the last eight years.</p><p>I know that people again, the heads of these departments right now might not be comfortable doing that, but Ashley, I that is only way we can get back to having trust and faith in these institutions is to really declassify. What happened with Clinton and Loretta Lynch on that tarmac in Arizona? What really did happened with Comey's clearing of <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton? </nameText></person>What happened with Peter Strzok? The only way we get to that we have to declassify.</p><p>WEBSTER: And of course, David, in the background of all of this is we have the Russia investigation. The collusion which the President addressed earlier today when you're saying, there is no collusion. What have you found so far? They haven't anything, right?</p><p>BRUNO: Right. I mean, well, we don't know, right? We have multiple indictments --</p><p>WEBSTER: We've been going on for a long time.</p><p>BRUNO: We have a couple indictments. We have to two police (ph), one by George Papadopoulos and Mike Flynn.</p><p>WEBSTER: But directly link to --</p><p>BRUNO: Right. And that is pending. It's going on. We don't know. We will see at this point, absolutely. We have not seen any collusion or conspiracy that goes right to the White House.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, Ned, how long does this go on for?</p><p>RYUN: Well, this -- but the point I want to make is, we've had this thing going on for at least a year-and-a-half, almost two yes. And I've made this argument to people. Use your common sense. You had heads of intelligence agencies that didn't like Trump. You have a deep state bureaucracy that doesn't like Trump. And yet, the opposition party, the mainstream media that doesn't like him. If there was actually something there, don't you think we would have heard of it right now?</p><p>And so I'd argue, again there is nothing evidence there is many evidence that never will be evidence, of the fairy tale of Trump-Russia collusion.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right, we have to leave it right there. David, Ned, thank you so much. Great conversation. I really appreciate it.</p><p>BRUNO: Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: Take a look at the market today and by the way, nice rally going on, the Dow up 163 points. We're at 24,670 on the Dow. The S&amp;P up one percent, the Nasdaq also going great guns, up at more than one percent, up 6938 on the Nasdaq.</p><p>All right, we'll have more on the markets and so much more after this.</p><p>WEBSTER: Now, check it out, stocks broadly higher today with the Dow up triple digits. We had session highs just a few seconds ago. In fact, there is a new Intraday record for the Dow. It seems like we say it every day. Investor reacting to some positive earnings and retail sales, and guess what? Our very own Nicole Petallides live at always at the New York Stock Exchange, with more on a buying spree this Friday, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: That's right. It is heavy volume. It is quadruple-witching. And we have some rebalancing. I'm just telling you it's going to be a really heavy volume day.</p><p>In addition to that, right now we're up 160 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average, near our session highs. We're clocking in another winning week, right? So the Dow will be up four weeks in a row and at the close, it will be our 69th record, which will tied the all-time amount of closing records for any given year, which is back in 1995. If we have one more after this, Ash, we will go down in history as most records ever.</p><p>We're talking a looking, not only as the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P which have up arrows. But you can see, since Election Day, the Dow Jones Industrial average up about 35 percent, the S&amp;P up about 25 percent. So we certainly have enjoyed a nice run. It was a lot obviously built in on tax reform and the overall, which certainly seems to going well today, on the latest amendments that have been made on the child tax reform to appeal Rubio and Lee -- Senators Rubio and Lee.</p><p>So that's -- while taking a look at Costco, and Adobe, both of which had positive quarterly earnings, look at Costco up 3.5 percent, Adobe 1.6 percent, new high there by the way for Costco taking a look at some of the other retailers, big picture cracks up 17 percent, getting an upgrade over at Stifel, Nicolaus and just talking about their exposure abroad and that does well.</p><p>Remember when the stock is 75 bucks about 10 years ago? Forget that, how about you focus on this, great day today, Under Armour some positive comments there from the analysts as well and also foot locker getting an upgrade and getting the margins, going forward we'll watch the margins. You can see that too was a winner.</p><p>Overall, we will say that Moody has talked about the run up, recent run-up that we've seen in retail. It might be exhaustive. So we'll see that the latest retail sales numbers, Ashley, were pretty great. I mean, they were showing straight to people, spending on things that they don't really need, furniture, electronics, sporting good, books, music. So the latest numbers were pretty good showing holiday shoppers were hitting the stores. Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER: I always need electronics. I'm just saying, I'm a kind of gadget guy, Nicole. So it's always an excuse to buy electronics. I love it. Anyway, thank you so much. Great stuff. Who knows, Dow 25,000 by Christmas? Maybe.</p><p>Meanwhile, backlash today over the roll back of Obama-era net neutrality rules, with all the hysteria out there, you think, well the internet as we know it is coming to an end. Our own Deirdre Bolton is here to cut through all the noise. And she will be next.</p><p>WEBSTER: We are just getting word from our colleagues at Fox Newsthat <person><nameText>Marco Rubio </nameText></person>is indeed a yes now on the tax bill. He got what he wanted, a bump in that refund on the child tax credit. He is in on board, we are told, still, we don't know about Bob Corker, Mike Lee, <person><nameText>Jeff Flake, </nameText></person>Susan Collins, still some questions to be answered. But <person><nameText>Marco Rubio </nameText></person>essentially got what he wanted. Now he says yes to the tax bill.</p><p>Also the FCC voting to end net neutrality rules guarantying equal access to the internet. Now most experts say, these changes won't have much impact in the short term. Others are resorting to complete hysteria.</p><p>CNN actually reported this as, the \"End of the internet.\" Sentiments shared by Senator Bernie Sanders who tweeted Congress and the courts need to fight back.</p><p>Meanwhile, others have said this is attack on LBGT community. Some on Twitter even said we will going to die.</p><p>I kid you not. Deirdre Bolton is here now. Deirdre --</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, we're all going to die at some point but it is not in direct relation to repeal of --</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. But should we be in a panic? Come on.</p><p>BOLTON: So, listen, it is not the end of the internet as we know with the soundtrack, right.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: But it is the beginning of a huge fight.</p><p>WEBSTER: OK.</p><p>BOLTON: So you have 20 states attorney generals, they've lined up to sue the FCC calling the agency's move, a violation of the law and a serious threat to the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>So here is a map. We made a list of states that are beginning to take a legal action against the FCC. So I'm not going to read all the names. But you can see them, north, south, east, west more adding themselves as we speak.</p><p>So the tech community going bonkers. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, Microsoft's Brad Smith, execs from Google, Airbnb, a whole list, speaking out. This is Netflix's statement as further tweet this morning. \"We're disappointed in the decision to gut net neutrality protections that ushered in an unprecedented era of innovation, creativity and civic engagement. This is the beginning of a longer legal battle. Netflix stands with innovators, large and small, to oppose this misguided FCC order.\"</p><p>Now Netflix, other big tech companies, they're taking a stand on the vote on principle because the service providers such as Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T, they can charge Netflix more money because Netflix uses more internet capacity when we all binge watch our shows. But it doesn't matter, Netflix can pay.</p><p>So the reason big tech is fighting the FCC is because big tech says the vote kills innovation. So for example, if there is future competitor out there to Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix trying to build itself up now, a fledgling company, the arguments goes would not even be able to get off the ground and afford the fees that a Verizon, or a Comcast, or an AT&amp;T would have the power to demand.</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, he calls Silicon Valley a bunch of hypocrites. Here is part of his statement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AJIT PAI, FCC CHAIRMAN: Companies likes Facebook, and Amazon, and Netflix, and Google, became global giants precisely because the government wasn't involved. That's part of reason why I think so much of this hysteria is simply misplaced. As we will see going forward, getting this regulatory system, right, means better, faster cheaper internet access for all Americans across the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So that is the FCC Chair. So actually he's kind of like --</p><p>WEBSTER: Ajit Pai -- so basically he says, this will enable, get government out of the way.</p><p>BOLTON: Yeah.</p><p>WEBSTER: It will enable the internet providers to get more money, if I want to pay for faster internet. I can, it's not like, the internet is going away.</p><p>BOLTON: So that's exactly the point.</p><p>WEBSTER: I can pay more if I want to.</p><p>BOLTON: So he has two offshoots. That first statement is very true.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: Actually Portugal is a live experiment in that.</p><p>WEBSTER: OK.</p><p>BOLTON: So people there, they pay for tiered internet access much as we pay for tiered cable access.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: It's essentially the same system, just with a different product.</p><p>WEBSTER: Got it.</p><p>BOLTON: Ajit Pai's second point, he is libertarian. So he just by definition, by philosophy is for less regulation. And he says, Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T, the service providers. He said they don't really have a financial incentive to invest or to build in underserved areas, be they rural or low income earner --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right, this would give them the money to do it?</p><p>BOLTON: Well, I think his argument is that if they can make money and other ways charging Netflix or Facebook, then they will take that money, and build out broadband and maybe areas that are not as well-served.</p><p>WEBSTER: So bottom line is, it is not the end of world as we know it. We are all going to die at some point but not as a result of the FCC -- OK, very good. Deirdre, thank you very much. Good stuff.</p><p>U.N. Ambassador <person><nameText>Nikki Haley </nameText></person>presenting missile fragments that she says are indisputable evidence that Iran is violating U.N. resolutions and called out the regime as a threat to peace and security to the entire world.

WALID PHARES, FOX NEWSFOREIGN AFFAIRS ANALYST: It was really because Ambassador Haley after the speech of President in Riyadh a few months ago has pushed the explanation of what the U.S. position is very clearly.</p><p>Number one, Iran is now plotted to have been using those missiles through the militias via Yemen. And, you look at the video that the public has seen, and you see the actual missiles. So that is a very important point.</p><p>Number two, there is an interpretation, an American interpretation that those missiles are now deployed outside of Iran, which means that one of the actions that the U.S. is seeking from the international community and from the allies is to stop the shipping of those missiles and other equipment outside Iran which will tell me more about what's behind the horizons.</p><p>WEBSTER: It seems like the U.S. is a little bit alone on this. I will get into Saudi Arabia in a minute but you know, the Europeans, they continue to take this softly, softly approach, and believe that the U.S. is off kilter here because at least we have the Iranians locked date in some sort of a nuclear deal. But my thought on that, it is not a good deal in the first place and they are clearly violating it.</p><p>PHARES: Absolutely. I mean, it is tot a good deal. We all know that, most of us who criticized the deal, the administration and many members of the U.S. Congress. But what the Ambassador Haley has done, it's claim that OK, we have the criticism of the Iran dial. That's not what I'm talking about right now.</p><p>I'm talking about the missiles. And the minute she did that we'll going to have with us, maybe for the Arab and Muslim countries in the coalition. We're going to have with us France. Imagine that the President of France was also addressing missiles issue and maybe the U.K. and with them a number of eastern European and the central European countries concerned about those missiles.</p><p>Guess what? Some countries in Latin American, Africa, East Asia, all of these countries can come with us on the objection to the missiles regardless of the issue of the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>WEBSTER: What is your interpretation, what is been going on in Saudi Arabia, in particularly the Crown Prince, the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, who's very anti-Iran and very strong on this, and by all accounts has been communicating with Israel. I mean, could we have a Saudi-Israel alliance to take on Iran? I mean, they are very, very aggressive in this field?</p><p>PHARES: I have been monitoring -- many observers have been analyzing the changes that have been taking place in Saudi Arabia. Even use a term which may not apply but could, enlighten us, Perestroika and Glasnost. It's when the Soviet Union started to changed course, unfortunately for them they collapsed.</p><p>What is happening here is that MBS, Mohammad bin Salman is trying to move Saudi Arabia in different direction. That is not easy. It's not done overnight.</p><p>So number one they canceled the power of religious belief, (ph) which was the must difficult thing to change and after that, giving rights to women. More important geopolitically, indeed, you're right he is mobilizing Saudi power and his allies in the peninsula and Arab allies against the expansion of Iranian military force in the region.</p><p>WEBSTER: Very quickly, I have 10 seconds, Walid, but we're seeing Iran's influence spread out, aren't we? We're seeing it take over some of the vacuum in Syria and Iraq?</p><p>PHARES: Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER: How concerned are you, how much dominance or at least the growth, if you like, of Iran outside of its own borders?</p><p>PHARES: Very quickly I have been very concerned for the last maybe nine years. Now that I see that there is an Arab coalition forming now, now that I see that we have a bridge with that coalition, I think we are now in the beginning of the phase to push back against Iran. This is just starting right now.</p><p>WEBSTER: Very good. We have to leave it right there. But it's great stuff. Dr. Walid Phares. Thank you so much, I appreciate it.</p><p>PHARES: Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: Thank you.</p><p>Americans spent much more than the economists predicted so far this holiday season. Confidence is high apparently. Good news for the economy and, of course, the retailers, our very own Jeff Flock in the Chicago among the crowds. There he is, very festive scene. We'll be going to Jeff, next.</p><p>WEBSTER: Guess what? Consumers going on a shopping spree last month with retail sales jumping nearly one percent in November, on line even better. The big win is of course as we know, the online retailers as well as electronics, I can't get enough of those and furniture. Not so much.</p><p>Now, is this a sign of more good things to come for consumer in 2018? Who better to ask Jeff Flock, who is live among the throngs of shoppers in Chicago. Jeff?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FBN CHICAGO-BASED REPORTER: State Street, out in front of what used to be called Marshall Fields. And I'll tell you, totally, Ashley, I came here on Christmas seasons past, I almost wrecked a picture of Santa Claus thus far.</p><p>We have come here before, and State Street has not been crowded. Today, I'll tell you, maybe you can see the Christmas spirit definitely in full swing. And today, not just for retailers that -- actual stores, brick-and- mortar, but today this is what they call a free shipping Friday.</p><p>More than 900 retailers around the country offering free shipping on all orders today. You don't even have to have a minimum order, which you have to for a lot of folks. These retailers, everybody from Macy's, to Target, J.C. Penney, Saks, the whole bunch 900 plus. If you go to free shipping day.com we get a full list.</p><p>Now back out here on State Street, maybe you see the beautiful windows used to be Marshall Fields. It is now Macy's. And Macy's has done really well. Take a look at the stocks over the course of the past months of multiple retailers. Macy's actually top of the list, up 25 in the last month. Nordstrom up 16 percent. Walmart up nine percent.</p><p>Why? Well, maybe it's because, so long people are getting paychecks. It used to be 2009, November 2009, unemployment was about 10 percent.</p><p>Now we're about 4.1 percent. And I'll tell you, believe me, Ashley, heard of the little drummer boys you got a whole bunch of them out here today, very talented folks, entertaining the shoppers along State Street as they look at the Marshall Fields windows (INAUDIBLE) decades along State Street.</p><p>What's known as today, the most wonderful time of the year for retailers? Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: Fantastic job, Jeff Flock. Great drumming. I have a headache. But it was wonderful, very, very good indeed. They were talented.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right, Star Wars: The Last Jedi opening today to rave reviews and what is expected to be Blockbuster tickets sales, the force is strong with this one. We could see a record opening weekend. We've got a preview for you, next.</p><p>WEBSTER: For the finalized tax bill is supposed to be released around 5:30 made public. It wasn't good enough for our own Blake Burman. He managed to get his hand on it right now. Blake, what are you seeing in that bill?</p><p>BURMAN: And as of it, it's coming to from several sources here in Washington and the first thing that jumps out, which not going to put all the numbers up right now, we were just given them.</p><p>The first thing that jumps up is seven different brackets, that being 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35, 37. The original Senate bill is what won out here. Because what the individual side of this is the same as what first appeared in the individual Senate bill. The tweaks that are made to it are on side, where it's those who are married or filing jointly.</p><p>The top end rate has gotten a lot of talk, on individual side. It will be $500,000 at 37 percent. On the married filing jointly side, it will be 600,000 and above. That number has dropped substantially from the initial Senate plan. It was initially at a million dollars. So that got slashed some 40 percent, where the tinkering is, again it's on the married filing jointly side, when you start to play with brackets in between, there some numbers raid, some numbers lowered but the headline here is what we are getting from expect posted publicly here at 5:30. The seven brackets, and it appears, not appears, what happened in the Senate bill and initially, won out here.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, certainly appears that way. Great stuff, Blake Burman, thank you very much.</p><p>Of course, they'll be pouring tomorrow that bill as he gets the time to do that. But those are the headline numbers that you saw just the -- Blake, thank you very much.</p><p>The \"Star Wars\" franchise is certainly a force to be reckoned with, as we know that, the latest chapter in the legendary series, The Last Jedi, now in theaters and on track for me as the largest movie opening ever.</p><p>Joining me now to discuss all the light saber swinging action, comScore Incorporated Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian. Paul, thank you for joining me, have you seen the movie? I assume you have. Is it a home run?</p><p>PAUL DERGARABEDIAN, COMSCORE'S SENIOR MEDIA ANALYST: I sure have.</p><p>WEBSTER: It is a home run?</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN: It's a total home run. I saw the movie, of course, this is the follow-up to 2015's, \"The Force Awakens\" which opened in North America to the biggest debut ever, $248 million.</p><p>Now, that long two years ago, had a 57 million preview night on Thursday. This film had the second biggest Thursday preview with 45 million. So the Last Jedi is off to rollicking start, and could join the 200 million club for opening weekend in North America. Not only has three films on the list right now, this could be the 4th. So a huge deal for the movie industry this weekend.</p><p>WEBSTER: Am I right, Paul that it's two and a half hour long or did I misread that? And it has going to be good to occupy for two and a half hours?</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN: Yes, I already say a great movie can't be long enough and if it's a terrible move, anything over now would be, you know, you'd suffer thought that. But I think what we're seeing in the comScore data, we do exit polling. So we have a service called post-track. And this is movie is showing five out of five stars. You can't get higher than that in our survey. 82 percent definite recommend. So that means audiences are loving it. The critics are loving it. And that's how you get to a billion dollars in worldwide Box Office and beyond.</p><p>And we're already showing that the film has earned $106 million in two days, globally. And now it's poised for a massive weekend worldwide. And it really a global business --</p><p>WEBSTER: Indeed, it is.</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN: And the \"Star Wars\" franchise is a global phenomenon, and this sets us on really strong pace for the rest of the bock office share, which we have about two weeks left.</p><p>You know, \"Star Wars\" fanatics are very fiercely protective of the property. You know that very quickly, Paul.</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN: Right.</p><p>WEBSTER: It seems like Disney is doing a good job with continuing this franchise.</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN: Yeah, they are. I mean, you know, it's a huge amount of responsibility to take this on with the first movie opening in 1977. The franchise just in theaters worldwide up to this point about $7.5 billion, you add the merchandising on to that. And then, of course, we have next Memorial Day, the Han Solo movie. And two years from now will be episode nine, the next installment in this new trilogy, and the final installment in this new trilogy. So this is the gift that keeps on giving to Disney. This is a long term play. We're talking about decades long, you know, everyone's kids and their grand kids will be seeing \"Star Wars\" movies for the next many decades.</p><p>WEBSTER: Wow. I think you're all right there. Paul Dergarabedian. Paul, thank you very much. I will two and a half hours --</p><p>DERGARABEDIAN: Thank you, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: I'll take your advice. I will go and watch it. Thank you so much.</p><p>As we get ready to hand over to Liz Claman. The Dow up 157 points. What a great way to finish the week. The Dow at 24,666, ominously, but there you go, good day for the market. Our time is up. Liz Claman, over to you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTELR-2017121501cb232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R67-3GJ1-DXH2-64BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437067</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7481\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>INTELLIGENCE REPORT</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 15, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Tax Reform</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Net Neutrality</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robert Mueller</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hillary Clinton</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bitcoin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iran</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nikki Haley</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Retail Sales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Star Wars</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Stock Exchanges</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

They've been extraordinarily successful. That's why they're so big. But they're not companies anymore - they're countries.\"</p><p>Other congressional Republicans tempered their enthusiasm, however. And others responded with distinct caution to the idea of Congress taking on an antitrust role that's normally in the hands of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission - both of which have lately taken an interest in tech giants such as Google and Amazon.</p><p>\"Antitrust is a highly technical inquiry, not something that lends itself to easy generalizations or blanket condemnations,\" said a statement from Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who chairs the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel that would be in a prime position to oversee a probe. \"This is why such investigations are best left to the antitrust agencies rather than Congress.\"</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a leading critic of the tech industry, agreed that federal regulators would be \"more effective\" than Congress in policing the issue. He suggested that lawmakers should instead focus on issues like protecting consumers' data privacy.</p><p>The reactions underscore the dueling impulses of Republicans when it comes to tech in the Trump era. Many have railed against internet giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter, particularly over what they see as an anti-conservative bias in the way the companies manage content. Some have dangled the prospect of taking away the industry's longtime liability protections. But most Republicans also hew to the party's instinctive distaste for anything that smacks of regulation - let alone trust-busting.</p><p>The GOP's more hawkish tech critics include Graham, who has complained about the unregulated \"wild wild West\" of social media companies and said he's \"certainly willing to look into their business model\" as well. Another is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has accused digital platforms of suppressing conservative speech. </p><p>\"I was glad to see the House launch that investigation and I'd love to see Senate Judiciary Committee do the same,\" Cruz said. </p><p>House Democrats have yet to lay out the full scope of the probe. But Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), chairman of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee that is spearheading the congressional investigation, specifically named Google, Facebook and Amazon as a \"significant part\" of it during his announcement Monday. He said he's prepared to issue subpoenas and compel witnesses to testify if needed. </p><p>House Judiciary's top Republican, Doug Collins of Georgia, and Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the top Republican on its antitrust panel, initially praised the Democrats' probe, with Collins calling the effort a \"bipartisan\" opportunity to explore whether the tech industry remains competitive and \"if necessary, to take action.\" </p><p>But a GOP committee aide later sought to draw some boundaries around that support, suggesting the two Republican lawmakers are leery of some of the more aggressive tactics Cicilline mentioned. </p><p>Collins and Sensenbrenner have agreed to \"less formal oversight activity to look into big tech,\" said the aide, who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak on the record. The aide added that \"there has not been bipartisan agreement to scrutinize, subpoena, compel testimony from or start a critical investigation\" into specific companies.</p><p>That reluctance contrasts with some of the fiery rhetoric Republicans have brandished as they take aim at perceived bias on the part of Google, Facebook and Twitter, which deny any political favoritism in the way they manage their platforms.</p><p>Several GOP lawmakers, including Cruz and Hawley, have even floated the idea of revisiting a 1996 law that gives websites immunity from lawsuits over content their users have posted. It's a critical provision for the internet industry, shielding companies from expensive litigation if something libelous pops up in a search result, YouTube video or Facebook post, for example.</p><p>The tech antitrust issue isn't likely to dissipate for Republicans anytime soon, with the topic taking center stage in the Democratic presidential field. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has called for a breakup of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is backing calls to split up Facebook.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Justice Department has opened the door to its own possible antitrust investigation of Google, although it has yet to say whether it will launch such a probe. People familiar with DOJ's activities confirmed to POLITICO and other news organizations last week that the department has taken jurisdiction over any potential Google probe as part of a recent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>The Justice Department has also claimed jurisdiction over any antitrust claims involving Apple, while the FTC would handle any investigations of Facebook and Amazon, according to news reports and sources familiar with the cases. The two agencies periodically get together to divide up companies in industry groups and determine which agency will handle an investigation, should there be infractions that would warrant investigation, an FTC official has told POLITICO.</p><p>Whether any of these procedural moves will blossom into full-blown investigations, or result in fines or other penalties, is still unclear. But all four companies have faced complaints in both the U.S. and Europe from rivals who accuse them of abusing their dominant roles.</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-1354267</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8N-YWB1-JDJ6-K021-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1052\"/><timeReceived>7:08 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Lawmakers are asking him about alleged bias in the company's search results, as well as its reported plans to launch a censored search engine in China.</p><p>Pichai's appearance comes after he angered members of a Senate panel in September by declining their invitation to testify about foreign governments' manipulation of online services to sway U.S. elections. Pichai's no-show at that hearing was marked by an empty chair for Google alongside the Facebook and Twitter executives who did appear.</p><p>Pichai went to Washington later in September to mend fences, meeting with some two dozen Republicans and indicating he also planned to meet with Democrats. He took part last week in a White House meeting with other tech industry executives that focused mainly on getting government and businesses working more closely on accelerating emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.</p><p>In October, Google announced it was shutting down its long-shunned Plus social network following its disclosure of a flaw discovered in March that could have exposed some personal information of as many as 500,000 people. The company deliberately avoided disclosing the privacy lapse at the time, in part to avoid drawing regulators' scrutiny and damaging its reputation, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing anonymous individuals and documents.</p><p>Lawmakers want Google to explain its failure to reveal the breach.</p><p>On Monday, the company said it was accelerating its plans to shutter Plus after discovering a privacy flaw that inadvertently exposed the names, email addresses, ages and other personal information of 52.5 million users last month. The service will now go dark in April instead of August, as previously announced.</p><p>\"We work hard to ensure the integrity of our products, and we've put a number of checks and balances in place to ensure they continue to live up to our standards,\" Pichai said in his opening statement prepared for Tuesday's hearing.</p><p>Lawmakers are also concerned by recent reports that Google is poised to re-enter China with a search engine generating censored results to comply with the demands of that country's Communist government.</p><p>President Donald Trump has accused Google of rigging the results of its dominant search engine to suppress conservative viewpoints and highlight coverage from media that he says distribute \"fake news.\" That's another area of potential questions to Pichai by committee members.</p><p>The company has denied any political bias, and there's no evidence of an anti-conservative tilt. Pichai said in his written testimony that \"I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests.\"</p><p>Google has good reason to communicate with lawmakers and policymakers, and to seek to weigh in on thorny issues. Trump and some lawmakers have raised the possibility of asking regulators to investigate whether Google - which handles nearly two of every three online searches in the U.S. - has abused its clout as a major gateway to the internet to stifle competition.</p><p>And momentum is building in Congress for legislation to put stricter limits and privacy protections around the big tech companies' collection of data. With the Democrats having captured control of the House in the midterm elections, and poised to take over as the majority running the Judiciary Committee next month, tougher legislation could be in the offing.</p><p>Pichai, a former engineer, took the helm of Google in 2015 in a major restructuring that made Google a division of conglomerate Alphabet Inc. - whose businesses include Waymo, a self-driving technology development company.

GOP Rep. Jim Jordan , ranking member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, said in a letter ,...</p><p>U.S. House Republicans want to add Twitter \u2019s CEO to the roster of Big Tech execs scheduled to testify later this month before a congressional antitrust panel.   GOP Rep. Jim Jordan , ranking member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, said in a letter , \u201cthere is bipartisan interest to hear from Twitter about its power in the marketplace, its role in moderating content on its platform, and the causes for its recent highly publicized security breaches.\u201d   The letter was addressed to Democratic U.S. Rep. Jerrold L. Nadler , who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jordan insisted that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey should appear on July 27. That\u2019s in addition to the existing antitrust lineup : Amazon \u2019s Jeff Bezos, Facebook \u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Google \u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple \u2019s Tim Cook. All are set to appear before the Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel.   All four companies are also being looked into by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).   The House hearing is part of an investigation into the tech giants. The outcome of that investigation is expected to produce legislation that would reform and regulate the online world.   Jordan\u2019s letter to Nadler said, \u201cI write to notify you that we are calling Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, to testify at this hearing and we expect that you will transmit an invitation to him promptly.\u201d As justification, he said, that as Congress \u201cconsiders large technology companies and the competitive landscape, a thorough examination cannot exclude Twitter, a market leader in social media. The upcoming hearing represents a significant and unique opportunity to explore these issues with respect to Twitter.\u201d   The concern has long been that each of the four Big Tech firms have used their position to squeeze out competition and dominate the market.   U.S. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, chairman of the House antitrust panel, has said there is not enough competition in the U.S. tech scene and he wants to change that.   This would be the first time all four Big Tech CEOs have testified together before Congress, although all of them except Bezos have done so separately in the past.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    New PYMNTS Study: Subscription Commerce Conversion Index \u2013 July 2020     Staying home 24/7 has consumers turning to subscription services for both entertainment and their day-to-day needs. While that\u2019s a great opportunity for providers, it also presents a challenge \u2014 27.4 million consumers are looking to cancel their subscriptions because of friction and cost concerns.

One of those is regulation.Many politicians on both sides of the aisle have discussed government regulation of Big Tech. Government regulation and amending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act are seen as a solution to the scandals plaguing tech companies. </p><p>But not all politicians are convinced of these solutions' effectiveness. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) warned[1] of the 'unintended consequences' amending or repealing Section 230 could have for free speech.On Twitter, Rodgers called[2] for 'a serious ...oughtful discussion on achieving the balance of #Section230.' She then stated[3], 'I'm not for gutting it.' Rodgers described Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provided legal protection for tech companies from the consequences of users' posts, as 'essential for consumers and innovators in the Internet ecosystem.'A House hearing of subcommittees, which included testimonies from Google and Reddit executives, was held on Oct. 16. Google's Global Head of Intellectual Property Policy Katherine Oyama and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman strongly defended[4] Section 230 as necessary for their respective platforms.Conservatives and liberals alike have discussed making changes to Section 230. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced a bill[5] in June called the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act[6], which would revoke the immunity enjoyed by Big Tech companies. The White House[7] allegedly had a proposal as well, called 'Protecting Americans from Online Censorship,' which would revoke the protection of Section 230 for a platform if there was an abuse of it.Rodgers stated[8], 'These proposals are not consistent with the First Amendment.' She argued that the FCC, the FTC or any other government agency should not have control over the moderation of speech on the internet. Rather, 'we should continue to provide oversight of Big Tech ...eir use of #Section230, and also encourage constructive discussions on the responsible use of content moderation,' she wrote[9].A Gallup[10] poll from August found that 48 percent of Americans wanted Big Tech to be regulated further, while 40 percent did not. 56 percent of Democrats polled wanted more, tighter government control over tech platforms, compared to 48 percent of Republicans.Tech executives have also surprisingly called for an increase of government regulation. Microsoft President Brad Smith[11] told NPR that regulation would protect 'something that is far more important than technology: democracy.'However, in Europe, government regulation of companies like Facebook and Google is backfiring as the values of the companies clash with the mandates of the European Union. Facebook[12] faced a ruling from an Austrian court to take down content that violated Austrian law across the globe.

One of those is regulation.Many politicians on both sides of the aisle have discussed government regulation of Big Tech. Government regulation and amending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act are seen as a solution to the scandals plaguing tech companies. </p><p>But not all politicians are convinced of these solutions' effectiveness. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) warned[1] of the 'unintended consequences' amending or repealing Section 230 could have for free speech.On Twitter, Rodgers called[2] for 'a serious thoughtful discussion on achieving the balance of #Section230.' She then stated[3], 'I'm not for gutting it.' Rodgers described Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provided legal protection for tech companies from the consequences of users' posts, as 'essential for consumers and innovators in the Internet ecosystem.'A House hearing of subcommittees, which included testimonies from Google and Reddit executives, was held on Oct. 16. Google's Global Head of Intellectual Property Policy Katherine Oyama and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman strongly defended[4] Section 230 as necessary for their respective platforms.Conservatives and liberals alike have discussed making changes to Section 230. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced a bill[5] in June called the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act[6], which would revoke the immunity enjoyed by Big Tech companies. The White House[7] allegedly had a proposal as well, called 'Protecting Americans from Online Censorship,' which would revoke the protection of Section 230 for a platform if there was an abuse of it.Rodgers stated[8], 'These proposals are not consistent with the First Amendment.' She argued that the FCC, the FTC or any other government agency should not have control over the moderation of speech on the internet. Rather, 'we should continue to provide oversight of Big Tech their use of #Section230, and also encourage constructive discussions on the responsible use of content moderation,' she wrote[9].A Gallup[10] poll from August found that 48 percent of Americans wanted Big Tech to be regulated further, while 40 percent did not. 56 percent of Democrats polled wanted more, tighter government control over tech platforms, compared to 48 percent of Republicans.Tech executives have also surprisingly called for an increase of government regulation. Microsoft President Brad Smith[11] told NPR that regulation would protect 'something that is far more important than technology: democracy.'However, in Europe, government regulation of companies like Facebook and Google is backfiring as the values of the companies clash with the mandates of the European Union. Facebook[12] faced a ruling from an Austrian court to take down content that violated Austrian law across the globe.

It also released preliminary earnings Monday for the final quarter of 2017 that fell short of analysts' expectations.</p><p>Before U.S. stock markets opened, GoPro said the job cuts would leave the company with fewer than 1,000 workers, down from its current level of 1,254 employees. CEO Nick Woodman also said he would cut his cash compensation for 2018 to $1.</p><p>All the bad news from GoPro slammed the company's shares Monday, as GoPro's stock price fell 21 percent to $5.95. GoPro shares are down by 75 percent from their $24-a-share price when the company went public in June 2014.</p><p>GoPro has faced intensifying competition in the action camera market as big tech companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have started selling similar products. Some analysts have said that GoPro's Hero cameras have become a commodity and that the company's main selling point now is its brand. </p><p>In November, Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt wrote that there hasn't been a noticeable bump from GoPro's newest camera in the Hero line and that it's turning up less in searches and app downloads.</p><p>The company is pulling the plug on its Karma drone business after more than a year of false starts, product stumbles and disappointing sales. </p><p>GoPro said that even though the $800 Karma has reached the No. 2 position in the U.S. for drones in its \"price band,\" the company decided the drone market was \"untenable\" because of \"a hostile regulatory environment in Europe and the United States (that) will likely reduce the total addressable market in the years ahead.\"</p><p>GoPro initially put the Karma on sale in October 2016 but pulled it from the market after just 16 days. That followed reports of technical issues that caused the drones to drop from the sky as they were flying. GoPro put the Karma back on the market in February 2017.</p><p>Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities said GoPro became a victim of both hubris and desperation as it tried to make a go of it in the drone sector.</p><p>\"Drones are a competitive space,\" Pachter said. \"Karma was priced significantly higher than the competition, and the GoPro brand wasn't enough for consumers to justify the higher price. I think they made a strategic error in pursuing entry into such a competitive space, and it proves how hard consumer electronics innovation has become.\"</p><p>GoPro also released preliminary fourth-quarter results, which didn't do anything to inspire investors' confidence. GoPro said it expects sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 to be $340 million, a 37 percent decline from the same period a year ago. Wall Street analysts had earlier forecast GoPro to report sales of $472 million for the quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bloomberg contributed to this report.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHICO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHICO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RCJ-6PV1-JCK9-7488-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279923</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chico Enterprise-Record (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 9, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0004OLY</classCode><className>SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS334310 AUDIO &amp;

It also released preliminary earnings Monday for the final quarter of 2017 that fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations.</p><p>Before U.S. stock markets opened, GoPro said the job cuts would leave the company with fewer than 1,000 workers, down from its current level of 1,254 employees. CEO Nick Woodman also said he would cut his cash compensation for 2018 to $1.</p><p>All the bad news from GoPro slammed the company\u2019s shares Monday, as GoPro\u2019s stock price fell 21 percent to $5.95. GoPro shares are down by 75 percent from their $24-a-share price when the company went public in June 2014.</p><p>GoPro has faced intensifying competition in the action camera market as big tech companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google have started selling similar products. Some analysts have said that GoPro\u2019s Hero cameras have become a commodity and that the company\u2019s main selling point now is its brand.</p><p>In November, Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt wrote that there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable bump from GoPro\u2019s newest camera in the Hero line and that it\u2019s turning up less in searches and app downloads.</p><p>The company is pulling the plug on its Karma drone business after more than a year of false starts, product stumbles and disappointing sales.</p><p>GoPro said that even though the $800 Karma has reached the No. 2 position in the U.S. for drones in its \u201cprice band,\u201d the company decided the drone market was \u201cuntenable\u201d because of \u201ca hostile regulatory environment in Europe and the United States (that) will likely reduce the total addressable market in the years ahead.\u201d</p><p>GoPro initially put the Karma on sale in October 2016 but pulled it from the market after just 16 days. That followed reports of technical issues that caused the drones to drop from the sky as they were flying. GoPro put the Karma back on the market in February 2017.</p><p>Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities said GoPro became a victim of both hubris and desperation as it tried to make a go of it in the drone sector.</p><p>\u201cDrones are a competitive space,\u201d Pachter said. \u201cKarma was priced significantly higher than the competition, and the GoPro brand wasn\u2019t enough for consumers to justify the higher price. I think they made a strategic error in pursuing entry into such a competitive space, and it proves how hard consumer electronics innovation has become.\u201d</p><p>GoPro also released preliminary fourth-quarter results, which didn\u2019t do anything to inspire investors\u2019 confidence. GoPro said it expects sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 to be $340 million, a 37 percent decline from the same period a year ago. Wall Street analysts had earlier forecast GoPro to report sales of $472 million for the quarter.</p><p>Bloomberg contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSENT-624C4692E0545029E0530100007F1B7B</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRSENT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RC9-S2J1-DY2C-12C9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153562</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Press Enterprise, Inc.

It also released preliminary earnings Monday for the final quarter of 2017 that fell short of analysts' expectations.</p><p>Before U.S. stock markets opened, GoPro said the job cuts would leave the company with fewer than 1,000 workers, down from its current level of 1,254 employees.</p><p>Chief Executive Nick Woodman also said he would cut his cash compensation for 2018 to $1.</p><p>All the bad news from GoPro slammed the company's shares Monday, as GoPro's stock price fell 21 percent to $5.95. GoPro shares are down by 75 percent from their $24-a-share price when the company went public in June 2014.</p><p>GoPro has faced intensifying competition in the action camera market, as big tech companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have started selling similar products. </p><p>Some analysts have said that GoPro's Hero cameras have become a commodity and that the company's main selling point now is its brand. </p><p>In November, Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt wrote that there hasn't been a noticeable bump from GoPro's newest camera in the Hero line and that it's turning up less in searches and app downloads.</p><p>The company is pulling the plug on its Karma drone business after more than a year of false starts, product stumbles and disappointing sales. </p><p>GoPro said that even though the $800 Karma has reached the No. 2 position in the United States for drones in its \"price band,\" the company decided the drone market was \"untenable\" because of \"a hostile regulatory environment in Europe and the United States (that) will likely reduce the total addressable market in the years ahead.\"</p><p>GoPro initially put the Karma on sale in October 2016 but pulled it from the market after just 16 days. That followed reports of technical issues that caused the drones to drop from the sky as they were flying. GoPro put the Karma back on the market in February 2017.</p><p>Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities said GoPro became a victim of both hubris and desperation as it tried to make a go of it in the drone sector.</p><p>\"Drones are a competitive space,\" Pachter said. \"Karma was priced significantly higher than the competition, and the GoPro brand wasn't enough for consumers to justify the higher price. I think they made a strategic error in pursuing entry into such a competitive space, and it proves how hard consumer electronics innovation has become.\"</p><p>Along with the job cuts and plans to get out of the drone business, GoPro released preliminary fourth-quarter results, which didn't do anything to inspire investors' confidence. GoPro said it expects sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 to be $340 million, a 37 percent decline from the same period a year ago. Wall Street analysts had earlier forecast GoPro to report sales of $472 million for the quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bloomberg contributed to this report.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHICO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHICO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RCJ-6PV1-JCK9-748K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279923</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"505\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chico Enterprise-Record (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 9, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0004OLY</classCode><className>SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS334310 AUDIO &amp;

Josh Hawley on Tuesday introduced a new bill aimed at fighting \"social media addiction,\" an escalation in the vocal tech critic's wider campaign to impose consequences on Silicon Valley over its dominance in the global economy.</p><p>The Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act -- or the SMART Act -- would ban practices frequently employed by top social networking sites to keep users engaged, like YouTube's \"autoplay\" feature or Snapchat's \"snapstreaks.\" The bill comes as tech giants face mounting scrutiny in Washington over their handling of disinformation, hate speech and user data.</p><p>Hawley's bill would give social media companies three months to eliminate what it deems \"practices that exploit human psychology or brain physiology\" -- autoplay, self-populating feeds and virtual awards linked to constant engagement with the platform. It would also require companies to roll out features that would allow users to set limits on the time they spend in the site or application with notifications showing how much time a user has logged every day.</p><p>The bill would also give the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Trade Commission the authority to introduce new rules that could address \"unfair or deceptive\" practices a social network may introduce in the future.</p><p>\"Big tech has embraced a business model of addiction. Too much of the 'innovation' in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away,\" the Missouri Republican said in a news release on Tuesday. \"This legislation will put an end to that and encourage true innovation by tech companies.\"</p><p>Hawley's newest legislation comes as lawmakers have grown increasingly alarmed that large tech platforms could be having an outsized influence on politics, privacy and the wider economy. The measure joins a string of bills introduced by Hawley in recent months that target Silicon Valley in recent months.</p><p>One recent proposal seeks to make the federal government the arbiter of whether tech companies have treated user content equally and without partisan bias. A negative finding by regulators could expose a platform to legal liability, under the proposal.</p><p>Last week, the FTC announced a massive settlement with Facebook concluding the agency's investigation into the social network's privacy missteps. The $5 billion fine imposed on Facebook is the largest in FTC history, and it requires the company to make various changes to its board structure in an effort to enhance corporate accountability. But critics say the FTC's settlement was too light on Facebook considering the circumstances; regulators did not depose CEO Mark Zuckerberg or COO Sheryl Sandberg, and neither executive was held personally liable in the agency's formal complaint.</p><p>Meanwhile the Justice Department has announced a wide-ranging antitrust review into the tech industry. Officials said last week they were interested in Silicon Valley's power in online retail and social networking, among other areas. The House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel is in the midst of a similar probe, and has sharply questioned tech execs over their business practices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20190731social-media-senator-josh-hawley-silicon-valley-addiction1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPM-5KV1-DY60-M3M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><timeReceived>8:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 31, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Update (1015ET): Just hours after media reports shined a light on a new DoJ legislative recommendation to hold tech giants accountable for censoring political speech and discriminating against conservatives.  The \"Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act,\" will force tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet to bind themselves to \"good faith\" standards of impartiality outlined as follows:[3]  Users could sue the major Big Tech companies for breaching their contractual duty of good faith  The duty of good faith would contractually prohibit Big Tech from: Discriminating when enforcing the terms of service they write (just like police and prosecutors are not supposed to discriminate when enforcing the law)  Failing to honor their promises  Big Tech companies who breach their duty of good faith would have to pay $5,000 plus attorney's fees to each user who prevails.  Notably, Hawley is joined by Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton and Mike Braun. If passed, the bill would allow the Federalist and Zero Hedge to sue Google for unequal treatment. </p><p> Today I'm introducing new legislation to combat #BigTech[4] censorship. It gives users the right to sue if the big platforms enforce their terms unfairly or unequally.

Tucker Carlson's Opening Monologue Calling Out The GOP For Doing Nothing About Google's Censorship \"If you're worried about the concentration of power in the hands of a few unaccountable actors, and you very much should be, nobody has more unchecked power than Google does.\" pic.twitter .com/gGKAkfrMU5[19] ; \u2014 The Columbia Bugle ???????? (@ColumbiaBugle) June 17, 2020[20]   If you're worried about the concentration of power in the hands of an elite few, you should be worried about Google.  * * *  The DoJ just escalated its burgeoning feud with Silicon Valley by introducing a new legislative plan meant to make certain changes proposed in a Trump executive order signed late last month permanent - including a measure to strip tech giants of \"liability shields\" for activity and speech that happens on their platforms. [21]  In effect, the DoJ proposal would rollback protections centered in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, something that's gaining bipartisan support (albeit for vastly different reasons).[22]    The proposal calls for the rolling back of legal protections that online platforms have enjoyed for more than 20 years to try and make tech companies more responsible in how they police their content, CNET reports[23]. The proposed reforms, to be announced later on Wednesday, are designed to require social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook or YouTube (owned by Google parent Alphabet) to be more active in policing sites for illicit or harmful content, while also requiring them to be more consistent in decisions to remove content they find objectionable.  If adopted by Congress and passed, the bill would effectively make some of the changes outlined in an executive order signed by Trump late last month the law of the land: It would rollback protections for these digital 'platforms' that engage in active political censorship of users on said platforms.Because  of this, it represents a serious escalation of the Trump Administration's fight against Big Tech, which President Trump has long criticized for discriminating against conservatives and their ideas.  The new framework might gain more traction on capital hill, particularly after the events of yesterday, when a journalist-activist employed by NBC News published a story claiming that the \"far-right\" websites Zero Hedge and the Federalist (two sites that have both been described as about as conservative as the Drudge Report) were recently demonetized by Google. Shortly after, Google clarified that it was working with the two publishers to rein in hate speech in comment sections. [24]  Furthermore, Jonathan Turley[25], a law professor at GW who often writes on free speech issues, criticized an NBC News report on the \"de-monetization\" (later denied by Google) of Zero Hedge and the Federalist) and argued that Google's actions support the DOJ legislative proposal and the Trump Administration's incipient anti-trust effort.  As we discussed earlier in regards to Twitter, Google seems to be making the case for not only pushing forward with anti-trust inquiries but stripping it and other companies of immunity protections. Indeed,the Justice Department just announced that it is moving forward with proposals to strip away protections. Google and other companies were givenprotections under Section 320because it has claimed to being a neutral supplier of virtual space for people to speak with one another. It is now effectively shutting down sites because they allow others to comment freely on their sites. This biased targeting of sites has led to congressional objections and renewed threats to amend the federal law. Indeed, Google is undermining the support with some of us who viewed protections are fostering free speech values. It is now using its role to stifle and regulate speech, the very antithesis of not just free speech but the federal protections.  The White House has made it abundantly clear that it won't tolerate social media platforms continuing to censor and de-monetize conservative speech while ignoring similar behavior by radical leftists. If these platforms want to continue to 'curate' the information and speech found therein, then they should be treated more like a publisher than a platform.

Sell WhatsApp and sell Instagram,' the Missouri senator said, according to CNBC, after their Capitol Hill meeting.</p><p>The senator says they also spoke about Facebook's moderation of anti-abortion videos on that platform. He says that Zuckerberg told him 'that there was clearly bias - those were his words - he said there was clearly bias' against the conservative viewpoint.</p><p>Facebook has not responded to Hawley's claims following the titan's meetings in Washington D.C., which he capped off with a sit-down with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. </p><p>Trump has complained about a bias against conservatives on social media platforms and has hauled in Twitter's and Google's CEOs over the past several months for private discussions at the White House.</p><p>Neither the White House nor Facebook provided details on what the two men talked about. </p><p>'Mark is in Washington, D.C., meeting with policymakers to hear their concerns and talk about future internet regulation. He also had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,' a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>Zuckerberg had a closed-door dinner with senators Wednesday night as part of his trip to Washington D.C. to lobby lawmakers on privacy and regulation issues important to Facebook, the social media giant he founded. </p><p>His agenda includes meeting with powerful Democrats on the Intelligence panels, DailyMail.com has learned, and with lawmakers working on privacy issues. </p><p>'I'm sorry. I'm not taking questions,' he told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday as he walked into a meeting. </p><p>Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, arranged the dinner meeting - at an unnamed restaurant - at Facebook's request, according to a spokesperson.</p><p>'At Facebook's request, Senator Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington for Mr. Zuckerberg and a group of Senators,' Warner's spokesperson Rachel Cohen said in a statement.</p><p>'The participants had a discussion touching on multiple issues, including the role and responsibility of social media platforms in protecting our democracy, and what steps Congress should take to defend our elections, protect consumer data, and encourage competition in the social media space,' she said.</p><p>Zuckerberg is making his first trip to the nation's Capitol since he took a beating from lawmakers about his company's practices in an April hearing before Congress. </p><p>His visit comes as lawmakers are looking at regulating social media companies and are weighing a new privacy law that would hamper the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data.</p><p>The Facebook founder has called for government officials to take a more active role in regulating the Internet.</p><p>'The rules governing the Internet allowed a generation of entrepreneurs to build services that changed the world and created a lot of value in people's lives,' Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post in March. 'It's time to update these rules to define clear responsibilities for people, companies and governments going forward.' </p><p>Facebook declined to release Zuckerberg's schedule or comment on who was at the Wednesday evening dinner and who paid for it.</p><p>'Mark is in Washington, D.C., to meet with policymakers and talk about future internet regulation. There are no public events planned,' said Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone in a statement. </p><p>Zuckerberg will meet with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, according to a congressional aide, and he met with Senator Maria Cantwell Wednesday evening separately from the dinner, her office told DailyMail.com.</p><p>Cantwell is the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, which is debating online privacy legislation. </p><p>Schiff is investigating foreign interference in the 2016 election, which Facebook and other social media companies have had to defend their policies following revelations Russia used their platforms to influence the presidential contest. </p><p>Additionally, Zuckerberg met with Republican Senators Mike Lee of Utah, who is the chairman of the anti-trust subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary panel.</p><p>'We need robust investigations and enforcement of the antitrust laws, especially in the tech arena,' Lee said in a statement Wednesday after lawmakers on Senate Commerce Committee questioned executives from tech companies about the spread of extremism and violence on digital platforms. </p><p>Lee's office said the two men spoke on a number of issues. </p><p>'Sen. Lee and Mr. Zuckerberg touched on a number of topics including bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, government regulation of digital platforms, antitrust enforcement, Section 230 liability, and data-privacy issues,' a Lee spokesperson said of the meeting.</p><p>Zuckerberg also met with Josh Hawley of Missouri, who is a huge conservative critic of Big Tech. </p><p>And he was spotted coming out of the office of Texas Senator John Cornyn. </p><p>The visit from the Facebook CEO also comes the Federal Trade Commission launched an antitrust investigation into the company.</p><p>During his April testimony on Capitol Hill, lawmakers pressed the Facebook founder on how third-party partners - like Cambridge Analytica - could harvest data without users' knowledge. </p><p>They also asked Zuckerberg about fake news on Facebook, if there was a bias against conservatives and about Russian interference in the 2016 election. </p><p>One person not on Zuckerberg's agenda is Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>'Not on schedule, no request received,' a senior congressional aide told DailyMail.com when asked if the two would meet.</p><p>Pelosi criticized Zuckerberg and Facebook in May after the company did not remove an altered video that slurred her words and made the speaker appear drunk.</p><p>Zuckerberg reached out to her after the incident but she did not return his phone call. </p><p>The speaker accused Facebook of 'lying to the public' and saying it shows 'they were willing enablers of the Russian interference in our election.' </p><p>Facebook warned users the video of Pelosi is fake but it refused to remove the altered footage of her speech at a Center for American Progress event, which was subtly edited to make her voice sound garbled and slowed down, as if she was under the influence of alcohol. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-56267973</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3B-RJG1-JCJY-G3V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1214\"/><timeReceived>3:23 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Josh Hawley on Monday issued a rare rebuke of the government agency that oversees Facebook, Google and other tech giants, charging that regulators had \"failed\" to protect consumers' personal data from abuse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, the Missouri lawmaker urged the agency's leaders to take a more aggressive stance toward Silicon Valley, starting with investigations into tech companies for violating their users' privacy repeatedly over the past year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawley said there is \"substantial evidence\" that Facebook had broken a 2011 agreement with the FTC that settled an earlier probe into its privacy practices - a breach that could trigger steep federal fines. The GOP senator also faulted Facebook for its earlier efforts to monitor app usage by children and adults through a tool that was loaded onto iPhones in a way that angered Apple.</p><p>With Google, meanwhile, Hawley charged that the search giant had \"consistently misinformed users about its use of geolocation data,\" at times collecting that information from Android smartphones even when device owners thought they had disabled the tracking of their whereabouts.</p><p>In response to these and other high-profile privacy mishaps, Hawley said the FTC so far \"has been toothless,\" and he urged the agency to use all the power at its disposal to probe big tech companies - or tell Congress if it's outmatched and needs help.</p><p>\"For too long our nation has put off accounting for the price we paid in return for the benefits of the online platforms that now dominate American culture and industry,\" Hawley wrote to FTC Chairman Joseph J. Simons, a fellow Republican.</p><p>\"These companies have failed us. Washington has failed us. The FTC has a special role to play, but it too has failed us,\" Hawley said.</p><p>Hawley's missive arrives a day before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he is a member, is set to hold a hearing about online privacy and the future of regulation. Google is expected to testify at the Tuesday session, according to two sources familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record. A spokesman for the panel's chairman, GOP Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Facebook and Google also did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The FTC has been probing Facebook over its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed data on 87\u00a0million of the social site's users - but Facebook has denied that breach broke its earlier agreement with the agency. Google has said it provides clear tools to control what happens to users' location data.</p><p>More than a century old, the FTC serves as the U.S. government's de facto privacy cop because of its mandate to police businesses for unfair or deceptive acts and practices. In recent months, the agency has taken some action on tech issues, levying a fine against the social app now known as TikTok for collecting personal data on children, and creating a special task force to oversee competition in the tech industry. A spokesman for the FTC did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Still, the FTC has faced fierce criticism across the political spectrum for failing to penalize wrongdoers in the tech industry. Roughly a dozen consumer-privacy organizations in January called on Congress to create an entirely new \"federal agency focused on privacy protection, compliance with data protection obligations, and emerging privacy challenges.\" Some of those groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, have urged the FTC to complete its investigation into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica before the first anniversary of the probe passes later this month.</p><p>Democrats and Republicans in Congress have started to discuss new legislation targeting the data-collection practices of Facebook, Google and other tech giants. The United States lacks an overarching federal consumer privacy law, even though individual states, led by California, have adopted their own rules. Europe leads the world as the toughest regulator of tech companies.</p><p>Democrats generally have called for granting the FTC stronger authorities, along with more money and new staff, to police privacy abuses. Republicans, who historically have been reluctant to give the commission new power, increasingly have expressed an interest in rethinking the agency's role on data-protection issues.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-3b621c60443411e990f00ccfeec87a61</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM6-YYM1-DXKP-J260-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><timeReceived>12:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Josh Hawley on Monday issued a rare rebuke of the government agency that oversees Facebook, Google and other tech giants, charging that regulators had \"failed\" to protect consumers and their personal data from abuse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, the Missouri lawmaker urged the agency's leaders to take a more aggressive stand toward Silicon Valley, starting with investigations into tech companies for violating their users' privacy repeatedly over the past year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawley said there is \"substantial evidence\" that Facebook had broken a 2011 agreement with the FTC that settled an earlier probe into its privacy practices - a breach that could trigger steep federal fines. The GOP senator also faulted Facebook for its earlier efforts to monitor kids' and adults' app usage through a tool that was loaded onto iPhones in a way that angered Apple.</p><p>With Google, meanwhile, Hawley charged that the search giant had \"consistently misinformed users about its use of geolocation data,\" at times collecting that information from Android smartphones even when device owners thought they had disabled the tracking of their whereabouts.</p><p>In response to these and other high-profile privacy mishaps, Hawley said the FTC so far \"has been toothless,\" and he urged the agency to use all the power at its disposal to probe big tech companies - or tell Congress if it's outmatched and needs help.</p><p>\"For too long our nation has put off accounting for the price we paid in return for the benefits of the online platforms that now dominate American culture and industry,\" Hawley wrote to FTC Chairman Joe Simons, a fellow Republican.</p><p>\"These companies have failed us. Washington has failed us. The FTC has a special role to play, but it too has failed us,\" Hawley said.</p><p>Hawley's missive arrives a day before the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he is a member, is set to hold a hearing about online privacy and the future of regulation. Google is expected to testify at the Tuesday session, according to two sources familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record, along with representatives from other tech companies and consumer groups. A spokesman for the panel's chairman, GOP Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Facebook and Google also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The FTC has been probing Facebook over its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed data on 87 million of the social site's users - but Facebook has denied it broke its accord with the agency. Google has said it provides clear tools to control what happens to users' location data.</p><p>More than a century old, the FTC serves as the U.S. government's de facto privacy cop because of its mandate to police businesses for unfair or deceptive acts and practices. In recent months, the agency has taken action on issues including children's privacy, levying a fine against the social app now known as TikTok, and it created a special task force to oversee competition in the tech industry. A spokesman for the FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Still, the FTC has faced fierce criticism across the political spectrum for failing to penalize wrongdoers in the tech industry. Roughly a dozen consumer-privacy organizations in January called on Congress to create an entirely new \"federal agency focused on privacy protection, compliance with data protection obligations, and emerging privacy challenges.\" Some of those groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, have urged the FTC to complete its probe into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica before its one-year anniversary later this month.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, the agency's future also has received renewed attention as Democrats and Republicans have started to discuss new legislation targeting the data-collection practices of Facebook, Google and other tech giants. The United States lacks an overarching federal consumer privacy law, even though individual states, led by California, have adopted their own rules - and Europe leads the world as the toughest regulator of tech companies.</p><p>Democrats generally have called for granting the agency stronger authorities, along with more money and new staff, to police privacy abuses. Republicans historically have been more reluctant to give the commission new power - but increasingly have expressed an interest in rethinking the agency role on data-protection issues.</p><p>In his letter, Hawley asked the FTC to detail whether it had gaps in its authorities that stymied its work - but urged it to wield the power it already has to probe privacy abuses by the country's largest tech companies.</p><p>\"These debates cross party lines, implicating election integrity, free speech, privacy, competition, and many other issues,\" he wrote. \"But these debates include a central, shared concern that the new custodians of once-diffuse information have abused the power they amassed and neglected their responsibilities.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-153381fe8cd3471d8dc64c1b3bbdddbd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM6-YYM1-DXKP-J25G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"837\"/><timeReceived>12:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This comes as politicians such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have sounded the call to war on Big Tech monopolies in a September 10 tweet[3]: 'Big Tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple have way too much power over our economy our democracy. For the good of our country, we must demand our regulators do their jobs take swift, aggressive action - not kick the can down the road one more time.' Bloomberg went on to observe that: 'Nearly every state attorney general is investigating the company in a parallel probe focused on the company's online advertising business and led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.'Google might be facing fights on multiple fronts: 'Different states have focused on other parts of Google's sprawling business lines, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing confidential matters.' </p><p>The article then explained how, according to the same anonymous sources: 'Even after the case is filed in the coming weeks, some Democratic-led states could continue to investigate other aspects of Google's business and could bring an additional case in the coming months.'The same article specified that this will be one of the most decisive actions against Big Tech in many years: 'The lawsuit is expected to be the most significant antitrust action in the U.S. in the roughly two decades since the government sued Microsoft Corp.[4] in 1998.'Conservatives have good reason to believe Google abuses its power as the world's largest search engine. Guerilla journalism group Project Veritas published a video showing Google Responsible Innovation Head Jen Gennai suggesting that 'breaking up Google' would not 'prevent the next Trump situation.'[5] She also mused how changes in Google's secret algorithms could have prevented his election from happening in the first place.Donald Trump, Jr. [6]accused Google of 'election interference' in mid-June after the search engine giant had reportedly demonetized skeptic news website ZeroHedge and sent a warning that it would take similar action against The Federalist. NBC News alleged that[7] 'A Google spokesperson said in an email on Monday that it demonetized the websites after determining they violated its policies on content related to race.'Google also flip-flopped on its ad policies[8] after massive pushback by liberals who complained that they could specifically benefit the Trump campaign.Could this clear liberal bias and vulnerability to liberal activists lead to a stolen election? At least one expert would say, yes. Prominent liberal Google critic Dr. Robert Epstein[9] wrote that Google gave at least 2.6 million votes to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it could sway 'upward of 15 million votes' in the Democrats' favor in 2020.Breitbart released leaked footage[10] of Google leadership and employees gathering for a meeting with an 'atmosphere of panic and dismay,' after President Donald Trump's 2016 victory.Conservatives are under attack.

This comes as politicians such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have sounded the call to war on Big Tech monopolies in a September 10 tweet[3]: 'Big Tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, &amp;#38; Apple have way too much power over our economy &amp;#38; our democracy. For the good of our country, we must demand our regulators do their jobs &amp;#38; take swift, aggressive action - not kick the can down the road one more time.' Bloomberg went on to observe that: 'Nearly every state attorney general is investigating the company in a parallel probe focused on the company's online advertising business and led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.'Google might be facing fights on multiple fronts: 'Different states have focused on other parts of Google's sprawling business lines, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing confidential matters.' </p><p>The article then explained how, according to the same anonymous sources: 'Even after the case is filed in the coming weeks, some Democratic-led states could continue to investigate other aspects of Google's business and could bring an additional case in the coming months.'The same article specified that this will be one of the most decisive actions against Big Tech in many years: 'The lawsuit is expected to be the most significant antitrust action in the U.S. in the roughly two decades since the government sued Microsoft Corp.[4] in 1998.'Conservatives have good reason to believe Google abuses its power as the world's largest search engine. Guerilla journalism group Project Veritas published a video showing Google Responsible Innovation Head Jen Gennai suggesting that 'breaking up Google' would not 'prevent the next Trump situation.'[5] She also mused how changes in Google's secret algorithms could have prevented his election from happening in the first place.Donald Trump, Jr. [6]accused Google of 'election interference' in mid-June after the search engine giant had reportedly demonetized skeptic news website ZeroHedge and sent a warning that it would take similar action against The Federalist. NBC News alleged that[7] 'A Google spokesperson said in an email on Monday that it demonetized the websites after determining they violated its policies on content related to race.'Google also flip-flopped on its ad policies[8] after massive pushback by liberals who complained that they could specifically benefit the Trump campaign.Could this clear liberal bias and vulnerability to liberal activists lead to a stolen election? At least one expert would say, yes. Prominent liberal Google critic Dr. Robert Epstein[9] wrote that Google gave at least 2.6 million votes to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it could sway 'upward of 15 million votes' in the Democrats' favor in 2020.Breitbart released leaked footage[10] of Google leadership and employees gathering for a meeting with an 'atmosphere of panic and dismay,' after President Donald Trump's 2016 victory.Conservatives are under attack. Contact the FCC at 1-888-225-5322 and/or via the MRC's FCC contact form[11] to give your take on the petition filed by the Department of Commerce regarding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on 'hate speech' and equal footing for conservatives.

This comes as politicians such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have sounded the call to war on Big Tech monopolies in a September 10 tweet :     \u201cBig Tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, &amp; Apple have way too much power over our economy &amp; our democracy. For the good of our country, we must demand our regulators do their jobs &amp; take swift, aggressive action \u2013 not kick the can down the road one more time.\u201d     Bloomberg went on to observe that: \u201cNearly every state attorney general is investigating the company in a parallel probe focused on the company\u2019s online advertising business and led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\u201d    Google might be facing fights on multiple fronts: \u201cDifferent states have focused on other parts of Google\u2019s sprawling business lines, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing confidential matters.\u201d The article then explained how, according to the same anonymous sources: \u201cEven after the case is filed in the coming weeks, some Democratic-led states could continue to investigate other aspects of Google\u2019s business and could bring an additional case in the coming months.\u201d    The same article specified that this will be one of the most decisive actions against Big Tech in many years: \u201cThe lawsuit is expected to be the most significant antitrust action in the U.S. in the roughly two decades since the government sued Microsoft Corp. in 1998.\u201d    Conservatives have good reason to believe Google abuses its power as the world\u2019s largest search engine. Guerilla journalism group Project Veritas published a video showing Google Responsible Innovation Head Jen Gennai suggesting that \u201cbreaking up Google\u201d would not \u201cprevent the next Trump situation.\u201d She also mused how changes in Google\u2019s secret algorithms could have prevented his election from happening in the first place.   Donald Trump, Jr. accused Google of \u201celection interference\u201d in mid-June after the search engine giant had reportedly demonetized skeptic news website ZeroHedge and sent a warning that it would take similar action against The Federalist. NBC News alleged that \u201cA Google spokesperson said in an email on Monday that it demonetized the websites after determining they violated its policies on content related to race.\u201d     Google also flip-flopped on its ad policies after massive pushback by liberals who complained that they could specifically benefit the Trump campaign.   Could this clear liberal bias and vulnerability to liberal activists lead to a stolen election? At least one expert would say, yes. Prominent liberal Google critic Dr. Robert Epstein wrote that Google gave at least 2.6 million votes to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it could sway \u201cupward of 15 million votes\u201d in the Democrats\u2019 favor in 2020.    Breitbart released leaked footage of Google leadership and employees gathering for a meeting with an \u201catmosphere of panic and dismay,\u201d after President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory.    Conservatives are under attack. Contact the FCC at 1-888-225-5322 and/or via the MRC\u2019s FCC contact form to give your take on the petition filed by the Department of Commerce regarding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on \u201chate speech\u201d and equal footing for conservatives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and fresh attacks from President Trump are giving momentum to a conservative push to gut the law that gives companies immunity for content posted by their users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservatives see the changes as essential to combating what they say is anti-conservative bias and censorship by the tech industry.</p><p>Republicans brought new attention to the controversy this week when Nunes sued Twitter and several of its users for defamation. The lawmaker alleged Twitter users were allowed to insult him online because the company has a left-wing bias.</p><p>And Trump on Tuesday promised to look into an aide's allegation that he was censored by Facebook, accusing social media companies of being \"on the side of the Radical Left Democrats.\"</p><p>Social media platforms have repeatedly denied that they are censoring conservatives and there is little evidence to back up Republicans' claims of being \"shadow banned,\" or having their posts hidden from other users. Last week, a federal judge appointed by Trump threw out a lawsuit from right-wing activists alleging that social media companies were discriminating against conservative voices.</p><p>But the fight over bias is putting a spotlight on a part of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, Section 230, which largely gives internet platforms legal immunity over content posted on their sites by third parties.</p><p>Proponents of the law say that it has helped grow the modern internet economy built on user-generated content and was designed to protect against lawsuits like Nunes's.</p><p>Now, a growing chorus of Republican voices want changes to the law in order to hold internet giants liable for the content on their platforms and how they moderate users.</p><p>\"You're neutral platforms; nobody is holding you responsible for what you put up, nobody is holding you responsible for what you take down,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told an executive from Google at a hearing last week.</p><p>\"But that's a big advantage in the law. If you have a newspaper, or a TV station, you can be regulated and you can be sued.\"</p><p>A spokesman for Graham did not respond when asked if the senator plans to hold hearings or push legislation on the issue.</p><p>For Nunes, the law's language means his bias suit against Twitter faces long odds.</p><p>Carl Szabo, the general counsel for NetChoice, a trade group representing internet companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, said on Tuesday that Nunes's case is unlikely to succeed.</p><p>\"This lawsuit underscores the importance of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which empowers platforms to host content and discussions of our elected officials \u00af whether our elected officials like it or not,\" Szabo said in a statement.</p><p>\"Twitter has been an amazing forum for discussing \u00af and yes, criticizing \u00af our public officials, hopefully this lawsuit doesn't undermine that. The ability to criticize our public officials is core to our American principles.\"</p><p>Proponents of the law are arguing that any changes would have dire consequences. And the GOP's arguments are unlikely to sway Democrats at a time when they have criticized tech companies for not cracking down enough on right-wing extremists \u00af especially in the wake of the massacre targeting two mosques in New Zealand last week.</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who helped author Section 230, believes that any attacks on the law will disrupt users' ability to express themselves freely online.</p><p>\"Donald Trump, Devin Nunes and [Texas Sen.] Ted Cruz are proving exactly why Section 230 is so essential \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without protections, all online media would face an onslaught of bad-faith lawsuits and pressure campaigns from the powerful in an effort to silence their critics,\" Wyden said in a statement to The Hill.</p><p>\"The fact is, social media companies should be doing more to clean up their platforms, not less,\" he added. \"Calls for government regulation of online speech and the business practices of private corporations run counter to everything conservatives claim to believe.\"</p><p>It's the second time in as many years that lawmakers have sought to change the law.</p><p>Congress carved out an exception to Section 230 last year after a contentious fight with the tech industry. A bill commonly referred to as SESTA or FOSTA made internet platforms liable for any content facilitating sex trafficking.</p><p>But critics worry that the carveout and any future amendments could undermine good-faith efforts by platforms to police their content.</p><p>The attacks on the law come at a difficult time for the tech industry, with its key players already under scrutiny in Washington on a number of fronts.</p><p>Democrats are pushing for tougher data privacy regulations and antitrust enforcement against the biggest companies.</p><p>For Republicans, momentum is building for targeting Section 230, which many see as an attractive way to rein in the industry.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a freshman lawmaker who has already become one of the GOP's biggest tech critics, recently called Section 230 a \"sweetheart deal\" that allowed Silicon Valley to grow exponentially without concern for their platforms' effect on society.</p><p>For Hawley and other conservatives, the law is at the heart of their fight against perceived bias.</p><p>\"We need to look at look at this cozy relationship between Big Tech and big government,\" Hawley said at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this month. \"Because government has given tech this special status. That's why we are where we are.\"</p><p>Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, dismissed the idea that conservatives were the unique targets of bias on social media platforms.</p><p>He said targeting the tech industry's legal protections would be \"one of the most aggressive forms of regulation that government could pursue.\"</p><p>Republicans, though, see the actions of tech companies as unfair \u00af and want to level the playing field.</p><p>Trump's social media manager, Dan Scavino, on Monday said Facebook had temporarily blocked him from commenting on his own posts.</p><p>The company said it inadvertently restricted Scavino's account because it noticed a burst of \"identical, repetitive activity\" that led the company to believe it was coming from a bot.</p><p>But those explanations are not enough for Republicans.</p><p>\"I will be looking into this,\" Trump vowed on Twitter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-40D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1059\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

Happy Thanksgiving to you and to everyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: I'm Dagen McDowell in for Kennedy. Tonight, can senate Republicans unite under the GOP tax plan? And why are Wall Street firms now skeptical of the proposal? Mr. Robert Wolf is here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, is <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>really now blaming president Obama for her election loss? We'll have to explain that, coming up, and tech companies behaving badly. Uber and Google in the spotlight for trying to pull a fast one on users. How can we fight back? All that and more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The gloves are off tonight on KENNEDY. First tonight, taxes. Say it like we hate it. As the White House and GOP leaders continue to push their plan for tax cuts, some firms on Wall Street appear to be growing skeptical.</p><p>And that could spell trouble to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>signature issue. according to the \"Washington Post,\" Bank of America economist are calling the Republican proposal a \"fiscal sugar high for somebody who drinks Mountain Dew,\" I kind of like that.</p><p>The number crunchers at Morgan Stanley claim any positive effects from the tax cuts would be short-lived and out of Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein is saying that the economy is doing well and tax cuts don't need to be a priority. So what would the tax cuts mean for normal folks?</p><p>Well, independent experts have been analyzing the senate bill and the predictions are clearly split along some partisan lines. The left-leaning Tax Policy Center is out with a study that says.</p><p>In the first year under the senate plan, nine percent of Americans will see their taxes rise, 50 percent of Americans will see their taxes go up after a decade.</p><p>But the conservative Tax Foundation points out that the senate plan would lead to higher wages, nearly 1 million new jobs, and enough economic growth to generate about $1.2 trillion in federal revenue. So who should we listen to? Politicians, bankers, or the bean counters in D.C.?</p><p>Joining me now is former economic adviser to President Obama, Fox News contributor Robert Wolf. We kind of have you wrapped up all in that.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISOR: I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's -- you're kind of all of those things.</p><p>WOLF: I am.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I kind of mean that as a compliment.</p><p>WOLF: Well, thank you. Well --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because you haven't said -- you don't think -- you haven't thought all year that they would get tax reform done, certainly, by the end of the year. Do you still stand by that?</p><p>WOLF: I stand by that and, you know, as you know, I'm for tax reform. I would have split it between business tax reform and personal. I think comprehensive is just too difficult and I think that's what they're finding. And trying to mix and match just doesn't work.</p><p>You have a lot of people arguing why is corporate tax reform permanent and personal not permanent? And then --</p><p>MCDOWELL: So that's where the 50 percent of people's taxes go up after 10 years is because these tax cuts expire.</p><p>WOLF: Exactly. And then I also think we're just in a situation where there's a misunderstanding about how corporate America works in many ways. Just because you get more money, that doesn't mean you invest more money. OK? You can have buy -- do dividends.</p><p>You can do stock buy backs. You only invest if there's an ROI. And so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Return on investment.</p><p>WOLF: A return on investment. So a lot of the corporate CEOs are saying, you know, \"It's great if we get our taxes lowered.\" But as Gary Cohn found out when he asked how many CEOs raised a hand would actually reinvest it, there was a de minimis number in the audience.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But do you -- are you hearing that privately that these CEOs aren't going to invest? That they would just buy back stock, which by the way would pump up the stock market and <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>would probably like that.</p><p>But AT&amp;T's CEO Randall Stephenson earlier this year clearly not a fan of <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>now that the justice department is trying to put the kibosh on AT&amp;T buying Time Warner. But he said that 20 to 25 percent corporate tax rate will make us step up our investment level.</p><p>So are they not telling the truth?</p><p>WOLF: Well, I think, first of all, it -- the economy feels better globally today than when he made that statement. I actually do think that they will take the money and spend it hopefully on capital expenditure and people.</p><p>But that being said, the economy has been doing a bit better on a global basis and what I would say is one of the concerns all the corporate CEOs has is debt and deficit. Because at the end of the day, that impacts inflation, that impacts the economy.</p><p>And if you recall when President Obama was looking at tax reform --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, he proposed at 2012 --</p><p>WOLF: He proposed 25 percent for manufacturing, 28 percent for corporate.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Twenty-eight percent. In 2012 and 2013.</p><p>WOLF: But the fiscal, you know, hawks, mainly the conservative Republicans, forced it to be revenue neutral. Which was fine, but you can't really do tax reform revenue neutral unless you take away some things and that's why this is not tax reform.</p><p>This current plan by the GOP is just a tax cut. We should just say what it is. It's a tax cut.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's certainly a tax cut on -- well, it's a tax reform on the business side somewhat because we do go to a territorial system and we try --</p><p>WOLF: But that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and prevent some corporate tax shenanigans that go on now and a number of the tweaks in it.</p><p>WOLF: But I would view tax reform as impacting revenues, OK? And expenses. This is not impacting revenues.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, the Tax Foundation, we use that statistic if it -- if it raises revenue 1.2 trillion, that comes close to paying for it.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, what I would say.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're going to argue with this.</p><p>WOLF: Well, no, no. Listen, I'm a Reagan Democrat. I was brought up in Wall Street in the '80s. We all believe trickled down economics worked in the '80s. It's not the same today. When Reagan was president, taxes were 70 percent, OK? Corporate taxes were north of 50.</p><p>It's just totally different and it wasn't a global economy the way it is today. We have not proven, OK, in the last decade that trickled down economics has worked. So I'm a little more skeptical about that. That being said, I think we should simplify the tax plan.</p><p>I would just do it separately. I would do business tax reform, I think you can pass it, and then I'd work on the hard, personal tax part.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Steve Moore who work with (INAUDIBLE) before the inauguration, I think.</p><p>WOLF: Well, Steve and Austin, you know, I -- both sides have 32 advisers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>WOLF: And they both think it should be separated.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's a party over there, I tell you what.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Those are some fun people.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, they are.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lots of arguing. Robert.</p><p>WOLF: A lot of arguing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's good to see you.</p><p>WOLF: Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving to you and everyone at Fox.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Back at you, my friend. In the meantime, the prospects of getting the tax plan passed just keep getting murkier. A small number of undecided GOP senators could ultimately decide its fate.</p><p>According to reports, that group includes Bob Corker of Tennessee, Jeff Flake of Arizona, and Susan Collins of Maine, among others. The problem is, every time GOP leaders try to appease some senators, they risk alienating others. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin says he's voting \"no.\"</p><p>And this is over the way small businesses are treated and as we all know, they can't really afford any more defectors. So will they unite? Carley Shimkus is here, one of my favorite people walking on planet Earth. She's a reporter for \"Fox News Headlines 24/7\".</p><p>She was in a cranberry field short -- a little while ago. Townhall.com political editor and Fox News contributor, Guy Benson, another favorite of mine and Former White House Security Council Staffer Gillian Turner. A big --</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SECURITY COUNSEL STAFFER: Your absolute favorite.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Absolute favorite, and I like her hair better than yours, Carley so.</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS REPORTER: Oh, wow. I kid -- I kid her. She's got the best hair I think on Fox News.</p><p>TURNER: Yes, it's so funny because I hate my hair. But thank you.</p><p>SHIMKUS: What?</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we all agree here something that senators and the Republican party, Guy, cannot. Do they get this done? I can't imagine Senator John McCain coming out and giving this thing a thumbs-up just because it would mean potentially a victory for <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: I mean, if that's the mentality of a senator like McCain or Susan Collins or Bob Corker, that would be so petty. It would be throwing away a long-term victory and conservative goal just to stick it to Trump.</p><p>And it would being just as petty, if not more so as they accuse Trump of being on a regular basis. I think that there are some positive signs on this. I'm not convinced that Ron Johnson is a hard no. I think that he's saying no for now and maneuvering.</p><p>Lisa Murkowski has made a few --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No one thinks he's a hard no.</p><p>BENSON: Right. So I -- it doesn't seem like he -- you can take it to the bank that he's going to be voting against this thing. Murkowski, who is a real pain on healthcare is making some noises that seem optimistic about certain elements of the plan. If we're not --</p><p>MCDOWELL: If she says that she'll vote, yes.</p><p>BENSON: We're not there yet in terms of a whip count but the Republicans have to recognize they need to get something done. There's a lot in this bill to really like. It's time to finally govern like a majority.</p><p>TURNER: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But Murkowski says that it seems like she'll be a \"yes\" if they repeal the individual mandate that that's her condition for the --</p><p>BENSON: Well, she's OK with the plan of getting rid of the individual mandate, so long as they pass something else like a stabilization package to basically bail out insurers because of the disruption that that would occur.</p><p>If both of those are balanced out, she and possibly Susan Collins have indicated they could get onboard for something like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, the line is all politics is local. Really, all politics is personal. It's like personal relationships but also, I want it and I want it now.</p><p>It's -- they all have these individual wants and needs, and it's, I think, disgusting to the American people, quite frankly.</p><p>TURNER: Well, the other thing -- so let's say there's a Christmas miracle and the senate passes their version of this bill. They've still got this massive uphill battle ahead with the reconciliation process.</p><p>Because we're still left with a situation where the house and senate versions have some major, major discrepancies. I mean, I could tell you all about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, particularly with the state and local tax deduction and the senate plan. they completely do away with it on the house plan.</p><p>TURNER: Tax brackets.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They have -- right. they have the $10,000 exemption for property taxes but I think a bigger point, Carley, is that the senate -- the senate and the house -- the Republicans in both chambers, they do a horrible job of communicating this.</p><p>And they do a horrible job of fighting back against the criticisms from the Democrats. Some of which Robert Wolf expressed.</p><p>SHIMKUS: They do. And some of the concerns that politicians are expressing now have been expressed for years and it's largely because of a lack of communication and inability to get things done. but enough about politicians.</p><p>The American people are really not completely onboard with this plan either. There was a recent Harvard-Harris poll that said 54 percent of Americans oppose this bill. A majority of conservatives agreed with the way this tax bill was laid out but small business owners are concerned.</p><p>There's overall sentiment that this benefits the rich over the poor. So also, is <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>doing enough to get more people onboard? I don't really know if he has been.</p><p>TURNER: One thing is that part of the reason healthcare failed according to Capitol Hill is that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>didn't really have enough skin in the game. He did not go door to door like he should have --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's right.</p><p>TURNER: -- to try and sell this to members and senators. I think he's tried to reverse course, correct that error with this. He's been much more hands on in delivering tax bills on both sides of the aisle on both chambers -- to both chambers. For everything --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're making a face.</p><p>TURNER: -- for that 70 point -- you don't think so?</p><p>BENSON: No. No. I think you're right. I think he's always cared more --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's his thinking face.</p><p>TURNER: Well, just quickly. The 70-point plan that he had the White House come up with to deliver to the Hill was, like, an opening show of, like, look.</p><p>BENSON: We're serious.</p><p>TURNER: \"We're serious about this. We've put thought into it.\"</p><p>BENSON: Yes and I think to your point about polling, there's reams of other polling showing that the major elements of the Republican bill are very popular with the American people.</p><p>What Republicans ought to be saying constantly is that independent sources, independent analysts have found that the tax reform bill that just passed the house would cut taxes on average for every income group in America.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BENSON: That it will grow the economy, create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and the biggest one being 70 percent of Americans right now file taxes and take the standard deduction. They do not itemize.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And we get to double it for you, people.</p><p>BENSON: They have double the standard deduction. That is at least 70 percent of Americans automatically winners right off the top of this thing. Republicans don't point that out every second.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Make it -- make it easier. We're going to increase your child tax credit and we're going to double the standard deduction and we're going to stick it to those liberals in those blue states. Sorry. That's what they're doing.</p><p>BENSON: That's where you live, though.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I know, I'm getting the -- never mind.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Twitter's going to be fun.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: In these -- in these plans I am getting the -- moving on. Speaking of -- well, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton, </nameText></person>once said it takes a village to raise a child, but it's going to take several villages to keep track of all the things that she's blamed her election loss on.</p><p>Yesterday, she went to excuse number 900. This time bringing President Obama into the mix saying this, \"When you run to succeed a two-term president of your own party, you have a historical headwind blowing against you.\" The nerve that Obama winning a second term.</p><p>Hillary also went on to say that she had a difficult time running because this election was the first reality TV campaign, which is amazing given that here we are a year later, and she's still not accepting reality. So has Hillary gone mad or did she just have too much hot sauce at lunch?</p><p>Carley, this is -- I understand -- because she was trying to -- she couldn't really run on President Obama's record in terms of people in the middle of the country.</p><p>The very people who turned and voted for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>because their wages weren't growing, they felt left out, they felt left behind, ignored by Washington. So how are you going -- how are you going to basically blame the president, President Obama but then also rub --</p><p>SHIMKUS: While you're running -- yes. Yes, like, can you -- can you help me win? I actually think she made a really good point, given everything that, you know, you just said.</p><p>It's obviously going to be more difficult for her to convince unhappy people that she's going to make them happy running as a Democrat after Obama. But I mean, the funny thing here is just that the excuse train is, like, 150 cars long now.</p><p>And it's rolling down the tracks with no end in sight. So this is another one.</p><p>TURNER: I actually view it as an excuse as much as I see it as, like, this was a moment where she was actually being very truthful because the way --</p><p>BENSON: Rare.</p><p>TURNER: Because the way that I -- the way that I see it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That side over on the campaign trail.</p><p>SHIMKUS: That should be the headline.</p><p>TURNER: A lot of the stuff that she's throwing around about, you know, it's Bernie's fault. It's this one, you know, like, that stuff was a little --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Russia.</p><p>TURNER: But I think this is actually -- she's being honest and it's true. Because one of the things her campaign failed to do at a national level was to really hammer out how she overlapped with and differentiated herself from President Obama's policies.</p><p>It's something that they fail on the campaign trail from day one all the way through to November.</p><p>BENSON: And they were doomed to fail. And they --</p><p>TURNER: They -- but, well -- but --</p><p>BENSON: On that -- on that point because if you look at the exit polling.</p><p>TURNER: They could have -- but they could've done a better job of hammering out from the beginning --</p><p>BENSON: Sure.</p><p>TURNER: -- the areas of this is where we're with president Obama, and this is how we're different. This is how we're better and they never did that.</p><p>BENSON: I think -- I think your point is well taken but if you look at the exit polling and the polling leading up to this election, people were not happy with the direction of the country. It was on paper a change election. She was right about the history at play here.</p><p>And there is not a single person on the planet who could be credibly convinced that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>would a changemaker after eight years of Barack Obama. No one was going to believe that. So it was a tall task. Trump, say what you will about him, big, big change.</p><p><person><nameText>Hillary Clinton, </nameText></person>more of the same.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it wasn't eight years of Obama that were -- was her problem. It was eight years of Bill Clinton, and she, with being in the White House, and what she tried to do there that was -- it's much further left than what Barack Obama did, I would argue.</p><p>BENSON: A lot of baggage.</p><p>TURNER: Like they were viewed --</p><p>MCDOWELL: A lot of baggage (INAUDIBLE) it was a lot of baggage and a personality that was fiction or at least she tried to be fiction. And then the -- sorry.</p><p>SHIMKUS: That's something we will not miss.</p><p>BENSON: It's terrifying.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The panel returns later but first, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>managed to stay away from the Roy Moore controversy for a while but finally weighed in on the Alabama senate race yesterday. Should he have just stifled? I'll ask Ari Fleischer, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just when it seemed like <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>had wisely side-stepped the controversy surrounding Roy Moore and other Washington sex scandals, he dove right into the muck with White House reporters and seemed to suggest that he, well, supports Roy Moore.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, he denies it. I mean, if you look at what is really going on and you look at all of the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn't happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, some political analysts say the president should've just continued to stay quiet on that issue with some calling the off the cuff statements an unforced error. Same goes for his ongoing Twitter spat with the NFL as well as basketball dad LaVar Ball.</p><p>Whom Trump referred to as a poor man's Don King. So what will it take for the president to avoid the political third rail or could it be in his best interest to just keep stirring the pot? Let me bring in former White House secretary -- Press Secretary, Ari Fleischer.</p><p>He is also a Fox News contributor. Ari, I have said literally for -- since the president declared his candidacy, he shouldn't be on Twitter. he shouldn't be saying that, but he still does it, and he won the White House, and he's still here.</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Yes and I don't think anybody should ever think he will get off of Twitter. He won't. He's actually used it to his benefit many times. I think sometimes he's gone too far. The LaVar Ball thing, I think is just a silly distraction.</p><p>I don't think there's anything that's going to upset the ship of state here. But it's a -- it's a fight that if you're the president, sometimes you want to elevate. You don't have to be in every fight that's out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: As a communications director, though, the comments that he made on the fly about Roy Moore, it was the way he said it that seemed to be the problem and as if he did not have kind of a prepared response to those questions. Whose fault is that?</p><p>FLEISCHER: Oh, no, I think he had a prepared response. He knew what he wanted to say and I think he's been inching toward this for weeks. Look, he can't keep silent on this forever. The election's not for another three weeks.</p><p>He's going to talk to the press within the next three weeks and he made his point. And he is in an impossible catch 22. If -- play it out. if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>had said that Moore needs to step down, the immediate next questions is then \"What about you, Mr. President?</p><p>Why should we believe Roy Moore's accusers when we didn't believe yours?\" So he can't say that. And so what's he going to say and then I think that's the pickle that he's in and that's why he said what he said.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, does it distract and take away and even damage his agenda as the senate is now trying to move forward on massive tax reform? It'll, ultimately, if he can get through the senate, go to conference. Does this hurt that?</p><p>Should he be communicating more about that versus everything else from basketball to football to the color of the sky?</p><p>FLEISCHER: Well, look, I think that nothing is going to impact tax reform in this election. Either Republicans are going to be able to pass it before this election or they're not.</p><p>And then if you lose the seat in Alabama, then it's going to be even more precarious when it comes to final passage if they don't have that done in time. So I understand that incentive to want to have somebody who votes your way.</p><p>But, again, you know, there's not as if you can just avoid reporters for three weeks. I suppose he could clam up and do that. But it's very hard to do when you're the president, and he's going to get asked by the press about Roy Moore. They love the topic. They're never going to let it go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I will give him this. He did try to make it about a political choice that are you going to choose a Democrat? He mentioned that the candidate was weak on crime. And or are you going to choose a Republican?</p><p>And I thought that that was the kind of lane that you want to stay in.</p><p>FLEISCHER: You have to be consistent, and I have said that the right moral thing would've been for Moore to step down. I wish he had done that. I don't defend Roy Moore. But in the Democrat's case.</p><p>Take what happened with Congressman Conyers who's also been accused of sexual harassment and had paid off a settlement. One of the leading Democrats in the house leadership a congressman named James Clyburn, fellow Democrat said this about his friend Roy -- Congressman John Conyers that the charges against him don't have any real substance.</p><p>\"You can't jump to conclusions with these types of things. For all I know, all of this could be made up.\" So if the Democrats are going to jump on <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for not believing the accusers of Roy Moore, they need to jump on James Clyburn for defending John Conyers.</p><p>You can't have it both ways and the Democrats are trying to have it both ways on these issues.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well said. Ari Fleischer, great the see you. Take care. Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>FLEISCHER: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, a damning new report claiming Uber's new hacker stole data from nearly 60 million customers and drivers but kept it under wraps from -- for more than a year. Should you be concerned if you're an Uber user? Deirdre Bolton, details next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: An Uber cover-up exposed. The ride-sharing company has admitted they paid hackers $100,000 to conceal a cyberattack that exposed the data of 57 million customers. Oh, and that hack occurred back in October 2016.</p><p>Is the latest in a long list of Uber screwups that date back all the way to the company's founding. So why are we just finding out about the hack now and should users be concerned? Here with me now Fox Business Network's Deirdre Bolton. Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FBN ANCHOR: I (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is the latest screw up. But this is kind of even more appalling than some of the things --</p><p>BOLTON: I was just going to say -- yes, I was going to say Uber's past CEO, former CEO Travis Kalanick had really set the bar pretty high for bad behavior, immaturity.</p><p>And as many people would say, maybe even questionable ethics as a human being compared to other average human beings. But this actually takes the cake. So Uber got hacked, you mentioned the date, October 2016. So more than a year ago and didn't tell anybody.</p><p>OK. So that's actually a problem as you alluded to following a long list of problems. Uber just flouted regulation. You're supposed to pick up the phone and call the New York attorney general, the FTC, and say, \"Hey, this is what happened.</p><p>Customers' accounts and data were breached. Also, some of our drivers.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's like 600,000 drivers, I think.</p><p>BOLTON: And so 600,000 license numbers were taken from 7 million drivers, Dagen. And then if you want to look at the numbers for worldwide customers, it's above 50 million. This is a big hack. I just want to underline this point that CEO no longer has his job.</p><p>And this is just one of the reasons years, this is the only one, at least, that I know of from being on the business where the CEO was like, \"Oh, you hacked our database? OK, here's $100,000. Zip it.\"</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: And there's no way to know or we don't know at this point what the hackers still have in their hands.</p><p>BOLTON: I'll go over the list with you. I mean, you know, now, what I do want to tell you is that the list has been provided by Uber itself. So we're going to have to trust. In other words, no Social Security numbers, I do know that. No credit card information and no trip location details, which is obviously a great privacy concern.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they're asking us to trust them when they didn't tell us for the last year that they got hacked.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. And they sort of just released in a blog post saying, \"Hey, this just happened a year ago.\" Quiet blog posting. I think you should know about it. One thing I do want to say is the new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, it's a very long last name, seems extremely confident.</p><p>He is just trying to cleanup these messes left, right, and center. Honestly by all accounts, he's a very good leader. He's very strong. He had said, \"Listen, there's no excuse for what happened. I'm not even going to try to explain this, but what I can tell you is going forward every single business decision that we're making at Uber is made with the idea of integrity.</p><p>So I do give the new CEO a lot of credit. I just think he has such a huge mess. It's like two monkeys cooking in a kitchen and he has to go around and clean up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A culture of misogyny and sexism that was well-known throughout Silicon Valley. They were using the personal travel information of a reporter to follow her. There was one executive had the personal medical records of a rape victim in India.</p><p>BOLTON: And he actually flew to India illegally obtained those medical records with the idea of discrediting a customer who was a victim of a rape at the hands of an Uber driver, but the idea was to take her medical records and discredit her story. No, I mean, there's nothing that was correct or noble or done properly at this company under the former CEO.</p><p>I do want to highlight, He's still on the board. So there are a lot of investors, in fact, one of their biggest investor is Benchmark Capital in an open lawsuit right now trying to, basically, get more board seats.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I'm going to make this face in the camera and relay in respect to that news. Crazy. Thank you, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>BOLTON: You're so welcome, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're fantastic. Always good to see you. So how evil is technology? That's the question asked in \"New York Times\" op-ed that compares the tech industry to big tobacco. What? The piece outlines three ways big tech is hurting users. Number one, social media is having a negative impact on young people.</p><p>Two, the tech industry is encouraging addiction to products to make more money. And three, monopolies like Facebook and Google are using their market power to invade our privacy. Privacy invasion has proven to be a valid fear. Google just admitting that they have been able to track the location of users even when the setting was turned off on phones. So how do we fight big tech?</p><p>The party panel, back. Carley Shimkus, Guy Benson, Gillian Turner. Carley, this is what you cover. You cover social media. How do we fight this?</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS REPORTER: You can't. You can't fight it, but you have to realize that this is what is happening and there's nothing that you can really do about it. Even if your location, you know, tracker is off, even if your microphone is off on your phone, always assume that people now have your information.</p><p>Now, I don't think that everybody should be very concerned about this. I personally am not. I like to think that my life is so bland that somebody in, you know, a tech company isn't tracking me, personally, but they --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Carley, there are a lot of perverts online tracking you.</p><p>SHIMKUS: That is true. One look at twitter and you get very terrified.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've read this \"New York Times\" op-ed, and I think about all of the information that people give to these technology companies and the way they choose to use, this is personal responsibility.</p><p>This is where parents need to step up, this is where we all need to step up because ultimately if you're worried about it, then don't use your phone then take charge of your own life.</p><p>SHIMKUS: The landline will make a research.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Seriously.</p><p>GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: Totally agree. And a lot of this does come down to what you allow yourself to do and your devices and the choices that you make and parenting and so forth, but to the example that you just gave about Google, these were people being responsible turning off features that they didn't want on and google is exploiting it anyway in a way that I think was a betrayal.</p><p>And then Uber was in trouble in the last couple days revealing that there was a huge hack that compromised millions of people's data.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, which dear to ourselves.</p><p>BENSON: Yes, and what do they do? They covered it up by hiring basically more hackers to make it go away and now we're just finding out about it. So if this --</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SECURITY COUNCIL STAFFER: It was shockingly easy for them to follow it up.</p><p>BENSON Very easy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good thing that Google a couple of years ago got rid of its original motto, \"Don't be evil.\" That used to be the motto because they couldn't -- I want to get Gillian. Gillian, what were you going to say?</p><p>TURNER: I was just going to say that there are some parallels on the national security front, which what Carley was saying about how do you regulate Silicon Valley and big tech? You can't, really. You can't really rely on the government to do this. We're only now for the first time getting social media to dump ISIS content off of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that was through shaming because I shamed Twitter years ago because they were literally not policing it at all, but I think that the threat of regulation will get them to do a better job at protecting people's information, the threat of it because they don't want the government coming in.</p><p>It's looking like some holiday spirits may be running a little dry this year. Many offices will reportedly be banning alcohol from their year-end parties while some firms are even canceling the shindigs altogether.</p><p>The reasoning lies in the recent tidal wave of sexual harassment accusations coming out of workplace environments. Several employers don't want to take the chance of a booze-fueled incident, but is sobriety really the answer? Guy, you're giving me the death stare.</p><p>BENSON: It's such a depressing story. Where some of perv NATO is ruining everything for everyone else. If you have too many drinks at the office Christmas Party, you probably shouldn't be doing that to begin with.</p><p>TURNER: Or take yourself home.</p><p>BENSON: To have it ruin for everyone else because of these bad apples is so annoying and a lot of people are moving towards alcohol-free lunches, which is fine but less fun.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll drink some booze at lunch because noon is like my 5:00.</p><p>BENSON: Solution.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes, exactly, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, because I get up at 2:00 in the morning.</p><p>SHIMKUS: My favorite time to have a glass of wine is at noon. I am --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENSON: Your solution here, I'm like, \"Oh, some companies are moving these to lunches.\" You're like, \"Great. Let's drink at lunch.\" Undeterred.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's what people are going to do at the Christmas party like a little --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENSON: They'll be looking like high-schoolers, you know, drinking at a school dance except that they'll be all adults.</p><p>TURNER: Everyone's running to the bathroom.</p><p>SHIMKUS: This isn't going to happen, though. There would be so much outrage if they don't serve alcohol at company Christmas parties. People would just bring their own. You know what they do --</p><p>TURNER: Here's a pro tip. No one's going to go, so don't bother to hold the party. Would you -- I wouldn't go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's true. And then the company would save money, though.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Just cancel it.</p><p>TURNER: They will enforce that then. I guess which some of them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But do you know what? That's what they're doing. These companies are using this as cover to cancel the Christmas party.</p><p>BENSON: Cheapskates.</p><p>TURNER: So they already know this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The war on Christmas. I tell you it exists.</p><p>TURNER: This is a real war on Christmas right here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly. You take away my booze, it's war all right. Thank you, all, Gillian, Guy and Carley.</p><p>TURNER: Thank you.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Big hug.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Big hug. Did you know there are more troops in Somalia than at any time since the infamous Black Hawk Down battle? Buck Sexton joins me to discuss why the American military is beefing up its presence in Africa, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: On the death of four U.S. soldiers in Niger last month, people started to wonder why we had such a big military presence in Central Africa in the first place. Turns out, America's military presence in Africa extends far beyond just Niger.</p><p>It has expanded this year following Trump's April decision to grant new authorities to our military leaders in Africa. And Somalia alone, 29 airstrikes have been carried out this year to combat Islamic extremist. More than double what was carried out in 2016. Military personnel in Somalia have also more than doubled this year from about 200 to 500.</p><p>It's the largest American military presence in that country since the Black Hawk Down disaster in 1993 when 18 U.S. soldiers died. Now, Somalia is a war-torn country and there seems to be an endless supply of bad guys there, but can America really patch things up?</p><p>Let me bring in former CIA officer, host Buck Sexton with \"America Now\", and it is buck sexton. Good to see you, my friend.</p><p>BUCK SEXTON, FORMER CIA OFFICER AND HOST, AMERICA NOW: Good to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's going on in, particularly, Somalia and why the increased presence there?</p><p>SEXTON: The Trump Administration I think has seen what's gone on in Iraq and Syria as a template for what they're going to try to do against the affiliates of the Islamic State around the world going forward.</p><p>Use local on-the-ground allies, work within the political realities of the various tribes and factions and sectarian groups in the area, give them air cover, have a limited presence of U.S. Special Forces or Special Operations Command personnel who will be training, providing intelligence, and other assistance if necessary, but let indigenous forces carry most of the fight.</p><p>That has been the -- that has worked to -- that has worked well in Iraq and Syria. Somalia, they are upping the airstrikes. This is where the Trumpian aspect of it I think comes into play even more. They're taking a more aggressive stance with those strikes.</p><p>They also did this in Iraq and Syria, I should note, but that means that you will have an increase in casualties and not just casualties of bad guys, but I think the administration's calculation is look what happened in Iraq and Syria. We have a half million people dead in Syria.</p><p>You have civil war there. In Iraq, tens of thousands killed at a minimum hundreds of thousands wounded, displaced, injured, enslaved, and that was because there was insufficient action taken on the ground by -- there was a U.S. presence, and there were U.S. options at hand.</p><p>So I think what they're trying to do is the anti-ISIS model from Iraq and Syria elsewhere around the world, and that means more airstrikes, and it means that we will have people in harm's way. That's part of this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. They're putting the hammer down for lack of a better phrase. What about, though, because it's the military operation, but that comes out of intelligence gathering. Do you have any sense as a former CIA officer the quality of the intelligence that we're getting in order to execute on some of these missions?</p><p>SEXTON: Well, you need it to be for counter insurgency purposes, which is really what you're dealing with in the context of a place like Somalia, you need it to be granular. You need to know down to the tribe and village level who the players are, good and bad, and that means that on-the-ground allies are absolutely essential, which brings me back to what the template is now.</p><p>Look, we did go back in Iraq. We did go back in Afghanistan. For bush and Obama's terms in office. Obama pulled down in Iraq, but actually surged in Afghanistan. I think there's a recognition that it's not ever going to be possible for us to build a country and want it more than the people who live in the country.</p><p>We can't want it more than they do. So that's why using the forces on the ground in the case of Somalia, in Niger we're working very closely. They had mentioned the raid, the very important raid where we lost some U.S. Special Forces personnel killed, but they're working with indigenous forces there too.</p><p>We're using force multiplies air cover and our specialized operators and in some places --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But ultimately, we see as a nation and this sounds very simplistic. These terrorist-affiliated groups in these African countries is a threat to the United States security. Maybe not here at home, but overseas, that's a question rather than a statement.</p><p>SEXTON: Well, you look at a group like Al-Shabaab.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>SEXTON: And you look at Boko Haram in Nigeria, for example. These are two ISIS-affiliated groups same ideology as Al-Qaeda. People get a little too into sometimes. I think the separations between these groups, they change, they're all working for the same thing, which is a global caliphate and a global jihad, but they have engaged in cross-border attacks.</p><p>Al-Shabaab has gone into Kenya and been responsible for mass casualty incidents there. So we know that that's already on offering for them. That's something that they're trying to do and I believe that one of the problems we've seen is that with, for example, the Obama Administration, Iraq and Syria, they took a hands-off approach.</p><p>They allowed the failed state to become the launch pad for jihadism, and then it was our problem anyway. So Trump's team is looking at this problem set. And look, it's very, very complicated and nobody can fix this easily and no one has all the answers.</p><p>But losing the problem set of what's going on with jihadist in sub-Saharan Africa saying more now even airstrikes that involve more casualties which is on only people need to be aware. That will happen if you're taking a harder line.</p><p>That prevents us from dealing with, OK, now there's a civil war in Somalia, which has been happening over the course of recent decades, but now there's a complete implosion and hundreds of thousands of people killed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Buck Sexton, great to see you.</p><p>SEXTON: Good to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>SEXTON: Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Eat well. Eat a lot.</p><p>SEXTON: That, I can promise.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but you can teach him new exercises. We'll tell you about a police dog who's trying to work off that holiday food in a \"TOPICAL STORM\", next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is keeping with a family tradition and spending the holiday weekend in Palm Beach, Florida. And President Clinton is keeping with family tradition and spending it at Hooters. Pass the blue cheese dressing. This is \"TOPICAL STORM\".</p><p>Topic number one. We don't normally cover serious topics in this segment, but we begin tonight with a police exercise that's so intense, they had to bring in the canine unit.</p><p>Any dog can give you a paw, but it takes a serious shepherd to drop and give you 20, and that's exactly what Nitro learned to do after gulf shores police taught him how to do push-ups or is it the other way around?</p><p>Nitro looks like he has better technique than that guy on the right. Over 1 million people have watched this video, but unfortunately, the news is not all good for Nitro. Earlier today, he was suspended from the police force after he got caught making deals under the table.</p><p>Topic number two. The legendary rap group Wu-Tang Clan is reportedly suing the dog-walking company for copyright infringement and they could be headed to the 36 Chambers of court because the lawsuit demands an undisclosed amount of cream.</p><p>By the way, these are Wu-Tang songs that I'm mentioning, which I only point out to you because the producer's just pointing them out to me.</p><p>Anyway the dog walking company is called the Woof-Tang Clan and aside from having a hilarious name, they also claimed to have the full hip-hop treatment for your dog, which means the dog's getting walked to a pot dealer and barking at female dogs.</p><p>Topic number three. Let's head on down to Florida where the holiday traffic is so bad that everybody is trying to use the HOV lane, including airplanes. A police dash cam captured footage of a pilot trying to fly on the (INAUDIBLE) roads after his engine failed on his plane.</p><p>Look out. Amazingly, nobody was hurt during the fiery crash, but Florida police say that passengers are still expected to suffer from the plane. They're all Miami Dolphins fans. You want to talk about crashes.</p><p>Topic number four. Up until now, if you drank whiskey out of a Capri Sun, you were either a raging alcoholic or a young actor hanging out with some questionable people in Hollywood, but all of that is about to change because a British company started a subscription service that brings you whiskey in a pouch for $7 a month.</p><p>These are real neat looking, but I just like to point out that Kennedy staff only picked this story about whiskey delivery because they heard my accent and, of course, just assumed that I come from a family of bootleggers, which is very presumptuous and, well, true.</p><p>But we didn't bring booze in a pouch, we brought it in a mason jar. Pouches were reserved for fish hooks, live bait, and chewing tobacco because I'm a lady.</p><p>Topic number five. This Monday is the online mega sale known as cyber Monday for those of you not familiar. Cyber Monday is like Black Friday for people who don't like being trampled in a store. Spain has the Running of the Bulls.</p><p>We have the running of the flat screens, but if you prefer Spain, you're in luck because international travel deals are expected to be one of the top- selling items on Cyber Monday.</p><p>Apparently, there's something about spending Thanksgiving weekend with your family that makes people want to leave the country. Discount packages are also available for nearly every domestic resort as well.</p><p>In fact, the only destination that's fully booked these days is Hollywood sex rehab. Coming up, planning on Russia to get a Christmas tree this holiday weekend? I'll tell you why. You might have to take an extra trip to the ATM on the way. Next</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's just about the time of year when millions of Americans go out to buy Christmas trees, but now the National Christmas Tree Association is claiming that there's a shortage. And they're going to be more expensive this year.</p><p>It kind of reminds me of just how right before the Super Bowl there always seems to be a national shortage of chicken wings and prices suddenly skyrocket at the supermarket.</p><p>Well, the Christmas tree folks claim it's because of droughts and wildfires, but here's an idea from a southern person. If you don't feel like shelling out more money for a dubious shortage, you can always do the next best thing. Buy a saw, go cut one down in your neighbor's yard and run.</p><p>Thanks for watching the show tonight. You can follow us on Twitter and Instagram @kennedynation.

Bruce Reese, the former head of Hubbard Radio and Bonneville International.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Bruce was a wonderful family man, an inspirational leader and a strong advocate for broadcasters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"He was passionate about this great industry and telling its story of public service.</p><p>\"He was an everyday hero and will be greatly missed.</p><p>\"Please join me in a moment of silence as we remember Bruce.</p><p>\"Now ... let me welcome the broadcasters, content creators, producers, distributors and technology companies from all corners of the globe who have come together to share their own passion for storytelling and to chart a course for a prosperous future.</p><p>\"This week at NAB Show, you will see an astounding array of exhibits that are telling the innovation story of the media and entertainment industry through product displays.</p><p>\"We're featuring the next generation of technologies, like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, next-gen wireless, e-sports and connected cars.</p><p>\"There is a saying that goes, \"Everybody has a story to tell.\"</p><p>\"My own NAB Show story began a decade ago - almost to this day, in fact - when I spoke at my first show as the new president and CEO.</p><p>\"On that morning, I shared the story of broadcasters' unrelenting commitment to always be there for their communities...to inform them...and to help them.</p><p>\"It is a deep-rooted commitment that manifests itself in many ways that often go unnoticed - in ways that have become ingrained in everyday life for millions of Americans.</p><p>\"Our communities turn on the radio to find out what the weather is like before heading to work...to learn how to help their neighbors in need...or to listen to the great personalities who seem like old friends.</p><p>\"They turn on their televisions to watch their favorite local news anchor and to get an unbiased report of what is happening in their communities.</p><p>\"And, they turn to their local broadcasters for a lifeline during emergencies.</p><p>\"This vital lifeline is the electronic thread that keeps every community together, informed and safe.</p><p>\"To me, the story of broadcasters is a story of everyday heroes.</p><p>\"What you do day in and day out can be taken for granted as your daily acts of service are sewn into the fabric of American life.</p><p>\"But make no mistake, what you do is vital - you are indispensable and irreplaceable.</p><p>\"I am reminded of something Oregon's 30th Governor and one of its best, Tom McCall once said about the definition of a hero.</p><p>\"He said, \"Heroes are not giant statues framed against a red sky. They are people who say: This is my community, and it is my responsibility to make it better.\"</p><p>\"An interesting note about Governor McCall - he was also a journalist and came to the public's attention when he served as a commentator on Portland's KGW-TV.</p><p>\"As a broadcaster, you strive to make your communities better expecting little in return.</p><p>\"And in this digital age, when people can access virtually anything from virtually anywhere from millions of sources of information, broadcasters' role in every community has become even more critical as people search for a trusted and reliable news source.</p><p>\"In the past, communities could also rely on their local newspapers...but the industry has been undermined by the rise of the internet and social media companies.</p><p>\"Now some of these companies and our competitors are complaining that there's not enough local news to feed their own news streams.</p><p>\"This irony is not lost on me.</p><p>\"Yet, I doubt that they will ever be able to replicate the local content that broadcasters provide to our communities.</p><p>\"They will never have local broadcasters' commitment to the investigative journalism that exposes government corruption and other abuses of power.</p><p>\"And, they will never have what broadcasters have that make us so different from our competitors - our connection to local communities.</p><p>\"That is why local radio and television stations are more relevant, more vital and more trusted than ever before.</p><p>\"And that is why the story of broadcasters' everyday heroism that I shared 10 years ago rings even truer today.</p><p>\"As your advocates in our nation's capital, NAB is ensuring that policymakers and the rest of America truly understand the many ways you give back...and your desire to always be there for your communities is what fuels you to constantly innovate.</p><p>\"Indeed, here at the show, the story of broadcasting - and where it fits in a rapidly evolving media and entertainment landscape - is on full display, and it is a story rich in innovation, inspiration and imagination.</p><p>\"One story we're excited to tell is about Next Generation Television, also known as ATSC 3.0. With Next Gen TV, we see the convergence of over the air and over the top, resulting in an enhanced viewing experience.</p><p>\"This enables TV stations to deliver their programming over the air not only to new TVs, but also to next-gen enabled tablets and cell phones without using your cellular network.</p><p>\"So, you can watch your shows and local news on the go without using all of your data.</p><p>\"The benefits of Next Gen TV include 4K ultra-high definition video, immersive, theater-like sound, interactive applications and mobility.</p><p>\"The Next Gen TV attachment with this phone lets me watch my favorite stations anywhere I am.</p><p>\"With this device, I am connected to a lifeline that can warn me of an impending storm and alert me to other emergencies with targeted public warnings that are interactive and mobile.</p><p>\"And, the best place to see what's possible with Next Gen TV is right here at NAB Show.</p><p>\"And while this attachment is great, what we would really love to see is a chip built into mobile devices to give consumers this technology.</p><p>\"In fact, we may be on the cusp of a new era of manufacturing that should and could include broadcast reception in devices.</p><p>\"But to date, manufacturers, Apple being one, refuse to enable broadcast chips in their devices.</p><p>\"And it begs the question...why?</p><p>\"As you know, we are embarking on a new election season. And, while I don't often agree with Senator Elizabeth Warren, I was intrigued by her recent comments about the big tech companies.</p><p>\"She said, \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p>\"I wonder if this growing tech power is one of the reasons why this consumer benefit is being held back by the manufacturers.</p><p>\"Given the threat to local journalism that is posed by these tech companies, lawmakers can enable broadcasters to better compete and to support journalism in this new landscape in two ways:</p><p>\"First, modernize outdated broadcast regulations to allow us to compete on a level playing field with these behemoth tech and pay-TV companies to better ensure that broadcast journalism can flourish.</p><p>\"And second, increase regulation on the tech industry to ensure that these companies cannot use their market power to stifle competition and the financial viability of local news.</p><p>\"While we grapple with these rapidly evolving changes in media, we remain energized by the innovations shaping radio's future.</p><p>\"NAB is actively working with automakers and internet service providers from around the globe to develop the next generation of radio that combines broadcasting with internet connectivity to create new user experiences in the connected car and beyond.</p><p>\"You can see some of this innovation with our In Vehicle Experience exhibit in the North Hall.</p><p>\"As broadcasters move to unleash this next generation of free broadcast radio and TV service, we will continue to work with the government to ensure as much flexibility as possible to allow stations to provide the very best services for their listeners and viewers.</p><p>\"Winning our legislative and regulatory battles on Capitol Hill and at the Federal Communications Commission ensures broadcasters will be able to capitalize on these innovations.</p><p>\"Back in Washington, D.C., your NAB advocacy team is focused every day on the issues that matter most to your business.</p><p>\"And working alongside the NAB Leadership Foundation, we are committed to ensuring that the broadcasting industry reflects the rich diversity of America and gives a voice to the distinct communities we serve.</p><p>\"With our headquarters moving just minutes away from Capitol Hill later this year, we will continue to send a strong message to policymakers that broadcasting's future is bright, and we will keep fighting for policies that make our businesses and our communities stronger.</p><p>\"That fight includes urging legislators to oppose the reauthorization of narrow satellite legislation that prevents many viewers from receiving their local TV channels ... preventing a performance tax that would cripple local radio stations ... fighting pay-TV companies' attempts to dismantle the retransmission consent process ... and ensuring fair streaming rates that make simulcasting viable for local stations.</p><p>\"And, as nearly 1,000 television stations move to new frequencies through 2020 to make room for wireless services, we will continue to work with the FCC and Congress to ensure that Americans' access to their local TV and radio stations will not be threatened.</p><p>\"Broadcasters are willing to fight to continue bringing the most trusted local news, lifesaving information and the best entertainment to their listeners and viewers.</p><p>\"These broadcasters are the heroes of everyday life.</p><p>\"In many cities, monuments have been built to honor and remember the heroes of our times.</p><p>\"Over the years, they gather dust, fade in color and are forgotten by most, except perhaps by pigeons who use them to perch.</p><p>\"I believe the greatest monuments we can make is in the hearts of the people of our local communities through the service we provide as broadcasters.</p><p>\"In his farewell address to the Oregon legislature, Governor McCall said, \"May we forever prove (by our action) that people can join together for mutual benefit and greater good.\"</p><p>\"It is my hope that the actions we take in our nation's capital and working together as a unified voice result in broadcasters' ability to continue serving our communities for generations to come.</p><p>\"Thank you for all that you do to make our communities safer and more informed - thank you for being everyday heroes.\"</p><p>About NAB Show</p><p>NAB Show, held April 6 - 11, 2019, in Las Vegas, NV, USA, is the world's largest and most comprehensive convention encompassing the convergence of media, entertainment and technology.

They are people who say: This is my community, and it is my responsibility to make it better.\"</p><p>An interesting note about Governor McCall - he was also a journalist and came to the public's attention when he served as a commentator on Portland's KGW-TV.</p><p>As a broadcaster, you strive to make your communities better expecting little in return.</p><p>And in this digital age, when people can access virtually anything from virtually anywhere from millions of sources of information, broadcasters' role in every community has become even more critical as people search for a trusted and reliable news source.</p><p>In the past, communities could also rely on their local newspapersbut the industry has been undermined by the rise of the internet and social media companies.</p><p>Now some of these companies and our competitors are complaining that there's not enough local news to feed their own news streams.</p><p>This irony is not lost on me.</p><p>Yet, I doubt that they will ever be able to replicate the local content that broadcasters provide to our communities.</p><p>They will never have local broadcasters' commitment to the investigative journalism that exposes government corruption and other abuses of power.</p><p>And, they will never have what broadcasters have that make us so different from our competitors - our connection to local communities.</p><p>That is why local radio and television stations are more relevant, more vital and more trusted than ever before.</p><p>And that is why the story of broadcasters' everyday heroism that I shared 10 years ago rings even truer today.</p><p>As your advocates in our nation's capital, NAB is ensuring that policymakers and the rest of America truly understand the many ways you give backand your desire to always be there for your communities is what fuels you to constantly innovate.</p><p>Indeed, here at the show, the story of broadcasting - and where it fits in a rapidly evolving media and entertainment landscape - is on full display, and it is a story rich in innovation, inspiration and imagination.</p><p>One story we're excited to tell is about Next Generation Television, also known as ATSC 3.0. With Next Gen TV, we see the convergence of over the air and over the top, resulting in an enhanced viewing experience.</p><p>This enables TV stations to deliver their programming over the air not only to new TVs, but also to next-gen enabled tablets and cell phones without using your cellular network.</p><p>So, you can watch your shows and local news on the go without using all of your data.</p><p>The benefits of Next Gen TV include 4K ultra-high definition video, immersive, theater-like sound, interactive applications and mobility.</p><p>The Next Gen TV attachment with this phone lets me watch my favorite stations anywhere I am.</p><p>With this device, I am connected to a lifeline that can warn me of an impending storm and alert me to other emergencies with targeted public warnings that are interactive and mobile.</p><p>And, the best place to see what's possible with Next Gen TV is right here at NAB Show.</p><p>And while this attachment is great, what we would really love to see is a chip built into mobile devices to give consumers this technology.</p><p>In fact, we may be on the cusp of a new era of manufacturing that should and could include broadcast reception in devices.</p><p>But to date, manufacturers, Apple being one, refuse to enable broadcast chips in their devices.</p><p>And it begs the questionwhy?</p><p>As you know, we are embarking on a new election season. And, while I don't often agree with Senator Elizabeth Warren, I was intrigued by her recent comments about the big tech companies.</p><p>She said, \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p>I wonder if this growing tech power is one of the reasons why this consumer benefit is being held back by the manufacturers.</p><p>Given the threat to local journalism that is posed by these tech companies, lawmakers can enable broadcasters to better compete and to support journalism in this new landscape in two ways:</p><p>First, modernize outdated broadcast regulations to allow us to compete on a level playing field with these behemoth tech and pay-TV companies to better ensure that broadcast journalism can flourish.</p><p>And second, increase regulation on the tech industry to ensure that these companies cannot use their market power to stifle competition and the financial viability of local news.</p><p>While we grapple with these rapidly evolving changes in media, we remain energized by the innovations shaping radio's future.</p><p>NAB is actively working with automakers and internet service providers from around the globe to develop the next generation of radio that combines broadcasting with internet connectivity to create new user experiences in the connected car and beyond.</p><p>You can see some of this innovation with our In Vehicle Experience exhibit in the North Hall.</p><p>As broadcasters move to unleash this next generation of free broadcast radio and TV service, we will continue to work with the government to ensure as much flexibility as possible to allow stations to provide the very best services for their listeners and viewers.</p><p>Winning our legislative and regulatory battles on Capitol Hill and at the Federal Communications Commission ensures broadcasters will be able to capitalize on these innovations.</p><p>Back in Washington, D.C., your NAB advocacy team is focused every day on the issues that matter most to your business.</p><p>And working alongside the NAB Leadership Foundation, we are committed to ensuring that the broadcasting industry reflects the rich diversity of America and gives a voice to the distinct communities we serve.</p><p>With our headquarters moving just minutes away from Capitol Hill later this year, we will continue to send a strong message to policymakers that broadcasting's future is bright, and we will keep fighting for policies that make our businesses and our communities stronger.</p><p>That fight includes urging legislators to oppose the reauthorization of narrow satellite legislation that prevents many viewers from receiving their local TV channels  preventing a performance tax that would cripple local radio stations  fighting pay-TV companies' attempts to dismantle the retransmission consent process  and ensuring fair streaming rates that make simulcasting viable for local stations.</p><p>And, as nearly 1,000 television stations move to new frequencies through 2020 to make room for wireless services, we will continue to work with the FCC and Congress to ensure that Americans' access to their local TV and radio stations will not be threatened.</p><p>Broadcasters are willing to fight to continue bringing the most trusted local news, lifesaving information and the best entertainment to their listeners and viewers.</p><p>These broadcasters are the heroes of everyday life.</p><p>In many cities, monuments have been built to honor and remember the heroes of our times.</p><p>Over the years, they gather dust, fade in color and are forgotten by most, except perhaps by pigeons who use them to perch.</p><p>I believe the greatest monuments we can make is in the hearts of the people of our local communities through the service we provide as broadcasters.</p><p>In his farewell address to the Oregon legislature, Governor McCall said, \"May we forever prove (by our action) that people can join together for mutual benefit and greater good.\"</p><p>It is my hope that the actions we take in our nation's capital and working together as a unified voice result in broadcasters' ability to continue serving our communities for generations to come.</p><p>Thank you for all that you do to make our communities safer and more informed - thank you for being everyday heroes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BCTCST-0047099260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BCTCST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVB-N1N1-JB5M-W148-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365240</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1754\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Broadcast &amp;

I appreciate this opportunity to talk about broadcasters\u2019 vital role in protecting the First Amendment and serving America\u2019s local communities.</p><p>Just a few days ago, Americans celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.</p><p>On that unforgettable day, an estimated 650 million people around the world tuned into their televisions as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. Families and friends took a collective breath as they listened to Armstrong utter these memorable words, \u201cThat\u2019s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d</p><p>One-fifth of the world\u2019s population watched the live televised image of the moon landing that day, with millions of others also listening to the event on their radios.</p><p>As we reflect upon this special anniversary, I and we are reminded of how broadcasters are always there to capture the most indelible moments in history. Broadcasters have the unique ability to bring us together as a nation like no other medium can.</p><p>The world has changed dramatically in the five decades since the Apollo 11 moon landing. Indeed, the media landscape seems to have changed in the blink of an eye, and continues to rapidly progress.</p><p>Today, in addition to local radio and television stations, there are a multitude of sources of information and content, giving consumers an overwhelming number of options and creating greater competition.</p><p>Ten years ago, there were nearly 240 million websites. Today, there are more than 1.6 billion.</p><p>The rise of social media has presented another platform for people to connect with each other, share and gain information and express opinions. 500 million Tweets are sent a day and 1.56 billion people a day log onto Facebook.</p><p>And though the number of people who are using social media as a source for news is growing, sorting fact from fiction has become more challenging on these platforms.</p><p>In my two decades as a public servant and now more than a decade as a broadcaster, I have witnessed the growing influence of social media and wonder if it\u2019s no coincidence that we have also seen the rise of divisive politics. In my last Senate campaign, in 2008, the glue of civility seemed to come apart in our civic discourse and a decade later, it has only gotten worse.</p><p>Though the rise of social media can be seen as democratizing, giving a greater number of people the opportunity to express their thoughts and opinions in an open forum, I believe it has also been a destabilizing force that has impacted our society in troubling ways. The paradox of social media \u2013 democratizing, yet destabilizing. Again, I am a witness\u2026</p><p>There doesn\u2019t seem to be an appetite for civil discourse on these platforms. Rather, one can more easily find heated debates fueled by name calling\u2026or rumors and gossip that try to pass as journalistic news, and, unfortunately, sometimes succeed.</p><p>And what you find on pay TV can also be unsettling\u2026 there the so-called news is fraught with partisan bickering, where the end-goal seems to be having the last word.</p><p>Sadly, we have become a more fragmented society where the winners and losers are quickly identified minute-by-minute on social media and where the truth and thoughtful debate are suppressed by the proliferation of fake news and false accounts.</p><p>Not surprisingly, a recent Ballast Research survey revealed that only two percent of policymakers believe social media is committed to hard facts\u2026and 90 percent believe that social media is part of the so called \u201cfake news\u201d problem.</p><p>It is a challenging time in the news industry where our citizens are overwhelmed by so much information and confused about finding the truth. That is why I believe broadcast radio and television are more important today than they have ever been.</p><p>Broadcasters give our communities coherence \u2013 survey after survey show that people trust their local stations that deliver the news accurately and without bias.</p><p>Local stations\u2019 investigations protect consumers from scams and their reporting of local elections help voters make informed decisions.</p><p>Broadcast networks provide high-quality and hard-hitting investigative stories and thoughtful public affairs programming such as \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and \u201cThis Week,\u201d and presidential debates, that keep citizens informed and hold elected officials accountable for their actions.</p><p>It\u2019s unfortunate that at a time when this trusted information is so critical to our communities, some of our pay-TV partners, like AT&amp;T and DISH, seem to be purposefully withholding broadcast signals from viewers \u2013 making them pawns in a political game that aims to upend the retransmission consent system.</p><p>Is their goal to manufacture the appearance of a \u201cbroken system\u201d to encourage Congress to intervene just as it deliberates the upcoming STELAR expiration? If so, that is a dangerous game and one that hurts viewers \u2013 their customers \u2013 the most.</p><p>But, sadly, it\u2019s not all that surprising. After all, AT&amp;T and DISH are the same companies that have been responsible for more than four out of five retransmission consent disruptions industry-wide over the past eight years.</p><p>AT&amp;T is the same company that is currently making decisions to withhold its content from viewers on competing platforms in the immediate aftermath of a merger where they committed just the opposite to regulators.</p><p>It is the same company asking for exorbitant fees for their own content offerings, while refusing to fairly compensate broadcasters\u2019 highest-rated programming.</p><p>And finally, AT&amp;T is the same 300 billion dollar company that for years has chosen to exploit STELAR\u2019s distant signal license rather than invest in the communities they serve by failing to offer those subscribers their local broadcast stations.</p><p>For example, how does seeing the weather forecast from New York City help the viewer in Bowling Green, Kentucky, when a life-threatening storm is on its way to their town? It\u2019s time to let STELAR expire. Let\u2019s stop subsidizing billion-dollar companies, like AT&amp;T, and instead ensure all Americans have access to the most accurate and timely source of news, sporting events, weather and emergency information \u2013 their local TV broadcasters.</p><p>The simple fact is, the retransmission consent process is a free-market system that works. Ninety-nine percent of all deals get done without interruption. And, my guess is that 100 percent would get reached if pay-TV companies do not purposefully try to create a problem simply so Congress attempts to \u201cfix\u201d it to their benefit.</p><p>If not for the compensation broadcasters receive for their highly-valued programming \u2013 programming that AT&amp;T, DISH and others re-sell to customers \u2013 broadcasters would be unable to support investigative journalism and expensive sports coverage and invest in sophisticated weather operations that save lives and provide in-depth local news coverage.</p><p>It is our hope that policymakers will remember that, while our over-the-air programming is free to the viewer, our content is expensive. It is all paid for from two sources \u2013 advertising and retransmission consent.</p><p>Even in today\u2019s hyper-competitive media environment, broadcast programming remains the most watched. Last year, 95 of the 100 most watched shows aired on broadcast television. And while no one denies that retransmission consent fees have increased, broadcast stations still remain under-compensated relative to the viewership of their video competitors.</p><p>AT&amp;T collects 6 billion dollars annually in affiliate fees from its own Warner Media cable properties like TNT, TBS, CNN and Cartoon Network. And yet, these cable networks\u2019 ratings pale in comparison to the ratings of local broadcast affiliates. Last year, the typical Big Four TV broadcast affiliate delivered on average nearly four times more viewers every night than even the most-watched Warner Media channel.</p><p>Beyond the highest-rated entertainment programming, broadcasters are carrying the mantle of investigative journalism at a time when local newspapers are closing up shop and unreliable information is free flowing on social media. Broadcasters continue to be a beacon of our First Amendment, and retransmission consent revenue enables broadcasters to protect these precious rights.</p><p>CBS anchor Walter Cronkite once said, \u201cFreedom of the press is not just important to democracy, it is democracy.\u201d</p><p>Our steadfast belief in this inspires us to join our friends at the Media Institute in fiercely defending our First Amendment rights, and relentlessly pursuing and reporting the facts without fear or favor.</p><p>No other media industry \u2013 not social media or the big technology companies \u2013 will ever have local broadcasters\u2019 commitment to the investigative journalism that exposes government corruption and other abuses of power.</p><p>And, no other media industry will ever match broadcasters\u2019 commitment to providing a lifeline when disaster strikes.</p><p>None of our competitors will ever have what broadcasters have that make us so unique \u2013 our connection to local communities.</p><p>As broadcasters\u2019 advocates in our nation\u2019s capital, NAB is ensuring that policymakers and the rest of America truly understand the many ways local stations give back\u2026and our desire to always be there for our communities is what inspires us to constantly innovate.</p><p>The development of new technologies means more platforms for broadcast journalists to deliver the stories our communities rely on every day for free.</p><p>We are excited about Next Generation Television, also known as ATSC 3.0, and the convergence of over-the-air and over-the-top, resulting in an enhanced viewing experience.</p><p>We\u2019re also actively working with automakers and internet service providers from around the globe to develop the next generation of radio, which combines broadcasting with internet connectivity to create new user experiences in the connected car.</p><p>Winning our legislative and regulatory battles on Capitol Hill and at the Federal Communications Commission ensures broadcasters will be able to capitalize on future innovations and continue to flourish for generations to come.</p><p>And, in order for broadcasters to provide new technologies to better serve our communities, we also need to be competitive with tech companies and the media and telecommunications industries. This means broadcasters need the freedom to quickly develop new products and services without unnecessary regulations.</p><p>Lawmakers can enable broadcasters to better compete and to support journalism in this challenging landscape by modernizing outdated broadcast regulations that prevent us from competing on a level playing field with these behemoth tech and pay-TV companies.</p><p>This is essential to ensuring broadcast journalism thrives at a time when communities need it most.</p><p>I am reminded of what Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in his 1919 dissent in the Supreme Court case Abrams vs. United States, \u201c\u2026the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas \u2013 that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market\u2026\u201d</p><p>I believe there is an antidote to this age of so-called fake news: More truthful journalism, which broadcasters can provide\u2026and making it available on every device.</p><p>Broadcasters are making great strides in this effort.</p><p>And, though we grapple with the challenges to investigative and truthful journalism posed by social media and big tech companies, we remain energized by the innovations shaping the future of broadcast. We will continue to work to ensure both radio and TV are available wherever listeners and viewers are.</p><p>In another 50 years, broadcasting will continue to evolve, but there are some things technology will never change.</p><p>Our communities will always turn to their local TV and radio stations to follow the inspiring events that have shaped our nation.</p><p>They will always count on us to be their eyes and ears\u2026 to guide them to safety during times of crisis\u2026 to share life\u2019s greatest moments\u2026 and to connect to families, friends and neighbors.</p><p>They will always count on us to be the megaphones for freedom and democracy.</p><p>And, broadcasters will always be there for our communities, whenever and however they need us most.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2226357I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-6C31-JDG9-Y488-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2066\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
