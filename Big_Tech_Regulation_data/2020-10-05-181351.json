Next Inning editor Paul McWilliams was a tech industry executive for more than two decades. Not only does he know how things work from the inside and how to spot a winning business model, he also has a long and successful record of picking winning stocks. Year to date in 2012 these picks have driven a 23% gain for the Next Inning Model Portfolio. Since its inception in 2002, the model portfolio is up over 300%.</p><p>McWilliams' latest reports have the tech world buzzing. Earlier this week, he covered Apple suppliers most likely to leverage the tech giant's huge success, while warning investors about selected companies that may not always be able to count on Apple's business. Now, he'sout with a new report covering a massive, potentially paradigm-shifting project by Googlethat will see the search giant roll out ultra-fast internet service, making winners out of select suppliers and posing a big threat to incumbent firms. These reports are essential reading, unavailable except via free trial subscription to Next Inning.</p><p>To get ahead of the Wall Street curve, you are invited to take a free, 21-day, no obligation trial with Next Inning.

Googleclaims consumers will pay only about what they do now for its new1Gbs service that runs about 100 times faster than a typical cable broadband connection. According to Google, it has completed its studies and will begin rolling out services during 2012.

Next Inning editor Paul McWilliams was a tech industry executive for more than two decades. Not only does he know how things work from the inside and how to spot a winning business model, he also has a long and successful record of picking winning stocks. Year to date in 2012 these picks have driven a 23% gain for the Next Inning Model Portfolio. Since its inception in 2002, the model portfolio is up over 300%.</p><p>McWilliams' latest reports have the tech world buzzing. Earlier this week, he covered Apple suppliers most likely to leverage the tech giant's huge success, while warning investors about selected companies that may not always be able to count on Apple's business. Now, he's out with a new report covering a massive, potentially paradigm-shifting project by Googlethat will see the search giant roll out ultra-fast internet service, making winners out of select suppliers and posing a big threat to incumbent firms. These reports are essential reading, unavailable except via free trial subscription to Next Inning.</p><p>To get ahead of the Wall Street curve, you are invited to take a free, 21-day, no obligation trial with Next Inning.

Googleclaims consumers will pay only about what they do now for its new 1Gbs service that runs about 100 times faster than a typical cable broadband connection. According to Google, it has completed its studies and will begin rolling out services during 2012. However, given its recent filings with the FCC, it appears that is only a part of Google's strategy, possibly a very small part.</p><p>-- What request did Googlefile with the FCC and why does it suggest that Googlemay be in the process of adopting a brand new business it can leverage with its current ecosystem business model?</p><p>-- How might Cisco, Harmonic, Corning, and Finisar participate in Google's new strategy? What other companies might expect to see an upside as Googlepursues its plans?</p><p>-- How will Google's new ventures threaten incumbent video service providers like Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon and Dish Network? Could Google's new strategy pose new competitive threats for Apple's business model?</p><p>-- How has Googleuniquely managed local political and regulatory issues that commonly plague service providers? Will this strategy continue to work if Googlerolls out services to new markets?</p><p>Founded in September 2002, Next Inning's model portfolio has returned 302% since its inception versus 48% for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>About Next Inning:</p><p>Next Inning is a subscription-based investment newsletter that provides regular coverage on more than 150 technology and semiconductor stocks.

Next Inning editor Paul McWilliams was a tech industry executive for more than two decades. Not only does he know how things work from the inside and how to spot a winning business model, he also has a long and successful record of picking winning stocks. Year to date in 2012 these picks have driven a 23% gain for the Next Inning Model Portfolio. Since its inception in 2002, the model portfolio is up over 300%.</p><p>McWilliams' latest reports have the tech world buzzing. Earlier this week, he covered Apple suppliers most likely to leverage the tech giant's huge success, while warning investors about selected companies that may not always be able to count on Apple's business. Now, he'sout with a new report covering a massive, potentially paradigm-shifting project by Googlethat will see the search giant roll out ultra-fast internet service, making winners out of select suppliers and posing a big threat to incumbent firms. These reports are essential reading, unavailable except via free trial subscription to Next Inning.</p><p>To get ahead of the Wall Street curve, you are invited to take a free, 21-day, no obligation trial with Next Inning.</p><p>McWilliams covers these topics and more in his recent reports:</p><p>- Last year Googleannounced its selection of a large city in the Midwest for the roll-out of its super-fast fiber optics network. Googleclaims consumers will pay only about what they do now for its new 1Gbs service that runs about 100 times faster than a typical cable broadband connection. According to Google, it has completed its studiesand will begin rolling out services during 2012. However, given its recent filings with the FCC, it appears that is only a part of Google's strategy, possibly a very small part.</p><p>- What request did Googlefile with the FCC and why does it suggest that Googlemay be in the process of adopting a brand new business it can leverage with its current ecosystem business model?</p><p>- How might Cisco, Harmonic, Corning, and Finisar participate in Google's new strategy? What other companies might expect to see an upside as Googlepursues its plans?</p><p>- How will Google's new ventures threaten incumbent video service providers like Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon and Dish Network? Could Google's new strategy pose new competitive threats for Apple's business model?</p><p>- How has Googleuniquely managed local political and regulatory issues that commonly plague service providers?

Next Inning editor Paul McWilliams was a tech industry executive for more than two decades. Not only does he know how things work from the inside and how to spot a winning business model, he also has a long and successful record of picking winning stocks. Year to date in 2012 these picks have driven a 23% gain for the Next Inning Model Portfolio. Since its inception in 2002, the model portfolio is up over 300%.</p><p>McWilliams' latest reports have the tech world buzzing. Earlier this week, he covered Apple suppliers most likely to leverage the tech giant's huge success, while warning investors about selected companies that may not always be able to count on Apple's business. Now, he'sout with a new report covering a massive, potentially paradigm-shifting project by Googlethat will see the search giant roll out ultra-fast internet service, making winners out of select suppliers and posing a big threat to incumbent firms. These reports are essential reading, unavailable except via free trial subscription to Next Inning.</p><p>To get ahead of the Wall Street curve, you are invited to take a free, 21-day, no obligation trial with Next Inning.</p><p>McWilliams covers these topics and more in his recent reports:</p><p>- Last year Googleannounced its selection of a large city in the Midwest for the roll-out of its super-fast fiber optics network. Googleclaims consumers will pay only about what they do now for its new 1Gbs service that runs about 100 times faster than a typical cable broadband connection. According to Google, it has completed its studiesand will begin rolling out services during 2012. However, given its recent filings with the FCC, it appears that is only a part of Google's strategy, possibly a very small part.</p><p>- What request did Googlefile with the FCC and why does it suggest that Googlemay be in the process of adopting a brand new business it can leverage with its current ecosystem business model?</p><p>- How might Cisco, Harmonic, Corning, and</p><p>Finisar participate in Google's new strategy? What other companiesmight expect to see an upside as Googlepursues its plans?</p><p>- How will Google's new ventures threaten incumbent video service providers like Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon and Dish Network? Could Google's new strategy pose new competitive threats for Apple's business model?</p><p>- How has Googleuniquely managed local political and regulatory issues that commonly plague service providers? Will this strategy continue to work if Googlerolls out services to new markets?</p><p>Founded in September 2002, Next Inning's model portfolio has returned 302% since its inception versus 48% for the S&amp;P 500.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 283629671</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:557F-W5B1-JCBJ-K4FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"499\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2012 Information Gatekeepers, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Fiber Optics Weekly Update</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1051-189X</issn><volume>Vol. 32</volume><issueNumber>No. 4</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>January 27, 2012</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001P56</classCode><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001ZF4</classCode><className>DISH NETWORK CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS334210 TELEPHONE APPARATUS MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC3661 TELEPHONE &amp; TELEGRAPH APPARATUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS515210 CABLE &amp; OTHER SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAMMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC4841 CABLE &amp; OTHER PAY TELEVISION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>CSCO (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>DISH (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Comcast Corp.

Next Inning editor Paul McWilliams was a tech industry executive for more than two decades. Not only does he know how things work from the inside and how to spot a winning business model, he also has a long and successful record of picking winning stocks. Year to date in 2012 these picks have driven a 23% gain for the Next Inning Model Portfolio. Since its inception in 2002, the model portfolio is up over 300%.</p><p>McWilliams' latest reports have the tech world buzzing. Earlier this week, he covered Apple suppliers most likely to leverage the tech giant's huge success, while warning investors about selected companies that may not always be able to count on Apple's business. Now, he'sout with a new report covering a massive, potentially paradigm-shifting project by Googlethat will see the search giant roll out ultra-fast internet service, making winners out of select suppliers and posing a big threat to incumbent firms. These reports are essential reading, unavailable except via free trial subscription to Next Inning.</p><p>To get ahead of the Wall Street curve, you are invited to take a free, 21-day, no obligation trial with Next Inning.</p><p>McWilliams covers these topics and more in his recent reports:</p><p>- Last year Googleannounced its selection of a large city in the Midwest for the roll-out of its super-fast fiber optics network. Googleclaims consumers will pay only about what they do now for its new 1Gbs service that runs about 100 times faster than a typical cable broadband connection. According to Google, it has completed its studiesand will begin rolling out services during 2012. However, given its recent filings with the FCC, it appears that is only a part of Google's strategy, possibly a very small part.</p><p>- What request did Googlefile with the FCC and why does it suggest that Googlemay be in the process of adopting a brand new business it can leverage with its current ecosystem business model?</p><p>- How might Cisco, Harmonic, Corning, and Finisar participate in Google's new strategy? What other companies might expect to see an upside as Googlepursues its plans?</p><p>- How will Google's new ventures threaten incumbent video service providers like Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon and Dish Network? Could Google's new strategy pose new competitive threats for Apple's business model?</p><p>- How has Googleuniquely managed local political and regulatory issues that commonly plague service providers? Will this strategy continue to work if Googlerolls out services to new markets?</p><p>Founded in September 2002, Next Inning's model portfolio has returned 302% since its inception versus 48% for the S&amp;P 500.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 284808700</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55B1-HW91-JCBJ-K46F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"500\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2012 Information Gatekeepers, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Gigabit/ATM</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1541-1222</issn><volume>Vol. 23</volume><issueNumber>No. 1</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>January 1, 2012</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Interview</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001P56</classCode><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001ZF4</classCode><className>DISH NETWORK CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS334210 TELEPHONE APPARATUS MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC3661 TELEPHONE &amp; TELEGRAPH APPARATUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS515210 CABLE &amp; OTHER SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAMMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC4841 CABLE &amp; OTHER PAY TELEVISION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>CSCO (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>DISH (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Comcast Corp.

By midday, the company's share price losses had multiplied to more than $40bn, making the day its worst in more than five years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Theresa May's spokesman said she backed an investigation by the information commissioner, which was prompted by a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">whistleblower who told the Observer</url> how Cambridge Analytica had harvested millions of Facebook profiles to influence voters through \"psychographic\" targeting.</p><p>The European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, said on Monday that the institution would investigate fully. Tajani urged the social media company to take more responsibility, saying on Twitter that \"allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens' privacy rights\". </p><p>In the US, a state attorney general has called for investigations, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">greater accountability</url> and regulation, while the head of the parliamentary committee in the UK investigating fake news accused Cambridge Analytica and Facebook of misleading MPs, with the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport warning of an end to the \"wild west\" of technology firms. </p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach</url></p><p>\"The allegations are clearly very concerning. It's essential people can have confidence that their personal data can be protected and used in an appropriate way,\" May's spokesman said. </p><p>\"So it is absolutely right the information commissioner is investigating this matter and we expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all the organisations involved to cooperate fully.\"</p><p>In statement Facebook said: \"We have hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to comply and afford the firm complete access to their servers and systems. We remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information.\"</p><p>Cambridge Analytica said: \"In 2014 we received Facebook data and derivatives of Facebook data from another company, GSR, that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research. After it subsequently became known that GSR had broken its contract with Cambridge Analytica because it had not adhered to data protection regulation, Cambridge Analytica deleted all the Facebook data and derivatives, in cooperation with Facebook.</p><p>The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, told the House of Commons that the revelations were \"clearly very worrying\" and the government was considering additional powers that the commissioner had proposed, including powers to impose further criminal sanctions and to compel testimony from individuals. Hancock said he was shocked at the speed at which Facebook had barred the whistleblower, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">Chris Wylie</url>, from its platforms, including WhatsApp. </p><p>\"I thought it was outrageous,\" he said. \"Facebook have some serious questions to answer here, and they will tell their side of the story. And to answer it by blocking an account, when we know in this house they do not act fast enough to block other accounts of obviously outrageous behaviour, I'll tell you what, it shows that when they need to they can block things incredibly quickly and they will need to do a lot more that.\"</p><p>However, Hancock said he had not seen any evidence that the activities had had an effect on the outcome of any election or referendum. </p><p>Labour's Stephen Kinnock said that if Cambridge Analytica were proved to have been \"in flagrant breach of our electoral rules, that would place a pretty huge question mark over the referendum result\". </p><p>Damian Collins MP, who chairs the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said he would call the heads of both companies, Mark Zuckerberg and Alexander Nix, to give further testimony.</p><p>\"We need to hear from people who can speak about Facebook from a position of authority that requires them to know the truth,\" Collins said. \"Someone has to take responsibility for this. It's time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.\"</p><p>Collins suggested the powers of the information commissioner should be beefed up to add the legal ability to force companies to provide information. </p><p>Downing Street said it would consider any formal requests to give new powers to the commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, but added her powers had only recently been reviewed. </p><p>\"I haven't seen any formal requests. The information commissioner does have significant powers, which have been enhanced in recent times, but if any formal requests were made to us I'm sure we'd consider it,\" the spokesman said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">Hancock told Collins's committee</url> last week that following Brexit he would like to review legislation governing social media.

But in its statement on Friday night, explaining why it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, Facebook said it had known in 2015 that profiles were passed to Nix's company.</p><p>\"In 2015 we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our ' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">platform policies</url> ' by passing data from an app that was using Facebook login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica,\" the statement said.</p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">Facebook and Cambridge Analytica face mounting pressure over data scandal</url></p><p>Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign paid Cambridge Analytica more than $6.2m, according to US federal election commission records but is has denied using any Facebook data in the campaign.</p><p>In a now-deleted series of tweets, Facebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, argued that the friend list data that Cambridge Analytica had acquired was obtained through an API, a feature that allows programs to interface with Facebook, that was well documented \"in our terms of service, platform documentation, the privacy settings and the screen used to login to apps\".</p><p>On Saturday evening, however, he deleted his tweets, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">saying</url> : \"I should have done a better job weighing in.

Whether it's Facebook, Amazon[1], Google, or Ring, none of them seem to really care about our privacy. And that is something that needs to change, and quick. By now, we all know about Facebook and its lack of caring about privacy. </p><p>With the Cambridge Analytica[2] scandal and many other issues it has had since then. But what's new now is Ring[3]. Earlier this month, it was reported that Ring allowed its R...eam in Ukraine to watch clips that were recorded from its cameras in people's homes without their consent. And what made it worse was the fact that these clips were shared unencrypted. Ring was reportedly viewing these clips so that it could build its own recognition software, in an effort to make their products better. As being able to recognize someone that lives there versus someone that doesn't, is a big a deal now. Users don't want to get a notification every time they walk in their front door and their doorbell sees them. The company decided it was going to build its own recognition software, and viewing clips it already had, was the best way to do so. Except it wasn't. It's a blatant invasion of privacy. According to the report out of The Intercept, Ring employees saw everything, including couples making out right in front of the camera, as well as people watching TV. This is because Ring sells a whole lot more than just doorbells, but also cameras to put in and outside your home. Ring did deny these accusations, that it never has and never will provide its employees with this ability to watch its customers without consent. Though, that does contradict some other reports - even before the massive report earlier this month. Don't trust any tech company In 2019, your data is the most valuable thing to basically any company. Google is able to provide a lot of its services for free, or at reduced costs, because it offsets the costs by collecting your data and using that to deliver ads to you. Remember, Google makes nearly 95-percent of its revenue from Ads. And collecting data helps it deliver better ads that are more likely to be clicked, and thus making it more money. The same goes for Facebook[4] actually, and seeing as we share just about everything that is going on in the world on Facebook, it has a ton of information about us already - possibly more than Google does. Facebook is also an ad company, so it is looking to use that data to help sell better ads to you. This is being amplified now with these digital voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant. These assistants are always listening for you to say the magic word. But how do we know that it is only listening for that magic word and not hearing everything else you say in your home? Sure, they all have buttons available to turn off the microphone, but again, how do we know that the microphone is legitimately turned off? It's nothing new, especially when it comes to Amazon Alexa. In fact, recently, Amazon sent thousands of Alexa recordings to the wrong user. That user was able to hear just about everything that the Alexa user was saying, not only to Alexa, but in general. This happened because the user asked for all the data that Amazon had of him - this is part of the rules of GDPR in Europe, companies have to provide that information - and Amazon gave him the wrong information. Many of us put so much trust into these tech companies, thinking that they can do no wrong. And that is our mistake, we as consumers should know better. However, all of the services that these companies offer us, usually for free and ad-supported, are just so good that we are reliant on them. YouTube for example, we all spend hours and hours on YouTube each day. But it's free, because of the ads that are shown on YouTube (there is YouTube Premium, but that is not required). Given recent events, we really need to think about how much trust we put into these companies. With the Internet of Things becoming more mainstream, privacy is being sacrificed To develop a lot of these Internet of Things products, it actually costs a fair bit of money to do so. Not only for the materials involved, but also all of the Research and Development that goes into it. But somehow companies, particularly startups who have virtually no money, are able to keep these products pretty cheap. This is because they are collecting your data to offset the costs. This is particularly true with Amazon Echo and Google Home devices. These devices are already very inexpensive. The Echo Dot and Google Home Mini retail for $50. This is because the two are selling this hardware at cost, or making a tiny bit of profit off of it. This is because the real value is in you using their digital voice assistant. Both companies want you to use that assistant for everything that you do all day long. The data that Amazon and Google collect are used to help improve its products, but to also sell you on things. Google[5] uses it to sell you ads online, seeing as your Google account is used for the Assistant, as well as on your smartphone, laptop and everywhere else. It's easy to show you ads based on what you asked the Google Assistant for. When it comes to Alexa, it doesn't really sell you ads (yet). But Alexa is used as a window into the Amazon store. So if you ask Alexa about a certain thing, you may see it show up under the recommended items on Amazon's site the next time you log in. Ring was not the first, and likely won't be the last Smart Home company to spy on you Ring was the one that got caught. But with all of these companies offering cloud storage for you to save clips recorded from the cameras in and around your home, don't think that Ring was alone here. Though, Ring is under a bigger microscope now than in the past, since Amazon purchased the company last year. And Amazon isn't exactly known for protecting your privacy. In fact, it's quite the opposite. What Ring was doing may have been on the up and up, only using the data to build its recognition software, but this is something that needs to be an opt-in feature. Allowing customers to opt-in to allow Ring to use that data, and perhaps even offering a bonus, like free cloud storage for storing their clips from their cameras. Ring did also make a few mistakes along the way because it wanted to save money. Primarily by sharing the video files among members of its R...eam, as unencrypted files. Data like that should always be encrypted, making it tougher for hackers to get a hold of. There are others out there, like Arlo and Nest, that are likely doing the same thing. Since developing your own recognition software isn't easy. So if you're thinking of avoiding Ring now, since they \"spy on users\", you should be avoiding every company that makes security cameras for your home. Particularly WiFi-enabled ones. This is the chance we take when we go all in with the smart home. There is the fear that these products can be hacked - as we saw recently with some Nest Cams that told people North Korea had launched missiles, even though it was untrue. But what could be even worse, is people being able to see everything you do in your home. So before you decide to get a security camera to put in your home, you're going to want to do some research, and outside is going to be better than inside. Wrap Up Living in 2019 means giving up our privacy, at least until the government buts in and adds some regulation for these companies. Facebook, surprisingly, is asking for regulation on itself, after the pretty terrible year it had in 2018. But across all of tech, there needs to be some regulation. Users should be able to put security cameras in their home to protect their home, without worrying about other people watching everything they do in their home. The Internet of Things and Smart Home[6] world can really reduce a lot of issues these days. Like crime and package theft in neighborhoods. But as always, it means that we are sacrificing our privacy. That's something we should not have to sacrifice. But that is the age we live in right now. Unless users want to pay more money for these products, then companies are going to continue to collect data on us and use it for different things. And it's not just in the IoT[7] and Smart Home space. This is happening in the TV space, social media and just about every other space.

And many of them blasting a subpoena of his son, Don Jr. and the Mueller Report. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is at the White House for us. So, Jeremy, the President has a lot on his mind this weekend. Let's start with his comments from the President about Biden and what should happen next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Fredricka. Well, the President and his allies have been pushing these questions of conflict of interest stemming from Joe Biden's role in the Obama administration, focusing on Ukraine policy, at the same time, as his son Hunter Biden was on the Board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And so, now we're seeing the President essentially saying that he is open to the possibility of directing the Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate the Bidens over these questions of conflict of interests.</p><p>And at the same time, we're also seeing the President on Twitter venting his frustrations about investigations circling around him and his own family. The President issuing a string of retweets this morning, 62 in under 40 minutes, talking about a grab bag of red meat issues for his base.</p><p>But one of those issues was the Senate Intelligence Committee subpoena of his son Donald Trump Jr. We know that the President has been unnerved by that, and this morning he took to Twitter to share some of those frustrations in the form of retweets not only about that issue, but also voicing criticism of the Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, who is of course a Republican Senator.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And then, Jeremy, what can you tell us about this report that former White House Counsel Don McGahn refused to publicly state the President did not obstruct justice.</p><p>DIAMOND: Well, our sources are telling us, Fredricka, that the White House Special Counsel Emmet flood, who has been handling essentially the response to the Mueller investigation for the White House, that he reached out to Don McGahn's attorney Bill Burck to ask him if McGahn would put out a statement saying that he did not believe the incidents involving him and the President that are detailed in the Mueller report amounted to obstruction of justice.</p><p>And we're told that McGahn declined to do so, that's despite the fact that McGahn apparently told Mueller and his team in interviews that he didn't believe the incidents involving him amounted to obstruction of justice.</p><p>But again those incidents involving McGahn have been at the heart of questions that Democrats in particular have raised about whether the President committed obstruction of justice. Of course Mr. Mueller did not reach a conclusion on that. He declined to say whether or not these incidences that he described in the report amounted to obstruction of justice.</p><p>But the Attorney General Bill Barr said that he did not believe the Justice Department had enough evidence to prosecute the President on those kinds of charges. Fredricka?</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much. All of that plus President Trump's personal attorney now reversing course. Just hours after Rudy Giuliani said he was going to Ukraine to push for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, he is now saying - Giuliani is saying he's not going to go; Giuliani insinuating that something bad could happen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've decided, Shannon, I'm not going to go to the Ukraine.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST: You're not going to go?</p><p>GIULIANI: I'm not going to go, because I think I'm walking into a group of people that are enemies of the President, in some cases enemies of the United States, and in one case, already a convicted person who has been found to be involved in assisting the Democrats with the 2016 election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: So the news of this cancelled trip came soon after President Trump told Politico that he planned to talk to Giuliani about the trip. All right, let's talk about all this now with Michael Zeldin who also served as Robert Mueller's former Special Assistant at the Department of Justice. He is also a former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst.</p><p>Also joining me, Wes Lowery a national reporter for The Washington Post, and a CNN contributor. Good to see both of you.</p><p>Alright so Wes, let me begin with you this about-face by Rudy Giuliani. At first, he says he's going to Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, and then he says he's not going because he was going to walk into a group of people who are enemies both to the President and the United States.</p><p>So, what can you tell us about what really is at the core of all this?</p><p>WESLEY LOWERY, NATIONAL REPORTER, WASHINGTON POST, AND CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Sure, I mean I think it's pretty remarkable when the reporting initially came out and Ken Vogel at The New York Times has done a ton of really strong reporting leading the way on this, that Rudy Giuliani the attorney for the President of the United States was going to go on this trip, seeking information not only about Hunter Biden and his role on the Board of a Ukrainian gas company, but also about the beginnings of the Mueller investigation - the Russian interference investigation and whether or not Democrats, the DNC, and other people had worked with Ukrainian intelligence on this.</p><p>It didn't really, I think, underscore the extent to which our political moment is one not of shame right, one that's relatively shameless.</p><p>[12:05:00] The idea that someone close to the President of the United States much less his personal attorney would personally lobby - travel across the world to lobby a foreign government to investigate, one, an investigation into the President United States, but two, I mean to launch an investigation or encourage them to continue investigation into the son of the person who is currently the frontrunner to be the opposing candidate to the President of the United States, does really speak to kind of where our political moment is.</p><p>Now, it's unsurprising to me and maybe it is a little surprising to me that, given the political pressure and the media pressure and the way that this was being perceived, that Rudy Giuliani has now pulled out of this meeting. But it was pretty remarkable on its face from the very beginning.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes, I mean Michael, it smacks of what was he or anyone thinking. I mean, hello, seeing how a foreign country meddled into the United States election, wasn't it - that the nucleus of the Mueller report? And now you've got a personal attorney who is out loud saying he's seeking potential assistance from a foreign country about meddling into the next election?</p><p>MICHAEL ZELDIN, ROBERT MUELLER'S FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT AT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AND CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Right. Well you've used Rudy Giuliani and thinking in the same sense, which I'm not sure is possible.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Oh my.</p><p>ZELDIN: Because what he says is just unbelievable. The notion that he would, through private channels, do something which the government has the authority to do, that is the State Department and the Office of International Affairs at the Justice Department have formal mechanisms by which, if they believe that there is something that is worth looking at, can be looked at.</p><p>But Giuliani is freelancing, and that's something that he's been doing all the time that he's been connected with Trump. I never think it helps Trump at all. I think it's all about Giuliani, he is a very Giuliani-centric individual and hopefully there's--</p><p>WHITFIELD: Except the President says out loud that he kind of liked the idea too.</p><p>ZELDIN: Yes, I know, I understand that. But ultimately, I hope this redounds to Giuliani's detriment because it's just unseemly to have him out there doing this sort of stuff. It's just not acceptable behavior.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Alright, so Michael let me also get you on the Democrats' now latest effort to get the President's taxes. They have issued subpoenas to the IRS, the Treasury Department, one deadline came and went, now there's a new deadline of May 17.</p><p>And if the subpoenas are ignored, what is the next step potentially? Is it contempt for the Treasury Secretary or anybody else, and if so does that even matter?</p><p>ZELDIN: Right, so what's at the heart of this is that the Treasure - the Ways and Means Committee has asked for the tax returns of the President and some of his businesses. They have a right under a specific statute to do that.</p><p>The White House is pushing back, actually the Treasury Department on behalf of the White House, is pushing back saying there's no valid legislative purpose for this inquiry, and they're therefore not going to reply.</p><p>They've subpoenaed it, it will now go to court if he contests, if he is held in contempt and then the court will have to make a decision as to whether or not Congress is acting within its authority to demand that which the statute authorizes, and whether or not if they don't do it, there's you know the possibility of contempt and jail for it.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And complying and contempt are usually taken very seriously. How do you see this, Michael, that the Treasury Secretary has already testified? It's not going to happen and there had been other threats of contempt involving people in the Trump administration, and it doesn't seem to shake anyone.</p><p>ZELDIN: Well that's right. It seems to me that they've made a decision that across the board, with respect to Nadler and Schiff and Richie Neal that all of these subpoenas for Congressional oversight that is in - they are entitled to, they are just going to stonewall. That seems to be a strategy that they've adopted.</p><p>They seem to be willing to take the contempt citation. They understand fully well that, if there is litigation around contempt, it could be months and months and even years, and that that delay advantages them, because I think that they believe that the information that's being sought will be damaging to their political and legal interests.</p><p>And so, they've made a decision that, if that's the case, rather than give it up, we'll stonewall and delay and hope that the 2020 election comes and goes before anyone sees - any of these documents see the light of day.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And Wes, in the last hour, I talked to Congressman Lloyd Doggett, and this is what he had to say about why Democrats do want to see the President's taxes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX): when The New York Times in great investigative reporting showed that Donald Trump was not just a loser, but the biggest loser of any taxpayer individually in America at one point,</p><p>[12:10:00] his response was that dodging taxes was just sport, to use his word not unlike his comment a couple of years ago that he was smart, because he hadn't paid taxes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: And so, Wes, folks have reviewed the history of Donald Trump and what has been learned about his taxes in that New York Times report that he lost more than $1 million - $1 billion in a ten-year - during a ten-year span. Does this give Democrats the ammunition to help justify what it is they're looking for in demanding his tax returns?</p><p>LOWERY: It certainly doesn't hurt the Democrats' argument. Now, to be clear, I mean this is going to be a partisan fight it seemed on the merits and legal experts have been weighing in on this at this point for not just weeks and months, but for years, that the Democrats did in fact have the authority to subpoena these tax records.</p><p>And Trump has decided he's going to continue fighting that in part in a strategy that might force this over to the courts and stretch this out past the election date, at which point he has much less to lose no matter what comes out.</p><p>But I do think that both of these stories, both of these lines of conversation, both about the subpoenas around President Trump's tax returns, but also about Rudy Giuliani and Ukraine speak to two big themes.</p><p>The first is, how is the President attempting to grapple and fight back at the Congressional oversight of the Democrats who now run the House?</p><p>But second, what are the President's - what is the President going to be willing to do now that he is the President himself running a campaign.</p><p>So, when you think about things like having perhaps interactions with foreign governments or encouraging explicitly or otherwise either interference of foreign governments, that's one thing when you are a private businessman who's running for President.</p><p>It's a different thing when you are the President himself and you have the ability to instruct the Attorney General to do things, the ability to instruct the Treasury Secretary to do things.</p><p>And so, what we're seeing is President Trump being the same Donald Trump that he was back in 2016, except now he's the President of the United States. And so, when he asks for something or does something, he's doing it with the force of the United States government as opposed to just with the RNC or with his campaign staff.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, West Lowery and Michael Zeldin, we'll leave it there for now. Thanks so much.</p><p>ZELDIN: Thanks.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, still ahead this breaking news, two barges colliding into an oil tanker spilling chemicals into a busy Texas shipping channel. A live report coming up.</p><p>And one of Facebook's founders, now calling for the company to be broken up. The reason he's so concerned, straight ahead.</p><p>[12:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Right now, thousands of barrels of a toxic gas product are leaking into a shipping channel near Houston, following a barge collision. A tugboat pushing two barges collided with an oil tanker on Friday, almost ripping one of the barges in half.</p><p>The crash occurred inside the Houston Ship Channel near Bay Port. CNN's Ed Lavandera is live in Houston where officials just updated the situation. So, what are you learning, Ed?</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Hi, Fredricka. Well investigators say they still don't know what caused these vessels to collide on Friday afternoon in the Houston Ship Channel, but there is an environmental concern, as 9,000 barrels of this gasoline product has leaked into the Houston Ship Channel.</p><p>Originally, investigators had said that it was 25,000 barrels. But they have lowered that number now to 9,000 barrels of this gasoline product. They are focusing also on the recovery. These - two of these barges between them were carrying 50,000 barrels of this gasoline product. One of those barges, which holds about half of that, is capsized so they're in the process of trying to recover that and make sure that that tank doesn't rupture, spilling more of this gasoline into the water there. Company officials spoke just a little while ago, updating folks on the situation there, in the ship channel.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM GUIDRY, INCIDENT COMMANDER, KIRBY INLAND MARINE: Our vessel, The Voyager, with two barges loaded with Reformate were struck by the ship Genesis River, and one of our barges has lost approximately 9,000 barrels of Reformate.</p><p>The other barge capsized, but has not leaked any cargo at this time. And we currently have about 3,600 feet of boom in place and we're working to put an additional 12,000 feet of boom, with 29 boats and 88 people in place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) LAVANDERA: So that boom that they're talking about is that a tube-like material that floats on top of the water. All of that is being deployed to try to contain that fuel from moving with the currents away from that site, and they're trying to clean that up.</p><p>Company officials and investigators say that there is around-the-clock air monitoring going on as well and that none of that is showing any kind of hazardous effects for people who live nearby and in those areas.</p><p>And they also say that their efforts today will be - we reported a lot here over the last few days about the weather situation. Some more rain expected here in the Houston area. They say they do expect weather to hamper some of the recovery efforts and the investigative efforts throughout the day, but that so far they're - they will work through it and no plans yet to stop that, because of the weather. Fredricka?</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Ed Lavandera in Houston, thank you so much. All right, coming up, no deal. Trade talks between the U.S. and China sputter, despite President Trump adding new tariffs, but who really pays the price when the U.S. raises rates on foreign goods? We'll ask the President and CEO of American Apparel, next.</p><p>[12:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials ended with no deal. President Trump tweeted that the conversations were candid and constructive; but just hours before, he slapped huge tariffs on products coming from China. As CNN's Tom Foreman explains, it's going to hit eventually your wallet.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, BROADCAST JOURNALIST, CNN: Despite friendly handshakes between team Trump and the Chinese delegates, trade talks have stalled. No deal on the horizon.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hello everybody.</p><p>FOREMAN: And no sign of President Trump giving an inch on the 25% tariff he's launched on Chinese goods.</p><p>TRUMP: I happen to think that tariffs for a country are very powerful. We are the piggy bank that everybody steals from, including China.</p><p>FOREMAN: But American consumers could soon feel a greater impact, if the tariffs expand to consumer products as threatened. China would be expected to pass on those expenses, jacking up prices on smartphones, computers, televisions, fitness trackers, and much more.</p><p>The extra cost for the average American family of four is expected to be close to $800. What could drive it? Three quarters of the toys bought in the U.S. are made in China, including these hugely popular dolls.</p><p>93 percent of Chinese made footwear, including some shoes for Nike could be hit, so could clothing, Bluetooth headsets and even drones.</p><p>Trump's tariffs on China last year steered away from consumer goods and focused on industrial items such as solar panels, steel, and aluminum. Those costs were passed on by American companies.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: American consumers are already paying, they just don't really know, it's kind of a stealth tax. But it's going to become a very obvious tax not too far from now, if this continues.</p><p>FOREMAN: The major markets are already showing unease over the clash.</p><p>[12:25:00] In the next three years, if China and the U.S. continue warring over trade, economists say both countries could see their economies slow down and close to a million American jobs might be lost.</p><p>Still, the President has long insisted China is cheating the U.S. by stealing intellectual property, manipulating currency, and most recently reneging on a framework for a deal. And he's convinced China will blink first, tweeting tariffs will make our country much stronger not weaker just sit back and watch.</p><p>The Treasury Secretary has called the talks constructive, but that doesn't tell us much about how long the impasse might last or how far the impact may reach. Tom Foreman, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, with me right now is Rick Helfenbein, he is the President and CEO of the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association, which represents more than 1,000 brand names. You are primarily a public policy voice, but you're not necessarily American Apparel, the brand name, just to make it very clear for a lot of folks who are familiar with the label American Apparel.</p><p>Alright, good to see you. So, you have expressed some real concerns now that these higher tariffs really could be fatal for some American businesses. To what extent?</p><p>RICK HELFENBEIN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, AMERICAN APPAREL &amp; FOOTWEAR ASSOCIATION: Well, this is real pain for our industry. It's not passive pain. It's sort of like Thursday night was a fairy tale that had just reached Chapter 11. Cinderella's clothes are suddenly going to go back to rags and there's no glass slipper to bail us out anymore.</p><p>U.S. trade representatives in the past have been actually very kind to us. They did stay away from consumables and they did hit us with 10%. They hit us in handbags, hats, backpacks, gloves, baseball gloves.</p><p>We've been able to finesse that. We cannot finesse 25%, it will cause severe damage to our industry. And if that wasn't a bad enough story Thursday night, the President did announce that the balance of goods which would include all apparel and all footwear, the list in that could be released as early as Monday. So, our members are in distress to say the least.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So some reports indicate that families could experience someone - something like $800 more out-of-pocket expense as a result of these tariffs, with the products that you buy. Do you think that's an exaggeration or do you worry that that is about right?</p><p>HELFENBEIN: No, actually I think that number is not nearly as high as it's going to be. In America, this is going to sound funny, but Americans buy on the average eight pairs of shoes and 68 garments. And you multiply that out and it just gets worse.</p><p>And you can't imagine a handbag going from $80 to $110, because remember that the Chinese are taxing the leather that comes from America, and it goes into China and they're taxing it going in and it's taxed when coming back. So, there's a doubling effect.</p><p>Plus, retailers work on what we call IMUs and the EMUs, margins, and they get multiplied. They get multiplied through the system. So, we don't really know, we can only estimate what a family of four will pay, but they will pay more.</p><p>So far they haven't noticed it. If you are a consumer and you go fill up your card, it's $2.50 a gallon, you get that. If it goes to $6 a gallon, you get that really big time. So, we have a lot of concerns, we are very worried. Retail is not in the best shape it's ever been.</p><p>And I mean, think about this, 2017 we had more bankruptcies than we did in 2008 and 2009. Last year, we lost over 100 million square feet of retail space. And this year, in the first four months of the year, they've been announcing more doors closing at retail than all of last year.</p><p>So, retail is struggling, prices go up. When prices go up, sales go down, jobs get lost. This is not a good thing. This is voodoo economics.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So that the President is very optimistic. I mean he just tweeted out this saying such an easy way to avoid tariffs, make or produce your goods and products in the good old USA, it's very simple. And this from the President who, especially on the campaign trail, he was criticized largely that so many of his products were made overseas. So, how do you interpret his words today?</p><p>HELFENBEIN: Well, it's a bit of fiction. I mean realistically, when I started in this business, we made so much in the USA. Today, Made in USA is less than 3% of the market. And one of the reasons - I mean think about this, 97% of all apparel, 98% of all footwear is imported into the United States.</p><p>[12:30:00] And if you look at the China numbers, 41 percent of apparel, 72 percent of footwear, 84 percent of accessories and clothing, backpacks and handbags comes from China.</p><p>We don't have a place to move this. And yes, we would love to make more in America but it's not possible. It's not practical. And we don't have a whole lot of places to go with these products. I mean, it gets confusing but think about this, on the apparel side, China has a 41 percent market share. The next closest is Vietnam at 14 percent. So between the two countries, that's 55 percent of the U.S. market. In Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, that's 70 percent of the U.S. market.</p><p>We're kind of trapped in our own skin. We don't have any place to go, and we start paying 25 percent -- you know, this isn't the first time the president has come out with this. In the first Republican debate 2016, there was a talk about 45 percent tariffs. And think about this, also, this shirt that I'm wearing right here, already carries a 20 percent tariff, add 25 with that, there's your 45.</p><p>The president has been true to his word and the American consumer may feel the pain. I do give the president a lot of credit, we have issues with China. And it's great to bring them to the table to talk. But he's now used tariffs to -- as a weapon. They've been weaponized, and that's not what they were designed for. So, we have some big concerns.</p><p>FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Rick Helfenbein, we'll leave it there for now. And thank you so much for joining me.</p><p>It is the biggest social media website in the world but is Facebook a little too big? CEO Mark Zuckerberg has too much power. One of the platform's co-founders says yes to all of that. More on that right after this.</p><p>[12:35:52] WHITFIELD: As Facebook braces for a possible multibillion- dollar penalty over its privacy practices, one of its co-founders is suggesting it's time to break up the social media site.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, FACEBOOK CO-FOUNDER: It's not a personal beef but it is personal. I mean, I've been friends with Mark for 15-plus years. I don't know if we'll be friends on the other side of this piece but I have no beef with him. I like Mark, I love his family. He's a good person.</p><p>I also think he has too much power. And I should say that I think that ultimately, it's up to the government to solve this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Chris Hughes co-founded Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg and two others back when they were students at Harvard. Hughes sold off his shares back in 2012. His op-ed was published in the New York Times. Let's talk more.</p><p>Joining me right now, CNN Tech Reporter Brian Fung. This is pretty scathing criticism even though he tries to couch it with, you know, I like him, you know, we've been friends for a long time. So, the bottom line is Chris Hughes right that it's time to break it all up? BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECH REPORTER: Well, you know, we have to talk a little bit first about what he's proposing here and whether or not it's feasible. Those are really the two key questions that we have to grapple with. And, you know, I'll take, you know, the question of whether or not -- of what he's proposing first.</p><p>You know, I think what Hughes has suggested is one, spinning off companies like Instagram and WhatsApp which Facebook owns. And then second, getting an independent regulator, separate government agency to oversee the tech industry much more closely. And, you know, these are pretty substantial asks here. You know, the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission is currently investigating Facebook for privacy practices. But experts tell me that if the agency were to try to break up the company, that would likely require a separate proceeding that would be an anti-trust proceeding, not related to this investigation.</p><p>So, that sort of gives you an idea of how difficult it might be to actually achieve some of what Chris Hughes is suggesting here.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And so I guess, in the meantime, you know, Facebook has offered to appoint some type of privacy czar. Is that an answer? And is that even realistic? What would the expectations be?</p><p>FUNG: Right. Well, that gets -- come to the heart of the question that a lot of policymakers are grappling with right now. Just how much self-regulation will be effective when it comes to reigning in big tech companies? And how much intervention needs to be brought in by the federal government or state government even/or international bodies. And so, you know, Facebook has said it's willing to submit to European style rules such as the law governing privacy in Europe, known as GDPR. It says that you know, for everyone to agree to a single common global standard like GDPR would make it much easier for Facebook to comply with.</p><p>On the other hand, critics of GDPR say it's very burdensome on individual consumers because the regulations essentially require you to hit accept and give your consent to every single website you visit. It's just not realistic. And so, one big question here is, whether or not those rules are enough and where the line is drawn between that and self-regulation.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Who can forget that, you know, Zuckerberg did testify before Congress last year about Facebook's handling of user information. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG FACEBOOK CEO: I think a lot of times regulation, by definition, puts in place rules that a company that is larger, that has resources like ours can easily comply with. But that might be more difficult for a smaller start-up to comply with. So, I think these are all things that need to be thought through very carefully when thinking through what rules we want to put in place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: So did anything concrete come from that?</p><p>FUNG: Well, Facebook has, you know, said it's launched more programs to try and handle things like misinformation and hate speech on its platform, it's hired a lot more human moderators.</p><p>[12:40:04] But overall, you know, these issues are still big problems for the company and it's, you know, trying to search for answers here along with policymakers. You know, just yesterday, Facebook said or Mark Zuckerberg said he was hopeful that a proposal by French officials to, you know, essentially create more oversight over Facebook would move forward that proposal, you know, would look pretty similar to what, you know, already exists at the E.U. level. But, you know, one big question is, can that be imported essentially to the United States and U.S. market?</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Brian Fung, good to see you. We'll leave it there for now.</p><p>FUNG: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, still ahead, cities held hostage. Baltimore is the latest American city brought to a crawl after a ransomware attack. The crippling problem on the rise across the U.S. next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:45:00] WHITFIELD: Some major U.S. cities are under a cyber attack with hackers demanding millions of dollars in ransom. That's according to a new report that shows a disturbing increase in ransomware attacks. Local governments are finding their computer systems crippled and held hostage by hackers.</p><p>CNN Senior National Correspondent Alex Marquardt reports.</p><p>ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This city of Baltimore is under an extensive cyber attack. Hackers launching an aggressive virus called Robinhood and holding many government computers hostage. The assault causing police e-mails to go down as did the board of elections. The finance department couldn't do business this week. Fax machines and printers were on the fritz.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We know that the team, they're working hard. And we do know that they are not in control of certain parts of our system. It's really frustrating, and this could happen to anyone.</p><p>MARQUARDT: And it does. A new report shared exclusively with CNN by Recorded Future is one of the first to measure the scope of these kinds of attacks, showing that across the country, ransomware attacks are on the rise, crippling counties, cities, and towns, costing them millions of dollars. Since 2013, malicious foreign actors have been detected targeting local governments, law enforcement, and universities 169 times. Twenty-two attacks alone this year. Figures the group behind the new study says which represent the tip of an iceberg. ALLAN LASKA, THREAT INTELLIGENCE ANALYST, RECORDED FUTURE: The bad guys see state and local governments as a target that is willing to pay and that they may be able to get a lot of money out of. If nothing else, they may be able to get a lot of news coverage out of.</p><p>MARQUARDT: The attackers are not governments. This isn't about politics, but money attacking targets big and small, often underfunded when it comes to cybersecurity.</p><p>LASKA: They've got a bunch of dedicated people, but they don't have the latest tools and equipment to protect themselves.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Eric Wyatt is one of those dedicated people. Last fall, he fought off a multi-pronged ransom attack on his 100,000 person community north of Anchorage, Alaska.</p><p>ERIC WYATT, MATANUSKA-SUSITNA BOROUGH IT DIRECTOR: They were so into our network that they brought down the vast majority of our work stations and servers. This type of attack that we saw was far worse than anything I had seen in my past being in this industry for over 35 years.</p><p>MARQUARDT: One thousand employees were affected. Old typewriters had to be dusted off. The ransom wasn't paid but it cost $2.5 million to fix the problems which still linger today almost a year later.</p><p>WYATT: We are outgunned. We don't have the resources to fight this fight. The people that are attacking us are better organized, better funded, and we don't have the same level of capability that they do. So they see us as a soft target, often we are.</p><p>MARQUARDT: The FBI is among the first calls that victims make. Now they say attackers have moved from targeting individuals to larger prizes because it's more lucrative.</p><p>ADAM LAWSON, SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT, FBI MAJOR CYBER CRIMES UNIT: We're seeing larger and larger ransomware demands of these victims.</p><p>MARQUARDT: A problem the FBI believes is only getting worse.</p><p>LAWSON: People are paying the ransom and encouraging the behavior. So I think we will continue to see an escalation in the sophistication of ransomware attacks.</p><p>MARQUARDT: The good news is that according to the study which was obtained exclusively by my colleague Kevin Collier, just 17 percent of state and local governments actually end up paying the ransom. Still, we have seen a surge of attacks against them. Attackers seeing them as ripe targets because of all the attention that they get when governments are taken offline.</p><p>Alex Marquardt, CNN, New York.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, for more on ransomware attacks, let's bring in Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent under President Obama. Good to see you. So --</p><p>JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Good to see you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: -- why are these risks associated with ransomware and why the public sector computer system?</p><p>WACKROW: Well, listen, I think we have to look at right now is the risk of this ransomware is on the rise. It's on the rise so much so that over the last two years we have seen a 97 percent increase in the amount of attacks that are launched against organizations and individuals. And to put a finer point on that, actually in 2019, every 14 seconds an organization is going to be affected by a malware attack that seeks to insert ransomware into their network. So, the risk of it is just right now, the sheer volume in the ability of organizations both public and private to defend against this.</p><p>When we talk about, you know, cities such as Baltimore that, you know, just had this attack, you know, it's less about them being targeted directly and it's more about them being a victim of opportunity. Traditionally, you know, we saw from some reporting is that they are, you know, unorganized. They don't have a solid structure to defend against this type of attack. And that, in itself, makes them a victim, easy prey for attackers to come in and take hold of critical data systems within the enterprise such as 911 emergency response and social services.</p><p>[12:50:11] So, we're going to see these ransom attacks continue for a long time to come.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So do you see that all cases cannot be handled the same and that paying ransomware actually might be a good decision in certain cases?</p><p>WACKROW: Well, first of all, law enforcement does not encourage payment of any type of ransom. At the end of the day, if you start paying this ransom, all you're doing is you're fueling the criminal enterprise that feeds it. So that is not recommended by any law enforcement entity.</p><p>But at the end of the day, it's a business decision that needs to be made. If your organization doesn't have the resiliency to come back from the attack, you may be forced to go ahead and pay that ransom.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. And so, what, if anything, can be done to prevent or even reduce, you know, the impact of these attacks?</p><p>WACKROW: Well, this is about, you know, establishing whether it's a private contract or in the public sector, establishing a culture of cybersecurity awareness. Making sure everyone understands what they need to do to prevent this. If you are attacked, what do you do? You isolate the infected computer systems, you back off the, you know, back off power from affected computers.</p><p>But you contact law enforcement immediately so they are aware. A lot of the times, unfortunately, these ransomwares go unreported. WHITFIELD: All right, Jonathan Wackrow, always good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>WACKROW: Thanks, Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: We'll be right back.</p><p>[12:55:21] WHITFIELD: An American hostage is among those rescued after being kidnapped in West Africa May 1st. The U.S. military assisted in the operation. These two men from France and a South Korean woman were also rescued. One of them is describing the ordeal as hell. The French minister for the armed forces says four terrorists were killed in the operation.</p><p>And it's a somber graduation day at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. One of the students who was injured but survived the shooting there 10 days ago will receive her degree. Two victims, Riley Howell and Ellis Parlier will also receive degrees in memoriam. The school has announced $1 million in scholarships in memory of the slain students.</p><p>And see what happens when victims and offenders of violent crimes meet face-to-face on the new CNN original series, \"The Redemption Project with Van Jones\" tomorrow night, 9:00. Followed by an all-new episode of \"United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell\" at 10 Eastern. Only on CNN.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Hello, again, thanks so much for joining me this Saturday.

The list of people calling for antitrust action against Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple and other big tech companies is growing. New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway has lead the charge, arguing that these companies\u2019 size and technological disruption have lead to a host of social ills, from tax avoidance to job destruction to electoral interference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The idea comes at a moment when anger at, and fear of, the tech giants is rising. Concern over Facebook Inc.\u2018s violations of user privacy and complicity in 2016 electoral shenanigans has made many people resent the social media giant. Alphabet Inc. (Google), which probably knows even more about users than Facebook does, could conceivably do even more to violate privacy if it were so inclined. The closing of many retail outlets have made many worry that Amazon.com Inc. really will become \u201cthe everything store,\u201d with all of the pricing power that entails.</p><p>Moreover, the big tech companies have become the focus of more general concerns about the economic effects of information technology. In addition to privacy concerns, people are afraid that automation is going to make them obsolete. Meanwhile, big tech has made a few people, like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, fabulously rich, even as wages have stagnated across the country. And a decline in the number of startup companies has left many worrying that business ownership is becoming a winner-take-all affair. Big Tech now dominates the list of the country\u2019s most valuable corporations.</p><p>Most of these concerns are perfectly legitimate. And in some cases, big tech companies are the proper target. But applying the traditional antitrust framework to Big Tech is difficult, because of the particulars of the tech business. As much as \u201cregulation\u201d has become a dirty word in some circles, it\u2019s probably a much better alternative.</p><p>The first reason breaking up Big Tech wouldn\u2019t help is what are known as network effects. Facebook dominates the social-media market because everyone wants to be on the same networking site as everyone else. Imagine there were four Facebook clones instead of one, each with a quarter of the people who now use the site. Everyone would either have to have four different accounts, or be cut off from some of their friends. Eventually, everyone would migrate to one of the four baby Facebooks, and the others would disappear, restoring the original big Facebook.</p><p>Of course, Facebook could be forced to spin off Instagram, WhatsApp and other social-media products that it owns that don\u2019t compete directly with its main social network. But very few of the ills ascribed to Facebook involve collaboration or data sharing between the Facebook and Instagram networks, or between Instagram and WhatsApp, so it\u2019s not clear what positive effect this would have.</p><p>Or take Amazon. It could be broken up into multiple online retailers \u2014 one for books, another for household goods and so on. After that, presumably, the baby Amazons would try to move into each others\u2019 product segments. Because it makes sense for online shoppers to have a one-stop place to shop, they would eventually shift to just one of the baby Amazons and turn it into an everything store all over again.</p><p>Of the big tech companies, perhaps only Apple doesn\u2019t depend on a strong network effect, making its profits instead from the quality and brand cachet of its products. But there\u2019s very little reason to break up Apple in the first place. IPhone prices are high not because of lack of competition \u2014 there are plenty of great mobile phones out there and that cost less \u2014 but because many people are willing to pay a lot for a premium brand. Throwing Apple in with the rest of the big tech companies shows that the case for antitrust springs partially from a reflexive desire to kick any company that seems large and powerful.</p><p>As for data-privacy concerns, these won\u2019t be solved by antitrust remedies and they could easily become worse. The problem isn\u2019t the size of the company that has your data, it\u2019s what the company chooses to do with that data. It seems quite possible that fragmentation of Big Tech would result in people using more data-gathering online services overall, which would only increase the number of companies with the ability and the incentive to sell their personal data.</p><p>Automation, meanwhile, won\u2019t be substantially slowed by breaking up Big Tech. Yes, Google and others are pouring money into self-driving cars and machine learning. But without Big Tech to hire them, researchers are going to simply start their own companies or go to university labs. Antitrust isn\u2019t a good way to slow the pace of technological change, even if doing so were advisable.</p><p>So antitrust is a poor tool for resolving the problems posed by the technology industry right now. A better alternative is regulation. Privacy concerns can be addressed by enacting strict, detailed, comprehensive national laws on data confidentiality, and by enforcing these laws stringently. Concerns over automation are overblown, but if they do come to pass, they\u2019re best addressed by wage subsidies and a social wealth fund. If big tech companies use local market power to hold down wages for low-paid workers, minimum wage hikes will be the appropriate remedy.</p><p>Of course, this could change. If Amazon becomes more dominant and raises consumer prices, or if the Big Tech companies grow so huge and powerful that they start holding down salaries for workers nationwide, it will be time to start looking at antitrust. But right now, it\u2019s not the right move.</p><p>Smith is a Bloomberg View columnist.

The hearing showed that lawmakers are beginning to understand what is and isn't important when it comes to regulating these large businesses. And it also showed an increased focus on the most important area of antitrust policy - mergers and acquisitions and whether regulators have exercised enough vigilance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, Big Tech has become ever more important to the U.S. economy and U.S. financial markets. The five biggest tech companies (the four that testified, plus Microsoft Corp.) now represent more than one-fifth of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500. Their value has only risen in the coronavirus pandemic:</p><p>When a few companies get this big and dominant, it makes sense to think about how they might be using their size to unfairly control markets.</p><p>One typical defense against such allegations is that tech companies are not monopolies. Whether this is true depends on how markets are defined - for example, Google is overwhelmingly dominant among search engines, but has only about a third of digital ad revenues. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg argued that his company faces intense competition in many markets, especially from the other top tech companies.</p><p>But focusing on whether a company is a monopoly misses the point. Oligopolies, where a few big companies dominate the market, also tend to wield some degree of market power. In theory, that can allow powerful players to jack up consumer prices, underpay workers and squeeze suppliers.</p><p>In the case of Big Tech, consumer prices are generally not the issue. Services provided to consumers by Google and Facebook tend to be free, while Apple's fat margins stem mostly from consumer willingness to pay a lot for the brand value of an iPhone. Wages are a slightly bigger concern. Big tech companies have already been caught and fined for colluding to hold down engineers' salaries, and there has been much attention paid to Amazon's warehouse low pay and unpleasant working conditions. But Big Tech ultimately doesn't employ very many people, and its proven anticompetitive activities have largely involved highly paid workers. So while Big Tech wage suppression deserves to be monitored closely, it's probably not yet a major threat to U.S. labor markets.</p><p>A bigger worry concerns suppliers. Platform companies depend on a network of third-party companies - merchants who sell on Amazon, websites that run Google ads, app developers who sell on Apple's App Store and so on. The platforms' size potentially allows them to extract a lot of value from these smaller companies, demanding a larger share of their revenue or even creating and then favoring their own competing offerings.</p><p>In the long run, as tech publisher Tim O'Reilly has argued, big tech companies would probably ossify and ultimately lose out from cannibalizing their own third-party ecosystems, but there's always the danger that short-term profits will prove too tantalizing. Thus, it's a good thing that Congress focused some of its attention on the need to maintain fair relationships between platforms and suppliers. Ultimately, this issue will probably have to be resolved with regulation because breaking up platform companies would eventually cause new platforms to emerge and become dominant.</p><p>Another concern is the prices that online service companies charge advertisers. By some estimates, more than half of digital ad spending now goes to either Google or Facebook, with the fastest-rising competitor being Amazon. Advertisers are the true paying customers for free online services for consumers.</p><p>This is a reason that legislators are worried about platforms buying out the competition. Facebook CEO Zuckerberg admitted in the hearing that he purchased social-networking company Instagram in 2012 as a way to head off a potential competitor. There have been allegations that the company has attempted or threatened to do the same with other young social networks, telling them that if they didn't accept an offer, Facebook would launch a competing product and drive them out of existence.</p><p>Ultimately, that could raise prices for advertisers, if Facebook properties are the only way for them to reach social-media users. Those sorts of buyouts and buyout threats could also have a chilling effect on startup formation and economic dynamism because even the threat of competition from a dominant company can deter new entrants. Columbia Law School professor Timothy Wu has argued that such buyouts are illegal under current antitrust law.</p><p>So if there's any case for antitrust action against Big Tech right now, it probably has to do with the acquisition of upstart competitors. Unlike most of the issues surrounding Big Tech, which are complicated and confusing because of the way online network effects change the economics of size, concern over anticompetitive mergers that jack up prices is very old and very common.</p><p>In any case, it's a very good thing that Congress is beginning to pay more attention to the problems of industrial concentration and oligopoly in the U.S. economy. Big Tech is obviously the most well-known and popular case, but with concentration rising across most industries, these hearings will hopefully be a jumping-off point for a broader re-examination of the value of mega-mergers and huge, dominant companies. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/08/30/faye-flam-new-cdc-coronavirus-testing-guidelines-have-it-backward/\"> Faye Flam: New CDC coronavirus testing guidelines have it backward </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/08/28/other-voices-rethinking-snowden/\"> Other voices: Rethinking Snowden </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/08/28/zirin-mallow-drop-box-voting-is-the-election-reform-the-us-needs-now/\"> Zirin, Mallow: Drop-box voting is the election reform the US needs now </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/08/27/peri-sparber-want-more-american-jobs-reopen-america-to-foreign-workers/\"> Peri, Sparber: Want more American jobs?

But Joseph E. Stiglitz is someone unique in many ways: Nobel Prize in economics, was the world bank's first vice president and chief economist, and chaired the Bill Clinton administration's Committee of Economic Advisers (CEA), as well as teaching at major universities in the United States: Yale, Stanford, Princeton, and now Columbia. So you can afford to say, admired, \"What a book about inequality, sex and class!\"</p><p><br/>Against the usual stereotypes of economists, Stiglitz is a constant devourer of fictionals. You might think that his wife, daughter and granddaughter of book publishers, has something to do with that taste, but actually as a child he had that habit. \"I was an avid reader of [Charles] Dickens. At the time I didn't understand why, and I didn't think about reason, except that I liked language and stories and didn't bother me too much that they were that long,\" he told The New York Times in a completely unusual interview: just about literature.<br/>\"On second thought, perhaps it is not surprising that someone whose lifelong passion has been the concern for inequality has been hooked on Dickens' graphic descriptions of England in the 19th century,\" he said. \"Anyone who is interested in understanding the Great Depression or the great Britain of the mid-19th century would be encouraged to approach [John] Steinbeck or Dickens.\"<br/>\"It's not surprising that someone whose lifelong passion has been the concern for inequality has been hooked on Dickens' graphic descriptions of England in the 19th century,\" Stiglitz said. (REUTERS/Toby Melville) (Toby Melville/)<br/>Stiglitz gave that note to the New York newspaper on the occasion of the paperback of his book People, Power, and Profits, Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent(translated by Taurus: The Response to the Age of Unrest), where he resumed his warnings against \"market fundamentalism\" to describe a desolate landscape of the United States. : lobby groups control regulations to favor their goals, trade progress destroys jobs, means lose credibility, democracy is at risk. \"It is not only the economy that has failed, but also our policy. Our economic divide has led to a political divide, and the political divide has strengthened the economic divide,\" he wrote.<br/>His book describes four main trends in this phenomenon\u2014monopoly power, poorly managed globalization, poor financial regulation, and new technologies that enabled greater human exploitation and manipulation\u2014and also prescribes some alternatives for \"capitalism to save itself,\" including the controversy of universal basic income. Written before the economic crisis resulting from COVID-19, progressive capitalism came forward to a theme that will resonate in the immediate future: \"Indeed there was destruction of employment in the process of globalization, but it will again be in a process of senseless de-globalization.\"<br/>It is no wonder that such a thinker is the most moved by the literature as \"the stories of struggle, of the fight against injustice and againstoppression,\" as he told the Times. \"Also vivid and heartfelt descriptions,\" he added. \"Just Mercy, by Bryan Stevenson, is an example,\" he said of the memoir the lawyer wrote about the Walter McMillian tragedy, prosecuted for a murder he did not commit and sentenced to death, translated as Out of Compassion.<br/>\"Our economic division has led to a political divide, and political division has strengthened the economic divide,\" the Nobel Prize wrote in his latest book. (REUTERS/Thomas Peter) (THOMAS PETER/)<br/>That's why he doesn't touch science fiction by mistake, he said. \"I'm not quite right why. Maybe because I think it's hard enough to understand our own world and try to fix it.\"<br/>Like many people who love to read, Stiglitz has an \"aspirational stack\" of books on its light table. \"In fact recently my wife bought me a bigger light table,\" she said. Now he has there Paris was a party, of Ernest Hemingway (the economist fell in love with the city when he taught there); These Truths, by Jill Lepore, and The Light That Goes Off, by Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes, \"because wherever people go they talk about those two books\" The cockroach, by Ian McEwan (\"Schloss Elmau's bookseller thought I'd like this Kafkaesque parody of Brexit, in which a cockroach becomes prime minister\" of the United Kingdom); Sonora, by Hannah Lillith Assadi, and even the book of a family member, her brother-in-law, by the way a well-known writer: The Ratline, by Philippe Sands, also author of East-West Street.<br/>What follows the aspirational stack is usually the list of future readings, and the Nobel Prize in Economics has one, of course. He participates, with his wife and journalist Robyn Meredith, who organizes it, a book club whose upcoming titles are Todo desmorona, by Chinua Achebe , a rereading for him - and Romance In Marseille, a newly discovered work by Claude McKay.<br/>On the occasion of the new edition of his book, Joseph Stiglitz revealed his enormous and eclectic literary passions.<br/>When he travels to a city, Stiglitz likes to read something that goes on there: it's part of his \"ideal reading experience.\" For example, recently he was at the Hay Festival, in Cartagena de Indias, and read Of Love and Other Demons, by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez: \"The heroine died in a convent, which is now converted to the hotel where we stayed,\" she said. \"Religious fanaticism. Contempt. Oppression. Love. The extremes were unforgettable to me. I couldn't let go of the book.\"<br/>Every year he travels to Johannesburg, and in his last stay read Dog Eater, by Niq Mhlongo, \"about a young man who goes to the University of Witwatersrand in 1994, after the end of apartheid. He's an antihero, and the book is satirical and funny and also sad. I gave it to several people for Christmas.\" In November, when he traveled to Moscow, he decided to go without a phone and without a laptop, and instead brought Keith Gessen's a terrible country, \"about a troubled academic who returns to Moscow to care for his grandmother,\" a book that introduced him to \"the strange and menacing underground current of current life in Moscow.\"<br/>Theseare other highlights, with names of authors and titles, in the Interview with the Nobel Prize in Economics:<br/>Like so many, Stiglitz learns things by reading, and Steve Kornacki's The Red and the Blue: The 1990s and the Birth of Political Tribalism \"reassessed my period at the Clinton White House, better understanding the forces that led to his choice,\" he said. \"It also reminded me of the ephemeralness of our political memories and the vicissitudes of politics.\"<br/>When he travels, Stiglitz likes to read stories about the places he knows: so he read From Love and Other Demons, by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, in Cartagena de Indias. (EFE)<br/>The last great book he read, he said, is M. G. Vassanji's The Uncertain World of Vikram Lall: \"A corrupt official, who has fled to Canada, remembers his life and Kenya's independence movement. His memories of youthful love and the student movement in Dar es Salaam were particularly unforgettable to me. The book has a special meaning for me because of the time I spent working in Kenya, between 1969 and 1971.\"<br/>Among the books he was given treasured by This Is The End, a book that brings together the caricatures of Donald Trump that Patrick Chappatte published in The New York Times; Keeping Faith, the memoirs of former President Jimmy Carter and the President's Annual Economic Report during his tenure at the CEA: all copies signed by its authors (the latter, by Clinton).<br/>A book that he thinks deserves more recognition is Ghachar, Chochar, by Vivek Shanbhag: \"It has a strong feminist message. It is a nouvelle about a family in southern India, and its descent into physical violence. The end has an amazing lap.\"<br/>There are authors with which his generation is familiar but not younger readers, he said, to talk about Wallace Stegner. \"In December I read In a Safe Place, your classic about academic life, friendship and mortality. It's about four friends who remember their friendship, and it begins in the years they taught in Wisconsin, when they were all trying to become full professors. Lore Segal and Vivian Gornick were known for m generation: now that they have published new books, they will be met by a younger audience.\"<br/>What contemporary authors do you like? The list is long.<br/>Amitav Ghosh, \"partly for his committed writing on climate change and for his magnificent historical prosa.\" Suketu Mehta's last book, on immigration, This land is our land, he seemed \"wonderful\". She feels she shares journalist Rana Foroohar's thinking about some topics, such as the dangers of digital businesses, which she described in Don't Be Evil: How Big Tech Betrayed Its Founding Principles \u2014and All of Us. And books like Peter S. Goodman's Past Due: The End of Easy Money and the Renewal of the American Economy, \"can give a much better impression of the dysfunctions of our economy and society than my driest, analytical work can.\"<br/>In theater he loves Greg Kotis (Urinetown) and Greg Pierce (Cardinal). In journalism, \"I admire the work of brave reporters from around the world, including Mar\u00eda Teresa Ronderos (Colombia), Giannina Segnini (Costa Rica, and now a colleague at Columbia), FerialHaffajee (South Africa), Musikilu Mojeed (Nigeria) and the tenacious human rights chroniclers who make Rappler (Philippines),\" he said. He also cited a Columbia graduate, Omoyele Sowore, a presidential candidate in Nigeria who was arrested for a controversial tweet, and philanthropic funding groups such as the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), ProPublica, The Marshall Project and Daily Maverick.<br/>Do you know economists who write well? Without irony he appointed several, who have made efforts to \"write flatly in order to disseminate their ideas to a wider audience and influence opinion.\" In the last year, above all, he found several works he liked: The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets, by Thomas Philippon; The Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman; Good economy for difficult times, by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, the couple who shared Thomas Piketty's Nobel Prize in Economics in 2019, and Capital and Ideology.<br/>On Piketty's book he emphasized: \"It has 1,100 pages\" in Spanish, in fact, it has 1248. \"I mention it partly out of envy: my editor would never have forgiven me anything even near that extent, and I think wistfully of the pearls that were lost in the cutting instances, especially the first of my books that proved popular, The Malay in Globalization, of only 282 pages\" (320 in Spanish, but revised in 2018 with a reissue of 544 pages).<br/>The books that followed the 2008 crisis are among the \"excellent\" that arose after the \"devastation,\" he said: Martin Wolf's great crisis, changes and consequences; Between Debt and the Devil: Money, Credit, and Fixing Global Finance, by Adair Turner and Crash: how a decade of financial crisis has changed the world, by Adam Tooze, who is his colleague, highlighted.<br/>Stiglitz revealed that he envies Piketty: not because of his ideas but because his publisher did not force him to cut his last book, more than 1,000 pages. (Reuters)<br/>His literary tastes, like those of many people, changed over time\u2014in his youth, in addition to the classics, he had \"a fascination with Russian authors\"\u2014but in his case he has a very special influencer: his wife, from a family of publishers. \"Usually when I need a book I just ask you to suggest something to me. That's how I've become much more eclectic.\" Lately she opened the door to Frank Langfitt's journalistic chronicle of life in China: The Shanghai Free Taxi: Journeys with the Hustlers and Rebels of the New China; Factory Girls, by Leslie T. Chang and Street of Eternal Happiness, by Rob Schmitz.<br/>If I had to organize the perfect literary evening, Stiglitz would invite four women to eat: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Diksha Basu, Kiran Desai and her mother, Anita Desai.<br/>And if I had to name a single literary work that marked it, he would lean for Oliver Wendell Holmes's poem \"One Hoss Shay,\" \"I've been accompanied all my life. It's about aging, and as a kid the image of that horse that slowly collapsed after a lifetime of work, I found it somehow very moving. I always wondered if that would be how my life would end.\"<br/>MoreABOUT THIS THEME:<br/>Stiglitz: \"Martin Guzman is the right person, in the right place at the right time\"<br/>Books that do well: 14 authors choose their favorite title in times of uncertainty<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-11701631</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YMT-KK71-JBJN-M0CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2115\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>america</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>cultura-america</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000150</classCode><className>AWARDS &amp;

Struggling to adapt to the information age in one of Europe's more troubled economies, the AEDE thought it had hit on a brilliant new revenue source: They got a provision inserted in a new intellectual property law that, starting in January, will force news aggregation sites to pay newspapers for the privilege of linking to their stories.</p><p><br/> This never made much sense: News aggregators are a massive source of traffic (and therefore ad revenue) for news sites. In effect, the law seeks to make it more difficult and costly for anyone to give those sites free advertising. Indeed, it's hard to see the point of posting stories online unless you expect people to link to them, and it's simple enough to automatically prevent search engines from indexing your site's content if, for some obscure reason, you don't want people to have an easy means of discovering your content. But never mind the logic; the law seemed like a foolproof way for ailing news companies to milk a few euros from big tech corporations flush with cash. What could go wrong?<br/> You know how the story ends, right? Everyone but the newspapers themselves seems to have seen it coming, since something similar had just played out in Germany[2]: Google News, the largest of the aggregators, announced last week that they would be shutting down operations in Spain[3]. Since the company didn't even show ads on its news site, keeping it open under the new regulations would be an unsustainable, money-losing proposition.<br/> The hilarious coda to the story: The AEDE, which previously complained that news aggregators were 'stealing' their work by publishing headlines and tiny snippets of stories, is now begging Spanish regulators to stop Google News from closing[4]. The site's shuttering, the group complained without irony, 'would undoubtedly have a negative impact on citizens and Spanish businesses.' Give them points for chutzpah if nothing else: They're not even waiting for the blood to dry on the hatchet before bemoaning the loss of their golden eggs.<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://gizmodo.com/spains-new-google-tax-could-be-bad-for-everyone-1652899707\">http://gizmodo.com/spains-new-google-tax-could-be-bad-for-everyone-1652899707</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/23/kapitulation/\">http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/23/kapitulation/</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://gizmodo.com/a-big-round-of-applause-to-google-for-shaming-spain-wor-1669840971\">http://gizmodo.com/a-big-round-of-applause-to-google-for-shaming-spain-wor-1669840971</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/spanish-newspapers-have-changed-their-minds-and-are-now-begging-google-news-to-stay-2014-12\">http://www.businessinsider.com/spanish-newspapers-have-changed-their-minds-and-are-now-begging-google-news-to-stay-2014-12</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-CATO10070514186837695867093596</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CATO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DVF-PCH1-F03R-N126-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><timeReceived>10:49 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cato@Liberty</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>December 15, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.organization\"><classificationItem><className>Google News</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc.</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Julian Sanchez Back</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Germany</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Spain</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

It's 2019, and I don't know what television is anymore.</p><p>Oh, sure, I know what a television--the physical object, the thing you order from Amazon after checking it out at Best Buy--is. I am even reasonably comfortable with the notion of shows or series, those half-hour and one-hour productions that come in sequential, chapter-like installments, much like they did 30 or 40 years ago when a handful of broadcast networks ruled the airwaves and pay cable channels such as HBO and Cinemax were still niche services for well-off movie nuts and people too embarrassed to rent softcore porn at video stores. (Remember those?)</p><p>But television! As a concept? As a means of cultural connection, a system for mass entertainment? A way of organizing the world, or at least the weekday hours after dinner and before bedtime? I have no idea what that is. It's too vague, too sprawling, too unwieldy, too individualized and demographic-specific. Yes, there are still broadcast stations, and if you stick an antenna on your window, you can still tune into them over the air. It's like connecting to some ancient cellular network that only has four apps, all of which are basically the same. But when was the last time you watched something that way? Even street people and survivalists have 5G now.</p><p>These days, television--whatever it is--is on your phone, on your PlayStation, on YouTube, on your laptop, and even, sometimes, on your actual television, the big thing you bought from Amazon. TV is increasingly indistinct from the world of big-budget Hollywood feature films and also from big tech, which now makes shows, the things you watch, in order to sell phones, watches, diapers, plush toys, and lunch boxes. On occasion, TV even seems to be melding with video games and vice versa. You can consume as much of it as you want, from virtually any place you can imagine, on anything that has a screen. TV is everything now, and everywhere, an amorphous cultural and commercial blob backed by billions in tech and media spending. Its cultural dominance is unchecked by anything except your own time, and it is increasingly tailored to your unique interests and obsessions.</p><p>Yes, I'm talking about Netflix, the streaming video goliath that introduced us to binge-watching, and Stranger Things, and binge-watching Stranger Things. But I'm also talking about the elephant stampede of high-profile streaming video services set to launch in coming months--which include Apple TV+, Disney+, Peacock, HBO Max, and something called Quibi-as well as existing services, from the recognizable (Amazon Prime Video, Hulu) to under-the-radar offerings from the likes of Vudu, Crackle, Facebook Watch, and Vizio's WatchFree. Television, to use a reference that somehow made the leap from the days of broadcast dominance to the social media present, has not just jumped the shark. It is the shark. It is chewing up everything in its path. And the streaming era has only just begun.</p><p>ALL YOUR FRIENDS</p><p>IN THE OLDEN days, before the internet, before smartphones, when a television (the object) was something you had to buy at a store, it was easy enough to understand what TV was: three networks broadcasting shows--scripted dramas about police and lawyers, laugh-track comedies about dopey dads and housewife moms, deadly earnest news programming, and only slightly less earnest comedy talk--that felt more or less the same. Television producers pandered, not necessarily to the lowest common denominator but to the widest. Airtime was limited, so their goal was to produce material that would serve everyone, or as close as they could get. Television defined the American median. It was something we could all talk about together.</p><p>There was a comforting sense of homogeneity to the TV of this era. It didn't ask too much of you, and it was always there when you needed it, a friendly and familiar presence. It wasn't designed to be great; it was designed to be consistently fine.</p><p>The apotheosis of this style of television was the long-running, insanely popular 1990s sitcom Friends, a show that lit-eralized the idea of what television was in its title. Friends was a show about a bunch of attractive and mildly glamorous but essentially ordinary white people hanging out and talking about their lives. It was a show you could watch and engage with but also one that you could just have on as background noise, with the characters' idealized, fictional, not-too-difficult lives serving as the backdrop to your own. That was television's reason for being: to keep ordinary people company in their own homes.</p><p>All of this was, one way or another, sanctioned by the government. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), our national censor, kept tabs on broadcast content, deciding which words were acceptable and which weren't and ensuring that your TV friends wouldn't use foul language. The lines of acceptability shifted gradually over time, and politicians occasionally complained about the coarsening of the culture, which mostly meant griping about the plot of Murphy Brown or the presence of uncovered butt cheeks on NYPD Blue. Television was understood as a system for the transmission of common cultural values, and, as a result, it remained fairly tame.</p><p>Cable brought a new edge to the medium. Ad-supported networks like Comedy Central and A&amp;E offered niche programming to self-selected audiences. HBO's subscription service, freed from FCC paternalism, could show blood and bare breasts and let characters say any flippity-flappin' words they wanted. But even as cable wormed its way into more and more homes in the 1980s and 1990s, it remained a lesser venue, a dumpingground for reruns and inexpensive programming, with high-quality originals few and far between.</p><p>And then, at the turn of the 21st century, that changed. The Shield, Nip/Tuck, The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men, Breaking Bad--even a remake of Battlestar Galactica--demonstrated not only that cable channels could compete with big broadcast networks on original programming but that they could produce elevated material that appealed to both critics and small but intensely devoted viewerships who weren't well-served by existing shows. The new TV wasn't designed to be fine for everyone. It was designed to be great for a targeted few.</p><p>Suddenly, everybody with a video camera and a distribution platform wanted in. Cable networks from The History Channel to TV Land to USA began devoting more resources to scripted original programming. It wasn't too long before Netflix, a DVD-by-mail company that later launched a streaming service-think HBO in the '80s, but on demand--joined the original content game too.</p><p>Unlike broadcast networks, which had to rely on imperfect audience surveys and Nielsen ratings, Netflix had direct access to viewership data, meaning it knew exactly what subscribers were watching, and when, and how often. The company had three major revelations.</p><p>The first was that television-style content, which on both cable and broadcast had always been delivered on a specific schedule, in a linear sequence over the space of weeks, could be divorced from time. Netflix not only allowed viewers to watch its shows whenever they wanted, it posted entire seasons online at once and then encouraged viewers to \"binge-watch,\" or consume the whole thing all in one go. Appointment TV, in which you regularly dated a show you liked, was no more; Netflix was TV as a series of intense one-night stands.</p><p>The second revelation was that TV could be portable. Netflix was an app, not a channel, which meant you could watch it on your computer, on your phone, in your car, and possibly even on your refrigerator. Netflix shows came to you, wherever you were. The service was platform agnostic.</p><p>Finally, Netflix realized that demand for new scripted content was practically infinite and began producing accordingly. In 2013, the year Netflix committed itself fully to originals, the total number of scripted series produced annually across all of Hollywood jumped by 17 percent.</p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, fewer than 5O original scripted television series were produced each year. In 2008, there were more than 200. By 2018, the number was just shy of 500, and streaming networks were the biggest producers. Netflix, which will reportedly spend $15 billion on content this year, wasn't competing with ABC and NBC and CBS. It wasn't even really competing with HBO. It was competing with the entire rest of one's life, with 24 hours of things to do that aren't watching Netflix. CEO Reed Hastings said in 2017, \"We actually compete with sleep.\" Then he added, perhaps not entirely kidding, \"And we're winning!\"</p><p>THROUGH A BLACK MIRROR</p><p>IT WAS AROUND this point that television began to lose its definition. After all, what was TV if not a thing that came into your home at a specific time, on a recurring schedule? What was television if not something you watched on a television? Netflix and its early competitors had broken the fundamental laws of the television universe.</p><p>The new television didn't just mean more TV. It meant a different kind of TV. It meant shows that didn't cater to the median viewer and that, in many cases, asked more from their audiences than casual background appreciation. That's how Netflix ended up with shows as varied as Bo Jack Horseman, an animated dramedy about a talking horse dealing with depression, and The Crown, abig-budget costume drama about British monarchs, and The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, a 10-episode prequel to the 1982 Jim Henson cult fantasy film with an all-puppet cast. And it's how the streamer ended up with Daybreak, a forthcoming series starring Matthew Broderick set in Glendale, California, about post-apocalyptic teen gangs that the company describes as \"part samurai saga, part endearing coming-of-age story, and part Battle Royale.\" It's like Fortnite meets Ferris Bueller.</p><p>This is weird territory. The boom in scripted television has been a boon for concepts that are unusual, offbeat, and downright wacky. As Ted Sarandos, Netflix's head of content, told New York magazine in 2018, \"Nothing is too niche.\"</p><p>Yet in its own way, Netflix is pursuing a median strategy--not with any one show, but with the totality of its programming. The idea isn't to appeal to everyone all at once but to appeal to everyone in fragments and pieces, serving one narrow interest at a time. That's why, in addition to investing heavily in scripted series, Netflix is backing feature films at nearly every budget level, from genre fare that has gone out of fashion at major studios (romantic comedies, teen sci-fi adventures) to big-budget Oscar hopefuls like Alfonso Cuaron's Best Picture-nominated Roma and the forthcoming Martin Scorsese crime epic The Irishman, which stars Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci. The company put up $200 million for Red Notice, an action thriller featuring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds. Ten Netflix films are scheduled to debut theatrically before the end of the year.</p><p>Netflix is also experimenting with more-novel formats, as in Bandersnatch, a Black Mirror special designed as an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure story. It's a video game disguised as a movie based on a television series owned by a tech company that makes more TV than any actual TV network. That's what television is today.</p><p>WHY JEFF BEZOS IS SPENDING $250 MILLION ON LORD OF THE RINGS</p><p>NETFLIX ISN'T THE only one breaking rules and busting budgets. Amazon Prime Video has been churning out high-quality scripted shows for years, often splashing out huge sums for well-known properties and talent. The company lured Julia Roberts, once the biggest female movie star on the planet, onto the small screen for Homecoming, a half-hour drama based on a podcast about a military conspiracy. It spent $250 million for the rights to make a television series based on Lord of the Rings. Amazon gives the services away as part of a package deal with Amazon Prime, which entitles subscribers to free two-day shipping on many of the products the company sells.</p><p>Why is Amazon paying Julia Roberts to appear on television and making a Lord of the Rings show? Partly because Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, which means he doesn't need a reason. Partly because he's a nerd. (Bezos, a known sci-fi fan, also had his company acquire the rights to the intrasolar space epic The Expanse after it was canceled on its original home, the cable network SyFy.)</p><p>But mostly because Amazon wants to sell you more dog food. Or toilet paper. Or Virginia Postrel books. Or batteries or bottles of passion fruit concentrate or actual televisions (after you demo them at Best Buy). It doesn't matter, really. Amazon, which, like Netflix, has a mass of data on its users' habits, has long known that Prime subscribers spend far more than non-subscribers, so it is laying out $6 billion for video content this year to make that subscription more enticing. It's just another perk, like flat-fee grocery delivery.</p><p>Amazon is also in the content business for the simple reason that it is a tech company with money. This similarly explains the existence of Facebook Watch, a service that, despite its relatively low profile, claimed 75 million daily viewers for such shows as Sorry for Your Loss, starring Elizabeth Olsen as a young widow, and Sacred Lies, about an ex-cult member. Facebook is in the spending-time-on-Facebook business, and TV shows give people a new way to spend time. Tinder, the popular dating app, recently announced Swipe Night, a four-episode, choose-your-own-adventure \"series\" that is part video game, part soap opera, designed to serve as a first-date activity. Why Netflix and chill when you can Tinder and hook up?</p><p>This also helps justify the existence of Apple TV+, a new service debuting in November with an array of heavyweight titles, I including new shows from A-list creators Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams. The Morning Show, a glossy insider drama about a morning talk program, starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell, cost a reported $15 million per episode--the same as the final season of HBO's fantasy epic Game of Thrones.</p><p>Apple has money, and it is trying to figure out its future in a world where everyone who wants an iPhone already has one. So it's making television... about television.</p><p>At the September event where it announced the launch date of its new service, Apple also announced a major new foray into mobile video games, including Beyond a Steel Sky, a sequel to a cult favorite 1994 adventure game featuring design work by Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons. In some loose sense this is television too, a lavishly produced, partially scripted thing you watch on a screen, the goal of which is to capture your attention (and perhaps sell you another screen).</p><p>And then there is Disney. Like Apple, it has money. And like Netflix, it's in the business of producing entertainment for both the small and the big screens. (As of this summer, four of 2019's top five domestic box-office hits were Disney films.) But Disney also has theme parks, and plush toys, and T-shirts, and lunch boxes, all of which are adorned with its characters. And Disney's movies, especially those set in the world of Marvel Comics characters (Iron Man, Captain America, and the rest of the Avengers), have increasingly taken the form of big-budget, big-screen shows--serialized, multi-character, episodic programming about friends who hang out, work together, and just happen to have superpowers. Disney's new streaming service will feature several series based on those same heroes, with stories that connect to the larger cinematic plotline, joining TV and movies more closely than we've ever seen before.</p><p>MURDER HOUSE FLIP IS A REAL SHOW</p><p>HAVE YOU HEARD of Quibi? You will. Launching in April 2020, it's the brainchild of former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, who raised more than $ 1 billion for a channel devoted to making short-form content designed to be watched on mobile devices. Among other projects, Quibi is planning a phone-sized remake of The Fugitive, starring Kiefer Sutherland, and a \"true-crime home renovation series\" called Murder House Flip.</p><p>Or maybe you won't hear about it. No one knows which of these services will become the next Netflix and which will become the next Pets.com. Indeed, among the front-runners for failure is Netflix itself. Despite a massive customer base and associated revenues, the streaming giant burns enormous amounts of cash on its content and has recently missed subscriber growth targets. And it faces stiff competition from the new services being launched by Apple and Disney, both of which will initially cost less than a typical Netflix subscription.</p><p>The problem for Netflix is that creating and selling access to shows is its core business. If you don't subscribe, it doesn't make money.</p><p>For Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and to some extent Disney, TV shows are a secondary product. Sure, they'll take your money every month. But Amazon only needs you to buy trash bags, and Apple only needs you to buy iPhones, and Disney just needs you (or your child) to love Star Wars and to buy lunch boxes and theme park tickets accordingly. Since you already love Star Wars, own an iPhone, and need trash bags, Disney, Apple, and Amazon are probably going to be OK.</p><p>A BILLION DOLLARS FOR BIG BANG THEORY?</p><p>THIS IS THE reality of the streaming era: There is a lot of television. And there is going to be a lot more of it--much, much more than anyone can ever watch. It will be weirder and less constrained by time or platform or format conventions than ever before.</p><p>The benefits for consumers are obvious: an endless supply of high-quality filmed entertainment, some of it truly great, much of it pretty good, none of it subject to federal prudishness. By displacing the broadcast networks as the primary outlet for scripted series, the streaming boom takes the FCC out of the content production process, reducing its power as a censor.</p><p>At least for now, these services are not expensive. Apple TV+ will cost $5 per month and be free for the first year if you purchase any Apple device. Disney's opening price is $6.99 per month. Even following several rounds of price increases, Netflix's |standard plan is just $12.99 per month. HBO Max, which will bundle HBO originals with other content from WarnerMedia, the company that owns the cable network, is expected to be the most expensive at $15-$17 per month. That's comparable to the cost of adding HBO to a cable subscription, while delivering an even greater wealth of content.</p><p>Speaking of cable subscriptions, the streaming boom threatens to render them obsolete--sort of. In the '90s and '00s, politicians and regulators regularly pushed to require cable companies to offer their services a la carte--allowing customers to buy only the channels they want. This was thought to be family-friendly (you could block channels you deem inappropriate for kids) as well as a way to save money (no more larded-up cable packages). Unbundling was a political imperative.</p><p>Streaming services accomplished this without legislation or regulation. Netflix offers a kid-friendly variant and password protection for adult accounts. Cord cutters can skip the cable TV package and pick their favorite streaming options. Yet the coming glut of services means that an ambitious unbundler who wants access to everything could end up paying, in total, about the same amount he previously did for cable, especially once prices inevitably rise. And the underlying internet service itself is still provided by a cable or phone company.</p><p>So this is what television is now: a system designed to maximize entertainment opt ionality, to ensure that not only is there always something you could watch, but there's always something you--specifically, individually, uniquely you--actually want to watch. Television, that old vehicle for the transmission of common culture, has become a tool for choosing and expressing what makes each one of us singular.</p><p>The quirks of the concepts, the variety of the delivery systems, the emphasis on serving ever-tinier niche audiences, and the sheer volume of material being produced might seem overwhelming. But all this is designed to produce a world in which there is something to appeal to every obscure interest, every microdemographic, every autonomous and idiosyncratic individual. The ultimate niche audience is just one person. We're not quite there yet. But the streaming era moves us closer.</p><p>And yet neither is the common culture dead. In September, Netflix agreed to pay $500 million for the rights to that classic of network-era television, Seinfeld. The same week, WarnerMedia agreed to pay a reported $1 billion for The Big Bang Theory, one of the longest-running and most successful network shows of the last two decades, which will air exclusively on HBO Max. Just a few months prior, the company agreed to pay $425 million to take over the rights--from Netflix--to another classic show: Friends.</p><p>Whatever television is today, and whatever it eventually becomes, it's still what television used to be, too.</p><p>PETER SUDERMAN is features editor at Reason.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-606944411</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 606944411</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM8-50P1-JCBJ-K1XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Reason Foundation</copyright><publicationName>Reason</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0048-6906</issn><volume>Vol. 51</volume><issueNumber>No. 7\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Cable TV Networks</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Humanities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Philosophy and religion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political science</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cable networks (Television)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Security guards</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjJBNjQ3RjNENTI2NEVCQkJFMTI4RTMxNzIyM0QyNjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Network Programming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzA3RTM0NUYzODI1NDQ0MEFGMUYwREVFMjlCQTQxNDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDcwRjUwMDk0RkU3NDkxMjk4ODU4NzMwOEZDNkIyOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Cries that a combined Uber and GrubHub[4] could control up to 90% of the food-delivery market are overblown, according to chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi.As everyone from grocery stores to independent restaurants and chains make the switch to delivery amid the coronavirus pandemic, the market is growing too rapidly for any one business to grab such a dominating lead, he says.\"This market is much broader than some people are presenting it to be,\" Khosrowshahi told Kara Swisher on an episode of Recode's Decode podcast published Monday[5]. \"Restaurants deliver directly, Dominoes, et cetera, delivers directly, grocery is delivered directly including hot food, so I think that I would disagree with the definition of market. This market just got bigger I think that this delivery of food and essentials to homes is an enormous market, and I don't see any one or any two having 90% of that market. </p><p>It's way too big a market.\"Indeed, the market share of a combined GrubHub and Uber may not reach 90%. Depending on which estimates you read, the delivery powerhouse could command upwards of 50% of the US market, but most fall short of the 90% figure. Still, as reports of the merger talks began to leak, pushback came swiftly from Democratic lawmakers who called the unconfirmed move \"pandemic profiteering\" and urged federal regulators to scrutinize any forthcoming deal.\"We always have to be concerned with their concern because these are important people that you'd have to listen to,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"We have been a highly regulated and locally regulated business for a long time and will continue to be. If the concern comes from restaurant partners making sure that the restaurant business is sustainable and they can grow. If the concern comes from couriers getting paid, that's a great concern. If it's from people being able to afford this, the food being affordable and available to everybody, we are aligned in that direction.\"But, like ride-hailing, the food-delivery industry will need some form of consolidation and rationalization in order to fully thrive, he warned. In rides, for example, both Uber and Lyft had to work toward fewer coupons and promotions to pad profits and ease financial losses for the segment. In delivery, it all comes down to scale.\"The thing is, no one's really making money in this business,\" Khosrowshahi continued. \"So the business itself has to be sustainable, and it has to be sustainable in a way that works for restaurants, works for couriers, and works for people who are ordering the food and it works for business, as well. So things are going to change. And we'll definitely listen to the opinions of regulators.\"After taking out what Uber pays to couriers, Khosrowshahi said the company makes about 12% of any order's total. The goal, he said, is to get that figure closer to 15% by \"scaling the business and really, really growing it.\"Khosrowshahi also took a shot at DoorDash, which in 2019 was found to be including some tips to couriers as part of guaranteed minimum earnings[6], instead of passing them directly to workers.\"There were competitors who were kind of messing around with tipping being part of earnings,\" he said. \"We never did that. We will not do that.\"Neither GrubHub nor Uber has confirmed any of the merger talks, which were reported by many outlets including Bloomberg, The New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal. Most recently, reports said the talks hinged upon a share-ratio for the all-stock deal, which would give GrubHub investors a set number of Uber shares following the deal.\"Can we get better? Yes. But we're building these businesses in the right way,\" Khosrowshahi said, \"and I think when we have a dialogue with regulators, the press will hold everyone accountable. I think that's the power of the press, and that's a good thing. I think people will find that we are one of the good actors and as we grow this business, we can set a standard that others can follow.\"You can listen to the full interview here.[7] Loading Something is loading.

It was everything she had worked and studied so hard for.</p><p>While online learning has been difficult, she has managed to persevere. But the latest ICE announcement had shaken her.</p><p>\"Now we are forced to choose between our health and our current future legal presence in the US,\" says the 20-year-old. \"I would like to say I am shocked, but quite frankly it is to be expected, especially with this administration. Still, I am heartened to see the college-sponsored lawsuits filed to overturn this decree, but remain anxious for a positive solution.\"</p><p>Marianna Villonco, University of San Francisco</p><p>\"Studying in the US has always been a dream of mine,\" says Marianna Villonco, a recent graduate of St. Paul's College, Pasig. \"Once the admission decisions came out, it came as a pleasant surprise to my family and myself that I was offered admission to all of the schools I applied. Not many opportunities like these come often, so I didn't let this slip away.\"</p><p>Marianna Villonco is an incoming freshman at the University of San Francisco (USF), where she plans to study finance. She chose USF because of the generous scholarship she worked hard to receive.

In the upcoming school year, she is excited to immerse herself in a new country that she is sure will help her grow as an individual.</p><p>On the latest announcement of ICE, the 18-year-old says, \"It's frustrating knowing there are one million international students affected by it.\"</p><p>Marianna is one of the lucky ones, a dual Filipino-American citizen. Nonetheless, she adds, \"I am deeply worried for my friends who are affected by this because they have to suddenly rethink the decisions and plans they have made.\"</p><p>Due to her dual citizenship, Marianna is considered a domestic student. As such, USF offered her the option to swap classes with international students who may need particular in-person courses for visa reasons. But that may not be enough to help the international students.</p><p>\"Although USF has [revised] options for modes of instruction,\" she says, \"some friends are left with no choice since a number of visa appointments were canceled or postponed.\"</p><p>Aldrin Aujero, Yale University</p><p>\"I decided to study in the US to maximize the scholarship opportunity that Yale generously provided,\" says Aldrin Aujero.

Initially excited for what the next chapter of her life holds, the recent news has caused some nervousness and apprehension.</p><p>\"I was shocked that the US administration would use international students as a pressure point to force schools into re-opening,\" says Axelle. \"I had previously believed that the US government cared about the health of its citizens. And that they valued the international students who chose to study at their schools. It now appears, however, that their priorities are elsewhere.\"</p><p>As an incoming first-year student, the 18-year-old has been dissapointed with the lack of support. Many have been unable to apply for visas in time because the US embassies have remained closed and no other options were provided.</p><p>\"I genuinely hope that the ICE and the US government reconsider this new policy,\" she adds. \"So they can create a safer, more welcoming environment in which domestic and international students are able to safely enjoy their studies in the coming year.\"</p><p>CAPTION(S):</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-629517172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 629517172</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CH-7SH1-DYTM-90N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Manila Bulletin Publishing Corp.</copyright><publicationName>Manila Bulletin</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 14, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US IMMIGRATION &amp;

Mr Sims said he did not think Google would seek to block news content from users as there was clearly value in the distribution for the tech giants, with news -stories going well beyond just Google News.</p><p>\"I don't think Google wants to run a platform completely devoid of all media content,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think that would be a strange way to run a platform and it might open them up to competition from a source that they may not want.\" Josh Frydenberg said it was \"time the tech titans were held to account\" as he declared the plan would force Google and Facebook to pay millions of dollars a year to publishers. \"It is time the tech titans were held to account and we have genuine competition, we have a level playing field, we have more transparency, and we get payment for original journalistic content.\" The Treasurer said there were a \"number of different options\" to force the tech giants to pay media companies, with a model to be designed by the ACCC.</p><p>\"You can do it on a value -option, or you can do it on a cost option, meaning that the tech -titans would end up paying a fraction of what the cost was for producing that original content every time that they use it,\" Mr Frydenberg said.</p><p>\"The other alternative is in terms of the value to that particular digital platform that they get from getting eyeballs on to their sites by using that content.\" He said the government would not bow to the threats of Google and Facebook that -occurred through attempted crackdowns in France and Spain.</p><p>\"In France, the digital platforms said they wouldn't show domestic media unless it was for free,\" he said.</p><p>\"The domestic media companies all said this was a misuse of market power, which now the French regulator is investigating. But we understand the challenge we face.\" While Mr Sims would not speculate on a model for the new code, he said it would be dependent on defining news, as well as governing transparency of news ranking, data sharing and revenue sharing.</p><p>\"Different people have different views on what constitutes news,\" he said. \"Then it's got to deal with transparency of news ranking and data sharing, but also it will deal with the value-sharing payment for content issues.\" News Corp (publisher of The Australian) has previously told the ACCC that all major news publishers in Australia - including the ABC - should come to an agreement with the tech giants before content can continue to be displayed on platforms.</p><p>This would stop a \"divide and conquer\" tactic by Google and Facebook that would allow one publisher on the platform at the expense of others.</p><p>Facebook Australia's managing director, Will Easton, said the company was \"disappointed\" by the government decision, given that it had invested \"millions of dollars\" to support local -publishers.</p><p>A spokesman for Google said the US-based tech giant had begun constructive talks with 25 Australian publishers and was committed to continuing talks under the compulsory code.EDITORIAL P11</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-ab3b85fc82b411eabe53753ad749af5106e8fe711f957e7bcb8bf6dd2d09ffe3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPT-M3C1-F0JP-W534-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We also need political leadership that recognizes regulators often know far less about socially beneficial economic interests than major business owners. President  Trump seems to get this. Robert Reich, however, does not.I note this in light of Reich's article for the Guardian, in which the Clinton administration labor secretary calls on the government to break up major tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. </p><p>Reich says that this is necessary for two reasons: because this corporate power \"stifles innovation\" and affords big tech undue \"political clout.\" Both rationales are wrong and require repudiation. On the first count, innovation, Reich points to U.S. government data which suggest that the rate at which new job-creating businesses have been created since 2004 has halved. He suggests \"big tech\u2019s sweeping patents, data, growing networks and dominant platforms have become formidable barriers to new entrants.\" Yet the data are more complicated. It shows that while high-skill businesses are forming at largely static rates, the growth rate trend for businesses with a high likelihood of becoming active job creators is slowly up-ticking. A little hint here: if an author provides a link that forms the data linchpin of their argument, make sure you click the link yourself. Incidentally, the census report's concluding line also suggests that it might be high-tax and high-regulation business environments that are to blame for lower-than-desired business creation rates.Regardless, the central issue here is whether Reich is correct that the data show big tech is stifling innovation. And I do not believe that's the case. For one, there is little high-value business creation even in markets such as the European Union where U.S. tech companies must grapple with extensive regulations that are designed to limit their competitive power against smaller European companies. The real reason that we haven't seen more business creation is not because big tech consolidates power, but rather because big tech firms are the best innovators. Put simply, they are doing their job better than anyone else. And while it's true that big tech companies are active in buying out smaller innovators, even that activity isn't necessarily problematic. That's because those who have been bought out are free to set up new innovative companies with the capital they have earned from their first sales. Neither is it true that big tech firms do not compete. Apple and Google are great competitors, and firms such as Walmart are now competing online with firms like Amazon.Reich's argument that big tech has too much political power is even less impressive. The facts simply do not bear his claim out. After all, President Trump regularly attacks Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Congress has hardly been friendly to Facebook and Twitter in recent months. I suspect that Reich's real intention in including this claim of outsize political influence is to stir up the Guardian's left-wing readership (such readers always see corporate conspiracies lurking closely).Ultimately, though, the simple point is this: Big tech has been good for jobs, good for consumers, and good for the U.S. economy. And as the world grows more wealthy and its citizens have the means to seek out higher value goods, big tech and thus the U.S. will have the most to benefit. But only, that is, if we protect the right of companies to grow big and make a lot of money. Antitrust legislation remains on the books, but we shouldn't reach for that solution unless a specific malady has been identified. In this case, it has not been.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2138197558</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TV4-YCF1-DY0W-424T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ff15dc7-be90-4676-8121-5a868016c4bb\"> US economy shrank</url> by a tenth in the second quarter \u2014 almost a third if you annualise the numbers. Unemployment is now trending back up. Yet as its first pandemic relief package expires today, Congress is nowhere near to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a65a1086-8ac1-401f-9c76-74eb87a9bf10\"> reaching a deal</url> to keep people\u2019s heads above water. </p><p>Had America taken steps to flatten the viral curve, the economy could now be slowly getting back on its feet. Schools would be preparing to reopen next month and large employers would be readying for at least a modest return to office routines. That opportunity has been thrown away. Google caught the headlines this week by saying its employees will <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/tech/google-work-from-home-extension/index.html\"> stay at home</url> until summer 2021. It was no different to the conclusions being drawn by hundreds of thousands of small businesses, college campuses, retail outlets and service centres across the US. </p><p>America is not winning the war on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\"> pandemic</url>. It barely even seems to be fighting it. There seems to be very little prospect it can turn the corner before early 2021.</p><p>I don\u2019t give investment advice. But it\u2019s fair to conclude that the Federal Reserve is doing everything it can for the US economy. This week chairman Jay Powell stated the obvious, which was that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/938a5387-778d-4f9e-8aed-53d2a332c7af\"> Fed\u2019s stance</url> would be dependent on the path of the virus. That was good news for Treasury bonds since there is no end in sight to Covid-19, which means the US central bank will keep the spigots on for the foreseeable future. It may be the only well-functioning institution around. </p><p>But we should not take too much heart from the fact that many sectors of the US economy are relying solely on the Fed to prevent catastrophe. Alas, Mr Powell is not in charge of fiscal policy (or public health guidelines, for that matter). In the absence of serious national leadership, what should we expect in the coming months?</p><p>More of the same, or worse unfortunately. In the past few days, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f2a727e-7aa2-4990-8e47-c9e1f0959490\"> US mortality rate</url> has crept back up to well above a thousand a day, or roughly one a minute. That\u2019s about double where it was in late May before the virus had fully spread to the south. And it is about half the level it was at in late April when New York and New Jersey were at their peaks. There are some signs the crisis is abating in Florida and Texas. But the disease is now springing up in other parts of the south and the Midwest. It continues to wreak a vengeful resurgence on California. </p><p>There is no possibility of an effective <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a983341f-4066-4ace-8b0a-43f4c82d63a9\"> vaccine</url> being ready for mass distribution before the end of the year. It would be ambitious to expect that in the first half of 2021. Which means that at best America faces another nine months to a year of what it has been undergoing since March. </p><p>As I have written before, Covid-19 is beguilingly simple compared to other global challenges. We just need a good vaccine. In the meantime, we must rely on the quality of our governance systems to keep the economy afloat and our children at least semi-educated. I see little prospect of that for the remainder of 2020. </p><p>Rana, I know you\u2019re going on vacation soon and are in the mood to take a respite from gloom.

I live in New York, where despite being in a stage 4 reopening, cases are not surging again, because we have a governor who has gotten people to do the simple stuff like wear masks.

That is feeding through to extraordinary growth in prices, mainly on the east coast of Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Tuesday, Michele Bullock, who is the RBA's assistant governor (financial system), had good reason to boast about the effectiveness of previous macroprudential measures. She told a Bloomberg conference in Sydney that in 2014 regulators had no choice but to put \"sand in the gears\" of the housing boom with a limit on the annual growth in investor lending.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A second leg of the macroprudential response was to set some more prescriptive guidelines for home loan serviceability assessments and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority intensified its scrutiny of lending practices.</p><p>\"There is no doubt that the actions did address some of the risks,\" Bullock said. \"Nevertheless, the early experience suggests that, while the resilience of both borrowers and lenders has no doubt improved, the initial effects on credit and some other indicators we use to assess risk may fade over time.</p><p>\"We are continuing to monitor their ongoing effects and are prepared to do more if needed.\"</p><p>Westpac Banking Corp chief executive Brian Hartzer told Chanticleer on Tuesday that the RBA faced a difficult challenge because they had to, on the one hand, support parts of the economy with low interest rates, while avoiding a housing price bubble.</p><p>Hartzer does not believe Australia is in the midst of a housing asset bubble. He says there is no evidence in Westpac's housing lending data that investors are buying houses for a \"quick flip\" to another buyer.</p><p>But he says Bullock's comments highlight the need for action by state and local governments to ease the barriers to new housing development. He thinks there needs to be co-ordinated policy action to fill the demand supply gap.</p><p>Hartzer is positive about the recent data showing foreign buyers were responsible for purchasing about 11 per cent of NSW homes. The data from the NSW Office of State Revenue found that foreign citizens accounted for 11 per cent of the 28,141 residential homes purchased in NSW from July to September last year.</p><p>The fact that Chinese buyers accounted for 32 per cent of these buyers was not a surprise to Hartzer. He can understand why Chinese nationals would want to live in Australia and take advantage of the high quality standard of living, including the education system.</p><p>He says foreign investment has been a feature of Australia for many years and continues to support the financing of new unit developments which, in turn, helps to resolve the lack of supply in the residential market.</p><p>Hartzer thinks the capital controls in China will eventually have an impact on the amount of money being invested in the Australian housing market.</p><p>Lessons in Mobileye deal</p><p>The Israeli technology industry is used to record-making mega deals, but that has not stopped a buzz of excitement in the country's tech sector in the wake of Intel's $US15.16 billion takeover of Mobileye.</p><p>There are several universal lessons from the takeover of this Jerusalem-based software company, which develops visual information processing applications for driver assistance systems. According to Tel Aviv-based tech investor Ben Weiss the first lesson is that there is no such thing as an overnight success.</p><p>Mobileye was founded 18 years ago. It took 15 years to go from private hands to publicly listed company. Its initial public offering was in 2014.</p><p>\"Mobileye has been record-setting in many aspects, including the power of patience and persistence as the market woke up to the big opportunity and use case for its technology,\" Weiss says.</p><p>The second lesson is that equity is a brilliant tool for motivating staff in tech companies. There were reports on Tuesday that the Mobileye transaction had generated the largest takeover premium paid in any M&amp;A deal this century. That is hard to believe given Dealogic said the premium to the one-month share price was 39.71 per cent.</p><p>However, Nomura analysts said the premium to the three-month share price was 51 per cent, which is less than the 55 per cent premium paid for Altera by Intel in 2015. Either way, Intel is paying a huge price to gain market leadership in autonomous driving. Using Intel's takeover price of $US63.54 a share, Mobileye is valued at 41 times its earnings.</p><p>The Mobileye deal is three times bigger than the largest previous Israeli exit of $US5 billion in 2013 when Cisco acquired NDS from News Corp.</p><p>Mobileye has 543 employees and there is a minimum payment to staff of $US1.2 billion. That means the average payment to each employee will be about $US2 million. There was speculation in Israel on Tuesday that the minimum payment to junior staff would be $US250,000.</p><p>Another lesson from this deal is that Israel has once again shown its capacity to anticipate the big technology trends and not be daunted by the fact it does not manufacture the core products that will benefit from technological change.</p><p>According to Tel-Aviv tech investor Gilad Greenbaum this should hold lessons for Australia. Greenbaum says the global car industry saw Apple and Google entering the market with plans to develop autonomous vehicles and that fuelled panic.</p><p>\"The car makers in the USA, Germany and Japan were quick to place more funds towards R&amp;D in the area,\" he says. \"The Israeli tech industry saw the opportunity and within just a few years more than 100 tech companies were established here to mitigate the car industry fears.\"</p><p>Greenbaum names the following Israeli start-ups as being at the forefront of automotive tech: Nexar, Otonomo, Argus and Karamba Security. Others are Innviz and Oryx which are developing driving kits similar to Mobileye.</p><p>Greenbaum says it is not too late for Australia to shift its automotive expertise to meet the hunger for tech and grow a smart automotive industry.</p><p>He says one reason Israel was quick to make headway with autonomous driving technologies was because it did not have a car industry. \"It actually helped a lot to not have the lobbying and pressure groups representing old world industries.\"</p><p>Greenbaum sees the race for leadership in autonomous driving as a battle between the big car companies and the big tech companies. This battle has fuelled an incredible land grab for the best and brightest in autonomous driving technology.</p><p>VW paid $US300 million for Gett, which was previously known as Get Taxi. VW also bought a 40 per cent stake in CyMotiv, a new start-up for automotive cyber security.</p><p>Daimler Benz opened an R&amp;D centre in Israel in October last year after collaborating with a few start-ups in Israel, including chip vendor Valens and smart glass company Gauzy.</p><p>Greenbaum believes the really big winner from this battle will be Daimler Benz. He also thinks the market has not worked this out yet.</p><p>\"The massively underpriced Daimler Benz remains the only automotive company in the world besides Tesla possessing a complete set of technology for both electrical car and autonomous cars,\" he says.</p><p>\"Its reputation for manufacturing excellent cars and its strategic agreement with Uber means its current share price is a steal. I think it is 30 per cent underpriced and expect it to correct towards $US100 a share in 2017.\"</p><p>Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in New York told clients on Tuesday that the premium paid for Mobileye was justified given its strategic position, its dominant position in the critical data space, and its seat at the table which will accelerate Intel's mobility ambitions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6u1yznn2nd31mis9j98a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N35-6TM1-F0J6-J0P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1284\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The flooding rains, coupled with \"the accompanying moisture in the air,\" caused \"condensation\" to form on the LVCC's \"electrical equipment which eventually led to the failure,\" said Handel. The National Weather Service reported that a record 1.33 inches of rain inundated Las Vegas Tuesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Though Central Hall plays home at CES to the largest tech companies in the world, \"we have no evidence\" that the huge power draw from the exhibits on the show floor contributed to the blackout, said Handel. \"We have worked closely with CES, and our many other full-facility shows, to ensure that we have sufficient power for their more than 2.5 million square feet of exhibits,\" said Handel. LVCVA is working with the local power company, NV Energy, \"to evaluate the situation and determine next steps to prevent a similar occurrence in the future,\" he said.</p><p>NV Energy representatives didn't comment Thursday, but sources friendly to the utility said it had no culpability for the outage. NV Energy supplies high-voltage service to the LVCC, which in turn uses transformers to lower that voltage and send the power to service all the facility's electrical needs, said the sources. When residual dripping water from Tuesday's heavy rains caused something to arc in one of the transformers, NV Energy's high-voltage service sensed the problem and tripped a safety breaker system, they said. The utility responded quickly to help LVCVA identify the problem and suggest ways to get the facility back online, they said.</p><p>Though power was restored to Central Hall by 1:30 p.m. PST, tech journalist Grant Clauser tweeted at 2:02 p.m. that Samsung still wasn't letting anyone enter its booth. Samsung didn't comment Thursday, nor did other Central Hall exhibiting companies we canvassed, except for Casio. \"As with any major event or trade show, we are always prepared for instances like what happened yesterday at CES,\" said a Casio spokeswoman. \"While it was an unexpected interruption, we found that everyone -- from customers to media -- has been very flexible and we're rescheduling any missed opportunities. We look forward to a productive conclusion to the show.\" CES ends its four-day run Friday at 4 p.m. PST.</p><p>Twitter users kept weighing in on the blackout long after the lights came back on. \"Wonder how fast they locked all the stands down to keep the toys from disappearing in the dark?\" tweeted one. \"I have to say that today's blackout at is a lesson for all of us tech nerds,\" tweeted another. \"Without power, this connected future we envision isn't much, eh? Power is the air for tech.\"</p><p>CES Notebook</p><p>CTA President Gary Shapiro hosted the governors of three leading \"innovation\" states to discuss how they're creating a tech-friendly climate. Shapiro said it was the first time he remembers three governors on the same stage at CES. Rick Snyder, Republican governor of Michigan, said his state \"led the world\" on innovation through World War II, then lost its way. \"We were too successful,\" he said. \"You can't take things for granted. The world changed. We didn't.\" The state has cut taxes and regulations and focused on bringing in engineers and IT professionals and other skilled workers, Snyder said. \"We are the world's leader in mobility, in autonomous and connected vehicles,\" he said. Snyder said a world of autonomous vehicles will pose new challenges. \"What happens to truck drivers, delivery drivers?\" he asked. \"How do we train them for new careers?\" Montana farmers are using lasers, pinpoint applications and other connected technologies, said Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, a Democrat. There's \"scrappy innovation occurring in corners across our state,\" he said. A governor has to be prepared to say to local universities, \"I want a two-year program, I want to make sure that we're providing what our employers and what our innovators need,\" Bullock said. Also appearing with Shapiro was Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R).</p><p>Police and other first responders likely will have uses for the IoT, 5G and maybe even autonomous vehicles, said speakers on FirstNet panels at CES Thursday. \"We want to connect the in-car platform with the body-worn camera platform\" for livestreaming at times, said Chicago Police Department Chief-Technical Services Jonathan Lewin. \"We're not going to have the bandwidth, even with FirstNet, to be real-time streaming all the time.\" The two types of cameras can use wireless to connect, and can upload data, he noted, though \"it becomes a fairly significant cost issue to get there. We will. It just takes time.\" With self-driven automobiles, he said he sees \"great potential there both for improved officer safety and for improved public safety\" and personally thinks the police could use unstaffed autos. Applications like the ShotSpotter gunshot locating service can \"suffer from latency issues,\" but \"we'll take whatever speeds we can get,\" Lewin said. Other panelists agreed some public-safety applications could use 5G, too. AT&amp;T's partnership with FirstNet means the public safety network \"gets to take advantage\" of coming improvements on the carrier's network, said Matt Walsh, the company's director-IoT business development.</p><p>Net neutrality turmoil and increasing skepticism about tech company dominance are big challenges for an industry that largely has enjoyed strong consumer support and light scrutiny by Congress and regulators, said tech and civil society groups at a CES panel Wednesday on the internet economy. The 2016 election was a game changer in focusing attention on fake news and hate speech, forcing tech companies to make decisions on managing controversial content, said Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"The government is asking the private sector to do things they couldn't do on their own,\" she said. Startup companies are particularly worried about the outcome of net neutrality rules, said Engine Policy Director Rachel Wolbers. While initially skeptical about why startups were so concerned about net neutrality before joining Engine, Wolbers said she \"quickly realized how important it is for them to have a level playing field.\" The 2015 net neutrality order provided that certainty by putting bright line rules around what ISPs can and can't do. \"We feel like now those rules have been taken away it will be harder for startups to compete,\" Wolbers said. Engine is concerned about legislation to curb online sex trafficking that's picking up steam in Congress and raises tricky issues especially for small websites, Wolbers said. The Senate hotlined the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (S-1693) Wednesday but Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who has long opposed the bill (See 1801030047), put a hold on it, Wolbers said. \"The House has a better approach\" with the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (HR-1865), which has 173 co-sponsors. \"We are hopeful that can be passed,\" she said. It's unclear whether the two measures could be reconciled since they take very different approaches, she said in response to our question on the future for the legislation. SESTA supporters planned a rally Thursday to draw attention to the bill, which has 64 co-sponsors, with Sen. Rob Portman, D-Ohio, leading the push to get the bill onto the Senate floor. Panelists also expressed concern about the increasing skepticism around big tech and calls to evaluate antitrust issues (see 1712150045). TechFreedom Executive Director Austin Carson urged caution on any new regulations or laws aimed specifically at a technology. \"If you're writing a technology-specific law, you're probably doing it wrong and it will be outdated very soon,\" he said, citing cybersecurity information sharing legislation as an example of where the market addressed problems during the seven years it took a bill to be passed (see 1512180052).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONSED-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONSED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RCX-4F91-DYRJ-12B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1365\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Consumer Electronics Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 12, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00020RY</classCode><className>NV ENERGY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001ONN</classCode><className>CASIO COMPUTER CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>6952 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DDH2</classCode><className>ENERGY SHORTAGES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001743</classCode><className>TRADE SHOWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001359</classCode><className>POWER FAILURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DDH2</classCode><className>ENERGY SHORTAGES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N220000CC</classCode><className>UTILITIES INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000775</classCode><className>NATURAL GAS &amp; ELECTRIC UTILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N561591MM</classCode><className>CONVENTION &amp; VISITORS BUREAUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N221100CC</classCode><className>ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzMyRjFDNjRCQUVENEJBMkEzMjZEMUVBQzA2MUIwQ0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA</classCode><className>Electric Power Industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

You can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article\">sign up here</url>. Charlie Warzel is off this week, so he\u2019s turning the newsletter over to his colleague Sarah Jeong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ever have an uncanny moment on Facebook or Instagram when you saw an advertisement for something you were just talking about in real life? You never searched for it on your phone or typed the words on your computer, so how could advertisers possibly know? Was your phone bugging you?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No, your phone is not secretly listening to you. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last year, Kashmir Hill (now doing investigative work here at The New York Times) wrote about an <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/these-academics-spent-the-last-year-testing-whether-you-1826961188\">academic study at Northeastern University</url> that looked for \u201cunexpected activity\u201d transmitted from smartphones \u2014 in other words, an audio file secretly broadcast to Facebook or its advertisers. She wrote:</p><p>They found no evidence of an app unexpectedly activating the microphone or sending audio out when not prompted to do so. Like good scientists, they refuse to say that their study definitively proves that your phone isn\u2019t secretly listening to you, but they didn\u2019t find a single instance of it happening.</p><p>The study included apps belonging to Facebook and over 8,000 apps that send information to Facebook. Those apps came up clean. (The study did detect some untoward behavior from other apps \u2014 some were recording screenshots and video of what people were doing on their phones and transmitting them to third-party analytics companies. But none of them was listening in on conversations).</p><p>This is my personal bugbear, the thing that sets me off on a probably tedious tirade to my friends and neighbors at backyard barbecues and cocktail parties. The simple fact is that your devices gather so much data about you, your whereabouts, your contacts, your browsing activities and the activities of your contacts that advertisers can predict what you\u2019re saying without even actually listening in.</p><p>Unfortunately, my insistence that Facebook is not listening to you is, predictably, undermined by Facebook, which sometimes is secretly listening to you.</p><p>Last week, Bloomberg reported that hundreds of outside contractors have had access to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio\">audio chats in Facebook Messenger</url> \u2014 because they were paid to transcribe them. Of course, these conversations were happening over Facebook Messenger, rather than being passively recorded in the privacy of one\u2019s home. And they happened only when the user opted in for message transcription.</p><p>But the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio\">opt-in message</url> didn\u2019t mention any human beings. \u201cTurn on Voice to Text in this chat?\u201d the pop-up asks in bold text. Below that, it reads: \u201cDisplay text of voice clips you send and receive. You can control whether text is visible to you for each chat. Learn more in the Me tab.\u201d</p><p>If this latest admission from Facebook sounds familiar, it\u2019s because this is the fifth big tech company recently revealed to be using human ears when you might not expect it. In April, Bloomberg reported that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-10/is-anyone-listening-to-you-on-alexa-a-global-team-reviews-audio\">Amazon Alexa</url> uses human beings to review audio files to check whether the technology is correctly interpreting voice commands. In July, a human contractor for Google Assistant leaked thousands of audio clips to a Belgian public broadcaster. The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/613951/humans-might-be-listening-to-your-google-assistant-recordings/\">MIT Technology Review</url> reported: \u201cThe clips include fragments of deeply personal conversations, including people\u2019s addresses, information on someone\u2019s love life, and what sounded like a woman in distress. Many of the recordings were captured accidentally, because the speaker had incorrectly identified the \u2018wake word.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The same month, a whistle-blower told The Guardian that Apple<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings\">uses contractors to listen to Siri audio clips</url>. Shortly after that, Vice reported that Microsoft contractors       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xweqbq/microsoft-contractors-listen-to-skype-calls\">listen to Skype conversations</url> that use Translator, a seemingly miraculous feature that provides real-time audio translation during calls.</p><p>In all five of those cases, the contractors are being used for quality control. The artificial intelligence that drives voice-to-text or automatic translation can improve over time only when a human being flags when it succeeds or fails. But this drudgery is sometimes a shockingly prurient invasion of privacy. \u201cApple contractors regularly hear confidential medical information, drug deals, and recordings of couples having sex,\u201d The Guardian reported in its story about Siri.</p><p>Because voice assistants like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant are triggered mistakenly all the time, people are being recorded without their knowledge. It doesn\u2019t quite amount to wiretapping, because they\u2019ve consented to having these devices in their lives. But I highly doubt that users reasonably expect recordings of their sexual activities to be played back to other human beings who are being paid to listen.</p><p>This wouldn\u2019t be so bad if the companies were explicit about what was going to happen with these audio files. And the blow would also have been diminished if they hadn\u2019t oversold the power of artificial intelligence to people who weren\u2019t in a position to know better.</p><p>Voice recognition is still in its infancy. As it turns out, the human brain makes a lot of leaps and inferences with the signals it receives through the ears \u2014 assumptions and fill-ins that we\u2019re still trying to figure out how to do with machines. Artificial intelligence needs to feed on data, and in this case, the data takes the form of these personal audio files. But it\u2019s not enough to just dump the audio into a machine. Human contractors must be paid to recognize what machines cannot.</p><p>Being upfront about the humans who operate behind a curtain of artificial intelligence would mean looking less ingenious, less innovative, less omniscient. But users deserve to be in the know and able to make informed decisions about what devices to allow in their homes and on their persons.</p><p>From the Archives: What Comes After the Fall?</p><p>In 2001, four Times reporters sat down with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/29/business/silicon-valley-round-table-so-technology-pros-what-comes-after-the-fall.html\">four \u201cveterans\u201d of Silicon Valley</url>, including Eric Schmidt of Google. The dot-com bubble had just burst, so much of the round table was preoccupied with economic predictions. Some of the conversation reads like a time capsule. (One reporter asks whether they are concerned about \u201cstudies that suggest that people who don\u2019t use the internet see no use for it.\u201d)</p><p>Other parts are still relevant. The tech executives were grilled on whether \u201cfree\u201d services are still viable as a business model and whether advertising is still the model for the future. Mitchell Kertzman, then chief executive of Liberate Technologies, said the current moment was seeing \u201can overreaction\u201d against advertising. Mr. Schmidt \u2014 as prescient as ever \u2014 observed: \u201cThere is an enormous demand for all-you-can-eat subscription services for proprietary intellectual property. People are tired of having 500 accounts which charge them $5 a month for this source and that source.\u201d (Netflix was founded in 1997 and introduced its streaming service in 2007.)</p><p>Mr. Schmidt also predicted that in the coming years:</p><p>\u2026 there\u2019s clearly going to be pressure around privacy legislation of some kind. A lot of people are worried that the privacy legislation will end up being written by a large number of lobbyists from all the different sides, and it will not end up looking like whatever outcome people really think it should.</p><p>This was President George W. Bush\u2019s first year in office, and in an alternate universe, we may very well have seen pro-privacy regulation in America enacted then. The round table took place in July 2001. After Sept. 11, the government passed the Patriot Act, an enormous erosion of American privacy that we are still contending with.</p><p>Tip of the Week: Picking a Virtual Private Network</p><p>Last week, Charlie gave <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/opinion/health-data.html\">some great tips</url> to stay safe on public Wi-Fi. (His explanation of virtual private network services can be found       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/opinion/facebook-ftc-privacy.html?module=inline\">here</url>.) Shortly after the newsletter landed in your inbox, Wirecutter, a New York Times-owned site, put out its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-vpn-service/\">2019 recommendations</url> for the best V.P.N.s. It\u2019s well worth a read just to start thinking about what kind of standards you want to set for your V.P.N., and really, any consumer technology.</p><p>\u201cAll of your internet activity will flow through the servers of the company whose V.P.N. you use, so you\u2019ll need to trust it more than you trust the network you\u2019re hoping to secure, whether that\u2019s airport Wi-Fi, a hotel internet connection, your corporate IT network, or your home I.S.P.,\u201d says Yael Grauer, the technology journalist who wrote the recommendation. She then rattles off a series of stories where V.P.N.s made promises they did not live up to. (For example, earlier this year, \u201cmore than half of the top 20 free V.P.N.s in the App Store and the Google Play store were <url normalizedValue=\"https://hackernoon.com/whos-really-behind-the-world-s-most-popular-free-vpns-d74bafc82178\">owned by or based in China</url>, a country where V.P.N. services are banned.\u201d)</p><p>Ms. Grauer assessed trustworthiness based on news reports, on information about who owns and operates the service, on the opinion of security experts and on court cases where specific V.P.N. services have proved to authorities that they don\u2019t log customer data. She also looked for security audits by third parties.</p><p>All in all, it\u2019s a great primer on how to think about the tech you put your trust in.</p><p>[If you\u2019re online \u2014 and, well, you are \u2014 chances are someone is using your information.

Intent Evidence CONCLUSION</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>After decades of judicial and agency permissiveness in merger enforcement and in the application of section 2 of the Sherman Act, (1) the law that prohibits monopolization, many are calling for a new antitrust equilibrium. (2) Industrial concentration has risen steadily in many business sectors in the United States, (3) as have firm profits. (4) The evidence also suggests a weakening of competition (5) and at least a link between increased market power and widening economic inequality in this country. (6) Emergent economic literature, moreover, reveals that large firms can wield monopsony power in the purchase of labor in local markets,' which could partially explain the stubborn stagnation of wages in the past few decades even when, as now, unemployment is low. (8)</p><p>Much of the widespread anxiety over excessive private power is focused on the largest digital platforms--primarily Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. (9) Economically, critics fear that these dominant platforms could foreclose competition by quashing innovation through various strategies such as application cloning (10) or acquisitions of nascent start-ups. (11) A related fear is that the large platform companies could use their troves of user data to gain early insights into consumer trends, which would allow them to identify and forestall nascent competitive threats. (12) Or, their data advantage could simply be so substantial that it forecloses entry. (13) But the concerns extend beyond economics. Critics worry, too, that the large platforms' persistent dominance poses risks of social and political harm and threatens our democracy. (14)</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this angst over the power of the largest tech firms and its potential economic and political implications has prompted discussions of ways to strengthen merger control (15) and to revive section 2, a law that has lost much of its potency since the early 1980s. (16) One of the ideas mentioned in connection with section 2 approximates \"no-fault\" monopolization--that is, dispensing with the conduct requirement of a monopolization cause of action. (17) The no-fault theory, which appears to underlie Senator (and presidential candidate) Elizabeth Warren's recent policy proposal to break up Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple, (18) was first considered in the late 1960s through the 1970s. (19) Initially endorsed by many antitrust intellectuals of the day, including Donald Turner, Philip Areeda, Oliver Williamson and others, a number of ambitious no-fault initiatives introduced during this period ultimately failed. (20)</p><p>The end of the 1970s ushered in the current modern (or conservative) era of antitrust, which favors a limited role for antitrust especially in the context of section 2, effectively ending the no-fault conversation. Courts adopted demanding standards and burdens of proof that made section 2 liability very difficult to establish. (21) And the government rarely brought monopolization cases after the 1970s, United States v. Microsoft Corp. being a notable exception. (22) This relative inactivity on the section 2 front, (23) coupled with a permissive merger policy, contributed to a perception that antitrust law is not up to the task of tackling dominance issues today, particularly those involving the largest technology platforms.</p><p>Frustrations with the limits of antitrust in this regard on the part of some critics brought forth a new movement, sometimes called New Brandeis antitrust (or sometimes, pejoratively, \"Hipster\" antitrust). (24) Although loosely unified by a strong distrust of the largest technology companies and a shared belief that modern antitrust law has abandoned its populist roots, New Brandeis proponents are a varied group who hold different views on how antitrust should be reformed. (25) One suggested framework carries echoes of earlier no-fault proposals, by eliminating the exclusionary conduct requirement of section 2 when excess market power is shown. (26)</p><p>Current monopolization doctrine in the United States requires proof of a firm's monopoly power in a relevant market, and its use of improper (\"exclusionary\") conduct to create, protect, or enhance its monopoly. (27) The conduct must also have an \"anticompetitive effect.\" (28) A no-fault monopolization theory as a deconcentration tool for the technology platform markets would be a radical, paradigm-shifting move that would require legislative action. I argue that reform efforts in this direction would be misplaced for various reasons, at least at this time. If the suggestion is economically motivated, then it would be prudent to have some reliable evidence, not just a rough judgment, that the economic benefits of dispersing the platforms' power outweigh the losses, before any attempt is made to restructure some of the country's most creative and successful companies. (29) If the motivation is to address a variety of noneconomic harms, such as threats to our democracy, including the problems of \"fake news,\" privacy intrusions, and rising economic inequality, then it is doubtful that no-fault, or antitrust generally, is a particularly good tool to address these serious, but noncompetition-related, problems. (30) Tax, labor, privacy, and consumer protection laws; and education, job training, social insurance, and other governmental programs directly tailored to the problems at issue would likely be more effective while at the same time imposing fewer collateral costs. (31)</p><p>Furthermore, to the extent that simplicity is the goal, a no-fault approach may prove disappointing as it raises some troubling questions for which there are no easy answers. For example, important issues relating to when no-fault rules should be triggered, what the appropriate measure of power should be, and whether discretion in enforcement should be permissible are all difficult to resolve, rendering the solution hardly as effortless as it might seem. (32)</p><p>A better solution, in my view, would be to retain the conduct and effects requirements, but work toward a more activist vision of section 2 through an evolution of law and policy in a more pro-plaintiff direction. (33) This could mean greater vigilance in identifying improper conduct and seeking a steady widening of the scope of exclusionary conduct through bolder choice of cases. (34) Moving toward greater flexibility in the analysis of anticompetitive effects, an approach that was implicitly endorsed in United States v. Microsoft Corp., (35) would be helpful as well. Additionally, the current ineffectualness of section 2 stems largely from the high burdens of proof imposed on plaintiffs, combined with the inherent difficulty of proving dynamic harms. (36) In light of that, slightly lessening the plaintiffs evidentiary burden, such as through the adoption of certain rebuttable presumptions and greater acceptance of qualitative evidence, including intent evidence, would alleviate some of the unusual difficulties of proof. (37) While these \"fixes\" may appear modest compared to no-fault and other somewhat vague New Brandeis proposals, they can be more feasibly accomplished and lead to meaningful changes, without the need for major legislative action and without the complete disruption of an existing framework that is conceptually sound.</p><p>In this Article, I focus my discussion on no-fault monopolization, including its drawbacks, and make some alternative suggestions for edging toward stronger section 2 enforcement, but I shall leave the discussion of various other New Brandeis suggestions to others. The Article proceeds as follows: In Part I, I discuss the original no-fault movement, its economic underpinnings, the support it had from intellectuals at the time, and its ultimate failure. In Part II, I discuss the digital platform markets, the enduring dominance of the largest platforms, and the New Brandeis frustration with section 2 law and policy, leading to renewed political interest in no-fault monopolization. In Part III, I discuss why, in my view, reform efforts in the direction of no-fault would be misplaced. And, in Part IV, I propose ways to reinvigorate section 2 through an evolution of law and policy, arguing that these alternatives may be more constructive than drastic measures such as a no-fault approach, or a complete overhaul of the consumer welfare standard.</p><p>I. THE NO-FAULT MONOPOLIZATION MOVEMENT, 1969-1980</p><p>The no-fault monopolization movement is generally dated from 1969 to 1980, (38) although some intellectuals had spoken much earlier against big business. (39) For example, Louis D. Brandeis, a fierce champion of small businesses, had written extensively in the early 1900s about the economic, social, and political dangers of \"bigness\" and about the moral value of small independent businesses. (40) Nobel Laureate George Stigler, likewise, was concerned about big business and had embraced a no-fault vision of antitrust in 1952, (41) although he had retreated from his views even before the start of the movement. (42) No-fault language was also evident in some Supreme Court monopolization opinions authored by Justice William 0. Douglas, who wrote in United States u. Griffith that \"monopoly power, whether lawfully or unlawfully acquired, may itself constitute an evil and stand condemned under [section] 2 even though it remains unexercised.\" (43)</p><p>Critical boosts for the no-fault monopolization idea came in the 1960s with the endorsements of several leading antitrust thinkers, including Donald F. Turner, Oliver E. Williamson, and Phillip E. Areeda. An antitrust icon of his time, Turner argued in 1969 that a firm should be found to have unlawfully monopolized a market if its power \"has persisted over a long enough time to indicate relatively impervious barriers to entry, regardless of how it was obtained or maintained, excepting only monopoly based on economies of scale\" or on patents. (44) A few years later, Williamson likewise emphasized \"the problem of continued dominance of an industry by a single firm which has obtained its position by lawful means.\" (45) He described that circumstance as a form of \"market failure,\" and called for \"government intervention to upset this condition.\" (46) Areeda's support of no-fault monopolization was evident as well, writing that \"[t]he evils of monopoly are largely independent of the manner in which it is achieved or maintained,\" (47) and urging an approach that tackles \"monopoly status\" rather than searches for exclusionary practices. (48)</p><p>Their views and those of other like-minded antitrust scholars of the time (49) were apparently very much influenced by the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) paradigm that had dominated economic and antitrust thinking from the 1940s through the 1970s. (50) Introduced by Edward S. Mason (51) and developed by Joe S. Bain, (52) this economic paradigm posits that market structure strongly influences or determines conduct, and conduct, in turn, strongly affects market performance. (53) Under this framework, knowing the structure of a market would allow one to predict conduct and performance. And if, as the model predicts, concentrated markets likely result in anticompetitive conduct, which, in turn, likely results in poor performance (such as inefficiency), then a no-fault agenda could make sense. Under this theory, more likely than not, the existence of persistent market power would be accompanied by anticompetitive conduct and inefficiencies. (54) In that event, finding liability based on evidence of substantial market power, without having to identify and analyze a monopolist's alleged bad act, is unlikely to sacrifice efficiencies. (55)</p><p>With the backing of antitrust luminaries of the day, a number of no-fault initiatives were considered on the political front during this period. The first involved the 1969 expansive recommendations of the Neal Task Force--President Lyndon Johnson's Task Force on Antitrust Policy--to adopt no-fault monopolization liability theories and otherwise restructure industries deemed overly concentrated. (56) A few years later, Senator Philip Hart introduced a no-fault monopolization bill, the Monopolization Reform Act of 1976, which would have removed the conduct requirement in section 2 cases brought by the United States. (57) Between 1972 and 1975, Senator Hart introduced the Industrial Reorganization Act in successive Congresses which, if passed, would have imposed no-fault monopolization liability not only for a single corporation in possession of monopoly power, but also for oligopolies that collectively held such power. (58) Finally, the National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures (NCRALP), appointed by President Jimmy Carter, (59) submitted its Report in 1979 recommending that Congress consider amending section 2 to establish liability for no-fault monopolization for \"persistent monopoly power.\" (60)</p><p>While none of these efforts succeeded, as noted, they had enjoyed the support of many of the leading antitrust scholars of the day, (61) except Robert Bork (62) and economist George Stigler, who by then had already changed his earlier deconcentration views. (63) Many of these supporters, however, later retracted their endorsements with the ascendance of a new body of economic literature that seriously challenged the SCP theories. (64) Broadly speaking, this new body of scholarship argued that economies of scale are much more substantial, and firms in concentrated markets behave more competitively, than had been assumed. (65) This effectively eroded the SCP assumption that persistent monopoly power was likely attributable to exclusionary conduct, not superior conduct or economies of scale. (66) The reversal of course by these intellectuals when the SCP theory faced severe challenge suggests that the no-fault movement, even in that \"big is bad\" era which Harry First has called \"Woodstock antitrust,\" was not wholly a populist reaction against bigness and its perceived political and social harms. Rather, it was at least partially based on assumptions, rooted in the SCP model, that relatively little would be lost and much would be gained economically by taking a no-fault approach.</p><p>II. THE AGE OF DIGITAL PLATFORM MARKETS AND NEW BRANDEIS</p><p>I discuss below the digital platform markets, including an analysis of the economic characteristics of those markets (such as network effects) that have contributed to their incumbents' enduring dominance. This, in turn, explains the increasing overall dissatisfaction with the limitations of section 2, and the rise of the New Brandeis critics and their renewed interest in no-fault monopolization. I begin the Part, however, with relevant insights on the current conservative antitrust period in order to provide context to the discussion.</p><p>A. Conservative Antitrust from 1980</p><p>The early 1980s marked the end of Woodstock antitrust and the beginning of what is generally considered the \"modern,\" or conservative, antitrust era. Influenced by scholarship suggesting that differentiating between procompetitive and anticompetitive conduct is very difficult (because conduct that excludes competitors often also benefits consumers by enhancing efficiency), (67) courts and antitrust agencies worried about committing false positives--that is, mistaking procompetitive practices for anticompetitive exclusion. (68) The concerns were that false positives would have lasting effects, (69) chill innovation, and discourage other procompetitive practices, thereby depriving consumers of benefits they would have enjoyed otherwise. (70) In contrast, false negatives were seen as posing more fleeting harms because markets were assumed to be robust and to quickly self-correct. (71) Thus, the trend toward antitrust caution with respect to section 2 and tolerance toward dominant firm conduct began, and talk of no-fault theories ceased. (72)</p><p>During this period, consistent with the desire to minimize false positives, courts adopted demanding standards and burdens of proof designed to err on the side of noninterference with dominant firm conduct. (73) The \"consumer welfare\" paradigm, first endorsed by the Supreme Court in 1979, (74) became the framework on which modern antitrust is now based. (75) While consumer welfare has no uniform or even clear definition in antitrust, (76) it is generally understood to mean that antitrust liability requires finding that the alleged bad conduct caused or is likely to cause consumer harm, (77) which could include not only higher prices or reduced output, but also quality harms and dynamic harms such as diminished innovation. (78) The term \"consumer\" in consumer welfare, however, is more or less a term of art that could include intermediate buyers (79) as well as suppliers, (80) neither of which are consumers in the literal sense. In this respect, the standard is not as constricted legally as many believe. (81)</p><p>Accepting the premise that antitrust law is for the protection of competition not competitors (82)--as the Supreme Court stated long ago (83)--consumer welfare is in theory a relatively sound concept, as it is designed to filter out conduct that is ultimately harmless to consumers. In practice, however, because nonprice effects are unquantifiable and often unmeasurable, proof is very difficult to establish, (84) and, for reasons to be discussed later, the difficulties are compounded in digital platform markets. (85) Along with the demanding burdens of proof imposed on plaintiffs, this has led to a tilting of antitrust law and policy against antitrust enforcement, particularly in the section 2 context. (86) A backlash against the highly permissive approach toward dominant firms and market power was probably inevitable in this age of large digital platforms. (87)</p><p>We are now in a populist period, where concerns are running high about big business and especially the immense economic power of the largest technology platforms. (88) Now, as in the no-fault movement in the 1970s, critics frustrated with the limitations of traditional antitrust enforcement are exploring ideas, including no-fault monopolization theories, for dispersing uncomfortable levels of concentration. (89)</p><p>B. Dominance of the Largest Digital Platforms: Network and Lock-in Effects, Enhanced by Personal Data</p><p>The dominance of the largest digital technology platforms in their respective core areas, and the breadth of their activities across markets, is undisputed. For example, Google's search engine handles approximately 88 percent of all general Internet searches worldwide; (90) Amazon garners 82 percent of e-book sales (91) and 45 percent of all e-commerce retail sales in the United States; (92) and Facebook is by far the most popular social network. (93) Additionally, Google and Facebook together have a 56.8 percent market share of all revenues received nationally from digital advertising, (94) though Amazon is rapidly gaining market share on them. (95) Further, each of these companies has expanded into multiple other business sectors as well, either through internal growth or acquisitions, and the breadth and scale of their activities are staggering. (96)</p><p>A policy dilemma that confronts antitrust policymakers sorting through the dominance issues of these firms is that, on the one hand, the platforms have benefited consumers immensely, (97) and their conduct in gaining or enhancing their dominance is not necessarily unlawful under monopolization doctrine. (98) On the other hand, their business practices, lawful or unlawful, may suppress innovation in the long run and slow economic growth. (99) The concern is that if there is no meaningful competition, these tech giants may become less innovative in the future, to the detriment of consumers. (100) Adding to the dilemma is the important role network and lock-in effects, enhanced by data, play in entrenching the power of some of the largest digital platforms in their respective areas of dominance and in strengthening entry barriers. (101)</p><p>Yet simply taking advantage of the inherent competitive benefits of network and lock-in effects is not improper conduct under section 2, (102) nor are these effects necessarily anticompetitive. In fact, they often provide efficiencies that benefit consumers. (103) Network effects refer to the rise of a platform's value to each individual user as the number of users increases. (104) Facebook, for example, becomes more attractive to each user as more people join the network, since there are more friends with whom the user can interact. A platform might benefit too from indirect network effects when third parties produce a variety of attractive complementary products, which increase the utility of the platform and draw more users to it. (105)</p><p>These effects are further magnified by the importance of consumer data to digital platforms and by the largest platforms' huge data advantage over their smaller rivals. (106) Platforms collect millions of scraps of personal data from consumers visiting their sites. For advertisement-supported platforms such as Facebook and Google, for example, the more user data that is collected, the better advertising can be targeted to individual users, (107) which leads to higher advertising revenues, which supports further investments in quality improvements, which attracts more users, and so on. (108) A smaller rival or potential rival platform, without comparable mounds of personal data, would be at a significant competitive disadvantage. (109)</p><p>A platform's organic growth of data--collecting, mining, synthesizing, and using that data--however, is generally not considered exclusionary conduct under section 2, even though it may indeed increase entry barriers. (110) Moreover, it is impossible to categorically describe the effects as anticompetitive, as data can help platforms deliver substantial consumer benefits. For example, search engines can improve on their search results for search terms going forward by learning from users' past \"click-and-query\" data (that is, users' actual clicks on the displayed search results for the relevant search term). (111) Thus, Google, the dominant search engine, is able to greatly enhance the quality of its search results relative to that of smaller search engines, because it has more data from more search activity with which to train its algorithms.</p><p>For platforms that are not primarily advertisement-supported, such as Amazon, the effects of data are similarly mixed, and it is also not clear that the organic growth and use of such data is improper. There is little doubt, for example, that having large bodies of user data relating to consumers' browsing practices helps Amazon identify an individual's buying patterns and cater better to his or her needs. (112) Knowing the items users searched for and immediately bought, or searched for but did not find, or found but did not buy, or items they placed in their baskets but wavered on buying for some time, or knowing how long their mouses hovered over various items, obviously gives the company valuable relevant information with which to improve its services.</p><p>Critics are correct that huge data advantages effectively protect dominant incumbent platforms from competition and serve as entry barriers, thereby further entrenching the incumbent's market power. (113) However, relying on personal data collected on its own platform, without more, is not improper conduct. Equally important, relying on data to better serve customers is a consumer benefit, not a consumer harm. (114) This reality highlights the futility of attempting to categorically characterize the competitive effects of big data as either procompetitive or anticompetitive. (115) It underscores as well the challenge policymakers face in deciding when and how to use antitrust law to protect consumers without causing more harm than good through inappropriate interference.</p><p>C. The New Brandeis Frustration with Section 2 Doctrine</p><p>While many commentators have been critical of the narrow interpretation of section 2 since the 1980s, (116) enhanced anxiety over the size of the largest tech companies has contributed to the rise of a genre of commentaries that more frontally challenge the antitrust enterprise. (117) This group of critiques, which has gained some political traction, (118) has been labeled collectively as New Brandeis antitrust. (119) Defining New Brandeis would be very difficult--and I shall not attempt to do so here--since those loosely identified with the group hold a variety of views on different issues, including on the antitrust reforms they deem necessary to keep the largest technology platforms in check. Several common threads run through their commentaries, though. They include a strong distrust of economic power generally, (120) and of the power of the largest technology companies in particular; (121) a shared belief that antitrust law should have a broader mission than that of promoting consumer welfare; (122) and the related belief that current antitrust law, even if aggressively enforced, would not achieve that broader mission, thus requiring an overhaul of the antitrust laws. (123)</p><p>1. The Conduct Requirement and the Consumer Welfare Standard</p><p>Section 2 of the Sherman Act does not combat \"bigness\" (or sheer size), nor does it prohibit even significant market power in a relevant market, absent some sort of exclusionary conduct. (121) Exclusionary conduct generally refers to practices inconsistent with legitimate competition that protects or increases a firm's monopoly power by excluding or weakening the firm's rivals. (125) Significantly, not all conduct that might harm a competitor is captured under section 2. (126)</p><p>Notably, simply taking advantage of scale economies and network effects (essentially a form of scale economies), or engaging in internal growth and expansion, is generally not considered unlawful conduct, even if it has the effect of impeding entry or meaningful competition from actual or potential rivals. (127) Thus, for example, it is certainly correct that the more users gravitate to Facebook, the greater the value of Facebook is to its users, which attracts more users. (128) The increase in Facebook's user base then allows it to collect more consumer data, which attracts more online advertisers who are able to serve better targeted advertisements to individual users. (129) This provides greater advertising revenues to Facebook, allowing the company to further improve and expand its products, attracting still more users, and so on. (130) While this network and feedback effects phenomenon indicates that entry barriers are high in digital platform markets, it does not necessarily describe unlawful conduct.</p><p>As to user lock-in, a complaint from critics of the largest platforms is that each tech giant has built its own ecosystem, and entices users to stay within it. (131) In the case of Facebook, for example, it is said that the network's architecture, combined with network effects, discourages users from switching: their friends are all on Facebook, and they have spent time posting photographs and otherwise building a presence on the network. (132) The high switching costs then create a lock-in effect and raise entry barriers into the relevant markets. (133) Although these observations are substantially true, tempting users to stay within an ecosystem by expanding offerings and adding or improving features, however, can hardly be considered improper conduct.</p><p>Identifying exclusionary conduct and making a case for consumer harm is similarly difficult with respect to Amazon. Carl Shapiro, who is sympathetic to the general need for stronger antitrust enforcement, nevertheless said of a New Brandeis critique:</p><p>[One] must describe the specific conduct that concerns them and explain how that conduct disrupts the competitive process and harms customers. Simply saying that Amazon has grown like a weed, charges very low prices, and has driven many smaller retailers out of business is not sufficient. Where is the consumer harm? (134)</p><p>Herbert Hovenkamp similarly noted that \"[o]ne cannot simply lament that Amazon has grown too large,\" but must \"identify[] what exactly Amazon is doing that should be remedied and what those remedies should look like\" when clearly customers are not complaining. (135)</p><p>Furthermore, under the consumer welfare standard on which contemporary antitrust is based, the conduct must have \"anticompetitive effect\"--that is, it must not only exclude rivals but must harm consumers or \"harm the competitive process and thereby harm consumers.\" (136) \"Consumer welfare,\" long accepted as the lodestone in antitrust analysis, (137) curiously has no real definition in antitrust law, but has been variously interpreted. (138) Under the narrow, orthodox, Chicago-School interpretation championed by Robert Bork, consumer welfare is almost synonymous with allocative efficiency, and, thus, only practices that artificially restrict output are deemed to harm consumers. (139) The more mainstream view, however, is broader and simply asks if the practice harms competition and ultimately makes consumers worse off.</p><p>Contrary to common critiques of the standard, the measure of consumer harm is not limited to price or output effects. (140) Diminishment of quality, choice, or innovation alone would qualify as consumer harm as well because these factors clearly impact consumer welfare. (141) However, unlike price, nonprice harms are usually unquantifiable and difficult to measure. (142) And, because plaintiffs normally carry the burden of proof, successful challenges to dominant firm conduct absent price effects have been rare in practice. Thus, as applied, the \"consumer welfare\" standard does tend to focus on price effects.</p><p>Certain characteristics of many digital markets compound the difficulty of showing consumer harm. Consumers do not pay a monetary price to use social media, search engines, e-mail, or many other popular platform products; instead, the advertising side of the platforms pays for the opportunity to serve targeted advertising to individual users (made possible by the volumes of personal data the platforms collect from them). (143) If price were functionally the only measure of harm, then showing adverse effects of any alleged exclusionary conduct would indeed be extremely difficult. (144) When the monetary price to consumers is zero, any harm from a dominant platform's alleged exclusionary conduct naturally would not be reflected in prices, (145) but rather in loss of quality or innovation. (146)</p><p>Correctly applied, as earlier discussed, the consumer welfare standard should capture consumers' competition-related harms other than price. (147) However, loss of quality or reduced innovation claims, never easy to establish in any case, are all the more difficult against the largest digital technology companies because of their track record of fast-paced innovation, quality improvements, and substantial investments in research and development. (148) Proving what might have been is always difficult, but it is particularly hard in industries where the incumbents are generally celebrated for their frequent rollout of new and improved products or features, (149) overall superior service, (150) and huge R&amp;D investments. (151) How does one demonstrate, or even credibly claim, that had Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Apple, for example, faced more competition, they would have introduced more innovative products or features?</p><p>Yet concerns about the absence of meaningful competition in the major platform markets, and its potential implications in the long run, are legitimate and deserve more attention. Without competition, any firm's incentives to innovate or expand would naturally be reduced, (152) and there would also be no real constraints on the platforms' abilities to exploit their power. Moreover, it is reasonable to surmise that the presence of a super-dominant incumbent such as Google or Facebook in a market, and fear of its strategic conduct, would chill innovation and venture capital investment in any nascent competitor's start-up projects. And, if Facebook or Google can freely copy the features of a start-up's product proven to be a hit with users (that are not subject to intellectual property protection), in addition to fairness issues, one would intuitively expect less incentive to innovate on the part of start-ups and less investor willingness to invest in start-up projects. (153) This intuition has found some support in recent empirical research showing that Android apps exhibit less innovation when Google vertically integrates into their markets. (154) Section 2 seems ill-equipped to deal with these types of problems involving the large digital platform companies, leaving us with unanswerable questions of which innovations consumers may miss because nascent firms are unable to get funding or are unwilling to take risks given the largest platforms' outsized dominance, or which quality improvements may not take place because of the lack of competition.</p><p>2. The Failure of Antitrust, Including Section 2, to Address Social and Political, and Other Noncompetition Harms (155)</p><p>The New Brandeis critiques, however, go beyond arguments that, as applied, the consumer welfare standard fails to capture all competition-related consumer harms. They further challenge the limited competition-related economic objectives of antitrust and argue for a more expansive vision. (156) In this view, even aggressive antitrust enforcement under existing law is inadequate because current doctrine fails to take into account the full panoply of social or political harms that might be associated with concentrated economic power.</p><p>Among the critiques is that excessive market power is unfair to smaller market participants (158) and contributes to economic inequality. (159) Furthermore, economic power tends to yield political power, (160) and political power on the part of large corporations tends to undermine American democracy. (161)</p><p>These concerns are magnified with respect to the largest digital platforms because they control a significant share of our commerce and communications, and impact many aspects of our lives. (162) Google's dominance in search, for example, gives it an outsized influence in shaping our virtual environment. (163) It determines, through its artificial intelligence-based algorithms, the digital advertisements that we see and the search results that are displayed in response to our search queries. This suggests that the inevitable biases of Google's systems and employees who write the algorithms could influence the information and content that flows to all of us. (164) The New Brandeisians correctly point out that the consumer welfare standard is incapable of factoring these risks into antitrust analysis. (165)</p><p>As for Facebook, a slew of scandals has recently embroiled the social network. They include the company's mishandling of users' personal data, its role in the Cambridge Analytica incident and in a number of security breaches, and its negligence in allowing Russian meddling and \"fake news\" to spread during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. (166) The problem is that although these serious transgressions did harm consumers, they were largely not antitrust transgressions that Facebook committed in order to protect or enhance its monopoly power. However, probably because laws more specifically targeted to the noncompetition-related misconduct and related problems are nonexistent and woefully inadequate, (167) some have looked to antitrust for a solution and have found it wanting.</p><p>Noting, correctly, that even strong antitrust enforcement under the traditional monopolization paradigm will not adequately address some of the problems just discussed, New Brandeis commentators have made various suggestions for reform, including a no-fault approach to monopolization. (168) Under Lina Khan and Sandeep Vaheesan's proposal, no \"bad act\" would be necessary to find section 2 liability if a firm possesses monopoly power for an extended period of time, such as five years. (169) Another New Brandeis commentator implicitly endorsed no-fault monopolization by arguing that the conduct requirement of section 2 is \"bias[ed] in favor of monopolies\" and amounts to a \"per se rule in favor of monopolization.\" (170) Senator Elizabeth Warren's recent policy proposal to break up Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple--technology firms that have annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and additionally operate a platform or digital marketplace--likewise represents a no-fault approach. (171)</p><p>In addition to no-fault, other New Brandeis suggestions include replacing the consumer welfare lodestone with various other tests or standards, including a \"citizen interest\" test (172) and a standard that focuses on \"our interests as workers, producers, entrepreneurs, and citizens.\" (173) Others have proposed the regulation of the largest digital platforms as public utilities or natural monopolies as a solution. (174) My discussion here of the New Brandeis proposals will be confined to the no-fault theory.</p><p>III. NO-FAULT REFORM EFFORTS WOULD BE MISPLACED</p><p>As earlier discussed, the sheer dominance of the largest platforms in their respective spheres likely carries a risk of harm to innovation in the long run. Moreover, even granted that the largest tech platforms have delivered impressive consumer benefits so far, it is not off base to suspect that the benefits could be larger still if they faced more meaningful competition. (175) Thus, from an economic perspective alone, the evidence supports reducing concentration and encouraging competition. The more difficult question is whether no-fault monopolization is a desirable or feasible approach to the problem. I conclude that it is not, at least not at this time, though stronger section 2 enforcement is long overdue.</p><p>A. Erosion of the Economic Foundation Underlying No-Fault Theory of Section 2 Liability</p><p>Despite the initial support from many prominent antitrust intellectuals, in a time that was much more congenial to small businesses than today, (176) earlier attempts to pass no-fault monopolization legislation and other deconcentration initiatives nevertheless all failed. (177) This suggests that even when the conditions for success were most favorable, policymakers and others still had misgivings about finding section 2 liability absent exclusionary conduct. Now, with modern antitrust economic scholarship having raised serious questions about the SCP model that was dominant from the 1940s through the 1970s, (178) more reservations are inevitable, and warranted.</p><p>Notably, the no-fault movement had drawn its intellectual strength from the SCP body of economic scholarship. (179) Given the SCP premise that persistent market power is likely associated with anticompetitive conduct and inefficiencies, combatting monopolies directly and seeking to restructure those firms, without identifying bad conduct, seemed efficient. (180) It would promise much benefit without the risk of much loss.</p><p>The growth and ascendance in the 1980s of a new body of economic scholarship that severely challenged the SCP assumptions, however, weakened the economic foundation of the no-fault theories and earlier policy proposals. And it eventually led many who had initially endorsed various no-fault initiatives to retract their support. (181)</p><p>Thus, if the idea of a no-fault theory of section 2 liability is economically motivated, it would be more prudent to have some concrete cost-benefit studies to evaluate whether it is likely to be beneficial on balance, rather than to rely on rough judgments. On the one hand, no-fault intervention would very likely inflict some economic welfare losses since, at the very least, it would reduce the benefits generated by the substantial economies of scale and network effects of the large technology platforms lost as a result of intervention. On the other hand, it could increase economic welfare by introducing competition into the dominant firm's market and complementary markets because competition typically benefits consumers. But whether the net welfare effect is beneficial requires some solid research. From an economic perspective at least, it seems safer to have some hard evidence that the economic benefits of dispersing the platforms' substantial market power, absent exclusionary conduct, outweigh the losses before we entertain the idea of restructuring or otherwise disrupting some of the country's most successful companies.</p><p>B. Other More Appropriate and Less Risky Instruments for Addressing Social and Political Ills</p><p>Of course, the primary motivation for the no-fault proposals may be noneconomic. Some critics have linked the immense economic power of the largest technology platforms to a variety of social and political ills, including rising economic inequality, the insufficient creation of good jobs, the dearth of opportunities for small businesses, political corruption, privacy intrusions, the problem of \"fake news,\" and interference with our elections which threaten our democracy. (182) Jonathan Baker and Steven Salop have argued persuasively that stronger and wiser antitrust enforcement can help reduce economic inequality by reducing monopoly profits, since monopoly profits represent a transfer of consumer wealth from consumers to the monopoly's shareholders and senior executives, who generally tend to be more affluent than average consumers. (183) But, beyond that, antitrust law is not primarily a wealth and income distribution tool. Nor is it tailored specifically to create good jobs, or to address other social and political issues.</p><p>I question the advisability of using antitrust law as a primary tool to try to resolve serious societal problems unrelated, or only tangentially related, to market competition. While Amazon may be responsible for the loss of many retail jobs, for example, and the largest technology firms may employ fewer workers relative to firms of comparable size in \"traditional\" industries, (184) it is not clear that no-fault deconcentration is the right way to deal with these monumental social problems rooted in technological advances. A more direct approach, using existing or new laws and policies targeted to the problems at issue, should deliver better results and have fewer collateral costs. In other words, consumer protection laws or privacy and data security regulations would be better than antitrust at dealing with possible transparency, data security, and consumer deception issues. (185) And tax and labor laws, job-training and education initiatives and so forth would be far better suited than antitrust to tackle the array of other social and political problems. (186)</p><p>C. Other Vexing Issues</p><p>There are other miscellaneous, but vexing, issues that cut against a no-fault approach. They include having to answer various complex questions regarding power and discretion, which makes no-fault far less effortless than it may seem. Moreover, adopting a no-fault theory of monopolization clearly requires legislative action which adds yet another hurdle.</p><p>1. The Complexity of \"Power\": Monopoly Power in a Relevant Market vs. Absolute Measures of Power (\"Bigness\")</p><p>If, as it seems, simplicity is what advocates desire, a no-fault approach will prove disappointing because it raises several complex conceptual and practical questions with no easy answers. For example, when should no-fault rules be triggered? Should they apply only where a firm has persistent monopoly power in a defined relevant market, as in the 1970s failed proposals? (187) Or should the measure of power, as in Senator Warren's plan, turn on absolute values? (188)</p><p>If the former, it is not clear that the approach would do the job that its proponents seem to want--easily disperse the economic and political power of the technology giants without protracted litigation. With so much at stake, if bad conduct and anticompetitive effects are not required, market definition would become critically important, and courts probably would be unwilling to find a violation unless monopoly power is clearly established. However, establishing monopoly power in a relevant market would be a true challenge when the products and services of digital platforms tend to extend across markets and the market delineations are blurry at best. For example, even for a firm such as Amazon, which undoubtedly has immense economic power and reaches into many facets of American lives, it is difficult to see in which markets (other than retail book sales) the firm has monopoly power in the antitrust sense. (189) The same is true of Apple. Although Apple famously became the first American firm to reach a market value of $1 trillion in August 2018,190 it is hard to identify a specific relevant market where it has monopoly power in an antitrust sense. (191)</p><p>It is true that in a traditional section 2 case, a defendant's monopoly power must also be established, and that usually entails defining the market as well. (192) However, courts have been more willing to dispense with strict market definition and calculations of market shares, at least in nonmerger cases, where there is actual evidence of anticompetitive effects. (193) But if evidence of conduct and its effects is not required, as would be the case under no-fault, then proof of market power would almost necessarily entail defining the market, at least in some broad sense, and determining market share.</p><p>If the vision of no-fault is for power to turn, not on market power in a relevant market, but on absolute measures of power--as in Senator Warren's plan--that would be a complete break from the fundamental core of antitrust jurisprudence. It could also be quite arbitrary in operation, as Senator Warren's plan itself demonstrates. Senator Warren's breakup proposal targets tech companies with \"annual global revenue of $25 billion or more\" and that operate a platform (or digital marketplace). (194) She further specifies that it is intended to apply to Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple. (195) It would seem that Microsoft should be included as well, as its annual global revenue exceeds $25 billion and it owns a platform, the Windows app store, but Microsoft is somehow spared. (196)</p><p>The very fact that Warren saw fit to exclude Microsoft from her breakup proposal, itself, points to a problem with her approach. Presumably, Warren would exempt Microsoft because she believes that the company does not pose the harms that warrant a mandatory spin-off. But a similarly strong case could be made for exempting Apple as well. Of the largest digital platforms, Apple has probably generated the fewest concerns about the risk of exclusion of potential competitors. (197) Moreover, despite the fact that Apple is famously the first company to reach the $1 trillion mark in market value, it is not clear how consumers would benefit from a forced spin-off of its Apple app store.</p><p>Another issue related to monopoly power is whether it has to be persistent, a condition that was incorporated in the 1970s no-fault proposals (198) but not in Senator Warren's plan. If persistence is required, what should be its measure--number of years? What if a firm's dominance shifts from one market to another market before the requisite number of years is reached? This could happen in markets with fast-moving technologies, where a first market becomes obsolete or greatly diminished in importance, and a second market emerges (whose products subsume the key features and functions of products in the first market). (199) In that case, does the firm's period of prior dominance in the defunct market transfer over to the new market if the firm gains dominance in the second market as well?</p><p>2. The Problem of Discretion</p><p>Yet another important question is whether a no-fault liability rule would (or should) require courts to grant relief once the power element is satisfied. Or would courts have judicial discretion to consider the importance or peculiar circumstances of the market and the welfare costs of any no-fault intervention before making a determination both on liability and on the remedy? Presumably, enforcement agencies could exercise prosecutorial discretion as they usually do, and decline to bring action (despite clear evidence of a power however it may be defined) if, in their judgment, disrupting that market would be unwise. The exercise of prosecutorial discretion is ordinarily desirable, as we want the government to account for all important factors before making an enforcement decision. However, with a no-fault regime, discretion essentially places antitrust agencies in the role of making important judgment calls on economic regulation, including which industries may be too critical to our economy to be disrupted, rather than on law enforcement. And it is not clear that antitrust agencies should have that role.</p><p>If power is to be defined by size or some other absolute measure, the exercise of discretion by antitrust enforcers may be even more troubling. Again, take the example of Senator Warren's breakup plan and her stated intention to have it apply to Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple, but apparently not to Microsoft, although all five companies fit the plan's absolute criteria for application. (200) Presumably, Warren did not see major harm in allowing Microsoft to keep its Windows app store, notwithstanding the company's large annual global revenue and its operating a platform/marketplace. While she may be (and probably is) correct in her assessment, it highlights a problem with using absolute measures but making exceptions. How does one decide why Microsoft, but not Apple, should be exempted, for example? And who should make that determination?</p><p>3. The Need for Legislation</p><p>Finally, from a pragmatic standpoint, adding a no-fault monopolization cause of action would require legislative action. Passing any legislation to amend a law that has existed for over 125 years is a daunting task even if Congress were not as dysfunctional as it is today. It is an especially difficult mission when the proposed amendment would depart radically from existing law as a no-fault amendment would. Given the difficulty involved, the uncertain results, and the possibility that more harm than good could be done, it would seem that efforts for stronger and more effective section 2 enforcement would be better (and more safely) spent elsewhere.</p><p>IV. REINVIGORATING SECTION 2 THROUGH EVOLUTION OF DOCTRINE AND POLICY</p><p>Though a no-fault approach, in my view, would be unwise, this moment of deep social unease over the economic, social, and political power of the largest technology companies provides us with a much needed opportunity to reset the antitrust equilibrium. There is growing agreement that closer antitrust scrutiny and a generally tougher line toward today's largest firms, including those in the technology sector, is long overdue. (201) Not only is there strong evidence of rising industrial concentration and weakening competition, the economic literature also suggests that competition, more so than monopoly, tends to drive innovation (202) and foster economic growth and prosperity. (203) Thus, preventing dominant firms from foreclosing entry or weakening rivals is important.</p><p>Challenging exclusionary conduct is especially important in today's high technology markets because such conduct could oust a nascent threat before the potential rival has had a chance to fully develop its product and, in so doing, eliminate the possibility of future innovation. (204) Furthermore, because many of the digital technology markets enjoy network effects and are winner-take-all markets, (205) an incumbent's market power tends to be durable, making it all the more imperative to block improper conduct that forecloses potential entry. My aim below is to highlight a few areas where efforts could be made to better constrain dominant firm conduct, particularly on the part of the largest digital companies, and to move antitrust (perhaps incrementally) in a more interventionist direction.</p><p>A. Focus on Identifying Exclusionary Conduct, and Seeking an Incremental Expansion of the Scope of Exclusionary Conduct</p><p>As discussed earlier, not all conduct that excludes competition is unlawful under section 2. (206) Naturally benefiting from network and/or lock-in effects, enhanced by an incumbent's significant data advantage, for example, is not considered unlawful conduct even if it contributes substantially to the largest platforms' entrenched monopoly power. Nor is excluding rivals through innovation a \"bad act.\" However, as even Justice Scalia (known for his solicitude toward dominant firms) has acknowledged, behavior that might be permissible--or \"might even be viewed as procompetitive--can take on exclusionary connotations when practiced by a monopolist.\" (207)</p><p>Therefore, cognizant of the dominant platforms' incentives and abilities to exclude competitors, the agencies could be more vigilant in scrutinizing the dominant platforms' practices so as to identify conduct that may deviate from competition on the merits and that has the effect of excluding rivals. For instance, while Google's use of its large datasets to \"train\" its algorithms (208) to return better search results is not improper, and the effects beneficial, even if it does leave rival search engines behind, implementing search algorithms to disadvantage or discriminate against its competitors in a vertical or adjacent market would be a different matter. Where the results are mixed--the algorithmic changes improve search results as well as injure competitors--given the enormous power of the largest digital platforms, placing the onus on the dominant platform to prove that the benefits exceed the harm would be reasonable.</p><p>The influential post-Chicago theory of raising rivals' costs, developed by Thomas Krattenmaker and Steven Salop, could help guide these efforts. (209) While the largest platforms' most often criticized patterns of behavior are not necessarily unlawful under antitrust doctrine, (210) conduct that protects or enhances a dominant firm's monopoly power by impeding rivals without benefiting consumers constitutes raising rivals' costs and should be recognized as exclusionary. (211) The antitrust agencies could expend more resources examining dominant firm practices and probing allegations of this nature, which they have occasionally done. One example involves the FTC's investigation into Google's use of proprietary interfaces that made it more cumbersome for its digital advertisers to port their advertisements to additional platforms, without obvious consumer benefits emanating from the practice. (212) Google retreated from the practice in the face of the FTC investigation, (213) illustrating the effectiveness of increased government vigilance.</p><p>In light of the importance of personal data in digital platform markets, another area that might benefit from closer scrutiny involves investigating and evaluating whether dominant platforms have constrained their competitors' ability to compete by impeding their access to necessary inputs (personal data) or to customers--such as raising rivals' costs. While simply enjoying the inherent advantages of having large datasets and a wide data advantage is not a \"bad act,\" burdening rivals by blocking their access to data critical for success would seem to be classic \"raising rivals' costs\" conduct that could violate section 2.</p><p>Another area that might warrant closer attention is where a large platform also competes directly against some of its platform's customers, a situation that Lina Khan, a fierce New Brandeis critic of Amazon, has found most objectionable. (214) Amazon is not only a dominant online retailer that sells directly to consumers, but it is additionally a marketing platform that hosts other online retailers selling to the same pool of Amazon consumer-customers. (215) In effect, Amazon competes against those of its merchant customers who sell similar products over Amazon's marketing platform.</p><p>This practice or business structure is not necessarily anticompetitive, however, and indeed may be procompetitive, since it offers smaller online retailers without sufficient scale greater exposure to customers than the retailers would otherwise have. (216) The practice also offers those smaller online retailers convenience and presumably lower costs by providing them an option to turn over the logistics of customer service, shipping, and delivery to Fulfillment by-Amazon for a fee. (217) However, there are obvious opportunities for abuse and unfairness. The marketplace setup gives Amazon access to those merchant customers' sensitive sales data which it could use to inform its own business planning and marketing strategies, to the competitive disadvantage of its merchant rivals. (218)</p><p>My point here is not that the structure--a dominant online retailer also operating an online platform that hosts (some) competing retailers--is inherently anticompetitive, and should be disallowed as Senator Warren has proposed. (219) Rather, the point is that, cognizant of the importance of data and the risks to competition this structure poses, the antitrust agencies should develop expertise in digital markets and be vigilant in scrutinizing the platforms' practices to identify and prevent those that might thwart competition on the merits from the platform company's competitors on the platform.</p><p>Yet another related area worth exploring would be a dominant platform's discriminatory refusal to deal with a customer because of the customer's competition against the platform in another market. For example, last year Facebook allegedly denied its potential rivals access to its troves of user data while granting access to other nonrival customers. (220) To the extent that these claims are credible, antitrust enforcers should be willing to investigate and bring action, in an attempt to push out the boundaries of unilateral refusals to deal that were set in Trinko. While the Supreme Court seemed to have limited the viability of refusal to deal claims to instances where the dominant firm had a prior course of dealing with the plaintiff, (221) the fact that Trinko did not involve a selective refusal to deal with competitors could be a distinguishing factor. (222) And that may support an argument that courts could stretch Trinko to reach discriminatory refusals to deal similar to the claim made against Facebook.</p><p>In Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., a 1986 case which has never been overruled, the Supreme Court condemned dominant firm conduct as exclusionary when it extends or entrenches the firm's market power \"on some basis other than efficiency.\" (223) Aspen elaborated further that exclusionary conduct is \"behavior that not only (1) tends to impair the opportunities of rivals, but also (2) either does not further competition on the merits or does so in an unnecessarily restrictive way.\" (224) This language envisions a broader scope for impermissible conduct under section 2 than is generally assumed today and could support the bringing of a broader range of cases.</p><p>In short, closer scrutiny of the largest technology companies' practices to identify suspect conduct, and a greater willingness to rely on more liberal (less \"safe\") theories of harm, such as raising rivals' costs, could ultimately move us toward a stronger section 2 policy. Likewise, a willingness to bring test cases in appropriate circumstances, with an eye toward persuading courts to expand the scope of exclusionary conduct, would be helpful as well.</p><p>B. Greater Flexibility in the Analysis of Effects</p><p>Another way to achieve stronger section 2 enforcement is to move toward greater flexibility in the analysis of anticompetitive effects. As discussed earlier, a primary New Brandeis charge against today's monopolization doctrine is that the consumer welfare standard supposedly prohibits only conduct that results in short-term higher prices or reduced output. (225) While this claim is factually incorrect, (226) successful challenges based on pure nonprice harms are indeed rare. (227) This is, however, due to practical problems of proof and not to any legal deficiencies of the standard, as United States v. Microsoft Corp. demonstrates.</p><p>One way to remedy this practical problem of proof is to draw inspiration from Microsoft and allow for more flexibility in the analysis of effects. This could include a greater willingness to (1) infer consumer harm from harm to the competitive process, (2) give more credence to claims of long run, if somewhat uncertain, harm to innovation, and (3) accord legitimacy and more weight to qualitative evidence, including intent evidence. Alternatively, or additionally, courts could apply rebuttable presumptions of anti competitive effects under certain conditions, which would considerably reduce the burden of proof on the plaintiff.</p><p>1. Drawing Inference of Consumer Harm from Evidence of Harm to the Competitive Process</p><p>The consumer effects of dominant firm conduct that have excluded or weakened smaller rivals often are not readily apparent, and demanding actual proof of consumer harm will likely result in underenforcement. In contrast, demonstrating that a dominant firm has undermined the competitive process, such as by competing on some basis other than efficiency, (228) is typically easier. Allowing an inference of consumer harm to be drawn from evidence of harm to the competitive process would, therefore, lessen the burden on a section 2 plaintiff in establishing liability. In fact, the D.C. Circuit seems to have employed this approach in Microsoft.</p><p>In United States v. Microsoft Corp., Microsoft, which had a monopoly in the relevant operating systems (OS) market through Windows, perceived a threat to Windows from two new non-OS products--Netscape's browser and Sun's Java programming language. (229) The Netscape browser and Java, if successfully developed to their full capability, could provide a new way for applications software to access a computer's OS, which could then weaken Windows's monopoly in the OS market because consumers would no longer be deterred from switching to another OS due to the dearth of applications software developed for the competing OS. (230)</p><p>The Government charged that, to protect its Windows monopoly, Microsoft engaged in a variety of exclusionary practices to squash Netscape's browser and Java before they could potentially succeed in developing the features that could threaten Microsoft's Windows monopoly. (231) There was no evidence, however, that Microsoft's bad conduct raised prices either for Windows or for browsers (which were free to consumers). (232) Nor was there evidence that, but for Microsoft's conduct, Netscape or Java would have succeeded in developing the features that could have transformed those products into viable threats to Windows. (233) The Court of Appeals, nevertheless, affirmed section 2 liability against Microsoft. (234)</p><p>In speaking of the need to show \"anticompetitive effect[s]\" to establish a prima facie section 2 case, the court said that the conduct must \"harm the competitive process and thereby harm consumers.\" (235) As there was little tangible evidence of harm to consumers--only the undermining of competition on the merits--the court was effectively drawing an inference of consumer harm from evidence of harm to the competitive process. Along the same lines, in addressing the issue of bad conduct and causation, given that Microsoft's actions crushed the nascent threats from Netscape and Java before either company could prove an ability to erode the Windows monopoly, the court said that \"it would be inimical to the purpose of the Sherman Act to allow monopolists free rein to squash nascent, albeit unproven, competitors at will--particularly in industries marked by rapid technological advance and frequent paradigm shifts.\" (236) In other words, the court found it unnecessary for the Government to prove the eventual viability of the nascent technologies (thus, harm to consumers) had they not been vanquished early on by Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct.</p><p>To the extent that inferring consumer harm from harm to the competitive process, subject to rebuttal by the dominant firm, (237) becomes more routinely accepted, the task of proving unlawful monopolization could be eased. Conduct that harms the competitive process is often not that difficult to observe, and demonstrating disruption of the competition process is easier than identifying direct harm to consumers. Additionally, this approach is reasonable from an economic perspective because it is reasonable to assume that harm to the competitive process would likely harm consumers in the long run even if direct consumer effects are not immediately apparent. Start-ups, or smaller rivals and potential rivals to dominant firms, would be discouraged from innovating and otherwise competing if dominant firms were able to \"compete\" through a subversion of the competitive process rather than on the merits.</p><p>2. Elevating and Promoting the Theory of Long-Run Innovation Harms, and Creating Presumptions</p><p>Antitrust has long recognized that firms in high technology markets often compete more on innovation than on price; (238) consequently, protecting innovation should be a paramount objective. The economic scholarship, moreover, suggests that competition fosters innovation, and overall economic growth and prosperity; (239) thus, the likely effect of suppressing competition would be reduced innovation and economic growth. It follows, then, that antitrust analysis should give substantial weight to the effect of any alleged exclusionary conduct on innovation, with the aim of prohibiting such conduct and encouraging innovation.</p><p>Exclusionary conduct in high technology markets carries a particularly high risk of harm to innovation because, as in Microsoft, it often means driving out a nascent technology or innovation in the early stages of development, (240) depriving it of the opportunity to develop to its full potential without hindrance. Yet, applying a conventional measure of harm would likely result in the finding of no consumer harm, precisely because the nascent product was unproven when it was quashed by the dominant firm's bad conduct. Obviously, whether a particular upstart constituted a reasonable nascent threat or whether the threat was too tentative or remote to support that finding is a question of fact, in a specific case.</p><p>Nevertheless, antitrust agencies could and should be more aggressive in putting forward innovation effects as the theory of harm when a nascent rival is crushed, even if there is a fair amount of uncertainty as to the viability of the threat. Resolving doubts about innovation effects in favor of promoting entry is justified, given the importance of innovation to high technology markets, because suppressing competition would likely chill innovation from rivals and potential rivals. Equally important, requiring proof of a high likelihood that a dominant firm's bad conduct against a nascent threat caused anticompetitive harm could have the perverse result of \"encourag[ing] monopolists to take more and earlier anticompetitive action\" against a nascent competitor. (241) Also, as the court of appeals noted in Microsoft, it is only right that \"the defendant is made to suffer the uncertain consequences of its own undesirable conduct.\" (242)</p><p>Easing proof of harm to innovation could take the form of adjusting burdens of proof and adopting the use of presumptions. Antitrust courts today tend to be far more concerned about the risks of false positives than false negatives, largely because of the belief that the former is more costly than the latter. (241) Mistakenly condemning procompetitive conduct, it is thought, would chill innovation and have lasting adverse effects whereas mistakenly overlooking anticompetitive conduct should have fleeting impact because markets tend to self-correct. (244) Recent commentary has already cast considerable doubt on these conservative error-cost assumptions, (245) and in the context of digital platform markets, the assumptions are even more suspect. Digital platform markets have substantial network effects, which render them less susceptible to market self-correction. Thus, the assumption that markets quickly self-correct, thereby minimizing the effects of false negatives, is highly questionable in these markets.</p><p>This suggests that some recalibration of the rules to acknowledge the risks and high costs of false negatives, and to reduce the overstated fears of false positives, is overdue. The adjustment could simply take the form of adopting presumptions and burden-shifting. One of the drawbacks of the current heavily fact-intensive approach to proving effects is that while it may minimize false positives, the risk of false negatives is necessarily higher if the plaintiff bears the full burden of proof on factors that are inherently difficult to prove. Using presumptions and a burden-shifting framework would lighten that burden.</p><p>Conceptually, this suggestion would call for a presumption of anticompetitive effect to attach if the plaintiff demonstrates that a firm with monopoly power engaged in conduct that is outside the norm of what is considered competition on the merits, and the conduct foreclosed actual or nascent rivals in the relevant market or in a vertical/adjacent market. The defendant would have the opportunity to rebut the presumption by offering a nonpretextual business justification and showing that the procompetitive benefits exceed the anticompetitive harms. This framework would be slightly more pro-plaintiff than that applied in Microsoft where the plaintiff has to first demonstrate the anticompetitive effect of the conduct, (246) after which the burden shifts to the defendant only to proffer a nonpretextual business justification. (247) If the defendant is able to do so, under the Microsoft framework, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to either rebut the justification or to demonstrate that the anticompetitive harms exceed the procompetitive benefits. (248)</p><p>C. Respecting Qualitative Evidence</p><p>\"Modern\" antitrust's anxiety over false positives (while being curiously sanguine about false negatives) has led to a strong bias in favor of quantitative, as opposed to qualitative, evidence. While quantitative evidence is undoubtedly desirable if it exists, skepticism about the legitimacy and value of qualitative evidence is damaging to antitrust enforcement because, quite simply, quantitative evidence of some important consumer harms is typically nonexistent or difficult to compile.</p><p>Affording greater respect for qualitative evidence could significantly ease the plaintiff's burden of proving harms that are largely unquantifiable. This is especially important in markets where companies compete more on innovation and quality than on price because any alleged reductions in quality and innovation resulting from a dominant firm's bad conduct are unlikely to be reflected in quantitative data. Giving a role to qualitative evidence as suggested here, in fact, is not a novel idea. Faced with the reality that empirical data is sometimes unavailable or too difficult to compile, agencies have relied on, and courts have accepted, qualitative evidence in different settings, such as in the definition of a relevant antitrust market. (249)</p><p>For instance, while courts may speak in economic terms of having to determine the \"cross-elasticity of demand\" to define a relevant market, (250) the data necessary to empirically estimate demand elasticities--including cost information for multiple products--may be unavailable. In that case, agencies have offered, and courts have accepted, qualitative evidence indicating which products consumers view as acceptable alternatives to the product in question in order to define the market, in place of empirical evidence of demand elasticities. (251)</p><p>Consider, too, the precise technical rules for market definition set forth in the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission Joint Horizontal Merger Guidelines--the hypothetical monopolist SSNIP (small but significant nontransitory increase in price) test. (252) The SSNIP test is designed to determine whether alternative products are sufficiently acceptable from the buyer's perspective to serve as a competitive constraint on the seller of the product(s) in the candidate market. (253) It does so by asking whether a hypothetical monopolist of the product in question can profitably raise prices by a small but significant amount and hold the price increase for a nontransitory period (254) (typically 5 percent for one year). (255) If a SSNIP can be implemented, the market is deemed properly defined. (256) If a SSNIP cannot be implemented because too many sales would be lost to substitute products, rendering the hypothetical SSNIP unprofitable, the market definition would be expanded to include those reasonable substitutes, and the test would be repeated iteratively with the expanded group of products until a SSNIP can be implemented, at which point the market is properly defined. (257)</p><p>The hypothetical monopolist SSNIP test is a precise economic tool, but, in practice, the quantitative evidence needed to operationalize it is sometimes not readily available, in which case qualitative evidence is offered, in addition to or instead of quantitative evidence. (258) The qualitative evidence could include, for example, anecdotal evidence, market executives' testimony as to how buyers responded after a previous price increase, informal buyer surveys, evidence relating to industry participants' behavior, the views of industry experts as to which products they see as likely substitutes for buyers, and so forth. (259) In other words, antitrust law as practiced does not always insist on quantitative evidence--if necessary, antitrust agencies search for and offer reliable and appropriate qualitative evidence.</p><p>My suggestion here is to lift the skepticism sometimes shown toward qualitative evidence and to promote greater acceptance of it. Given the fact that harms to innovation cannot be easily quantified, treating qualitative evidence dismissively would likely result in more false negatives, while working to develop reliable qualitative evidence and to accord it due respect should help reinvigorate section 2 enforcement.</p><p>D. Intent Evidence</p><p>Another closely related suggestion involves reclaiming a role for intent evidence in monopolization analysis. It is true that most courts and commentators today tend to dismiss intent evidence as irrelevant and unhelpful to monopolization analysis, (260) reasoning that \"the 'intent' to create a monopoly anticompetitively cannot be distinguished from the intent to do so competitively.\" (261) I disagree with that view and have written elsewhere that intent evidence is relevant because it can inform the analysis of effects. (262) Intent evidence can serve as a guide to, and a proxy for, effects when effects cannot be empirically proven as is often the case, (263) because \"no one is likely to know better the probable effects of a practice than the firm engaging in it.\" (264)</p><p>If corporate statements or documents show that a dominant firm's actions were intended to eliminate a nascent rival in order to prevent a possible future threat to its dominance, it would be reasonable to infer from that intent that the effects of the action were anticompetitive even if there was no clear showing of competitive harm. (265) A careful review of the opinions of both the court of appeals and the district court in Microsoft, perhaps the most important monopolization case of the last few decades, suggests that the courts did precisely that. Though reliance on intent was never explicitly acknowledged, both opinions were replete with references to Microsoft's anticompetitive intent. (266) They pointed to numerous internal corporate documents, senior executive statements, and other evidence of Microsoft's intentions to destroy Netscape as a potential competitor and to deceive another potential competitor, in order to prevent a possible future threat to its Windows OS monopoly. (267)</p><p>Those opposed to the use of intent evidence have mainly asserted that procompetitive and anticompetitive intent are difficult to distinguish, (268) that intent evidence is subjective and unreliable, (269) and that juries may mistakenly find corporate anticompetitive intent based on an employee's use of aggressive war and sports metaphors to describe their dealings with a competitor. (270) In my view, these problems are overstated. (271) Though anticompetitive and procompetitive intent may sometimes be difficult to distinguish, factfinders in our judicial system are accustomed to making these types of determinations. (272) Courts are not strangers to the task of making fine factual distinctions. As for the argument that subjective intent evidence is suspect because corporate executives' loose talk of destroying a competitor, not meant to be taken literally, may be misconstrued as anticompetitive intent, my response is that this is precisely the type of assessment that factfinders are competent to make. (273)</p><p>There is nothing to indicate that juries [or judges] are more naive and susceptible to error in discerning intent in antitrust than in other cases. As long as [steps are taken to ensure that] the subjective statements carry certain indicia of credibility [before they are given weight], they can be helpful in interpreting the objective steps taken by a dominant firm, even when the objective steps themselves are ambiguous. (274)</p><p>In my view, monopolization analysis would be well served by according more respect to intent evidence, and this is particularly true in markets where innovation competition is important, such as those involving the largest digital platforms. Where effects are difficult to prove, turning to intent evidence as a guide to, or a proxy for, effect could ease the task of establishing section 2 liability.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Antitrust, long used to lying in the legal and technocratic shadows, has improbably found itself at the center of a public discourse on concentration, excessive economic and political power, wealth and income inequality, and problems relating to the seemingly entrenched dominance of the largest digital platforms. (275) The new political salience of antitrust has provided us with a much needed opportunity to rethink contemporary antitrust law and policy, particularly with respect to monopolization.</p><p>Reform efforts in the direction of a no-fault monopolization approach, however, would be misplaced. (276) Economically, it is not at all clear that no-fault intervention to disperse market power is likely to be beneficial on balance. If the motivation is noneconomic, the antitrust laws were not designed to specifically tackle the serious social and political problems critics have linked to the digital platforms. Applying and, if necessary, enacting specific laws and regulations tailored to those problems would be more effective and constructive. Moreover, if (as it seems) simplicity is what advocates are after, a no-fault approach is unlikely to deliver since it raises a number of difficult conceptual and practical questions that are not easily answerable.</p><p>Rather than adopt an approach with uncertain results that would completely disrupt the current antitrust paradigm, it may be more productive to seek to reinvigorate section 2 through more modest changes. (277) These changes could include making greater efforts to identify exclusionary conduct and to work toward extending its scope, relying on raising rivals' costs and other more liberal theories of harm. More flexibility in the analysis of consumer harm would also be helpful. This could include allowing inference of consumer harm to be drawn from evidence of harm to the competitive process, elevating and promoting the theory of long-run innovation harm, and easing proof of such harm by adopting rebuttable presumptions of anticompetitive harm in certain situations. Finally, overcoming some skepticism surrounding the legitimacy and value of qualitative evidence, including intent evidence, would reduce the burden of proof for establishing liability and, thereby, strengthen section 2 enforcement.</p><p>Marina Lao, Professor of Law, Seton Hall University School of Law.

See Khan &amp; Vaheesan, supra note 6, at 237; Vaheesan, supra note 25, at 981; see also sources cited supra note 122.

See, e.g., Vaheesan, supra note 25, at 984 (\"Powerful businesses are using their might to hurt Americans in myriad ways, and consumer welfare captures at most only a subset of these public harms.\").

See Baker &amp; Salop, supra note 6, at 6-8 (\"The wealthiest have a disproportionate influence on public policy.... This political effect can make inequality self-reinforcing: the economic power of those at the top gives the wealthy political power, which can be used to entrench and enhance their economic power, further increase their political power, and so on.

Macron, 40, who likes to style himself as a champion of the digital economy, will then appear at Paris's technology fair, VivaTech, which opens on Thursday.</p><p>Zuckerberg is currently on a Facebook apology tour after the Observer reported that the personal data of tens of millions of people was harvested and shared with the political consultancy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/22/no-repeat-of-data-scandal-vows-mark-zuckerberg-in-brussels-facebook\">Cambridge Analytica</url>.

The country's pharmaceutical market is the second largest in the world, trailing only the U.S., and is forecast to grow from $108 billion in sales in 2015 to $167 billion by 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That said, pharma and healthcare marketers see a wealth of untapped opportunity. China has about 731 million internet users, comparable to Europe's total population of 742.3 million, and 95% of them (695 million) have mobile devices. Yet tech giants such Google, Facebook, and Twitter have little relevance in the country, where their platforms are banned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/dataanalytics/us-marketers-spend-slightly-less-on-digital-engagement-with-docs-than-china/article/574890/\">U.S. marketers spend slightly less on digital engagement with docs than China</url></p><p>As a result, pharma companies have sought to partner with the country's homegrown alternatives, including Alibaba, Tencent, and Weibo, to reach Chinese consumers. Better still, for pharma companies not yet established in the market, the opportunities outweigh the challenges, according to Li Ma, VP of Alibaba Health, the health division of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Sure, there are China-specific challenges - in market access, distribution, pricing, and reimbursement, which aren't exactly slam dunks elsewhere - but the market's size overrides most concerns: about 1.4 billion people and growing.</p><p>There's also acute need. Rising income levels, changes in diets and lifestyles, and the impact of <br/> air and water pollution have contributed to an increase in chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, chronic conditions account for 85% of about 10.3 million deaths per year, and constitute 70% of the total burden of disease in the country. More than 2.8 million people in China died of cancer in 2015, with lung cancer claiming the most lives.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/technology/japanese-drugmakers-lead-the-way-in-digital-innovation/article/628286/\">Japanese drugmakers lead the way in digital innovation</url></p><p>Moreover, there are a variety of ways to approach the market, says Mark Natkin, founder and managing director of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting. \"Increasingly, we've seen pharma companies allying with big tech companies to introduce information, or some sort of free equipment or medical devices, to introduce their brand and product.\"</p><p>In 2016, Sanofi and Alibaba signed an agreement to partner on online and offline health services, disease management, and patient education, with the two companies planning to devise a detailed plan by the end of 2017. The focus would be on delivering programs for the management of chronic diseases, Jean-Christophe Pointeau, GM of pharma at Sanofi China, said at the time.</p><p>In February 2017, Eli Lilly collaborated with physician social network Ding Xiang Yuan and Tencent, known for mobile messenger WeChat, on a diabetes-management program. The program provides patients with blood-glucose testing devices, educational tools, and patient-care services, with doctors able to access data collected from the devices in real-time. Meanwhile, Bayer, Novartis, and Pfizer have set up corporate pages on the Twitter-like platform Weibo.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/campaigns/asia-pacific-to-overtake-north-america-in-ad-spending/article/509158/\">Asia-Pacific to overtake North America in ad spending</url></p><p>Ma says Alibaba's venture into health is part of its \"double H\" (health and happiness) strategy. \"Alibaba believes that what China needs most in the next 10 to 20 years is health and happiness,\" she explains. \"Ali Health hopes to improve healthcare outcomes and transform public health-management capabilities through our strengths in internet technology, big data, and innovation.\"</p><p>Alibaba, which has about 500 million active users on its platforms, launched Ali Health in 2014. The unit's main areas of focus are online healthcare services, health management, product traceability (ensuring safe drug production, circulation, and use), and pharma e-commerce.</p><p>By all accounts it has been an immediate success: Ali Health reported a 739% increase in year-over-year revenue in the 12 months ending March 31, from 56.6 million yuan ($8.5 million) in 2016 to 475.1 million yuan ($71.7 million) in 2017, driven by its over-the-counter e-commerce business. The company has partnerships with more than 200 pharmacy chains, covering more than 20,000 drugstores in more than 100 cities.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"616\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><tbody><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"/><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Alibaba and GSK China have partnered to launch an unbranded adult vaccination service system through Taobao, China's version of Amazon.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>GSK DIVES IN</p><p>In August 2017, GlaxoSmithKline China and Alibaba announced a partnership to launch an unbranded adult vaccination service system through the Alibaba-owned online shopping app Taobao, China's version of Amazon.

In this case, it was related to cervical cancer prevention,\" explains Leslie Chang, VP and GM of vaccines at GSK China.</p><p>The drugmaker's Cervarix became the first HPV vaccine approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2016 and launched in July 2017. It arrived at a time of need: According to the HPV Information Centre, cervical cancer is the eighth most common cancer among women in China and the second most common cancer among women aged between 15 and 44. Yet a 2010 study by the National Center for Biotechnology Information found that only 21% of about 52,000 Chinese women was screened for cervical cancer via a pap test.</p><p>\"Alibaba has the big data that can direct traffic, especially if we're looking at a younger cohort of women who would benefit from the vaccine and are social media savvy,\" Chang explains. \"At the same time, we're leveraging GSK's disease-awareness knowledge and [targeting] patients - in this case, healthy women - who want to get vaccinated at the right venues in China.\"</p><p>Users can access the system through the app's My Health section, where they can access vaccine information, consult with registered HCPs and bots, locate nearby healthcare centers that offer vaccinations, and book in-person consultations. The system aims to help health centers better manage their workload by assisting them in scheduling appointments and thus reducing the volume of walk-ins.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/agencies/gsk-consumer-healthcare-to-prioritize-digital-after-agency-review/article/511474/\">GSK Consumer Healthcare to prioritize digital after agency review</url></p><p>Currently, the service is available at about 500 healthcare centers in more than 20 provinces in the country. About 10,000 women have booked appointments through the system in the two months since launch, Chang reports. GSK and Alibaba aim to make the service available in 1,500 centers across more than 100 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, by early 2018.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"616\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><tbody><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"/><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Hundreds of people wait in line at a Chinese hospital (left), while a healthcare worker helps a woman access the vaccination service's app at a healthcare center (right).

In China, drugmakers need to negotiate with provincial authorities to register the price of their vaccine or medication in those pro-vinces. Through late October, GSK had resolved bidding in about 20 out of 31 provinces, Chang says.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/technology/why-use-health-plan-apps-to-search-for-specialists-and-understand-drug-coverage/article/685091/\">Why use health plan apps?

Glenn Hou, founding partner of China Insights Consultancy, says the regulatory environment in China makes it difficult for drugmakers to enter the market.</p><p>Search engine giant Baidu learned this the hard way in 2016. After a paid medical listing scandal that year - a cancer patient reportedly died after taking an alternative treatment recommended in a paid listing on the search engine - Baidu shut down its mobile health unit to refocus on AI-powered healthcare innovations, such as healthbots. The incident led Chinese regulators to tighten control over online advertising, including a demand that Baidu limit marketing information to no more than 30% of the space on each web page.</p><p>See also: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mmm-online.com/technology/how-healthbots-can-assist-patients-and-hcps/article/734953/\">How healthbots can assist patients and HCPs</url></p><p>Hou is skeptical about the effectiveness of pharma/tech partnerships in the country. \"It's a strategy around financial performance, not a corporate-development strategy,\" he explains. \"[Tech giants] have so much money, they just invest in 10 companies and wait to see which one will succeed.\"</p><p>However, Hou does see potential in the treatment of chronic disease, rare disease, and cancer. In those areas, he believes that partnerships can help patients manage their daily lives and access educational resources.</p><p>Natkin agrees, adding, \"To the extent that a pharma manufacturer can establish a relationship with not just doctors but also with patients and patients' families, and establish some trust and ongoing relationships, that will help the manufacturer penetrate the market much more deeply.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MMMHUS-720780</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MMMHUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RDM-RFF1-F16T-Y51F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">355070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Haymarket Media.

As a retired teacher, I can't fathom how letting an instructor keep a loaded gun in a classroom of 30 or more students would make the area \"safer.\" Why should educators be turned into armed guards? Our schools need to partner with local law enforcement agencies and private security companies to address the issue of school safety, and let teachers do the job for which they were hired - educating our youth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Phyllis Ramirez, San Francisco</p><p>Make choice count</p><p>With the general election only several weeks away, now is the time to review all our local, state and country's challenges. We should then evaluate all the candidates whose message offers the best solutions. Try to be objective and not determine a candidate based solely on their political affiliation. Many good men and women fall under different parties so if it is necessary to split your ticket, so be it. Security at home and around the world, economy, immigration, education, social security, environmental, infrastructure repairs and universal health care are only a few issues that need our review prior to voting. In November, be sure to vote your choice as this is the only means we have to voice our support or reject a candidate that does not measure up to our country's current needs.</p><p>Bob Sweeney, Warwick, R.I.</p><p>Strike a balance</p><p>Regarding \"B-grade produce gets the A-grade treatment\" Page One, Sept. 21: While I applaud Chef Nick Balla's creativity and dedication to addressing the issue of food waste, I feel its important to highlight some underrepresented aspects of the food waste story. These new ventures like Imperfect Produce and food-waste-focused restaurants are great at capitalizing on surplus foods. However, they can diminish the volume of fresh food donations available to food banks and pantries. Tara Duggan mentioned briefly that one of Balla's donations was produce that the SF-Marin Food Bank couldn't accept. </p><p>That should be a two-way relationship to simultaneously fight food waste and hunger. If Balla wants to make sure his restaurant is accepted in underserved communities, he can start by making sure he isn't taking food from those struggling to eat. He could also think beyond jobs and living wages to affordable food access and soliciting community input on food related issues. For instance, the price of these potential waste-saving meals was not discussed in the article. A well-intentioned restaurant doesn't help the community if its members can't afford to eat there. A balance must be struck between decreasing hunger and managing food waste.</p><p>Casey Brown, Berkeley</p><p>A gross injustice</p><p>Regarding \"Admission rules may not pass test\" Page One, Sept. 23: My son went to Lowell High School class of 2015, graduated from UC Berkeley last December he only took two and a half years and is working at a big tech company as a software engineer. He was identified as a gifted and talented student. In middle school, his GPA was closed to 4.0. He was on the Principal's honor roll all four years and six semesters. His National Iowa test scores were all in the top one percent all three years. His Lowell admission test scores were near the top. So imagine if he was somehow denied entrance to Lowell to make room for other way less qualified students? That would be a gross injustice. </p><p>Ernest Tam, San Francisco</p><p>Affordability focus</p><p>Regarding \"Dreamforce to draw crowds, cash to city\" Page One, Sept. 24: The annual four-day Salesforce conference in San Francisco is certainly a boon for the city's hotels and restaurants, but after it's over, will the downtown be any cleaner, safer or affordable? Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff deserves praise for his various philanthropic efforts though I'm not sure purchasing Time magazine is one of them, as this article states. However, I wish Benioff would team with other tech moguls like Facebook's Mark Zuckerburg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey to helm a presentation called \"How Technology Can Make Cities More Livable - and Reduce Homelessness.\"</p><p>Divya Gupta, San Francisco</p><p>'Barbaric' rule</p><p>Regarding \"To exchange one injustice for another\" Insight, John Diaz, Sept. 23: The horrific experience of losing a loved one, such as Pati Navalta Poblete's son's murder, is unimaginable. While I can't speak to the specifics of his death, I can speak to SB1437.</p><p>SB1437 is not a free pass for those involved, however remotely, in a murder. Under SB1437, prosecutors may still charge felony participants with first-degree murder based on the facts of the case. If the person was a major participant in the felony and did anything that shows reckless indifference to human life, they remain liable for first-degree murder. SB1437 doesn't undo court rulings defining what can be considered reckless indifference, such as the role the person had in planning the felony, their actions or inactions, or their relationship to other perpetrators. SB1437 ensures that juries can still convict not only the actual killer but also anyone who acted recklessly. </p><p>Additionally, SB1437 does not undo accomplice liability, a separate statute that allows first-degree murder against those who are, even remotely, an accomplice. </p><p>Without SB1437, our existing felony murder rule will continue - a rule the California Supreme Court called \"barbaric.\" SB1437 should be signed into law.</p><p>Sen.

By the end of the day, it had trimmed its loss to 1%, down 32.38 points at 3,348.42. Despite the drop, most of the stocks in the index were higher, and the S&amp;P 500 still managed to close out its first winning week in the last five.</p><p>The paring of losses came as optimism rose that Washington may be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more support for the economy.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told airlines in the afternoon to stop furloughing workers because aid for them is imminent.</p><p>She said a wider rescue package for the economy, one that investors have long been agitating for, could also perhaps be on the way.</p><p>Big technology stocks remained weak. It\u2019s a sharp departure from much of the summer, when Big Tech stocks carried the market higher.</p><p>Treasury yields ticked higher.</p><p>Oakland, Calif.</p><p>Administration blocked on visa restrictions</p><p>The Trump administration was blocked from restricting H-1B visas that highly skilled foreign technology workers rely on to work in the U.S. The ruling conflicts with a pair of decisions in September in similar cases.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White in Oakland, Calif., agreed with several big U.S. business groups, which argued President Donald Trump exceeded his authority by imposing the immigration restrictions. The order, at odds with the conclusion reached by a federal judge in Washington, means the fight will likely move to an appeals court.</p><p>White said his order doesn\u2019t apply nationwide but only to the members of the plaintiff organizations. Those members, which include giants like Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp., comprise hundreds of thousands of U.S. businesses of all sizes and from a cross-section of economic sectors.</p><p>Trump declared in a June proclamation that foreign workers pose a threat to the U.S. labor market amid the downturn caused by coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>His decree froze new H-1B and H-4 visas, used by technology workers and their families, as well as L visas for intracompany transfers and most J visas for work- and study-abroad programs, including au pairs, through the end of the year. Thursday\u2019s order also blocks restrictions on J and L visas.</p><p>Washington</p><p>Court reinstates Glaxo\u2019s $235M Teva verdict</p><p>GlaxoSmithKline won an appeals court ruling that reinstates a $235 million patent-infringement verdict against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. over the heart drug Coreg.</p><p>A trial court was wrong to throw out the jury\u2019s finding that Teva infringed a Glaxo patent, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled yesterday. The appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, reinstated the verdict and damages award.</p><p>Glaxo\u2019s patent is for the use of the compound carvedilol to lessen the chance of death from congestive heart failure. The company claimed Teva infringed the patent, even when it was only selling its generic version of Coreg for hypertension.</p><p>Teva began selling a generic version of Coreg in 2007, when the main patent on the drug expired. Teva argued it wasn\u2019t responsible for the actions of doctors who prescribed the generic for congestive heart failure, because the doctors were acting based on their knowledge of Coreg\u2019s uses that they learned from Glaxo.</p><p>Washington</p><p>TikTok deal likely to slip past election</p><p>ByteDance is working with U.S. regulators to resolve outstanding security concerns over its planned sale of a stake in music-video app TikTok, and the companies involved are bracing for the approval process to drag on past the November election, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Oracle Corp., which is leading the bid to buy a stake in TikTok, is also still hashing out the fine-print terms of the deal, which two weeks ago received an endorsement \u201cin concept\u201d from President Donald Trump but faces skepticism from others within his administration and from the Chinese government.</p><p>ByteDance is in discussions on a final proposal with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, the regulatory body that must clear any agreement.</p><p>Several issues remain unresolved, including questions about data security, Chinese ownership in the new TikTok Global and a possible $5 billion education fund. Trump has said that if a deal isn\u2019t done before Nov. 12, TikTok will be shut down in the U.S., but it\u2019s possible that deadline could be changed if negotiations are still going on into next month, people familiar said.</p><p>\u2014 Compiled from wire reports</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPRREP-MERLIN_91277726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPRREP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6104-WTB1-F08V-60NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">308103</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Republican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)</publicationName><edition>ALL S EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 3, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Temporary Workers (H Visas)</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjUyMjMwMzBEMkE5NEMxOUFDQzhBMzEwRkI4NTREMDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUM5REQzQTlCRjlDNDkwOEFEQTFDQURFOEI3OUJCNzY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QD4</classCode><className>NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000104</classCode><className>APPEALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000105</classCode><className>APPELLATE DECISIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097YR</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT VISAS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001299</classCode><className>PASSPORTS &amp;

The EU is set to accept the U.S. chipmaker\u2019s pledge within weeks, formalizing an offer made in April with only minor changes, the person said.</p><p>Broadcom, based in San Jose, California, has a variety of products spanning components for servers, smartphones, cars, security software, home broadband and software that runs the biggest mainframe computers.</p><p>Chicago</p><p>Citadel Securities doubles profit</p><p>In the last week of March, with the COVID-19 pandemic upending lives and markets, Ken Griffin started building a temporary trading floor in Florida.</p><p>Citadel Securities mostly abandoned its Chicago and New York offices and set up shop at the Four Seasons Palm Beach, moving dozens of employees and their families. Others went to an emergency facility in Connecticut, moves designed to keep his market-making firm operating seamlessly as the rest of the financial world dealt with wild swings and extraordinary trading volumes from makeshift home offices.</p><p>The efforts paid off, with Citadel Securities handling more than a quarter of all U.S. equity volume in the first half of the year.</p><p>The trading operation, which is separate from Griffin\u2019s hedge fund business, generated $3.84 billion of revenue in six months, more than the $3.26 billion for all of 2019, according to a presentation to investors. Net income was $2.36 billion in the first six months of 2020, compared with $982 million for the same period a year earlier.</p><p>A spokesman declined to comment on the numbers for closely held Citadel, which were disclosed to investors this month as the Chicago-based company seeks a $300 million loan.</p><p>Citadel Securities, led by Chief Executive Officer Peng Zhao, also increased its market share. In the U.S. options market, it climbed to 32% from 27%. In the three months through August, 28% of U.S. equity volume went through Citadel, up from 22% in 2019.</p><p>Milwaukee</p><p>Harley-Davidson loses its rumble in India</p><p>Harley-Davidson is riding out of India.

The attendees, who included such right-wing Internet luminaries as Diamond and Silk and former White House aide Sebastian Gorka, were even treated to a vintage diatribe against the mainstream press: \"The media says - the establishment media, the fake media - they say, 'Aww, there's no censorship in social media! That's all made up, that's all fake.' You and I know that's not true.\" </p><p>It was classic Trump. Only it wasn't Trump. That last bit was delivered by Josh Hawley, a 39-year-old Republican freshman senator from Missouri who has quickly become the face of the conservative side of the backlash against Silicon Valley. Half a year into his first term, he has introduced a raft of legislation aimed at cracking down on some of the business practices of giants like Facebook and Google. And, somewhat improbably for a Republican senator who often speaks in the language of Trumpian grievance, much of this legislation has been bipartisan. In March, he teamed up with Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on a bill to strengthen online privacy protections for children; then in May, he partnered with Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) on the Do Not Track Act, which would let users opt out of having their data mined.</p><p>All of this has earned Hawley accolades from across the aisle, even though the bills stand little chance of becoming law anytime soon, and some of them strike experts as clunky and overbroad. (A measure he introduced in late July - the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act - reads like a parody of hyper-regulation: \"[T]he operator shall present the user with an option to decline by clicking an icon that is identical to the other icon in terms of size, shape, font, and other visual or auditory design.\") Feinstein told me that she and Hawley are \"both advocates for individual control of personal data.\" Warner said, \"It's great to work with a Republican partner who is thinking deeply about these issues.\" And Markey called Hawley \"a tenacious privacy advocate.\"</p><p>The senator from Missouri - a devout Christian conservative and former law professor, widely seen as a likely 2024 presidential contender - says his goal is to hold tech companies accountable. \"These companies, Google and Facebook in particular - Twitter, too - have built a model based around exploitative and addictive practices,\" he told me recently. \"I think we need to be asking ourselves, 'What is it that these companies have really given this country? Have they increased our economic productivity? Have they given us new and better jobs at higher wages? Have they made us more literate? More hospitable?' I don't think so. I think the answer is 'no' to all those questions.\"</p><p>Hawley's mix of policy entrepreneurship, anti-tech zeal and Trump-style provocation doesn't, of course, always win friends on the left - and, in fact, it can sometimes prove off-putting to conservatives. Consider legislation he introduced in June that would crack down on alleged anti-conservative bias in online searches and social media. The Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act would force large tech companies - under penalty of losing their immunity from what their billions of users do on their platforms - to submit to federal audits to ensure they don't engage in politically biased moderation.</p><p>The bill attracted zero co-sponsors and was panned on both sides of the political spectrum. Liberals argued that there's no evidence of anti-conservative censorship on the big platforms; to the contrary, conservative outlets like Fox News do quite well in Facebook engagement, and YouTube's recommendation algorithm has been great for right-wing channels. Many conservatives, meanwhile, balked at the notion of empowering the federal government to regulate speech online. \"Josh Hawley's Internet Censorship Bill Is an Unwise, Unconstitutional Mess,\" declared a headline in the National Review. </p><p>Yet Hawley remains defiant. And why shouldn't he? The bill curried favor with Trump, the only Republican endorsement that matters. Moreover, the politics of tech have changed dramatically - in Hawley's direction - during the Trump era. Silicon Valley was long politically untouchable, insulated on the left by its ties to the Democratic establishment and on the right by a stable pro-corporate, free-market consensus. Trump's election threw both dynamics into question. Democrats have realized that social media platforms very likely enabled Trump's victory, no matter the political leanings of Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg. And Republicans increasingly understand that the GOP base has little affection for long-standing party orthodoxy on economic issues; maybe corporations - especially those tech companies seen as progressive - aren't untouchable just because they're profitable.</p><p>The result of all this is a D.C. environment that has become far more hostile to Big Tech, with the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and House Judiciary Committee recently launching parallel investigations of the major players. \"The tech companies and their allies need to be really careful in this world,\" says Zach Graves, head of policy at the Lincoln Network, a conservative tech-focused think tank. \"A lot of them are still operating on George Bush-era assumptions about what the rules are. I don't think those rules apply anymore, and Hawley is great proof of that.\"</p><p>But Hawley may not be content to stop with Big Tech. In July, he introduced a bill with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) to lower the value of the dollar - a serious break from long-standing Republican consensus on trade. And in a speech he gave not long after the social media summit, he took shots at both parties for worsening the nation's economic divide: \"For years, the politics of both left and right have been informed by a political consensus that reflects the interests not of the American middle, but of a powerful upper class and their cosmopolitan priorities,\" he declared, adding: \"And where has this left middle America? Well, with flat wages, with lost jobs, with declining investment and declining opportunity.\" </p><p>You can almost hear those words coming from the mouth of someone like Bernie Sanders - and they raise tantalizing questions about just how far the bipartisanship of Josh Hawley and those who share his views may, or may not, plausibly go. Is the overlap between the left and Hawley-ism like the middle of a Venn diagram? Or is it more like the momentary intersection of two lines pointing in very different directions, and diverging outward to infinity?</p><p>Like many political phenoms who seem to emerge out of nowhere onto the national stage, Hawley's preparations for a career in public office began early. Growing up in Lexington, Mo., a small town surrounded by farmland about an hour's drive east from Kansas City, Hawley showed a keen interest in what was happening in Washington. While still in high school, at a private Catholic prep school in Kansas City, he wrote an opinion column for his hometown newspaper called \"State of the Union.\" (Sample take: \"The American people no longer want security provided by the government; they want freedom to provide their own security unhindered by government.\")</p><p>As a freshman at Stanford, Hawley approached historian David M. Kennedy to do an independent study about the history of the presidency. Kennedy was reluctant. \"I gave him a list of pretty heavy readings going back to the 19th century, frankly expecting I'd never see him again,\" he recalls. Hawley returned two weeks later and Kennedy, skeptical that he had actually absorbed the reading, quizzed Hawley on the contents. \"He nailed every question absolutely perfectly. It was clear he had read it all carefully, critically, assimilated it, thought it through. It was a truly impressive response from a young student.\"</p><p>Later, Kennedy supervised Hawley's senior thesis, an intellectual history of Theodore Roosevelt that would turn into a book. \"It might have been one of the most impressive senior theses that I supervised over more than 40 years of teaching at Stanford,\" Kennedy says. At the same time, Hawley was very much a politician in the making: \"It was clear he had that kind of ambition. He had the whole package from a very early age.\"</p><p>After Stanford came Yale Law School, where Hawley led the school's chapter of the Federalist Society,  an influential conservative legal network. Ian Bassin, who was Hawley's liberal counterpart as president of Yale's American Constitution Society, remembers Hawley as a \"religious and moral person\" who had compassion for people with different views. \"Those of us who really appreciated talking to people we didn't agree with, we found Josh to be genuinely principled and interesting,\" he told me. \"It was a good back and forth that we had.\"</p><p>At Yale, Hawley made an important early political connection. Harold Hongju Koh, then the Law School dean and a fixture of the Democratic foreign policy establishment, had invited former senator John Danforth, a pillar of the Missouri Republican Party, to give a talk. Afterward, at a dinner party, Koh made a point of sitting Danforth next to one of his students, a young conservative from Missouri. \"He is just such a good person that I want you to know him,\" Danforth recalls Koh saying. Koh remembers the setup slightly differently. Hawley \"was eager, desperate to meet Danforth, and I like to help my students achieve what they want, so I introduced them to each other,\" he says. Either way, it was the start of a friendship - one that would come in handy when Hawley was ready to enter Missouri politics.</p><p>Following law school, Hawley spent a year clerking for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and he began dating a co-clerk, Erin Morrow, who would become his wife. After a stint at D.C. law firms, they joined the University of Missouri Law School faculty, while Hawley also worked for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest law firm. </p><p>His writings from those years provide a window into his politics. In a 2010 essay for National Affairs titled \"America's Epicurean Liberalism,\" he wrote that the \"celebration of individual will\" is \"closely associated with a series of prominent dysfunctions in contemporary America.\" By Hawley's account, the growth of a liberal state devoted to individualism had paradoxically reduced liberty by replacing the functions of civil society with government - \"too often leaving no room for the mediating institutions of family, churches, civic associations, and fraternal groups that keep society strong and free.\" </p><p>Hawley stresses that he doesn't think the government has any business directly promoting Christianity. But his views on religion certainly place him toward the far right of the spectrum. This spring, he shocked even Republican colleagues by torpedoing a federal judicial nominee who, as a lawyer representing East Lansing, Mich., had defended the application of that city's anti-discrimination law against a Catholic-owned orchard that announced it wouldn't allow same-sex marriages on its property. And in Missouri in 2018, he drew criticism for suggesting that the 20th-century sexual revolution was responsible for sex trafficking \"on a scale that we would never have imagined.\"</p><p>I</p><p>n his book, \"Theodore Roosevelt: Preacher of Righteousness,\" which he published when he was just 28, Hawley describes a scenario that may sound familiar. For the election of 1884, the Republican Party nominated James G. Blaine, a controversial presidential candidate with a history of sketchy real estate dealings and an economic platform centered on protective tariffs. A number of high-minded GOP members broke ranks and refused to support him. But Roosevelt, an up-and-coming Republican politician, decided to set aside his contempt and back the nominee in the name of party loyalty. \"Politics,\" he told himself, in Hawley's summary, \"was a rough business; the political man must, to do any good, be willing to work with the less-than-ideal.\"</p><p>Hawley has taken many of his cues from the iconoclastic former president, his boyhood hero. Like Roosevelt, who grew up wealthy in New York City but remade himself as a rugged outdoorsman, Hawley has cultivated an image as a political outsider. In 2016, when he ran for Missouri attorney general, his campaign produced an ad featuring him walking toward the camera as, all around, men in suits climb literal ladders. Hawley is tall, lean and muscular, with a thick swoop of brushed-back brown hair and a narrow, serious face. Speaking in the sonorous baritone of a radio announcer, he says: \"Jefferson City is full of career politicians just climbing the ladder. I think you deserve better.\" A narrator's voice concludes: \"Josh Hawley. Conservative. Outsider. Attorney general.\"</p><p>The 2016 race was Hawley's first foray into politics. That November, he cruised to victory, winning slightly more votes statewide than even Trump. From the beginning, he did not behave like someone content to stay on the bottom rung. An investigation by the Kansas City Star found that, as attorney general, Hawley's payroll included a team of D.C.-based political consultants, who helped choreograph high-profile initiatives including litigation against opioid manufacturers and a raid on alleged sex traffickers, where Hawley appeared, camera-ready, wearing a law-enforcement badge around his neck. What drew Hawley's first national headlines, however, was the announcement of an antitrust investigation against Google - a sign both of his early interest in the subject and of its political potential. </p><p>The ladder-climbing ad became infamous in Missouri politics when, less than a year into his term, Hawley announced he was running to try to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill (D). Hawley, who was heavily recruited to join the race, insists that the Senate wasn't on his mind when he ran for attorney general.</p><p>It was during his Senate race that Hawley's current public persona started coming into view. In his campaign announcement video, flanked in the family kitchen by his wife and two young sons, he began laying down the anti-elite refrain he has been humming ever since. \"The D.C. career crowd just keeps on doing the same old thing,\" he told the camera. \"And you know? The system works pretty well for them. They're connected.\"</p><p>His challenge, as Missouri political reporters Lindsay Wise and Bryan Lowry would later write, \"was to convince both the populist, Trumpian wing of the Republican Party and the country club establishment that he was secretly one of them - and that he was just humoring the other guys.\" Early on, it looked like that might prove difficult. In August 2017, Hawley skipped a Trump rally in Springfield; the week before, his political mentor, Danforth, had published a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post urging Republicans to break with the president. After Hawley refused to denounce Danforth, a pro-Trump Republican threatened to jump into the race. According to news reports at the time, Hawley's campaign grew worried that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon would follow through on threats to back a primary opponent, and Hawley called Bannon to assure him they were on the same team. The next time Trump came to Missouri, Hawley was there to greet him. After that, Trump became a frequent visitor to the state, appearing with Hawley at a rally the night before the election. The next day, Hawley defeated McCaskill 51 percent to 45 percent. </p><p>Hawley's embrace of Trump and other politically expedient positions - he ran ads declaring his support for coverage of preexisting conditions even as he joined litigation to overturn the Affordable Care Act - strained some relationships. \"I was deeply disappointed in his behavior,\" Koh told me. \"It shocked me he was so eager to win he was ready to say pretty much anything.\"</p><p>Danforth, who in an interview described himself as a friend and admirer of Hawley, didn't criticize him directly - but he made clear that he dislikes anti-elite populist rhetoric. \"That's just a standard political style today, to try to convince people that they're being victimized by the in group, the powerful,\" he said. \"I think it's wrong.\"</p><p>Some of Hawley's Yale classmates, including former friendly rival Bassin, also wrote an open letter to Missouri voters blasting him. \"We may not have always agreed with Josh's politics during law school, but those of us who knew him respected his principles,\" they wrote. \"We have been saddened to see Josh abandon those principles as he tries to climb the political ladder.\"</p><p>Every politician faces questions about authenticity; the unusual thing about Hawley is that the private version of him appears to be more likable than the political one. When I asked his wife, Erin, to tell me something that most people don't know about him, she said: \"I would probably say the fun side. He has a wicked sense of humor and so we laugh a lot. ... I'm not sure you get that from the public persona.\"</p><p>Indeed, the public Hawley is dependably grim. In Senate hearings, he's sarcastic and stern. During one hearing a week after the White House social media summit, he verbally cornered Karan Bhatia, vice president of public policy at Google, letting Bhatia repeat his assurances that Google would never censor or filter results based on political viewpoints, before pouncing on the fact that the company deployed a censored search engine in China for four years before shutting it down in 2010. \"You have been more than happy to partner with the most repressive authoritarian regime on the planet,\" Hawley said from the dais. \"All for profits. Whatever it is that's good for Google. Why would anybody believe you now?\" </p><p>In other settings, Hawley can be downright apocalyptic. A few hours after the Google hearing, he was at a hotel in Washington delivering a keynote speech to the first National Conservatism Conference, a three-day gathering of the nascent movement to impose intellectual architecture on the post-Trump conservative coalition. \"The fate of our republican government is at issue,\" he warned, raising the specter of a \"cosmopolitan elite\" with questionable allegiances. \"This class lives in the United States, but they identify as 'citizens of the world.' They run businesses or oversee universities here, but their primary loyalty is to the global community.\" </p><p>The speech drew warm applause in person, but Hawley's rhetoric didn't go over so well online. A number of Jewish and left-leaning critics, including New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, called out Hawley's notion of a \"cosmopolitan\" elite as anti-Semitic. (\"Rootless cosmopolitan\" was a common anti-Semitic slur in the Soviet Union, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories often depict Jews as globalists who are disloyal to the nations they live in. \"If you're Jewish and the use of 'cosmopolitan' doesn't scare you, read some history,\" Krugman tweeted.) </p><p>Hawley, as always, was unapologetic. \"When it comes to liberals,\" he told Tucker Carlson the following week on Fox News, \"there's only one thing that they love more than being elites, and that's accusing everyone else of being bigots.\" </p><p>When I met Hawley in his Senate office the next day, however, there was little trace of that hostility. In person, he was a totally game interview subject, playful, quick to laugh, including at himself, and to smile broadly. Even his theory of politics was subtly different. In speeches and Fox News appearances, he portrays elites as scheming and disloyal; at the conference, he argued that \"the leadership class have tried to build a new state in their own image.\" But when we spoke, he seemed more understanding. \"I think both parties were probably caught off guard by this, frankly, by these developments over the last 20 or 30 years, because the neoliberal consensus, if you like, predicted something different,\" he said, leaning back, one arm draped over his office's leather couch. \"And now we've got to think through what do we do about that.\"</p><p>I asked him what he meant by \"cosmopolitan elite\" - and how someone with his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 doesn't qualify. \"The problem is not people going to places like Stanford or Yale, or wherever they go,\" he said. \"The problem is thinking that just because that's something that they wanted to do with their lives, that their priorities and their ambitions and their values should control the whole rest of the country's.\" </p><p>Hawley insists that his evocation of \"the great American middle\" is not code for whites or Christians. \"In this country, we are proudly and rightly - we're not united by blood, we're not united by ethnicity, we're not united by race,\" he said. \"We are united by the things we love together. And in loving those things together, we come to love each other. That has got to be our goal, and that has got to be our aspiration.\" </p><p>It's poetry. Who could object to coming together in love? (At that point, I scribbled in my notebook: \"Marianne Williamson?\") But an unpleasant corollary is that there's another group of Americans who don't love the same things. According to Hawley, that's an elite made up of Wall Street, Hollywood, academia, the news media - and, of course, Big Tech.</p><p>Defining politics in opposition to some enemy of the masses is the very definition of populism, and the role that the cosmopolitan elite play in Hawley's rhetoric is similar to the one that \"millionaires and billionaires\" play in Bernie Sanders's. In fact, Hawley sometimes seems like a walking manifestation of horseshoe theory - the idea that the political spectrum is not a line, but a curve along which the far left and the far right eventually bend toward each other. \"These orthodoxies, plural, that have defined our politics, really since the Second World War, it is time for them to be put to rest,\" he told me.</p><p>And yet, with the major exceptions of trade policy and his willingness to aggressively regulate Big Tech, it's hard to find examples of Republican orthodoxy that Hawley actually rejects. He supported the 2017 tax cut, which heavily benefited corporations and the wealthy, and told me he still thinks it was a good idea. In Missouri, he backed a right-to-work law that voters overwhelmingly rejected in a statewide referendum. And while Hawley expresses general concern about the threat of rising corporate concentration, especially to small businesses, he hasn't co-sponsored any of the bills Senate Democrats have introduced to strengthen antitrust enforcement. (In a statement, Hawley's spokesperson pointed out that Hawley asked about antitrust and tech during Attorney General William Barr's confirmation hearing. \"As he has said consistently,\" the spokesperson noted, \"antitrust enforcement is a critical tool in the competition policy tool kit, and he is friendly to all efforts to begin a conversation about how best to use and strengthen those tools.\") I was surprised to have to prod him to discuss Amazon, a corporation that in some ways dominates the economy more than any of the other tech giants and may be doing the most to crush independent merchants. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Since his speech at the National Conservatism Conference, a fair bit of liberal commentary has pointed to Hawley's political positions and wondered whether he's a \"real\" populist. That may be the wrong question. Populism isn't an ideology; it's a style, not wedded to any particular policy agenda. J.D. Vance, the conservative author of \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and a friend of Hawley's, told me he thinks Hawley is betting that the Republican Party can be the first to win over an American working class that is to the left of the GOP economically, but to the right of the Democrats on social issues. The challenge - especially as long as Trump leads the party - is figuring out how to appeal to working-class whites, whose cultural conservatism heavily centers on immigration and race, without alienating minority working-class voters.</p><p>Hawley attempts this by blaming the declining economic fortunes of the working class not primarily on illegal immigration, but on the various manifestations of cultural liberalism. Philosophers and screenwriters are, in this telling, somehow responsible for offshoring jobs to China. \"I think the big divide of our time is between the leadership class and their aspirations and their value set and their ideals, and the aspirations and ideals and therefore the lives of the folks in the middle of our country,\" he told me. \"And our economic structure reflects that.\"</p><p>This theory helps explain why social media is such a natural target for Hawley. If any place in America combines liberal cultural values with a hardcore capitalist streak, it's Silicon Valley. Conservatives even have a name for this: \"woke capital\" - the idea that corporations engage in performative cultural progressivism to stave off criticism of their business practices. </p><p>Hawley's anti-censorship bill is \"one of the best examples that we have of what a nationalist would mean when they say they want to use political power to address a cultural problem,\" says David French, author of the National Review piece criticizing the legislation. \"The one area in which the right broadly has been much more successful is politics, and the left has been broadly successful in culture, and therefore [they think] what we must do to save our nation is exert political power to change the national culture.\"</p><p>This is where the left and right critiques of corporate America part ways. To a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren, the problem with woke capital is the capital. To a Josh Hawley, it's the wokeness. </p><p>To the left, the sweeping social changes over the past 40 years happened despite a growing economic divide. But to Hawley, the former caused the latter. The rise of an individualist culture that devalues traditional Christian morality, hard work and civil society is responsible, along with the endurance of the post-New Deal welfare state, for the hollowing out of the middle class. If you believe that, then of course your political program is going to look nothing like that of a liberal who wants to raise the minimum wage and expand the social safety net. \"That doesn't give people dignity,\" Hawley told me. \"That doesn't give them the ability to manage and control their own lives.\"</p><p>This is why, despite the surface-level overlap between left- and right-wing economic populism, they remain so irreconcilably opposed. Both sides might hate Big Tech; both sides might justify their policy objectives in terms of reviving the economic fortunes of middle America. But because their theories of what has gone wrong are almost entirely different, they will continue to pull in opposite policy directions. And they will continue to train their anger on (mostly) different enemies.</p><p>After about an hour, Hawley's staff finally persuaded him to wrap up the interview so he could make his next appointment. As we stood up, I squeezed in one more question: Did he really believe the media was ignoring censorship of conservatives, as he had said with his \"fake media\" comment at the social media summit? \"My sense is the mainstream media thinks that is just ridiculous, that it's a joke,\" he said. But \"fake news\" is such a loaded term, I countered - it implies malice. \"There might be some malice,\" he responded, with a sly wink, as we headed for the door. \"Not for everybody, but I think there's some malice out there.\"</p><p>Gilad Edelman is executive editor of the Washington Monthly.

The attendees, who included such right-wing Internet luminaries as Diamond and Silk and former White House aide Sebastian Gorka, were even treated to a vintage diatribe against the mainstream press: \"The media says - the establishment media, the fake media - they say, 'Aww, there's no censorship in social media! That's all made up, that's all fake.' You and I know that's not true.\" </p><p>It was classic Trump. Only it wasn't Trump. That last bit was delivered by Josh Hawley, a 39-year-old Republican freshman senator from Missouri who has quickly become the face of the conservative side of the backlash against Silicon Valley. Half a year into his first term, he has introduced a raft of legislation aimed at cracking down on some of the business practices of giants like Facebook and Google. And, somewhat improbably for a Republican senator who often speaks in the language of Trumpian grievance, much of this legislation has been bipartisan. In March, he teamed up with Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on a bill to strengthen online privacy protections for children; then in May, he partnered with Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) on the Do Not Track Act, which would let users opt out of having their data mined.</p><p>All of this has earned Hawley accolades from across the aisle, even though the bills stand little chance of becoming law anytime soon, and some of them strike experts as clunky and overbroad. (A measure he introduced in late July - the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act - reads like a parody of hyper-regulation: \"[T]he operator shall present the user with an option to decline by clicking an icon that is identical to the other icon in terms of size, shape, font, and other visual or auditory design.\") Feinstein told me that she and Hawley are \"both advocates for individual control of personal data.\" Warner said, \"It's great to work with a Republican partner who is thinking deeply about these issues.\" And Markey called Hawley \"a tenacious privacy advocate.\"</p><p>The senator from Missouri - a devout Christian conservative and former law professor, widely seen as a likely 2024 presidential contender - says his goal is to hold tech companies accountable. \"These companies, Google and Facebook in particular - Twitter, too - have built a model based around exploitative and addictive practices,\" he told me recently. \"I think we need to be asking ourselves, 'What is it that these companies have really given this country? Have they increased our economic productivity? Have they given us new and better jobs at higher wages? Have they made us more literate? More hospitable?' I don't think so. I think the answer is 'no' to all those questions.\"</p><p>Hawley's mix of policy entrepreneurship, anti-tech zeal and Trump-style provocation doesn't, of course, always win friends on the left - and, in fact, it can sometimes prove off-putting to conservatives. Consider legislation he introduced in June that would crack down on alleged anti-conservative bias in online searches and social media. The Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act would force large tech companies - under penalty of losing their immunity from what their billions of users do on their platforms - to submit to federal audits to ensure they don't engage in politically biased moderation.</p><p>The bill attracted zero co-sponsors and was panned on both sides of the political spectrum. Liberals argued that there's no evidence of anti-conservative censorship on the big platforms; to the contrary, conservative outlets like Fox News do quite well in Facebook engagement, and YouTube's recommendation algorithm has been great for right-wing channels. Many conservatives, meanwhile, balked at the notion of empowering the federal government to regulate speech online. \"Josh Hawley's Internet Censorship Bill Is an Unwise, Unconstitutional Mess,\" declared a headline in the National Review. </p><p>Yet Hawley remains defiant. And why shouldn't he? The bill curried favor with Trump, the only Republican endorsement that matters. Moreover, the politics of tech have changed dramatically - in Hawley's direction - during the Trump era. Silicon Valley was long politically untouchable, insulated on the left by its ties to the Democratic establishment and on the right by a stable pro-corporate, free-market consensus. Trump's election threw both dynamics into question. Democrats have realized that social media platforms very likely enabled Trump's victory, no matter the political leanings of Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg. And Republicans increasingly understand that the GOP base has little affection for long-standing party orthodoxy on economic issues; maybe corporations - especially those tech companies seen as progressive - aren't untouchable just because they're profitable.</p><p>The result of all this is a D.C. environment that has become far more hostile to Big Tech, with the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and House Judiciary Committee recently launching parallel investigations of the major players. \"The tech companies and their allies need to be really careful in this world,\" says Zach Graves, head of policy at the Lincoln Network, a conservative tech-focused think tank. \"A lot of them are still operating on George Bush-era assumptions about what the rules are. I don't think those rules apply anymore, and Hawley is great proof of that.\"</p><p>But Hawley may not be content to stop with Big Tech. In July, he introduced a bill with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) to lower the value of the dollar - a serious break from long-standing Republican consensus on trade. And in a speech he gave not long after the social media summit, he took shots at both parties for worsening the nation's economic divide: \"For years, the politics of both left and right have been informed by a political consensus that reflects the interests not of the American middle, but of a powerful upper class and their cosmopolitan priorities,\" he declared, adding: \"And where has this left middle America? Well, with flat wages, with lost jobs, with declining investment and declining opportunity.\"</p><p>You can almost hear those words coming from the mouth of someone like Bernie Sanders - and they raise tantalizing questions about just how far the bipartisanship of Josh Hawley and those who share his views may, or may not, plausibly go. Is the overlap between the left and Hawley-ism like the middle of a Venn diagram? Or is it more like the momentary intersection of two lines pointing in very different directions, and diverging outward to infinity?</p><p>Like many political phenoms who seem to emerge out of nowhere onto the national stage, Hawley's preparations for a career in public office began early. Growing up in Lexington, Mo., a small town surrounded by farmland about an hour's drive east from Kansas City, Hawley showed a keen interest in what was happening in Washington. While still in high school, at a private Catholic prep school in Kansas City, he wrote an opinion column for his hometown newspaper called \"State of the Union.\" (Sample take: \"The American people no longer want security provided by the government; they want freedom to provide their own security unhindered by government.\")</p><p>As a freshman at Stanford, Hawley approached historian David M. Kennedy to do an independent study about the history of the presidency. Kennedy was reluctant. \"I gave him a list of pretty heavy readings going back to the 19th century, frankly expecting I'd never see him again,\" he recalls. Hawley returned two weeks later and Kennedy, skeptical that he had actually absorbed the reading, quizzed Hawley on the contents. \"He nailed every question absolutely perfectly. It was clear he had read it all carefully, critically, assimilated it, thought it through. It was a truly impressive response from a young student.\"</p><p>Later, Kennedy supervised Hawley's senior thesis, an intellectual history of Theodore Roosevelt that would turn into a book. \"It might have been one of the most impressive senior theses that I supervised over more than 40 years of teaching at Stanford,\" Kennedy says. At the same time, Hawley was very much a politician in the making: \"It was clear he had that kind of ambition. He had the whole package from a very early age.\"</p><p>After Stanford came Yale Law School, where Hawley led the school's chapter of the Federalist Society,  an influential conservative legal network. Ian Bassin, who was Hawley's liberal counterpart as president of Yale's American Constitution Society, remembers Hawley as a \"religious and moral person\" who had compassion for people with different views. \"Those of us who really appreciated talking to people we didn't agree with, we found Josh to be genuinely principled and interesting,\" he told me. \"It was a good back and forth that we had.\"</p><p>At Yale, Hawley made an important early political connection. Harold Hongju Koh, then the Law School dean and a fixture of the Democratic foreign policy establishment, had invited former senator John Danforth, a pillar of the Missouri Republican Party, to give a talk. Afterward, at a dinner party, Koh made a point of sitting Danforth next to one of his students, a young conservative from Missouri. \"He is just such a good person that I want you to know him,\" Danforth recalls Koh saying. Koh remembers the setup slightly differently. Hawley \"was eager, desperate to meet Danforth, and I like to help my students achieve what they want, so I introduced them to each other,\" he says. Either way, it was the start of a friendship - one that would come in handy when Hawley was ready to enter Missouri politics.</p><p>Following law school, Hawley spent a year clerking for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and he began dating a co-clerk, Erin Morrow, who would become his wife. After a stint at D.C. law firms, they joined the University of Missouri Law School faculty, while Hawley also worked for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest law firm. </p><p>His writings from those years provide a window into his politics. In a 2010 essay for National Affairs titled \"America's Epicurean Liberalism,\" he wrote that the \"celebration of individual will\" is \"closely associated with a series of prominent dysfunctions in contemporary America.\" By Hawley's account, the growth of a liberal state devoted to individualism had paradoxically reduced liberty by replacing the functions of civil society with government - \"too often leaving no room for the mediating institutions of family, churches, civic associations, and fraternal groups that keep society strong and free.\"</p><p>Hawley stresses that he doesn't think the government has any business directly promoting Christianity. But his views on religion certainly place him toward the far right of the spectrum. This spring, he shocked even Republican colleagues by torpedoing a federal judicial nominee who, as a lawyer representing East Lansing, Mich., had defended the application of that city's anti-discrimination law against a Catholic-owned orchard that announced it wouldn't allow same-sex marriages on its property. And in Missouri in 2018, he drew criticism for suggesting that the 20th-century sexual revolution was responsible for sex trafficking \"on a scale that we would never have imagined.\"</p><p>I</p><p>n his book, \"Theodore Roosevelt: Preacher of Righteousness,\" which he published when he was just 28, Hawley describes a scenario that may sound familiar. For the election of 1884, the Republican Party nominated James G. Blaine, a controversial presidential candidate with a history of sketchy real estate dealings and an economic platform centered on protective tariffs. A number of high-minded GOP members broke ranks and refused to support him. But Roosevelt, an up-and-coming Republican politician, decided to set aside his contempt and back the nominee in the name of party loyalty. \"Politics,\" he told himself, in Hawley's summary, \"was a rough business; the political man must, to do any good, be willing to work with the less-than-ideal.\"</p><p>Hawley has taken many of his cues from the iconoclastic former president, his boyhood hero. Like Roosevelt, who grew up wealthy in New York City but remade himself as a rugged outdoorsman, Hawley has cultivated an image as a political outsider. In 2016, when he ran for Missouri attorney general, his campaign produced an ad featuring him walking toward the camera as, all around, men in suits climb literal ladders. Hawley is tall, lean and muscular, with a thick swoop of brushed-back brown hair and a narrow, serious face. Speaking in the sonorous baritone of a radio announcer, he says: \"Jefferson City is full of career politicians just climbing the ladder. I think you deserve better.\" A narrator's voice concludes: \"Josh Hawley. Conservative. Outsider. Attorney general.\"</p><p>The 2016 race was Hawley's first foray into politics. That November, he cruised to victory, winning slightly more votes statewide than even Trump. From the beginning, he did not behave like someone content to stay on the bottom rung. An investigation by the Kansas City Star found that, as attorney general, Hawley's payroll included a team of D.C.-based political consultants, who helped choreograph high-profile initiatives including litigation against opioid manufacturers and a raid on alleged sex traffickers, where Hawley appeared, camera-ready, wearing a law-enforcement badge around his neck. What drew Hawley's first national headlines, however, was the announcement of an antitrust investigation against Google - a sign both of his early interest in the subject and of its political potential. </p><p>The ladder-climbing ad became infamous in Missouri politics when, less than a year into his term, Hawley announced he was running to try to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill (D). Hawley, who was heavily recruited to join the race, insists that the Senate wasn't on his mind when he ran for attorney general.</p><p>It was during his Senate race that Hawley's current public persona started coming into view. In his campaign announcement video, flanked in the family kitchen by his wife and two young sons, he began laying down the anti-elite refrain he has been humming ever since. \"The D.C. career crowd just keeps on doing the same old thing,\" he told the camera. \"And you know? The system works pretty well for them. They're connected.\"</p><p>His challenge, as Missouri political reporters Lindsay Wise and Bryan Lowry would later write, \"was to convince both the populist, Trumpian wing of the Republican Party and the country club establishment that he was secretly one of them - and that he was just humoring the other guys.\" Early on, it looked like that might prove difficult. In August 2017, Hawley skipped a Trump rally in Springfield; the week before, his political mentor, Danforth, had published a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post urging Republicans to break with the president. After Hawley refused to denounce Danforth, a pro-Trump Republican threatened to jump into the race. According to news reports at the time, Hawley's campaign grew worried that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon would follow through on threats to back a primary opponent, and Hawley called Bannon to assure him they were on the same team. The next time Trump came to Missouri, Hawley was there to greet him. After that, Trump became a frequent visitor to the state, appearing with Hawley at a rally the night before the election. The next day, Hawley defeated McCaskill 51 percent to 45 percent.</p><p>Hawley's embrace of Trump and other politically expedient positions - he ran ads declaring his support for coverage of preexisting conditions even as he joined litigation to overturn the Affordable Care Act - strained some relationships. \"I was deeply disappointed in his behavior,\" Koh told me. \"It shocked me he was so eager to win he was ready to say pretty much anything.\"</p><p>Danforth, who in an interview described himself as a friend and admirer of Hawley, didn't criticize him directly - but he made clear that he dislikes anti-elite populist rhetoric. \"That's just a standard political style today, to try to convince people that they're being victimized by the in group, the powerful,\" he said. \"I think it's wrong.\"</p><p>Some of Hawley's Yale classmates, including former friendly rival Bassin, also wrote an open letter to Missouri voters blasting him. \"We may not have always agreed with Josh's politics during law school, but those of us who knew him respected his principles,\" they wrote. \"We have been saddened to see Josh abandon those principles as he tries to climb the political ladder.\"</p><p>Every politician faces questions about authenticity; the unusual thing about Hawley is that the private version of him appears to be more likable than the political one. When I asked his wife, Erin, to tell me something that most people don't know about him, she said: \"I would probably say the fun side. He has a wicked sense of humor and so we laugh a lot. ... I'm not sure you get that from the public persona.\"</p><p>Indeed, the public Hawley is dependably grim. In Senate hearings, he's sarcastic and stern. During one hearing a week after the White House social media summit, he verbally cornered Karan Bhatia, vice president of public policy at Google, letting Bhatia repeat his assurances that Google would never censor or filter results based on political viewpoints, before pouncing on the fact that the company deployed a censored search engine in China for four years before shutting it down in 2010. \"You have been more than happy to partner with the most repressive authoritarian regime on the planet,\" Hawley said from the dais. \"All for profits. Whatever it is that's good for Google. Why would anybody believe you now?\"</p><p>In other settings, Hawley can be downright apocalyptic. A few hours after the Google hearing, he was at a hotel in Washington delivering a keynote speech to the first National Conservatism Conference, a three-day gathering of the nascent movement to impose intellectual architecture on the post-Trump conservative coalition. \"The fate of our republican government is at issue,\" he warned, raising the specter of a \"cosmopolitan elite\" with questionable allegiances. \"This class lives in the United States, but they identify as 'citizens of the world.' They run businesses or oversee universities here, but their primary loyalty is to the global community.\" </p><p>The speech drew warm applause in person, but Hawley's rhetoric didn't go over so well online. A number of Jewish and left-leaning critics, including New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, called out Hawley's notion of a \"cosmopolitan\" elite as anti-Semitic. (\"Rootless cosmopolitan\" was a common anti-Semitic slur in the Soviet Union, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories often depict Jews as globalists who are disloyal to the nations they live in. \"If you're Jewish and the use of 'cosmopolitan' doesn't scare you, read some history,\" Krugman tweeted.) </p><p>Hawley, as always, was unapologetic. \"When it comes to liberals,\" he told Tucker Carlson the following week on Fox News, \"there's only one thing that they love more than being elites, and that's accusing everyone else of being bigots.\"</p><p>When I met Hawley in his Senate office the next day, however, there was little trace of that hostility. In person, he was a totally game interview subject, playful, quick to laugh, including at himself, and to smile broadly. Even his theory of politics was subtly different. In speeches and Fox News appearances, he portrays elites as scheming and disloyal; at the conference, he argued that \"the leadership class have tried to build a new state in their own image.\" But when we spoke, he seemed more understanding. \"I think both parties were probably caught off guard by this, frankly, by these developments over the last 20 or 30 years, because the neoliberal consensus, if you like, predicted something different,\" he said, leaning back, one arm draped over his office's leather couch. \"And now we've got to think through what do we do about that.\"</p><p>I asked him what he meant by \"cosmopolitan elite\" - and how someone with his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 doesn't qualify. \"The problem is not people going to places like Stanford or Yale, or wherever they go,\" he said. \"The problem is thinking that just because that's something that they wanted to do with their lives, that their priorities and their ambitions and their values should control the whole rest of the country's.\" </p><p>Hawley insists that his evocation of \"the great American middle\" is not code for whites or Christians. \"In this country, we are proudly and rightly - we're not united by blood, we're not united by ethnicity, we're not united by race,\" he said. \"We are united by the things we love together. And in loving those things together, we come to love each other. That has got to be our goal, and that has got to be our aspiration.\" </p><p>It's poetry. Who could object to coming together in love? (At that point, I scribbled in my notebook: \"Marianne Williamson?\") But an unpleasant corollary is that there's another group of Americans who don't love the same things. According to Hawley, that's an elite made up of Wall Street, Hollywood, academia, the news media - and, of course, Big Tech.</p><p>Defining politics in opposition to some enemy of the masses is the very definition of populism, and the role that the cosmopolitan elite play in Hawley's rhetoric is similar to the one that \"millionaires and billionaires\" play in Bernie Sanders's. In fact, Hawley sometimes seems like a walking manifestation of horseshoe theory - the idea that the political spectrum is not a line, but a curve along which the far left and the far right eventually bend toward each other. \"These orthodoxies, plural, that have defined our politics, really since the Second World War, it is time for them to be put to rest,\" he told me.</p><p>And yet, with the major exceptions of trade policy and his willingness to aggressively regulate Big Tech, it's hard to find examples of Republican orthodoxy that Hawley actually rejects. He supported the 2017 tax cut, which heavily benefited corporations and the wealthy, and told me he still thinks it was a good idea. In Missouri, he backed a right-to-work law that voters overwhelmingly rejected in a statewide referendum. And while Hawley expresses general concern about the threat of rising corporate concentration, especially to small businesses, he hasn't co-sponsored any of the bills Senate Democrats have introduced to strengthen antitrust enforcement. (In a statement, Hawley's spokesperson pointed out that Hawley asked about antitrust and tech during Attorney General William Barr's confirmation hearing. \"As he has said consistently,\" the spokesperson noted, \"antitrust enforcement is a critical tool in the competition policy tool kit, and he is friendly to all efforts to begin a conversation about how best to use and strengthen those tools.\") I was surprised to have to prod him to discuss Amazon, a corporation that in some ways dominates the economy more than any of the other tech giants and may be doing the most to crush independent merchants. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Since his speech at the National Conservatism Conference, a fair bit of liberal commentary has pointed to Hawley's political positions and wondered whether he's a \"real\" populist. That may be the wrong question. Populism isn't an ideology; it's a style, not wedded to any particular policy agenda. J.D. Vance, the conservative author of \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and a friend of Hawley's, told me he thinks Hawley is betting that the Republican Party can be the first to win over an American working class that is to the left of the GOP economically, but to the right of the Democrats on social issues. The challenge - especially as long as Trump leads the party - is figuring out how to appeal to working-class whites, whose cultural conservatism heavily centers on immigration and race, without alienating minority working-class voters.</p><p>Hawley attempts this by blaming the declining economic fortunes of the working class not primarily on illegal immigration, but on the various manifestations of cultural liberalism. Philosophers and screenwriters are, in this telling, somehow responsible for offshoring jobs to China. \"I think the big divide of our time is between the leadership class and their aspirations and their value set and their ideals, and the aspirations and ideals and therefore the lives of the folks in the middle of our country,\" he told me. \"And our economic structure reflects that.\"</p><p>This theory helps explain why social media is such a natural target for Hawley. If any place in America combines liberal cultural values with a hardcore capitalist streak, it's Silicon Valley. Conservatives even have a name for this: \"woke capital\" - the idea that corporations engage in performative cultural progressivism to stave off criticism of their business practices. </p><p>Hawley's anti-censorship bill is \"one of the best examples that we have of what a nationalist would mean when they say they want to use political power to address a cultural problem,\" says David French, author of the National Review piece criticizing the legislation. \"The one area in which the right broadly has been much more successful is politics, and the left has been broadly successful in culture, and therefore [they think] what we must do to save our nation is exert political power to change the national culture.\"</p><p>This is where the left and right critiques of corporate America part ways. To a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren, the problem with woke capital is the capital. To a Josh Hawley, it's the wokeness. </p><p>To the left, the sweeping social changes over the past 40 years happened despite a growing economic divide. But to Hawley, the former caused the latter. The rise of an individualist culture that devalues traditional Christian morality, hard work and civil society is responsible, along with the endurance of the post-New Deal welfare state, for the hollowing out of the middle class. If you believe that, then of course your political program is going to look nothing like that of a liberal who wants to raise the minimum wage and expand the social safety net. \"That doesn't give people dignity,\" Hawley told me. \"That doesn't give them the ability to manage and control their own lives.\"</p><p>This is why, despite the surface-level overlap between left- and right-wing economic populism, they remain so irreconcilably opposed. Both sides might hate Big Tech; both sides might justify their policy objectives in terms of reviving the economic fortunes of middle America. But because their theories of what has gone wrong are almost entirely different, they will continue to pull in opposite policy directions. And they will continue to train their anger on (mostly) different enemies.</p><p>After about an hour, Hawley's staff finally persuaded him to wrap up the interview so he could make his next appointment. As we stood up, I squeezed in one more question: Did he really believe the media was ignoring censorship of conservatives, as he had said with his \"fake media\" comment at the social media summit? \"My sense is the mainstream media thinks that is just ridiculous, that it's a joke,\" he said. But \"fake news\" is such a loaded term, I countered - it implies malice. \"There might be some malice,\" he responded, with a sly wink, as we headed for the door. \"Not for everybody, but I think there's some malice out there.\"</p><p>Gilad Edelman is executive editor of the Washington Monthly.

It kept swinging up and down after that, the latest examples of the lightning-quick shifts in momentum that have rocked Wall Street recently. Through the tumultuous week, the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.5% to clinch its its first back-to-back weekly loss in four months.</p><p>The Nasdaq composite, which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market\u2019s recent selling, lost 66.05, or 0.6%, to 10,853.55 after also flip-flopping between gains and losses. Its 4.1% drop for the week was its worst since market panic was peaking about the coronavirus and stocks hit a bottom in late March.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 131.06, or 0.5%, to 27,665.64, but not before careening between a gain of 294 points and a loss of 86 points.</p><p>Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties is what to do with Big Tech stocks, which critics have long said were due for a slide after soaring too high through the summer.</p><p>WASHINGTON</p><p>Consumer prices up 0.4% in August</p><p>U.S. consumer prices rose 0.4% in August as used car prices surged by the largest amount in 51 years, the Labor Department reported yesterday.</p><p>The August increase in the consumer price index reflected some moderation following big gains of 0.6% in both June and July as the pace of energy price gains slowed.</p><p>However, there were still areas that showed bigger price increases, led by a 5.4% jump in used car prices, the biggest monthly gain since March 1969. New car prices were unchanged in August but analysts predict prices are likely to rise in coming months, reflecting supply shortages. Motor vehicle production closed completely during the spring as the pandemic shut down wide swaths of the economy.</p><p>Other big gains were seen in household furnishings, which jumped 0.9%, the largest monthly increase since February 1991. Prices of furniture, bedding and appliances all showed big gains.</p><p>Still, even with the recent gains, inflation increases over the past year are modest. Overall inflation is up 1.3% while core inflation, which excludes energy and food, is up 1.7%.</p><p>Cologne, Germany</p><p>Boeing 737 Max moves toward return</p><p>Boeing\u2019s grounded 737 Max jetliner completed a round of test flights with European air-safety regulators, taking another step toward a return to the skies.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency will now evaluate data from the trips, it said in a statement yesterday. The agency, based in Cologne, Germany, performed the flights from Vancouver, near Boeing\u2019s Seattle-area operations, to get around coronavirus-related U.S. travel curbs.</p><p>The European flight tests follow similar assessments conducted by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Transport Canada. Pandemic-related travel restrictions have delayed recertification of the Max, which has been grounded since March 2019 after two crashes killed 346 people.

This is Sam's Aunt Betty. This week on the show, NPR reporters Vanessa Romo and Alina Selyukh. All right, let's start the show. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS!... I DID IT AGAIN\")        </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALINA SELYUKH: Yes. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAM SANDERS: Yeah, right? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: That is all I have to say about the beginning of the song. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Hey y'all, from NPR, I'm Sam Sanders. IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. I'm broadcasting from NPR West in Culver City, Calif. - still in my running shorts. But my two guests today are at NPR headquarters in D.C. Hello to both of you. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Hey, Sam. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I wish I was wearing running shorts. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter) Alina Selyukh covers tech for NPR. Vanessa Romo covers just about everything for NPR's breaking news blog The Two-Way. I'm glad you guys are here today. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: This is my second time. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: And I cannot believe it. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Me too. I'm a two-timer. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: We should start a spinoff. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Hey, there you go. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...And call it It's Been Two Minutes. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: It would be great. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'm down with that. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: I'm in. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You guys, our fourth guest today on the show is Miss <person><nameText>Britney Spears. </nameText></person>You hear that song? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Oh, yeah. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS!... I DID IT AGAIN\")        </p><p><person><nameText>BRITNEY SPEARS</nameText></person>: (Singing) I played with your heart, got lost in the game. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: A colleague of ours pointed out this week - his name is Danny Nett. On Twitter, he tweeted this week that this song - <person><nameText>Britney Spears</nameText></person>' \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" - turned 18 years old this week. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Oh, that is so painful. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Right? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: No. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You know what, though? But it gave me a chance to just play this song all week, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: It's one of the best. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And the song itself was written by a songwriter named Max Martin. He's this Swedish pop writer supreme who has written hits for everyone for, like, the last 20 years. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: His story is amazing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Right? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: People should read about it. He's written pretty much anything - like, every year in Top 40, there's something he's written. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Wow. I had no idea. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: He's still making hits. There's just a wonderful book that basically outlines the way that Swedish songwriters took over American pop music. It's called \"The Song Machine: Inside The Hit Factory\" by a guy named John Seabrook - totally fascinating. Max Martin, thank you. <person><nameText>Britney Spears, </nameText></person>thank you. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS!... I DID IT AGAIN\")        </p><p><person><nameText>BRITNEY SPEARS</nameText></person>: (Singing) Oh, baby, baby. Oops, you think I'm in love. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So Vanessa, and Alina and Britney are here with me to look back on the week of news, culture and everything else. Let's get into it, guys. We're each going to describe how this week of news felt in only three words. Alina, you're going to go first. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: So my three words are, the long shadow. And... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Whoa. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...That is - it's dark. But what it really kind of has come to mean to me is this feeling of constant repetition that's in the news. I don't follow the news, like, super closely. I'm kind of living in my own bubble of tech and retail these days. But every time I read the news, it just seems like the same themes pop up over and over. And specifically... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Which themes? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: This week, so, for instance, the nuclear threat from North Korea. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...That looms over so many different trade negotiations, for example, with South Korea that the U.S. has been having. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, visited China this week on this, like, stealth trip that was so stealth after all. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: And that was a major conversation there. So that's one theme. And then another theme is, of course, the poisoning of the former Russian spy, the double agent in London. And now we're seeing reactions and then reactions to reactions. The U.S. is ousting Russian diplomats. European countries are ousting Russian diplomats. Now Russia is ousting Western and American diplomats. And it just seems like these ripples of the same story keep coming out. And the third story I want to mention is - goes even further back, which is Ferguson. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...And the ripples of that the we're seeing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Talking about the Michael Brown case in Ferguson? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Exactly. But also, you know, the fact that we're still talking about police brutality and police shootings. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: With Stephon Clark. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Stephon Clark. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: For those who might not know, what's that case about? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: So this week, there were massive protests in Sacramento about the shooting of Stephon Clark, who was an unarmed black man, 22-years-old, was shot by police in the backyard of his grandparents' after a report of a suspicious man breaking - allegedly breaking windows in the neighborhood. The cops turned up, and this is what ended up happening. It's just, like, this perpetual story. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. And with all of those things that you bring up, there seems to be no resolution in sight. I mean, even thinking about North Korea, we have seen North Korea's leader really show some true acumen. He is making himself seem like a statesman on the level of other leaders by what he's doing with these things like this China visit. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: And I think at this point that there's a conversation about President Trump meeting with the leader of North Korea and South Korea - with the leaders of both North Korea and South Korea. And China - I don't know that China's involved in that meeting, but they're definitely involved from the outside. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, yeah. Vanessa, you got three words? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: I do. They are, you were saying? </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: So I have been writing a lot about Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who alleged having an affair with President Trump and also, Karen McDougal, the former Playboy Playmate who has also said that she had a 10-month-long love affair with Trump. So you were saying because we've been hearing a lot in the last week from both of these women. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: And Trump, who is well-known for his love of Twitter - right? - and, like, wastes no time in taking to Twitter to express his feelings on anything - on Coke, on Pepsi, on people's weight, on anything else... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: He has not tweeted about Stormy Daniels or Karen McDougal at all. In fact, The New York Times ran this great story earlier this week where they counted that since he's been commander in chief, Trump has tweeted 2,900 times - 2,900 times. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, my goodness. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: And not one of those have mentioned Stormy Daniels or Karen McDougal. So I thought that was really... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: By name. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: By name, yes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And, of course, we have to point out that the White House has continually denied all of these affairs. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I have to say, though, this is also another example of a story that has a shockingly long shadow to me, even in this news cycle where things kind of blip and go away. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: And I think that's very intentional by both Stormy Daniels' team and even Karen McDougal's team. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah, they're smart. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: They know how to keep this stuff in the news. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Right. And the thing that Michael Cohen, and now his lawyers and then Trump's other lawyers all want is to force all of these cases back into arbitration - right? - so they can remain sealed behind closed doors, out of the public eye so no one will know what's happening. And the thing that Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal really want is to force this out into the public. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Got you. I have three words, you guys. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Let's hear them. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Hold them hostage. And usually, I try to use my three words to connect the dots between multiple stories. But this week, I was just really obsessed with one - this Atlanta cyberattack. I think you've covered this, Vanessa, right? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Yeah, I just wrote about - I just wrote a big, giant story about it and talked to a ton of people who have been affected by the same thing. I mean, it's everywhere. It's school districts, law enforcement... </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Hospitals. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: ...Hospitals. It's really terrifying. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So basically, this week, some cyberattackers laid siege to Atlanta's government data. They threatened to wipe all of the city of Atlanta's computers totally clean unless they got a ransom payment of about $51,000 in bitcoin. When I saw that figure, I was like, y'all, dream bigger. You only want $51,000? Anyway, I digress. So they shut down... </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Wait, wait, wait. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...A lot of... </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: But it's $51,000 per, like, a hard drive. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: No. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: It's total? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: No, total. It's - they're asking for, I think, 6 bitcoin, which amounts to... </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: OK. Never mind. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: ...About $51,000 at the moment. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I stand down. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Also, Sam, I should say they didn't threaten to wipe out all of their computers. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: It's just, like, some computers. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But the ones that were affected were crazy. So, like, the Atlanta court can't see cases. Residents can't pay their, like, utility bills online. Police officers are writing reports and booking inmates... </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: By hand. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...By hand. And this has been going on all week. There's no Wi-Fi at the Atlanta airport. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: No. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's bananas. So then on top of that, these cyberattackers have a website - like, a ransom website basically saying, Atlanta, you can pay us here. It was secret. But then, midway through the week, a local TV station in Atlanta tweeted out the link and shared it. And then that website for the ransom payment was overloaded with, like, randos (ph) posting stuff. And then they had to take the ransom website down. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Yes, they said it was - they got too much spam. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: What is going on, Atlanta? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So what's happening now with it, Vanessa? Like, what's the latest? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: So the latest is, we actually don't know. We don't know if Atlanta has decided to pay off the attackers because that's actually something that people do. I mean... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: ...Just last month, the city of... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Pay the money. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: ...Leeds in Alabama, they had a similar ransomware attack where the hackers were asking for $12,000. And they were just like... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Why are they dreaming so - why are they aiming so low? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Yes, across the board, they're not asking for loads and loads of money. I mean, there is another case in - that I also wrote about. There was a case in Buffalo, N.Y., a hospital there. The hackers threatened them with $30,000. They were trying to extort them for $30,000. The hospital said, no way; no, thank you. So what happened? They were shut down for six weeks. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Whoa. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: And in the end, it cost them $10 million to recover all of their data. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, my goodness. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: So in a lot of cases, it just behooves you to pay the money and just get on with it. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Although, I'm pretty sure that sort of, like, the federal guidelines or the directions from the investigators will be pretty clear to not engage. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: The FBI... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Not pay. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: The FBI has a \"Gremlins\" kind of policy, which is like, don't feed them after midnight, and don't get them wet, right? So they basically say, when you pay these hackers, it just encourages them to do this again. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: And then - and you never know. This could - the money could be going to a really illicit purpose, some illicit activity. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: So don't do it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, well, don't do it. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Of course, they you understand that it's sometimes in the better interest of a city, of a school district, of a hospital... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: To just get it over with. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: ...To just get it over with. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Well, before someone hacks this show, we're going to go to a break. Coming up, we're going to talk about whether there's any real possibility that the government starts to regulate big companies like Facebook. And also, we will talk to a teacher in Oklahoma because teachers there might be striking because they haven't had a raise in 10 years. All right, this is IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I'm Sam Sanders. We'll be right back. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: We are back. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Sam Sanders here with two guests who will tell you who they are. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I'm Alina Selyukh, and I'm a business reporter at NPR. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: I'm Vanessa Romo, and I cover breaking news. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Awesome. So you guys, before we get back into the news, I have a question for you about a weird thing I saw this week on the Internet. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Which one? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Do tell. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: First - right? Yeah, yeah. So there's a new condiment option in the world this week - sliceable ketchup. Did you guys see this? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: What? Why? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: What? Sliceable ketchup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It is ketchup that you can, like, layer on a sandwich like a piece of cheese. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Because it's, like, gelatinous? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: NBC said of it - so the slice, quote, \"resembles a thin piece of fruit leather, is made from vine-ripened tomato puree, distilled vinegar, cane sugar, kosher salt, onion and garlic powders and fruit pectin.\" The company making this - they're called Bo's Original Slice of Sauce. Their whole argument is this makes ketchup less messy. So my question for you guys - would you use that? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: I am so grossed out right now. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: No way. Also, get it together, people, for whom it's too - ketchup is too messy. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: How messy is your regular ketchup habit that you need a... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It is - it can be messy. So then what condiment would you guys change if you could? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I would go for a leathery honey layer. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: How about... </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: I am so impressed by how quickly you came up with that because it's a genius idea. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: It bothers me. I think the honey bear's out to get me every time. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: It also - it's so slow in coming out of the thing. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Oh, see? There you go. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: And yeah. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: They should've asked me. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You guys, we'll talk more about ketchup later. But now it's time for a segment that we call Long Distance. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF DRAKE SONG, \"HOTLINE BLING\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: We call someone out in the country or the world, and we ask them about what's going on in their neck of the woods. So you guys, this week, I wanted to call a teacher in Oklahoma because Oklahoma teachers might strike beginning on Monday. This comes after teachers in West Virginia striked for a pay raise earlier this year. So in Oklahoma, teachers make about $38,000 a year. They want a pay raise. There was a bill that passed and was signed this week in Oklahoma that raises their pay by about $6,000 on average per teacher. But as of Friday, when we're taping this, the teachers say it's not enough yet. The largest teachers' union in the state of Oklahoma - they're calling for a walkout on Monday. So that's the background. I called up a teacher in Tulsa, Okla. She's a first grade teacher with Tulsa Public Schools. Her name is Monya Brown. We caught her on her lunch break. Let's listen. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Hey, Monya. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Hello. How are you? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'm good. How are you? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Oh, well, you know, physically, fine. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Mentally, it's just, you know, everything is kind of up in the air. You know, I'm having a hard time focusing and doing my job with all this that's going on. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So the latest, it seems - the state House in Oklahoma passed a bill. And the bill was signed that would put up - what? - like, over $400 million to give teachers like you a pay raise. But that's still - what? - like, a fraction of what you guys want, right? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: It's a fraction of what we want, you know? And it is a start. We are acknowledging that. And I - I don't want to say we because I'm definitely speaking for myself. I am acknowledging that. However, it needs to be taken a little bit more seriously. And it's not exactly what we as a whole are asking for. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: What do your first-graders think about all of this? Do they know what's going on? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: They don't really know what's going on. I hear them talk. They say, they - you know, when... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You in your car? (Laughter) I heard you. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: I'm sorry. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That's OK. Are you driving somewhere? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: On my lunch break - uh-huh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. Are you safe to drive and be on the phone right now? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Oh, I'm with another teacher, so I'm in the passenger seat. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. All right. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: You need for us to pull over? I'm sorry. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Well, no. But that said, if you're going to be where you're going in, like, five minutes, we can just call you back in five. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You want to do that? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Uh-huh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. We'll call you back in five minutes. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: OK. Bye-bye. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Bye-bye. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Hey, you still there, Monya? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Yes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Thank you so much for that. Sorry we had to have you... </p><p>MONYA BROWN: No. That's OK. I just - you know, this is the life of a teacher. We're always going... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Always moving, yeah. I understand. So if I got this down correctly, you only make - as a teacher teaching first grade, you only make $38,000 a year. How does that work out? How hard is it to make ends meet with that much money a year? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: You know, it's very hard. I find myself always just juggling - juggling bills. What should I pay this month? What can hold off? Can I call this place and see if I can get an extension? Maybe getting your - my gas cut off or having... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Really? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Yeah. A lot of spend money on students. I know I - extra snacks, you know? - and that kind of thing - it adds up. And you don't really think about it until... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Until the gas about to get cut off. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. You have a spouse and - what? - two kids. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Mmm hmm. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: How old are your kids? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: They're 11. So we're getting ready to be 11 and 5. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So what does your husband do? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: My husband - he works at American Airlines. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: And he has a second job, as well. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Really? What's his second job? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: His second job - he cleans buildings. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: And so, you know, one of my goals that I was just talking with some colleagues yesterday is, you know, I want to be able to make a little bit of extra money so that he can stay at home with our family. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: If I did the math correctly, this new bill that was just signed - the raise that it gives a teacher like yourself, making what you make - it'll be about $400 dollars extra a month after taxes. How would that change things for you, 400 extra dollars in your pocket every month? Would it would allow your husband to lose that second job? Like, would there be concrete changes from that much money? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: I mean, I don't really think it will. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Really? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: I may be able to put a little extra on utilities maybe, or for my own kids - you know, maybe not shopping at Goodwill to get the uniforms. Maybe we'll go and get uniforms at Old Navy or, you know, something like that. It'll be a little bit, but it won't be a significant change, is what I'm saying. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. I know that you were telling me earlier that you've - there's been a wide level of support across the state for what teachers like you are trying to do. But have you heard any criticism of a potential teacher strike? And if so, what is that criticism, and what does it sound like? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: I haven't hardly heard anything, to be honest with you. I ran into - I went into Family Dollar because I coupon. He had a misconception - and I forgot about it. But you're bringing it back to my thought. So he... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: He - you mean a guy that works there at the store? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Mmm hmm. So he said, you teachers, you know, you have - you're off in the summer, and you this and all of this kind of stuff. And I asked him - I said, well, if you don't mind me asking, how much money do you make? And he's an assistant manager at Family Dollar. And he told me he made $52,000 last year. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That's more than you. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: I know. So now when I go, and he's at my neighbor Family Dollar, and I say - I call him 52. So we have a running joke now. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>MONYA BROWN: And so he's like, I didn't know. I said, exactly. And so no one knows. I don't see how you guys do it. I don't see how you do it. That's, you know, the consensus of, oh, I couldn't teach. I couldn't do it. So don't beat us down because this is what we like to do. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: What salary, for you personally, would make you satisfied? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: I believe that teachers should start at least at $50,000. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. Do you think that the state will get there? Because right now the raise that - I mean, because the raise they signed doesn't take you there. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: And I get that. And notice I said start. So, you know, that's if you're a first-year teacher and that's your first year. So what I'm saying is these are steps that we're trying to get there. You know, years from now, hopefully, we're going to be competitive. And we're going to get those colleges, recruits that want to come to Oklahoma and teach, and students have all the resources that they need. And they don't have to share textbooks. And that's what we want. That's what we're striving for. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Besides getting ready for a strike on Monday, what are your plans for the weekend? Anything fun planned? </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Well, you know, just time with family, Easter egg hunting and getting ready for church on Sunday and, you know, just normal - what everyone else pretty much does. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: And then we'll see what happens when we wake up on Monday. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. I thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate talking with you and your being open with your story. And I hope you and your kids have a wonderful Easter. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Thank you. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thank you so much. All right. </p><p>MONYA BROWN: Bye. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Special thanks to listener Liz Beard (ph). She's also a teacher in Tulsa. She helped us find Monya. All right. So back in the studio with Vanessa and Alina. That call was so interesting to me, you guys, because, like, even for her to take 10 minutes to talk to me, she was, like, working. You hear her moving boxes around. You hear her driving with her teacher friend somewhere else. We assume that people in certain professions are just doing well because they went to school, and that's that. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: She's making less than her local Dollar General assistant manager. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I wish - I wish - and I don't know how this could ever happen. But I wish people could have honest conversations about salaries and maybe not on an individual basis but sort of on a professional basis just within your community because I think, in that circumstance, it sounded like the Dollar manager really had his eyes opened to the reality of another person about whom he made assumptions earlier. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Exactly. </p><p>You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Sam Sanders here with two guests today, Vanessa Romo, who covers breaking news for NPR's Two-Way blog, and Alina Selyukh, who covers tech and retail for NPR - both of them joining me from D.C. Hey there. Hey there. Hey there. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Hi. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Hey, Sam. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So it's time for our main story of the week. I want to talk about Facebook. You know, we've been hearing nonstop now for the last two weeks or so all about Facebook and its ties to this kind of shady data firm Cambridge Analytica. That's the firm that used Facebook data from, like, 50 million people to possibly influence the 2016 election. Since this has come to light, big tech is under fire. Mark Zuckerberg, who leads Facebook, might actually testify in front of Congress. He's also said that he may be open to Congress and the federal government regulating his company, which is a new development. So my big question for us today is, are we as a country ready to regulate big tech? And if so, what does that look like? </p><p>Alina, you've been covering this issue for some time. What does regulation of a company like Facebook look like, and where is it happening? From what I can tell right now, the place where that is happening is Europe. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Europe - well, in the U.S., it doesn't look like anything. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: It doesn't exist right now. But in the next few weeks, on May 25, a new law goes into effect in Europe. And it's called the General Data Protection Regulation. And that law essentially will tell companies that if you have users in one of our 28 EU countries, you have to get affirmative consent for any data collection. So they have to get opt in very explicit from their users. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So basically, if you start on a social media company, the default is at, like, nothing is really shared unless you say yes to it? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Unless, specifically, the user approves of you collecting that information to begin with. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: There are so many other things to that law. There's also what's known as the right to be forgotten... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...Which is this permission for people to ask Internet companies to remove certain content about them. The popular version of that is the Google search results. If some Google search result about you harms you, you can petition Google to remove it from the search results. And this will be enshrined into law come May in Europe. Another one is minors under 16 will have to get parental permission to even access websites like Facebook and Snapchat and Instagram. And the final one is there's - the companies will get three days to disclose any kind of data breach. So this is the most kind of specific and targeted oversight... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...That the companies have ever faced. And all of this comes with massive fines attached to potential violations. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So OK. So all of that is about to happen in Europe. We're probably not going to see that here. But we have seen some efforts to regulate privacy and data before, and it hasn't gone so successfully. I'm talking about the Obama administration trying to regulate data and Internet service providers, right? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Yeah. So we're having this kind of interesting dichotomy in the U.S., which is that Internet companies - like your social media companies - are not regulated by pretty much any government body except for the FTC, which is not a pre-emptive kind of authority. What we do have is the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, which does oversee some parts of the broader Internet community, specifically the Internet providers companies like telecom companies, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This is, like, Comcast, AT&amp;T, like, where I get my Internet from. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Exactly. And so I'm going to utter these words - net neutrality. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: When the net neutrality rules were passed by the Obama administration, part of the net neutrality provisions kind of took the FCC down the path of trying to also write some privacy rules for the Internet providers because they could. And so... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And also because - I don't think most of us know - these Internet providers also collect your data. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Right. And the Obama administration wrote these rules that would have required Internet service providers to very specifically disclose what they're collecting, how they're using that data that they collect. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Did that go into effect? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: No... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...Because lo and behold, it took a while for these rules to be written. La-da-da-da. The new Republican administration came in and essentially stopped the rules from going into effect. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: So I had never - I had no idea that this was even happening. So Comcast or Xfinity or whatever - they know how often I visit my, like, bank account. They know how often... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: ...I go to, like, madewell.com and order, you know, socks - sparkly socks from them. I mean, they're keeping track of all of this? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Also, sidebar, there's no Madewell for men, which sucks. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Would they... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Like affordable J. Crew. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Oh, boohoo, things are hard for men. Just kidding. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: There's a big difference between what the Internet providers can see versus what, like, a Facebook or specifically Google can see. And they don't see a lot of the content. So, like, they might know that you go to Madewell. They might not know that you're buying socks. Actually, another element to all of this is that Facebook and Google also do track your presence on other websites. They have these little breadcrumbs that they plug across the Internet. So when you go on a random website, there will be a little breadcrumb on that website that informs Facebook that you'd visited this website. Google also can see what you're chatting with people about or writing in emails - that sort of thing. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: This is the thing that's so terrifying to me. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So, like, Alina, my question is, what has Facebook changed since this scandal with Cambridge Analytica, if anything? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Right. So Facebook has been pushing this idea that they're really making big changes in response to the outcry over Cambridge Analytica. A lot of the changes already took place in 2015. Sort of at the time, they stopped allowing Facebook information to be shared with third-party developers. They are now working on a transparency effort to show who funds the ads that you can see. This week, they sort of rolled out new version of privacy settings that are supposed to make it even easier for you to go on and fix and match your own level of privacy to what Facebook has for you. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: But I'm just so - I'm so skeptical because we've heard apologies in the past. And we've heard these, you know, proclamations of, you know, mea culpa from Zuckerberg. And he promises that things will get better for users, and they won't be abused or sold. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: And yet, you know, here we are again, right? So is this actually real? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: There's this fundamental idea that's ingrained in the business model of Facebook and Google which is different from most other companies, even the largest ones like Apple or Microsoft, which is that they make most of their money by selling our data. So this kind of philosophical question gets tossed around a lot. There's been a lot of think pieces about this, which is who is the customer of Facebook? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: The advertisers are the customers. And the... </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: We are... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: We're the product. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...The product. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This time feels different, though, because I feel like there are people in Congress talking about doing something, right? Like, last week, a senator from Massachusetts, Democrat Ed Markey - he talked about, like, a privacy Bill of Rights. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>ED MARKEY: That would guarantee that every American know when information is being gathered about them, know when that information is being reused for purposes other than which the consumer wanted it to be used. And third, and most importantly, they have a right to say no. It'd just be the law of the land, not just for Facebook, for - but for any of these online companies. This is the moment of reckoning. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Moment of reckoning. Do you buy that, Alina? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I kind of do. I don't know... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...Where it will take us. I think this is a moment that a lot of regular people can understand in terms of privacy conversations. People feel very connected to their own personas online. There's a big push by some advocates to bring those European laws to the U.S. - this kind of forceful opt-in requirement on Internet companies. The FTC is investigating Facebook yet again. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Right. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: So the outcome of that investigation may or may not come to light eventually, may or may not result in some kind of change. I find it really hard to imagine how Facebook pivots and changes their business model, as we talked about - this concept that their money comes from advertising, which relies on the data that it collects about you. So I'm not really sure. I'm not really sure this is... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...Like, a peak in a valley. I don't know. (Laughter) I don't know. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: I started off feeling, like, comforted by you. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I just... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: But then but the end, I'm still as scared as I was before this conversation started. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So basically, this story has legs. It won't go away. We'll probably check in with you again very soon, Alina, because the Internet, more than ever, is a scary place. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: On that dark note... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: On that dark note, we're going to go to a break. When we come back, we'll play a really fun uplifting game called Who Said That. This is IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Sam Sanders here with two guests, Vanessa Romo and Alina Selyukh, both reporters for NPR, with me today. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Hi. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Hey there. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It is time, you guys, for my favorite, favorite game. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF ATLANTA\")        </p><p>KANDI BURRUSS: Who had been saying that? </p><p>PORSHA WILLIAMS: Who said that? </p><p>KENYA MOORE: Who said that? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: This is my redemption tour. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: What'd you do, lose last time? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Oh, severely. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So the game is very simple. I share a quote from the week. You guys have to guess Who Said That or at least get close, guess the story, guess a key word. We're not sticklers here. The thing is, though, the winner gets absolutely nothing. You guys ready? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: And the loser gets to come back again, right? Right? Right? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. Yes. You can always play again. This is the best game because of that reason. You guys ready? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Let's do this. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Sure. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Here's the first quote. I really do love this one. \"Them little tweets don't faze me. McDonald's be so lazy. I know the reason you hating me - because I'm fast food's first lady.\" </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: It has to be Wendy's. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I don't know the story. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: So good. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: But it has to be Wendy's. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So Wendy's just released a mixtape... </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: What? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Oh, goodness. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Full of a woman rapper, like, dissing McDonald's and Burger King. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: The songs are hilarious. The production is actually pretty top-notch. And there's one song off the mixtape \"Rest In Grease\" that is just... </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Oh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Hot fire. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"REST IN GREASE\")        </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ARTIST: (Rapping) It's Queen Wendy up in this thing. Y'all can't beat us serving these things. Y'all too chicken for this beef. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: No. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"REST IN GREASE\")        </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ARTIST: (Rapping) I'm going to leave you resting in grease. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I want to be in that corporate meeting where somebody says, guys... </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: What was the casting process for this like? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...I know what we're going to do. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I have no idea. This Wendy's mixtape hit No. 3... </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: No. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...On the iTunes Hip-Hop charts recently. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: No. No. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I'm not surprised. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's for real. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: There are no rules to anything anymore, right? I know I sound like a really old person saying that. But, like... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's true. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: ...Nothing means anything anymore. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Here's the thing. Yeah, there are no rules. There is just content. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Content. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Alina, you're up one. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: What, what. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Time for the next quote. You ready? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Yes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: \"They joke that the president and Congress are all clowns. Well, in my professional opinion, they are the worst clowns I've ever seen.\" Who said that? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Some clown - professional clown? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That's actually right. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: What? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'm just going to give it to you. This is a former clown named Steve Lough. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: A no-longer-practicing clown? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: No-longer-practicing clown. He used to work for Ringling Brothers Circus. Now he's running for Congress as a Democrat in South Carolina's 5th district. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Oh, oh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Can I tell you his website? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: His website is clownforcongress.com. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: No. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Right? So we've been hearing for months now that there is this coming blue wave in the November midterms where all of these Dems and left folks who are energized are running for office. And the numbers apparently are astronomical. That's probably true because even the clowns are running for office. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: So when he says they're all clowns, it's a good thing in his opinion. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Maybe. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Because he's a clown for Congress. I mean, how does this add up? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You can go to clownforcongress.com and find all about it. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Learn all about it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Learn all about it. Yeah. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: And then Facebook will track it forever. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I won't be advertised to. It's all good. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Ready for the last quote? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Yes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Quote, \"I would like to thank my writers, all liberals. It has been fun to talk with you and jam. You are all wonderful.\" Who said that? It was a reboot of a thing that was very popular in the culture in the '90s. It came back in... </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: \"Roseanne.\" </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, Vanessa. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: I got one. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You got one. So \"Roseanne\" - her show came back to TV this week. The premiere was watched by about 18 million people. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Yeah. Huge ratings. Huge ratings. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Huge ratings. It was so big, Donald Trump called her to congratulate her because... </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: That's right. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: What? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...The whole premise of \"Roseanne\" this time is that they are a family of Trump supporters. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Or a divided family. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: They're not all - Roseanne is a Trump supporter. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. Yes. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: I watched a little trailer. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Did you enjoy it? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: You know what? I loved \"Roseanne\" when I was a kid. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Same. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: I loved that show. I thought it was, like, a really great show about, like, working-class families and just kind of a great depiction of the way that normal people lived, which was a great contrast to everything else that was on TV at the time. Yeah. And, you know, yes, as you mentioned, Trump found the time to pick up the phone. And I think he may have also tweeted about it, which, you know... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wow. So the game is over. Alina, I think you won. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: How are we not talking about Beyonce yet? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wait for it. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Oh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This is our bonus quote. I was going to give you - I was going to make one of the Who Said That quotes this week all about Beyonce. But you already know what that is. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: It was already... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So we'll just give you a little bonus and say my favorite quote of the week was this. Quote, \"Near the end of the party, Beyonce's at the bar. So I said to Beyonce, did she really bite you?\" </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That, of course, was Tiffany Haddish, my favorite comic of the moment. In a GQ profile, she describes this party scene in which an unnamed actress bites Beyonce, leading Tiffany to want to confront the actress and fight her. Beyonce says, no. Don't do it. Don't do it. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: She's on drugs. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But since this has been revealed, we have all been trying to figure out #WhoBitBeyonce. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Did you see what Tiffany had to say... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: No. What'd she say? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...Yesterday or a couple of days ago when she was asked about this one more time? Well, first, she said, NDAs are real. Stop asking me about this. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Oh, wow. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: ...And then proceeded to say that there are a lot more important things to worry about. For example, have you done your taxes yet? </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: (Laughter). </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: They're due real soon. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Tiffany - you know what, though? Tiffany, as much as I love her, she stepped in it. You can't bring that up and not expect the entire world... </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: It's unfair. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: It's been great. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Listeners, if you know, let us know. I will tell you, though, no one's biting over here. But the clear winner of the game is Alina. You won Who Said That. Congratulations. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Yes. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So how's it feel? </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I feel redeemed. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Uh-huh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I feel redeemed. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: She's glowing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Well, you get that and nothing else because there is no prize. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: That's all right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Now it's time to end the show as we always do. We ask our listeners every week to share with us the best thing that happened to them all week. We encourage folks to brag. They do. Let's take a listen. </p><p>TINA: Hi, Sam. This is Tina (ph) calling from Michigan, and the best thing that happened to me this week is that I got my first flock of 25 baby chickens. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wow. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Twenty five? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That's a lot. </p><p>AMY: Hey, Sam. This is Amy (ph) in San Diego, and the best thing that happened to me this week was marrying my boyfriend of eight years on a beach in Belize. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Congrats. </p><p>KELSEY: My husband and I took eight whole days off of work and went to Paris, France. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Amazing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wow. </p><p>CHRISTOPHER: I ran my 16th half-marathon today. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Congrats. </p><p>EMILY: After 11 years, I submitted my Ph.D. thesis to be examined. </p><p>AUSTIN: Hey, Sam. This is Austin (ph) from Long Beach, Calif. Best thing that happened to me this week was I managed to get in as a VIP guest of Travis Barker... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Whoa. </p><p>AUSTIN: ...At a Blink-182 show. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Amazing. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Blink-182. </p><p>MAYA: Hi, Sam. This is Maya (ph) from Chennai, India. And the best thing that happened to me this week was that I graduated high school as the valedictorian. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Congratulations. </p><p>MAYA: And I gave a speech that made a bunch of people cry. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh. </p><p>JOE: Hey, Sam. It's Joe from Greenfield, Mass., but I'm - right, now I'm in Brooklyn, N.Y. because after many months of not getting any work as a makeup artist or makeup designer... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Uh-huh. </p><p>JOE: I found out about a month ago I would be designing \"Jesus Christ Superstar Live\" on NBC. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wow. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: What? </p><p>JOE: And right now, I am walking in, and we are doing camera tests. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wow. </p><p>JOE: And yeah, it's been kind of incredible. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Good luck. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Congratulations, man. </p><p>LAURA: Hi, Sam. This is Laura (ph) from Centerville, Utah. The best thing that happened to me this week was on Sunday, when I got the results from my ancestry DNA test. I was adopted at birth, and I have never connected with my birth family. And when I got my DNA results, I matched with a sister, and so I have been emailing... </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: What? </p><p>LAURA: ...With my birth sister... </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Crazy. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Woah. </p><p>LAURA: For the beginning of this weekend, it's been pretty awesome. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So cool. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: That's amazing. </p><p>PAMELA: Hi, Sam. This is Pamela (ph) calling from Vermont. About a year ago, my 16-year-old daughter was diagnosed with cancer. And it was right around the time that your show started airing. And we have spent the year mainly in the hospital, and I've listened to every one of your shows since it started. The best thing that happened to me this week was my daughter is officially done with her chemotherapy treatment... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Good, good, good. </p><p>PAMELA: ...And cancer-free. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, man. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: What? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That's great news. </p><p>PAMELA: So I just wanted to say thanks for being there this year, and take care. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: Oh, that's amazing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, man. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Congratulations. </p><p>PAMELA: Ok, thanks. </p><p>AUSTIN: Have a great day, Sam. </p><p>KELSEY: Thanks. </p><p>JOE: Bye. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thanks to all the voices you heard there - Tina with the 25 chickens... </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Amazing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Amy, Kelsey (ph), Christopher (ph), Emily (ph), Austin at the Blink-182 concert. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Maya, congrats on being valedictorian. Joe, good luck with your show on NBC. Laura and Pamela, thank you for sharing that story. I'm so glad your daughter is cancer-free, and I am honored that we could be a part of your last year or so. We listen to all of these that come in. Keep them coming along with the dog pics, cat pics and soon to be 25 chicken pics. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: Can I throw in my brag? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: My cat turned 1. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh (clapping). </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: And I made him wear a tiny cape. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: (Laughter). </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: It was wonderful. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Send us pictures. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: He is Instagram famous. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You can always let us know the best parts of your week any week. Just email me at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:samsanders@npr.org\">samsanders@npr.org</email> - <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:samsanders@npr.org\">samsanders@npr.org</email> With that, a special thanks again to my guests for this show, Vanessa Romo and Alina Selyukh, two wonderful reporters at NPR. And as always and forever, special thanks to <person><nameText>Britney Spears </nameText></person>for giving us gems like these. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: I'm so happy to be here this week for this. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I guess we can say... </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: We did it again. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...At this point, we did it again. </p><p>ALINA SELYUKH: We did it again. </p><p>VANESSA ROMO: We did it again. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...With this show, right? This week, the show was produced by Brent Baughman and Anjuli Sastry with some help from Tom Dreisbach. Our director of programming is Steve Nelson. And we were edited this week by Uri Berliner. Our big boss who signs the checks is Anya Grundmann, NPR's VP of programming. </p><p>And before we go, got a quick correction from last week's episode. We talked about sanctuary cities and mentioned the town of Los Alamitos in California. Los Alamitos is not in Los Angeles County. It's actually in neighboring Orange County. Thanks to our attentive California listeners for pointing that out. </p><p>Refresh your feed Tuesday morning. I have a chat with the Oscar-winning actor Tim Robbins. He has a new show on HBO called \"Here And Now.\" But we also talk about one of the best films of all time that he was in, \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" That'll be in your feed Tuesday morning. </p><p>Also, I asked you last week. I'm going to ask you again. If you liked this show, put a rating on the show. Go to iTunes. Rate us. It just helps folks find it. Thanks for listening. Next week, we'll do it again. I'm Sam Sanders. Talk soon. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OOPS!... I DID IT AGAIN\")        </p><p><person><nameText>BRITNEY SPEARS</nameText></person>: (Singing) But to lose all my senses, that is just so typically me. Oh, baby. Oh, oops, I did it again. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SAMSAN-201803301501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SAMSAN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S13-4GS1-JBJH-325N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">461093</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8300\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Public Radio \u00ae All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>It's Been a Minute with Sam Sanders</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 30, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

That means there's still plenty of time for corporate CEOs to buy into PR's ESG pitch.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg penned a Feb. 16 op-ed in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Financial Times</emphasis></emphasis> that called for more regulation of Big Tech because he doesn't think \"private companies should make so many decisions alone when they touch on fundamental democratic values.\"</p><p>The article was a smokescreen, a PR ploy to get Facebook off the hook. Since the US government moves at a glacial speed, there's no way regulatory safeguards could be erected in time for the 2020 election.</p><p>Zuckerberg could snap his fingers and kill political advertising tomorrow, if he wished.</p><p>Philanthropist George Soros noted in a Feb. 18 letter-to-the-editor piece published in the FT that if FB has any \"doubt whether an ad is political, it should err on the side of caution and refuse to publish.\"</p><p>Soros doubts that going to happen because he believes Zuckerberg is \"engaged in some kind of mutual assistance arrangement with Donald Trump that will help him to get re-elected.\"</p><p>The Trump campaign has hired Matt Oczkowski, who was head of product at Cambridge Analytica, the data firm that improperly obtained the personal information of tens of millions of FB users.</p><p>Oczkowski played a key role in Project Alamo, the online campaign orchestrated through FB advertising that helped put Trump in the White House.</p><p>What do you say, Mark? There's still time to pull the plug on political advertising.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter feels heat on global warming</emphasis>. While Facebook is taking hits for its policies on political advertising, Twitter deserves scrutiny for running tweets denying global warming that are produced by bots.</p><p>A quarter of all climate crisis tweets stem from bots, according to a not-yet-published study from Brown University. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Guardian</emphasis> of the UK obtained a draft of the report. The Brown researchers found the bots had a \"substantial impact\" in amplifying global denial messaging and building support for president Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.</p><p>Stephan Lewandowsky, co-author of the study that analyzed 6.5M tweets, isn't surprised at the global denial messages. \"More often than not, they turn out to have all the fingerprints of bots,\" he told The Guardian. \"The more denial trolls are out there the more likely people will think that there is a diversity of opinion and hence will weaken their support for climate science.\"</p><p>What do you say, Twitter?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You've got to tip your hat to president Trump</emphasis>. He's a master at stagecraft. His Feb. 16 appearance at the Daytona 500 was pure magic. It was the opposite of a helmeted Mike Dukakis awkwardly sitting in a tank.</p><p>Flying from Mar-a-Lago, Air Force One did a lap above the Daytona International Speedway track before landing across the street at Daytona International Airport.</p><p>Air Force Thunderbirds, which did two fly-overs of the track, were parked next to the presidential plane.</p><p>Trump's motorcade then led a parade of racing cars around the 2.5-mile track. With First Lady Melania Trump at his side, the president gave a short pep talk before closing with, \"Rubber will burn, fans will scream, and the great American race will begin.\" As grand marshal, he declared, \"Gentlemen, start your engines.\"</p><p>The crowd loved every minute of it and took up chants of \"USA,\" \"four more years,\" and \"we love you.\"</p><p>White House media organ Fox News broadcast the spectacle and the Trump campaign filed an ad of the event. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Daytona Beach News-Journal</emphasis> reported that Trump's visit would be long remembered by Trump's fans.</p><p>The only glitch: Campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted that Trump won the Daytona 500 even before the race started. Unfortunately, he accompanied the tweet with a 2004 image of Air Force One carrying George W. Bush, taking off from Daytona after he attended the race.</p><p>Parscale deleted that image, which featured more fans in the stands than there were at this year's opening of the NASCAR season.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Savita Subramanian</emphasis></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ODWYER-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ODWYER2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCS-5X71-DYRW-V00J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8201</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 J.R.

This is Sam's Aunt Betty. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUNT DONNA: And Sam's Aunt Donna on the West Coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUNT BETTY: This week on the show, Washington Post technology reporter Tony Romm. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUNT DONNA: And NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell. All right. Let's start the show. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUNT BETTY: All right. Let's start the show. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Hey, y'all. From NPR, I'm Sam Sanders. IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: That was great. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Double the aunties. So Aunt Betty came to California to visit me and other relatives. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I saw the pictures. Did she bring treats to the whole newsroom? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: She brought a pound cake to NPR West. </p><p>TONY ROMM: What? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: She was a hit. And then she went to visit my other aunt, Donna, in San Diego. And they both announced you this week. It was really sweet. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Aw. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I know. I know. Speaking of sweet things, (laughter), happy weekend to our listeners and to my guests, Tony Romm, reporter at The Washington Post covering technology policy, and Kelsey Snell, who covers Congress for NPR. Both of you are old friends. I'm happy to have all of this friendship in studio with me. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Very exciting. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Why we got to be old? Why we got to be old? </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) When you want it the most, there's no easy way out. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Speaking of forever young, we're joined this week by the voice of Celine Dion. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I know. I've been dancing over here. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: As you should be. Pump it up. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) Love comes to those who believe it, and that's the way it is. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This is a Celine Dion classic, \"That's The Way It Is.\" And I'm playing it this week to honor her as her long, long run with her Las Vegas residency comes to a close. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Wow. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This weekend, it ends. Her last show at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace will happen this weekend. And did you guys know that she first went to Vegas in 2003? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I was just going to ask. It's been a long time. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So she began 16 years ago. She's basically been doing the same job for 13 of those 16 years. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Holy cow. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And she really changed the way that artists handle touring and their careers by doing what she did. So when Celine first went to Vegas in '03, no one was doing it. Like, the big headliners were, like, Tom Jones. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Really? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But Celine went and was really successful, and she made it a cool thing to do. And so now everyone goes to Vegas. I'm sure you know this. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. Like, Britney's there, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Britney's there. Gaga was there. J.Lo, Boyz II Men, Toni Braxton, Mariah Carey, Drake, Janet Jackson. Everyone does it now, and Celine Dion made that happen. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I mean, it's, like, a quick flight, right, from LA to go out there and perform? So if you lived in LA, you could, like, have a pretty humane life instead of traveling all over the world. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Exactly. And so that is a thing that artists love. You can have the crowds come to you in Vegas and not have to travel the country or the world for them. And also, as the industry has changed in the last 10 years or so with the rise of streaming, all of them sell less albums, and so their money is in playing shows for people. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) When you want it the most... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And so Celine made this model that is really easy and really lucrative if you're big enough. And, like, she changed the game. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Well, cheers to Celine. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Celine, kudos to you. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'll miss your show. It was nice just knowing that she was there. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: But your heart will go on. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). Yes, it will. It will, it will. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) And that's the way it is. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You can check out Kevin Fallon's story in The Daily Beast this week. It's all about Celine Dion and her exit from Vegas. All right. Now it's time to start the show as we always do. We ask each of our guests to describe their week of news in only three words. But all of our three words are going to focus on one big news story of the week. I am talking about the potential regulation of big tech companies. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have both taken early steps to investigate Google and Apple and Facebook and Amazon. And lawmakers in the House in D.C., they plan to look into Facebook and Google and other tech companies to see if they're too big. </p><p>So Kelsey, Tony, you're both covering this this week. And I want you to give me three words on this topic. But first, both of you, catch me up. Catch us up on what all happened this week 'cause it seemed like a lot of things came together at once. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. A lot of things did come together all at once. But it's sort of been simmering for a long time now, right? Like, people are just sort of generally annoyed with Facebook, which is, like, the Exxon Valdez of the tech industry... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...With some of these other companies, like Google and Amazon and Apple and so forth, for various reasons, too. But really, there were two chunks of news. The first was that we finally got word that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have essentially divvied up oversight of these tech companies on antitrust grounds. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: And at the same time, Congress decided that they want to start having a conversation that they've essentially been avoiding entirely for decades. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Like most things. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Right (laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: And it's always a little surprising when Congress actually volunteers to begin a process of looking into something they actively don't want to look into, like tech. So it's just been kind of one of those weeks where the worlds are kind of colliding and kind of all surrounding tech. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I want us to break down what these investigators and what these agencies mean when they talk about antitrust, this idea that these companies are too big and that they should possibly be, like, broken up. What are the things that could be broken up, and what reasons do folks have to say they've become too big? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. I mean, it takes many forms. It kind - and it depends on the company you're talking about. So Google is the company that's come up in this conversation most. And the Europeans have sort of sketched out what this looks like. The company has been under fire for giving preferential treatment to its services over rivals in search results. So, you know, you'll go type in whatever, and Google's version of that product will come up before its competitors, which folks in Europe saw as a major issue. And they fined the crap out of Google for having done it because people don't click to, like, the third page at Google. So like, why... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I do. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Do you? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, because I know that they're going to give me all their stuff first. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. Well, there you go. So... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>TONY ROMM: So like... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'm an outlier. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. So for Google, it's stuff like that and the fact that they're just buying up all these competitors. For Facebook, it's the reality that there really is, I think in the eyes of most consumers, like, one social network. And then people say, oh, well, you know, let's just go use Instagram instead of Facebook. Well, Instagram is owned by Facebook. The feds let Facebook buy Instagram. It's, like, that kind of stuff that's really on the minds of folks here. Like, whether - like, was all that good for the country, for the economy, for people? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Was there a thing that one of these companies did that made everyone say, this is the week? Or it was just kind of about that time. </p><p>TONY ROMM: It was really the latter. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission had been talking about this for quite a long time, and we really only got word of exactly how they were going to break this stuff down with respect to potential investigations over the weekend. That was sort of a coincidence, I would say. With respect to the House, again, lawmakers there have been talking about some sort of antitrust probe for a bit, but I think they sort of sensed the momentum - the political momentum. And that's why we saw the announcements. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah, I would say that there was a lot of pressure from the 2020 candidates - Democrats running for president - who are starting to talk about this in a more direct way. Particularly, Elizabeth Warren is talking about it a lot. And... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Does she have a plan for that? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Not really. </p><p>TONY ROMM: She's got a medium post. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>TONY ROMM: I didn't mean that to be as shady as it sounded. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Whenever you say medium post, it's shady. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: But, I mean, just the fact that 2020 candidates and viable 2020 candidates are talking about it, we're going to see that push Democrats... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...In Congress to take action anyway because that's kind of the way things work. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So we're all caught up now on what exactly happened. Kelsey, you have three words on this news topic. What are they? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yes, my three words are OK, now what? </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: So... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wait. Referee, umpire, is OK one word? It's one word. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: Ooh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's two letters. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Oh, yeah, I was going - I - when I wrote it out... </p><p>TONY ROMM: O-K-A-Y. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...It was just OK. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK... </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...With an O-K-A-Y. OK, perfect. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK, now what? Go ahead. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: So the reason I ask that is Congress says they want to do something, but doing something could mean a whole lot of things. Do they want to actually regulate? Do they want to break up the tech companies? Do they want to go back to ignoring the tech companies? Are they going to think better of this once they realize that tech companies give them a lot of money... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...And employ a lot of people all over the country? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: This is a really vague conversation that we're having. And I hate the word conversation in general because the word is vague. But that's where we are... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...Is - nobody has really been able to identify what it is they want to do. They just are acknowledging a problem. And I would say in this conversation, Tony is definitely the expert on the policy that happens. And I'm the expert on Congress not really doing anything. And... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: In this case, I want to see what they're actually going to do before I start to have a really strong sense of where things are going. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Yeah. So, Tony, what are your three words? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, my three words are one more thing, which... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...Y'all might remember is the thing that Steve Jobs used to say when he, you know, was unveiling iPhones and people would fangirl... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh... </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...During the iPhones... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: And there would be something else that they would have. But one more thing doesn't just describe that. I think it actually just describes where the tech industry is right now, politically speaking. Kelsey kind of alluded to some of this. It's not just antitrust and these concerns about bigness and what bigness means for competition and consumers. It's also disinformation. It's privacy. It's YouTube not doing enough to take down hate speech, which we saw play out over the course of this week, as, once again, the company was under fire for failing to act fast enough to take down repulsive stuff online. </p><p>And I think for a while, if you talked to a lot of these companies, what they would tell you is, this is just a blip, right? It's people in Washington doing Washington things, just getting really loud about stuff because it generates headlines. And eventually, it'll blow over. But the reality is that that's not the case. Like, people here are frustrated with the industry. The conversation has only gotten louder in the course of the past year or two. And it's a marked change from where we were 10 years ago when I was covering this stuff, when tech was, like, the darling of everybody here. You could do no wrong. And now I think the threats are serious. So, you know, to Kelsey's point - now what? Like, we'll see if Congress actually does something with this. But the conditions, the pieces are there for some serious regulations targeting the tech industry. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. I wonder if the GOP has precedent to possibly pursue this kind of stuff because when you think about the government breaking up big corporations, you don't think of the Republican Party wanting to do that. Could they be a part of that now? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Well, they're - I mean, that's a tough question at this point because we don't know how much the Senate is engaging on it. They aren't engaging as much as the House is. And the House is, frankly, run by Democrats. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. That being said, the Republicans are going after the tech industry for a much different reason than the Democrats are. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: And you hear this come up in a lot with the conversation around anti-conservative bias. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: There are all these Republicans, right up to the president, who say that Facebook and Google and whatnot limit the reach of conservatives and delete their content to make it harder for them to reach folks, even though the president has - what? - like, 60 million followers or something on Twitter right now. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: And so they use that as an attack vector against these companies to say that they've become too powerful. It's much different than the Democrats, which are out there talking about corporate power in a different capacity. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, which brings us to my three words, which are about that issue of speech. My three words on this whole tech debate are Section 230. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter) Is that three words? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Section T-W-O T-H-I-R-T-Y. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Very technical (laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I am obsessed with varying interpretations of this section of the Communications Decency Act - Section 230. It says, basically, two things. One, tech companies can't really be sued for what other people do on their platforms. And two, it gives these companies the right to censor content and to kick people off their platforms if they want. But the left and the right have very differing interpretations of this law. Tony, how confusing is this? </p><p>TONY ROMM: You know, it - on some level, it's kind of not. The government... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...Said tech platforms, like a Facebook or whatnot, should not be held liable for the content posted by their users. And the effects of that are twofold. First, it allowed the development of services that accept user-generated content, like photos and videos or whatnot and - without which the tech companies say they never would have offered social networks because they would have faced too many lawsuits. It would've been impossible in the early days of the Web. And the second is that it gave those companies the power to enforce their own terms of service without facing additional lawsuits and stuff. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: So there's a lot of misconceptions about 230 on Capitol Hill, but there's this feeling that, like, something is busted, right? Like, when videos of white supremacy go viral on YouTube, when hate speech and anti-Semitism goes viral on Twitter, when attack videos from the two Christchurch mosques in New Zealand go viral on the Web, you know, those companies face no repercussions for that outside the court of public opinion here in the United States. And to a lot of lawmakers and to a lot of regular users, that's just fundamentally wrong. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Well - and that's part of what has gotten the attention of Democrats in the House too is that - Nancy Pelosi was actually just on the radio in California, talking about how she thinks it's unacceptable that Facebook wouldn't take down a video that was doctored to make her look drunk. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: And there were people inside of the president's circle who were retweeting this and spreading it. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: And Pelosi basically said we let Facebook just kind of get a pass for too long. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. What I find so fascinating is that the very politicians who are railing against a company like Facebook, saying, get it together; they still have to use Facebook... </p><p>TONY ROMM: They're using it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...To reach their constituents. </p><p>TONY ROMM: It's true. And my favorite story of this week is Ted Cruz is out there, you know, making some noise again this week about how conservatives are being biased on Facebook. Ted Cruz is also running ads on Facebook pointing out his fight... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...About anti-conservative bias. Like, literally, he's raising money using the tool that he claims is not allowing him to, like, reach conservative voters. And... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oy. </p><p>TONY ROMM: He's not the only one who's been doing something like this. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Time for a break. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. Coming up, we're going to talk about a word that everyone seems to be using but few folks actually get right - intersectionality. It is loved by the left, hated by the right. We'll tell you why after the break. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. We'll be right back. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: We're back. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Sam Sanders here with two guests - Tony Romm, who covers tech policy at The Washington Post, and Kelsey Snell, who covers Congress for NPR. Do either of you use AirDrop? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I don't. I turn it off... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, no. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...On my phone. </p><p>TONY ROMM: No, I turned it off because I know exactly where this is going. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So tell folks who don't know yet what AirDrop is and how it works. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: AirDrop allows somebody to move something from their phone to any phone that they can see, essentially, right around them, right... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...Tony? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, you have to have an iPhone to do it... </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Right. </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...Or an Apple device to do it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But if you're in a public space and you have your AirDrop turned on... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Any other rando (ph) with an iPhone can, like, send you a photo or a gif... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Or whatever. It's kind of awesome but kind of scary. It's really scary to me. I have mine turned off all the time. </p><p>TONY ROMM: As you should. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Apparently, there's a lot of stories out this week that are saying that the kids are using AirDrop to just, like, dump memes and stuff on anyone around them. But there's also this, like, dark underbelly to the AirDrop where, like... </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...A lot of folks on the New York subway will get AirDropped (ph) pictures of bodies. </p><p>TONY ROMM: For all the money and smarts in Silicon Valley, you'd think they would have realized by now that if you build it, they will find a way to send dirty pictures using it. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>TONY ROMM: Like, it does not matter what the technology is, what the platform is, people will find... </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: The \"Field Of Dreams\" of tech. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I love it. All right, we got to talk now about a word that has been creeping its way into the culture over the last few years, and it's become - politically, at least - really divisive. The word is intersectionality. It turns out a lot of folks are using this word, especially online, without really knowing what intersectionality means. </p><p>JANE COASTON: So the clearest definition of intersectionality I can give you is that people are complicated, and... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>JANE COASTON: People are not just one thing at one time. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That is Jane Coaston. She covers politics for Vox. And she just wrote this opus on the word intersectionality. It's basically this idea that people can have overlapping identities and be treated differently because of them. So she's saying that you can be a woman and Latina at the same time. You can be gay and Asian American at the same time. And so today politicians use the word intersectionality, even candidates for president. It's being tossed around on Fox News as well, but not too many folks know where the word comes from. And so when you trace it back, the word intersectionality dates back to 1989 when a civil rights professor named Kimberle Crenshaw used the word in an academic paper. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. This originated in critical race theory, which was a group of legal scholars in the '70s and '80s who were thinking critically about how... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...Race and identity intersect with the law. And their argument was that the structures that undergird our legal principles in some ways gave credence to racism or, in other ways, you know, were themselves racist. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Well, because there's this case that she's writing about. And it's basically - and fix me if I'm wrong on this - this group of women, black women, are trying to sue their employer for discrimination. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But all of the legal precedents before that basically looks at those kind of suits as you're black and that's it or you're white... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...And that's it. And they... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Prescribe remedies based on single identity. And what... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Exactly. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...The women were saying and what Crenshaw was saying is, wait. You can be more than one thing at once, and that gives you a... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Precisely. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Different outcome. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Exactly. Exactly. And so in the - you know, in the case she was talking about, there were specific hiring practices that meant that black women received the brunt of discriminatory action that black men didn't get in that same workplace and white women didn't get in that same workplace. And they were - you know, the intersection of their identities, as being black and being women, was what was enduring discrimination. And, you know, the law wasn't able to see that. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Well, and, like, I love how simple the example of these black women is in this case. Basically, the rule in a lot of workplaces is, you know, last hired, first fired. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But in this workplace, for the longest time, they didn't hire women as managers. And they also didn't treat black people fairly. So by virtue of that system, all of these black women managers were, of course, the last hired. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Exactly. And so that is a specific form of discrimination that male managers didn't face, white female managers didn't face. It is specifically experienced by black women on the virtue of them being black and being women. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Exactly. So then, all right, intersectionality as a word - it's part of legal theory for a very long time. And something really weird begins to happen a few years ago. And all of a sudden, the word intersectionality is on the Internet and on college campuses and on conservative message boards. What happened? </p><p>JANE COASTON: So it's been interesting to track that because, you know, it enter - intersectionality enters the Oxford English Dictionary in, I think, 2015. It starts being kind of the subject of conversation by activists or on college campuses because I think that you saw, you know, the word diversity, you know, didn't - stopped meaning anything in a lot of ways. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: You know, I think a lot of people - you know, when it's weapons manufacturers bragging about their diverse hiring practices... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...You know, like... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's like, really? </p><p>JANE COASTON: Especially at a time when - you know, I think 2014, 2015, that's, I think - you start seeing the efforts of Black Lives Matter when you just saw a lot of people who were thinking, OK. What can we be doing here that would make this conversation easier or better or more fruitful? - because clearly, just asking, you know, for a more diverse workplace isn't really getting the job done here. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Well, then, also, what's happening at the same time is that the environment and the climate around issues of speech on lots of... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...College campuses is just getting... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...More heated. And then you see the right glom onto the word intersectionality to kind of push back against those campus climates, right? </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. Exactly. And again, I think the right is responding to how activists or how they perceive activists to be using the term intersectional or intersectionality on college campuses. You know, when I sent a number of conservative writers Kimberle Crenshaw's original paper, you know, they - no one had a problem with it. People were like, oh, yeah. You know, that... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Well, you mean, like, Ben Shapiro and David... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...French, like, leading... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Conservative voices said, oh, this theory, on its own... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Is rock solid. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yup. They were like, well, that makes sense. Like... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wow. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...That sounds fine. Well - and because, I mean, it also is - like, it's breathtakingly simple to argue, in a sense, people are complicated. People have multifaceted identities. But I think it was really this idea that, like, OK. You know, the term isn't bad, but how it's being used is bad. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So then let's talk about that then. How is the left using this term? How is the right using this term? And what do both sides dislike about how the other side is using this term? </p><p>JANE COASTON: Well, I think, on the left, intersectionality has been a means by which, you know, you could talk about a lot of different issues that would all impact... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Got you. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...Not a lot of different people but, a lot of times, the same person. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: You know, I'll use myself as an example. You know, I'm a biracial, gay person. You know, that means that I'm impacted by racism. I'm impacted by sexism. I'm impacted by misogyny. I can also be impacted by homophobia. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: And all of - it's not as if, you know, people are like, aha - like, you know, people don't divide up your identities when they're being... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...Mean to you. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You are Jane, and all of those things are in you. Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yeah, exactly, exactly. And so - but I think that something I find fascinating about how the right thought about intersectionality was this idea that it is creating a hierarchy that, you know, at the top of the hierarchy would be - I don't know, hypothetically... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Lesbian black women. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...Black trans women, which would be... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK, yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...Which would be big news to a lot of black trans women... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...And that, you know, the victimized will become straight white men - straight cisgender white men, which I found fascinating. And, you know, one - it's kind of acknowledging that there already exists a hierarchy and that you - any effort to eliminate the hierarchy is seen as an effort to simply reverse the hierarchy. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So we've talked about how the right has run with this word, but it seems like the left has made the word now almost a religion, almost a belief system. And like, it is - it's spiritual almost. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Well, I would say that I think that that is a bit of a canard. I think that for folks who are working on anti-discrimination efforts, they want to use intersectionality, you know, almost in some senses as a signal that makes it clear that they take all forms of discrimination and hate seriously. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So it's like a virtue... </p><p>JANE COASTON: And... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Signaling. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Well, I think virtue signaling would imply that they don't actually think that and that they're doing this just to show people. I think they actually do think that. I think they actually do take discrimination across the board very seriously and are using intersectionality as a means of indicating that, you know, diversity isn't enough, that, you know, this is where we're going to take our stand. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. My question in this moment, where, like, there's more knowledge available to all of us than ever before, yet people on the left and the right seem to make no effort to really truly understand a word like intersectionality - like, I wonder why that is the case. I would bet that most people could not point to the roots of this word in legal theory. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Is there something about the culture right now or our politics right now that keeps our understanding of these buzzwords so shallow? What is it about us? </p><p>JANE COASTON: Well, I think that as our culture has widened to include more voices and more people, how we talk about those voices and people hasn't been. You know, there are a lot more people who have heard Ben Shapiro talk about intersectionality than even, perhaps, I've heard Kimberle Crenshaw talk about intersectionality. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: And so I think it's when, you know, these kind of secondary actors get to redefine terms. And I'd argue that, you know, the left does this as well, where, you know, you may have heard intersectionality more from college students than you've heard from the original source or if - you know, you may have thought that this is a term that literally just came up in 2015... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...When it most certainly didn't. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: And so I think that it's when - you know, when secondary actors are able to define terms in our media or to define what something looks like or sounds like, I think that's where that confusion can come from. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thank you, Jane. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Of course. Thank you very much. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thanks again to Jane Coaston of Vox. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I'm Sam Sanders here with Tony Romm, who covers tech policy for The Washington Post, and Kelsey Snell, who covers Congress for NPR. What do you make of that? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: You know, it - the thing that I thought was really interesting about this is it reminds me of the conversation we have a lot about the word feminism - is it's... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Ah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...Another word where you get into a - it's a complex word that isn't really all that complex, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter) Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: People create definitions for it based on - you know, because it's shorthand. And... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Exactly. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...The problem that we run into in politics here is that people want shorthand because it's a way to connect with voters or with people who they're talking to in a very condensed period of time. But it doesn't actually express the complex feelings that they're having about the topic at hand. And that's where things get difficult. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: The challenge for us is to figure out how to have that conversation in a way that works for other people while, at the same time, dealing with the fact that there are lots of others with gigantic followings on social media who can kind of co-opt a debate around something like intersectionality to promote a very radically, you know, different or incorrect view of it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: When you have these kind of conversations, do you get a lot of feedback from people about their feelings about the word? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Well, like, I find with all these conversations, you have to spend 10 or 15 or 20 minutes stripping away the semantics and the jargon from the way people talk about this stuff... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Because you come to conversations around race and gender with talking points. And it just takes a certain conditioning to strip that back and be really honest about how you feel and what you want. And I think that's what's missing in our politics. And the way that this word has just kind of floundered speaks to that if that makes sense. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Time for a break - when we come back, my favorite game - Who Said That. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. We'll be right back. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: We were both already terrified about this game. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, we're going to do terribly. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I don't know why people get so worked up about it. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Sam Sanders, here with two guests - Kelsey Snell, who covers congress for NPR, and Tony Romm, who covers tech policy at The Washington Post. Y'all, it is time for my favorite game - Who Said That. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF ATLANTA\")        </p><p>KANDI BURRUSS: Who had been saying that? </p><p>PORSHA WILLIAMS: Who said that? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: The game is really simple. I share a quote from the week. You both have to guess who said that or at least get the story I'm talking about or a keyword from the story. Per usual, the winner gets absolutely nothing. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yes. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Nice. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Shall we begin? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Let's do it. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Let's do it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: No buzzers - just yell it out, all right? First quote is, \"the question I started out with was - how do people perceive what's difficult, and how can we train a computer to make those same types of predictions?\" </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: A game? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: A game show. </p><p>TONY ROMM: A game show. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: \"Jeopardy!\"? </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. OK. There you go. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Oh, really? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: See. Yeah, yeah. So that was a quote from Emma Boettcher. She's a new \"Jeopardy!\" champion. And she... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Beat the guy who had won millions with the expertise he gained from being a sports gambler. And she got her expertise in \"Jeopardy!\" by writing her master's thesis on how to beat the game. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Wait. I've... </p><p>TONY ROMM: See... </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...Been spending my time all wrong (laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: I could've gotten a master's in game shows? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes, you can. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Why did I do journalism? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Yeah. She wrote a 70-page master's thesis called \"Predicting The Difficulty Of Trivia Questions Using Text Features.\" And she basically found out that you can figure out how hard these questions are or how easy they are or how to guess the right answer based on how it's worded. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Wow. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: She wouldn't struggle at this show. She... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: She'd win it... </p><p>TONY ROMM: All of it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Hands down. All right, Kelsey. You're up one - zip. Next quote - you ready? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: \"We have decided to launch a campaign to educate the public, politicians and civil servants about the unique problems we face.\" </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Oh. </p><p>TONY ROMM: That could be anything. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. I was going to say. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: What marginalized community announced this week that they were going to have a march to celebrate themselves? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Oh. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Is this the straight pride thing? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Straight pride? </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, Jesus. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'll give that to both of you. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, no. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So as we know, June is LGBTQ Pride month, and there are parades and celebrations and honoring of that community all month. But in response, a group called Super Happy Fun America wrote a blog post this week announcing that, in the Boston area, these guys are planning a straight pride parade. </p><p>TONY ROMM: What's in it? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I don't even know - cargo shorts? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Socks and sandals. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>TONY ROMM: I have no words. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Final quote - I think the game is - well, the game is whatever. It doesn't matter. Final quote... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Here's a quote. \"Tonight's the night. Let's live it up. I got my money. Let's spend it up.\" Y'all know that quote. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's from a song. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: It is from a song. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, I know. And I'm like - I'm going to embarrass myself. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I love - no. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Let me do it again. Tonight's the night. </p><p>TONY ROMM: That's what it sounded like to... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Let's live it up. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Oh, it's... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I got my money. Let's spend it up... </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I know this. The... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Black Eyed Peas. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. Oh, my God. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Gosh. We're dragging over here. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, my God. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Why was it so hard? </p><p>TONY ROMM: I don't know. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: What really happened there is Tony and I totally knew the answer. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Uh-huh. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: We just wanted to hear you sing again - twice. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Uh-huh. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Twice, yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So I was reciting some of the lyrics of the Black Eyed Peas' classic \"I Gotta Feeling\" because, to the best of our knowledge from what Apple has revealed, that has been the best-selling song on iTunes. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Really? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And iTunes is in the news this week because Apple is kind of killing iTunes. iTunes is over. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yep. RIP. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I'm not going to be sad about that. </p><p>TONY ROMM: RIP, iTunes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Basically, iTunes allows you to, like, download songs. Now we've all moved to streaming. Right? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, yeah. I mean - and also, that software is terrible, and nobody likes using it. Whenever it opens up your laptop, you're like, damn this thing. It's like (laughter).... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I mean, I'm pretty sure I still have a phone somewhere that has that U2 album that they made you get from iTunes on your phone. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, my God. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: God. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Remember that? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So annoying. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So annoying. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. But they're, like, splitting it up into multiple things now. So it's like sort of gone but not gone. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So like, you can still use iTunes and download the song. But it'll be hidden, and Apple's going to prioritize streaming. But this is just a sign that, like, the industry has changed. You know, when iTunes came out, everyone wanted to download their songs and have them on their device. And now we've moved to streaming, and people just download this stuff less. So RIP. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Maybe they should just download podcasts more. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Ba-da-ba (ph). </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: NPR plugs. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Anyways, the game is oh (ph) - who won? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Not me. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I really don't know. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter) Celine Dion won. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That's right. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: At the end of the day, Celine is the winner. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Now it's time to end the show. Usually in this segment, we ask our listeners to share with us the best things that happened to them all week. We encourage folks to brag. We listen. It's always great. But this week, want to try something different. We have been asking listeners to share with us the strangest, weirdest, quirkiest parts of their week. We wanted folks to give us that audio. So we've put it together. </p><p>Brent, Anjuli - hit the tape. </p><p>IAN DOESCHER: Hi, Sam. This Ian Doescher (ph) from Portland, Ore. Here's the weirdest thing that happened to me this week. My sons and I were on vacation in New York City. And while we walked through Central Park, we overheard snippets of conversations. One person said, and then if you accidentally eat the child... </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>IAN DOESCHER: ...Not sure what that was about. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: OK. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>MAGGIE RINEY: Hi, Sam. Maggie Riney (ph) here. Something weird that happened to me this week is that I was returning from a local amusement park in Santa Claus, Ind., actually named Holiday World when a bald eagle swooped down, talons blazing, and almost landed on the hood of my car. </p><p>MELINDA: I was sitting on a bench on my patio with a cup of coffee in one hand and the hose in the other watering the plants, and a skunk walked across my feet. I think it was the weirdest thing that happened to the skunk, too. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>JASMINE: I recently started watching \"Sex And The City\" because I had never seen it. And last night, I came across the episode where the Russian hands Carrie a banana and tells her to put it in her purse. Today as I was walking to dinner, I said hello to my fruit stand guy, and he gave me a big hug, said hello and then gave me a banana to take with me. And since I was on my way to dinner, decided to save it for later by putting it in my purse. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAMANTHA: Hey, Sam. This is Samantha (ph). I had something really weird but special happen this past week. It was about my dad. He was a nurse, and I followed in his footsteps. This past week, there was a day I was feeling really down because I thought about how he wasn't around to trade crazy nursing stories or give me instructions on things. But when I was asked to start an IV on a patient, I thought about the instructions he'd given me a really long time ago - how to look for a site, how to approach it. I got the IV in one try and started talking with the patient only to realize that she had known my father once upon a time because he had hired her to work with him in the surgical department 15 years ago. She shared with me how well-liked he had been and how he always liked to laugh. She was right. He always liked to laugh. And that was the weird, special and awesome thing that happened to me this past week. </p><p>JASMINE: Thanks so much. Have a good weekend. </p><p>IAN DOESCHER: Thanks for everything you do, Sam. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: My goodness. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I'm also still a little hung up on, A, Santa Claus, Ind., and, B, a local amusement park. Like, there's a lot going on in that story. </p><p>TONY ROMM: I want a fruit stand guy. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Our listeners are pretty great. Oh, my goodness. Thanks to all those listeners - Ian, Maggie, Melinda (ph), Jasmine (ph) and Samantha. We listen to and read everything you send us, so keep it coming. Send me the sound of your voice. Send me an email or a note. Email all that stuff to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:samsanders@npr.org\">samsanders@npr.org</email> - <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:samsanders@npr.org\">samsanders@npr.org</email> All right. That's a wrap. The two of y'all were the best parts of my week. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Aw. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Aw. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thanks to Tony Romm, who covers tech policy at the Washington Post, for being here this week and Kelsey Snell, who covers Congress for NPR. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Thanks for having us. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, thanks. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This week, IT'S BEEN A MINUTE was produced by Brent Baughman and Anjuli Sastry. Steve Nelson is our director of programming. Our fearless editors are Jordana Hochman and Alex McCall. And our big boss is NPR's senior VP of programming Anya Grundmann. All right, listeners, till next time - thank you for listening. I'm Sam Sanders. Talk soon. Keep channeling your inner Celine. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) That's the way it is. That's the way it is. Don't give up on your faith. Love comes to those who believe it, and that's the way it is. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SAMSAN-201906101501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SAMSAN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9S-MT71-DY1J-T049-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">461093</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio \u00ae All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>It's Been a Minute with Sam Sanders</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 10, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Communications Decency Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZFRThGRDIyOERDNDRBNzlCRUMzNkNBMDIzRDU5NTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkEyQUE3Q0ZGNTBBNDZBQkI4Qjg5MjlFREFGQjZENDM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

This is Sam's Aunt Betty. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUNT DONNA: And Sam's Aunt Donna on the West Coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUNT BETTY: This week on the show, Washington Post technology reporter Tony Romm. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUNT DONNA: And NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell. All right. Let's start the show. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUNT BETTY: All right. Let's start the show. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Hey, y'all. From NPR, I'm Sam Sanders. IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: That was great. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Double the aunties. So Aunt Betty came to California to visit me and other relatives. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I saw the pictures. Did she bring treats to the whole newsroom? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: She brought a pound cake to NPR West. </p><p>TONY ROMM: What? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: She was a hit. And then she went to visit my other aunt, Donna, in San Diego. And they both announced you this week. It was really sweet. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Aw. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I know. I know. Speaking of sweet things, (laughter), happy weekend to our listeners and to my guests, Tony Romm, reporter at The Washington Post covering technology policy, and Kelsey Snell, who covers Congress for NPR. Both of you are old friends. I'm happy to have all of this friendship in studio with me. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Very exciting. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Why we got to be old? Why we got to be old? </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) When you want it the most, there's no easy way out. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Speaking of forever young, we're joined this week by the voice of Celine Dion. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I know. I've been dancing over here. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: As you should be. Pump it up. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) Love comes to those who believe it, and that's the way it is. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This is a Celine Dion classic, \"That's The Way It Is.\" And I'm playing it this week to honor her as her long, long run with her Las Vegas residency comes to a close. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Wow. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This weekend, it ends. Her last show at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace will happen this weekend. And did you guys know that she first went to Vegas in 2003? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I was just going to ask. It's been a long time. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So she began 16 years ago. She's basically been doing the same job for 13 of those 16 years. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Holy cow. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And she really changed the way that artists handle touring and their careers by doing what she did. So when Celine first went to Vegas in '03, no one was doing it. Like, the big headliners were, like, Tom Jones. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Really? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But Celine went and was really successful, and she made it a cool thing to do. And so now everyone goes to Vegas. I'm sure you know this. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. Like, Britney's there, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Britney's there. Gaga was there. J.Lo, Boyz II Men, Toni Braxton, Mariah Carey, Drake, Janet Jackson. Everyone does it now, and Celine Dion made that happen. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I mean, it's, like, a quick flight, right, from LA to go out there and perform? So if you lived in LA, you could, like, have a pretty humane life instead of traveling all over the world. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Exactly. And so that is a thing that artists love. You can have the crowds come to you in Vegas and not have to travel the country or the world for them. And also, as the industry has changed in the last 10 years or so with the rise of streaming, all of them sell less albums, and so their money is in playing shows for people. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) When you want it the most... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And so Celine made this model that is really easy and really lucrative if you're big enough. And, like, she changed the game. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Well, cheers to Celine. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Celine, kudos to you. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'll miss your show. It was nice just knowing that she was there. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: But your heart will go on. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). Yes, it will. It will, it will. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\")        </p><p>CELINE DION: (Singing) And that's the way it is. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You can check out Kevin Fallon's story in The Daily Beast this week. It's all about Celine Dion and her exit from Vegas. All right. Now it's time to start the show as we always do. We ask each of our guests to describe their week of news in only three words. But all of our three words are going to focus on one big news story of the week. I am talking about the potential regulation of big tech companies. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have both taken early steps to investigate Google and Apple and Facebook and Amazon. And lawmakers in the House in D.C., they plan to look into Facebook and Google and other tech companies to see if they're too big. </p><p>So Kelsey, Tony, you're both covering this this week. And I want you to give me three words on this topic. But first, both of you, catch me up. Catch us up on what all happened this week 'cause it seemed like a lot of things came together at once. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. A lot of things did come together all at once. But it's sort of been simmering for a long time now, right? Like, people are just sort of generally annoyed with Facebook, which is, like, the Exxon Valdez of the tech industry... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...With some of these other companies, like Google and Amazon and Apple and so forth, for various reasons, too. But really, there were two chunks of news. The first was that we finally got word that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have essentially divvied up oversight of these tech companies on antitrust grounds. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: And at the same time, Congress decided that they want to start having a conversation that they've essentially been avoiding entirely for decades. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Like most things. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Right (laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: And it's always a little surprising when Congress actually volunteers to begin a process of looking into something they actively don't want to look into, like tech. So it's just been kind of one of those weeks where the worlds are kind of colliding and kind of all surrounding tech. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I want us to break down what these investigators and what these agencies mean when they talk about antitrust, this idea that these companies are too big and that they should possibly be, like, broken up. What are the things that could be broken up, and what reasons do folks have to say they've become too big? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. I mean, it takes many forms. It kind - and it depends on the company you're talking about. So Google is the company that's come up in this conversation most. And the Europeans have sort of sketched out what this looks like. The company has been under fire for giving preferential treatment to its services over rivals in search results. So, you know, you'll go type in whatever, and Google's version of that product will come up before its competitors, which folks in Europe saw as a major issue. And they fined the crap out of Google for having done it because people don't click to, like, the third page at Google. So like, why... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I do. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Do you? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, because I know that they're going to give me all their stuff first. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. Well, there you go. So... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>TONY ROMM: So like... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'm an outlier. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. So for Google, it's stuff like that and the fact that they're just buying up all these competitors. For Facebook, it's the reality that there really is, I think in the eyes of most consumers, like, one social network. And then people say, oh, well, you know, let's just go use Instagram instead of Facebook. Well, Instagram is owned by Facebook. The feds let Facebook buy Instagram. It's, like, that kind of stuff that's really on the minds of folks here. Like, whether - like, was all that good for the country, for the economy, for people? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Was there a thing that one of these companies did that made everyone say, this is the week? Or it was just kind of about that time. </p><p>TONY ROMM: It was really the latter. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission had been talking about this for quite a long time, and we really only got word of exactly how they were going to break this stuff down with respect to potential investigations over the weekend. That was sort of a coincidence, I would say. With respect to the House, again, lawmakers there have been talking about some sort of antitrust probe for a bit, but I think they sort of sensed the momentum - the political momentum. And that's why we saw the announcements. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah, I would say that there was a lot of pressure from the 2020 candidates - Democrats running for president - who are starting to talk about this in a more direct way. Particularly, Elizabeth Warren is talking about it a lot. And... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Does she have a plan for that? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Not really. </p><p>TONY ROMM: She's got a medium post. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>TONY ROMM: I didn't mean that to be as shady as it sounded. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Whenever you say medium post, it's shady. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: But, I mean, just the fact that 2020 candidates and viable 2020 candidates are talking about it, we're going to see that push Democrats... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...In Congress to take action anyway because that's kind of the way things work. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So we're all caught up now on what exactly happened. Kelsey, you have three words on this news topic. What are they? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yes, my three words are OK, now what? </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: So... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wait. Referee, umpire, is OK one word? It's one word. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: Ooh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's two letters. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Oh, yeah, I was going - I - when I wrote it out... </p><p>TONY ROMM: O-K-A-Y. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...It was just OK. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK... </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...With an O-K-A-Y. OK, perfect. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK, now what? Go ahead. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: So the reason I ask that is Congress says they want to do something, but doing something could mean a whole lot of things. Do they want to actually regulate? Do they want to break up the tech companies? Do they want to go back to ignoring the tech companies? Are they going to think better of this once they realize that tech companies give them a lot of money... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...And employ a lot of people all over the country? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: This is a really vague conversation that we're having. And I hate the word conversation in general because the word is vague. But that's where we are... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...Is - nobody has really been able to identify what it is they want to do. They just are acknowledging a problem. And I would say in this conversation, Tony is definitely the expert on the policy that happens. And I'm the expert on Congress not really doing anything. And... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: In this case, I want to see what they're actually going to do before I start to have a really strong sense of where things are going. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Yeah. So, Tony, what are your three words? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, my three words are one more thing, which... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...Y'all might remember is the thing that Steve Jobs used to say when he, you know, was unveiling iPhones and people would fangirl... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh... </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...During the iPhones... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: And there would be something else that they would have. But one more thing doesn't just describe that. I think it actually just describes where the tech industry is right now, politically speaking. Kelsey kind of alluded to some of this. It's not just antitrust and these concerns about bigness and what bigness means for competition and consumers. It's also disinformation. It's privacy. It's YouTube not doing enough to take down hate speech, which we saw play out over the course of this week, as, once again, the company was under fire for failing to act fast enough to take down repulsive stuff online. </p><p>And I think for a while, if you talked to a lot of these companies, what they would tell you is, this is just a blip, right? It's people in Washington doing Washington things, just getting really loud about stuff because it generates headlines. And eventually, it'll blow over. But the reality is that that's not the case. Like, people here are frustrated with the industry. The conversation has only gotten louder in the course of the past year or two. And it's a marked change from where we were 10 years ago when I was covering this stuff, when tech was, like, the darling of everybody here. You could do no wrong. And now I think the threats are serious. So, you know, to Kelsey's point - now what? Like, we'll see if Congress actually does something with this. But the conditions, the pieces are there for some serious regulations targeting the tech industry. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. I wonder if the GOP has precedent to possibly pursue this kind of stuff because when you think about the government breaking up big corporations, you don't think of the Republican Party wanting to do that. Could they be a part of that now? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Well, they're - I mean, that's a tough question at this point because we don't know how much the Senate is engaging on it. They aren't engaging as much as the House is. And the House is, frankly, run by Democrats. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. That being said, the Republicans are going after the tech industry for a much different reason than the Democrats are. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: And you hear this come up in a lot with the conversation around anti-conservative bias. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: There are all these Republicans, right up to the president, who say that Facebook and Google and whatnot limit the reach of conservatives and delete their content to make it harder for them to reach folks, even though the president has - what? - like, 60 million followers or something on Twitter right now. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: And so they use that as an attack vector against these companies to say that they've become too powerful. It's much different than the Democrats, which are out there talking about corporate power in a different capacity. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, which brings us to my three words, which are about that issue of speech. My three words on this whole tech debate are Section 230. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter) Is that three words? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Section T-W-O T-H-I-R-T-Y. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Very technical (laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I am obsessed with varying interpretations of this section of the Communications Decency Act - Section 230. It says, basically, two things. One, tech companies can't really be sued for what other people do on their platforms. And two, it gives these companies the right to censor content and to kick people off their platforms if they want. But the left and the right have very differing interpretations of this law. Tony, how confusing is this? </p><p>TONY ROMM: You know, it - on some level, it's kind of not. The government... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...Said tech platforms, like a Facebook or whatnot, should not be held liable for the content posted by their users. And the effects of that are twofold. First, it allowed the development of services that accept user-generated content, like photos and videos or whatnot and - without which the tech companies say they never would have offered social networks because they would have faced too many lawsuits. It would've been impossible in the early days of the Web. And the second is that it gave those companies the power to enforce their own terms of service without facing additional lawsuits and stuff. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: So there's a lot of misconceptions about 230 on Capitol Hill, but there's this feeling that, like, something is busted, right? Like, when videos of white supremacy go viral on YouTube, when hate speech and anti-Semitism goes viral on Twitter, when attack videos from the two Christchurch mosques in New Zealand go viral on the Web, you know, those companies face no repercussions for that outside the court of public opinion here in the United States. And to a lot of lawmakers and to a lot of regular users, that's just fundamentally wrong. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Well - and that's part of what has gotten the attention of Democrats in the House too is that - Nancy Pelosi was actually just on the radio in California, talking about how she thinks it's unacceptable that Facebook wouldn't take down a video that was doctored to make her look drunk. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: And there were people inside of the president's circle who were retweeting this and spreading it. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: And Pelosi basically said we let Facebook just kind of get a pass for too long. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. What I find so fascinating is that the very politicians who are railing against a company like Facebook, saying, get it together; they still have to use Facebook... </p><p>TONY ROMM: They're using it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...To reach their constituents. </p><p>TONY ROMM: It's true. And my favorite story of this week is Ted Cruz is out there, you know, making some noise again this week about how conservatives are being biased on Facebook. Ted Cruz is also running ads on Facebook pointing out his fight... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...About anti-conservative bias. Like, literally, he's raising money using the tool that he claims is not allowing him to, like, reach conservative voters. And... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oy. </p><p>TONY ROMM: He's not the only one who's been doing something like this. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Time for a break. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. Coming up, we're going to talk about a word that everyone seems to be using but few folks actually get right - intersectionality. It is loved by the left, hated by the right. We'll tell you why after the break. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. We'll be right back. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: We're back. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Sam Sanders here with two guests - Tony Romm, who covers tech policy at The Washington Post, and Kelsey Snell, who covers Congress for NPR. Do either of you use AirDrop? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I don't. I turn it off... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, no. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...On my phone. </p><p>TONY ROMM: No, I turned it off because I know exactly where this is going. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So tell folks who don't know yet what AirDrop is and how it works. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: AirDrop allows somebody to move something from their phone to any phone that they can see, essentially, right around them, right... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...Tony? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, you have to have an iPhone to do it... </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Right. </p><p>TONY ROMM: ...Or an Apple device to do it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But if you're in a public space and you have your AirDrop turned on... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Any other rando (ph) with an iPhone can, like, send you a photo or a gif... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Or whatever. It's kind of awesome but kind of scary. It's really scary to me. I have mine turned off all the time. </p><p>TONY ROMM: As you should. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Apparently, there's a lot of stories out this week that are saying that the kids are using AirDrop to just, like, dump memes and stuff on anyone around them. But there's also this, like, dark underbelly to the AirDrop where, like... </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...A lot of folks on the New York subway will get AirDropped (ph) pictures of bodies. </p><p>TONY ROMM: For all the money and smarts in Silicon Valley, you'd think they would have realized by now that if you build it, they will find a way to send dirty pictures using it. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>TONY ROMM: Like, it does not matter what the technology is, what the platform is, people will find... </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: The \"Field Of Dreams\" of tech. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I love it. All right, we got to talk now about a word that has been creeping its way into the culture over the last few years, and it's become - politically, at least - really divisive. The word is intersectionality. It turns out a lot of folks are using this word, especially online, without really knowing what intersectionality means. </p><p>JANE COASTON: So the clearest definition of intersectionality I can give you is that people are complicated, and... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>JANE COASTON: People are not just one thing at one time. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That is Jane Coaston. She covers politics for Vox. And she just wrote this opus on the word intersectionality. It's basically this idea that people can have overlapping identities and be treated differently because of them. So she's saying that you can be a woman and Latina at the same time. You can be gay and Asian American at the same time. And so today politicians use the word intersectionality, even candidates for president. It's being tossed around on Fox News as well, but not too many folks know where the word comes from. And so when you trace it back, the word intersectionality dates back to 1989 when a civil rights professor named Kimberle Crenshaw used the word in an academic paper. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. This originated in critical race theory, which was a group of legal scholars in the '70s and '80s who were thinking critically about how... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...Race and identity intersect with the law. And their argument was that the structures that undergird our legal principles in some ways gave credence to racism or, in other ways, you know, were themselves racist. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Well, because there's this case that she's writing about. And it's basically - and fix me if I'm wrong on this - this group of women, black women, are trying to sue their employer for discrimination. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But all of the legal precedents before that basically looks at those kind of suits as you're black and that's it or you're white... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...And that's it. And they... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Prescribe remedies based on single identity. And what... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Exactly. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...The women were saying and what Crenshaw was saying is, wait. You can be more than one thing at once, and that gives you a... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Precisely. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Different outcome. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Exactly. Exactly. And so in the - you know, in the case she was talking about, there were specific hiring practices that meant that black women received the brunt of discriminatory action that black men didn't get in that same workplace and white women didn't get in that same workplace. And they were - you know, the intersection of their identities, as being black and being women, was what was enduring discrimination. And, you know, the law wasn't able to see that. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Well, and, like, I love how simple the example of these black women is in this case. Basically, the rule in a lot of workplaces is, you know, last hired, first fired. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But in this workplace, for the longest time, they didn't hire women as managers. And they also didn't treat black people fairly. So by virtue of that system, all of these black women managers were, of course, the last hired. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Exactly. And so that is a specific form of discrimination that male managers didn't face, white female managers didn't face. It is specifically experienced by black women on the virtue of them being black and being women. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Exactly. So then, all right, intersectionality as a word - it's part of legal theory for a very long time. And something really weird begins to happen a few years ago. And all of a sudden, the word intersectionality is on the Internet and on college campuses and on conservative message boards. What happened? </p><p>JANE COASTON: So it's been interesting to track that because, you know, it enter - intersectionality enters the Oxford English Dictionary in, I think, 2015. It starts being kind of the subject of conversation by activists or on college campuses because I think that you saw, you know, the word diversity, you know, didn't - stopped meaning anything in a lot of ways. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: You know, I think a lot of people - you know, when it's weapons manufacturers bragging about their diverse hiring practices... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...You know, like... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's like, really? </p><p>JANE COASTON: Especially at a time when - you know, I think 2014, 2015, that's, I think - you start seeing the efforts of Black Lives Matter when you just saw a lot of people who were thinking, OK. What can we be doing here that would make this conversation easier or better or more fruitful? - because clearly, just asking, you know, for a more diverse workplace isn't really getting the job done here. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Well, then, also, what's happening at the same time is that the environment and the climate around issues of speech on lots of... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...College campuses is just getting... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...More heated. And then you see the right glom onto the word intersectionality to kind of push back against those campus climates, right? </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. Exactly. And again, I think the right is responding to how activists or how they perceive activists to be using the term intersectional or intersectionality on college campuses. You know, when I sent a number of conservative writers Kimberle Crenshaw's original paper, you know, they - no one had a problem with it. People were like, oh, yeah. You know, that... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Well, you mean, like, Ben Shapiro and David... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...French, like, leading... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Conservative voices said, oh, this theory, on its own... </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yup. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Is rock solid. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yup. They were like, well, that makes sense. Like... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Wow. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...That sounds fine. Well - and because, I mean, it also is - like, it's breathtakingly simple to argue, in a sense, people are complicated. People have multifaceted identities. But I think it was really this idea that, like, OK. You know, the term isn't bad, but how it's being used is bad. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So then let's talk about that then. How is the left using this term? How is the right using this term? And what do both sides dislike about how the other side is using this term? </p><p>JANE COASTON: Well, I think, on the left, intersectionality has been a means by which, you know, you could talk about a lot of different issues that would all impact... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Got you. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...Not a lot of different people but, a lot of times, the same person. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: You know, I'll use myself as an example. You know, I'm a biracial, gay person. You know, that means that I'm impacted by racism. I'm impacted by sexism. I'm impacted by misogyny. I can also be impacted by homophobia. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: And all of - it's not as if, you know, people are like, aha - like, you know, people don't divide up your identities when they're being... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...Mean to you. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You are Jane, and all of those things are in you. Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Yeah, exactly, exactly. And so - but I think that something I find fascinating about how the right thought about intersectionality was this idea that it is creating a hierarchy that, you know, at the top of the hierarchy would be - I don't know, hypothetically... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Lesbian black women. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...Black trans women, which would be... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK, yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...Which would be big news to a lot of black trans women... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...And that, you know, the victimized will become straight white men - straight cisgender white men, which I found fascinating. And, you know, one - it's kind of acknowledging that there already exists a hierarchy and that you - any effort to eliminate the hierarchy is seen as an effort to simply reverse the hierarchy. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So we've talked about how the right has run with this word, but it seems like the left has made the word now almost a religion, almost a belief system. And like, it is - it's spiritual almost. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Well, I would say that I think that that is a bit of a canard. I think that for folks who are working on anti-discrimination efforts, they want to use intersectionality, you know, almost in some senses as a signal that makes it clear that they take all forms of discrimination and hate seriously. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So it's like a virtue... </p><p>JANE COASTON: And... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Signaling. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Well, I think virtue signaling would imply that they don't actually think that and that they're doing this just to show people. I think they actually do think that. I think they actually do take discrimination across the board very seriously and are using intersectionality as a means of indicating that, you know, diversity isn't enough, that, you know, this is where we're going to take our stand. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. My question in this moment, where, like, there's more knowledge available to all of us than ever before, yet people on the left and the right seem to make no effort to really truly understand a word like intersectionality - like, I wonder why that is the case. I would bet that most people could not point to the roots of this word in legal theory. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Is there something about the culture right now or our politics right now that keeps our understanding of these buzzwords so shallow? What is it about us? </p><p>JANE COASTON: Well, I think that as our culture has widened to include more voices and more people, how we talk about those voices and people hasn't been. You know, there are a lot more people who have heard Ben Shapiro talk about intersectionality than even, perhaps, I've heard Kimberle Crenshaw talk about intersectionality. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: And so I think it's when, you know, these kind of secondary actors get to redefine terms. And I'd argue that, you know, the left does this as well, where, you know, you may have heard intersectionality more from college students than you've heard from the original source or if - you know, you may have thought that this is a term that literally just came up in 2015... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: ...When it most certainly didn't. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>JANE COASTON: And so I think that it's when - you know, when secondary actors are able to define terms in our media or to define what something looks like or sounds like, I think that's where that confusion can come from. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thank you, Jane. </p><p>JANE COASTON: Of course. Thank you very much. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thanks again to Jane Coaston of Vox. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I'm Sam Sanders here with Tony Romm, who covers tech policy for The Washington Post, and Kelsey Snell, who covers Congress for NPR. What do you make of that? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: You know, it - the thing that I thought was really interesting about this is it reminds me of the conversation we have a lot about the word feminism - is it's... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Ah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...Another word where you get into a - it's a complex word that isn't really all that complex, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter) Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: People create definitions for it based on - you know, because it's shorthand. And... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Exactly. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...The problem that we run into in politics here is that people want shorthand because it's a way to connect with voters or with people who they're talking to in a very condensed period of time. But it doesn't actually express the complex feelings that they're having about the topic at hand. And that's where things get difficult. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: The challenge for us is to figure out how to have that conversation in a way that works for other people while, at the same time, dealing with the fact that there are lots of others with gigantic followings on social media who can kind of co-opt a debate around something like intersectionality to promote a very radically, you know, different or incorrect view of it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: When you have these kind of conversations, do you get a lot of feedback from people about their feelings about the word? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Well, like, I find with all these conversations, you have to spend 10 or 15 or 20 minutes stripping away the semantics and the jargon from the way people talk about this stuff... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Because you come to conversations around race and gender with talking points. And it just takes a certain conditioning to strip that back and be really honest about how you feel and what you want. And I think that's what's missing in our politics. And the way that this word has just kind of floundered speaks to that if that makes sense. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Time for a break - when we come back, my favorite game - Who Said That. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. We'll be right back. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: We were both already terrified about this game. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, we're going to do terribly. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I don't know why people get so worked up about it. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Sam Sanders, here with two guests - Kelsey Snell, who covers congress for NPR, and Tony Romm, who covers tech policy at The Washington Post. Y'all, it is time for my favorite game - Who Said That. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF ATLANTA\")        </p><p>KANDI BURRUSS: Who had been saying that? </p><p>PORSHA WILLIAMS: Who said that? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: The game is really simple. I share a quote from the week. You both have to guess who said that or at least get the story I'm talking about or a keyword from the story. Per usual, the winner gets absolutely nothing. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yes. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Nice. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Shall we begin? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Let's do it. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Let's do it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: No buzzers - just yell it out, all right? First quote is, \"the question I started out with was - how do people perceive what's difficult, and how can we train a computer to make those same types of predictions?\" </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: A game? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: A game show. </p><p>TONY ROMM: A game show. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: \"Jeopardy!\"? </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. OK. There you go. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Oh, really? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: See. Yeah, yeah. So that was a quote from Emma Boettcher. She's a new \"Jeopardy!\" champion. And she... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Beat the guy who had won millions with the expertise he gained from being a sports gambler. And she got her expertise in \"Jeopardy!\" by writing her master's thesis on how to beat the game. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Wait. I've... </p><p>TONY ROMM: See... </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: ...Been spending my time all wrong (laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: I could've gotten a master's in game shows? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes, you can. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Why did I do journalism? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Yeah. She wrote a 70-page master's thesis called \"Predicting The Difficulty Of Trivia Questions Using Text Features.\" And she basically found out that you can figure out how hard these questions are or how easy they are or how to guess the right answer based on how it's worded. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Wow. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>TONY ROMM: She wouldn't struggle at this show. She... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: She'd win it... </p><p>TONY ROMM: All of it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Hands down. All right, Kelsey. You're up one - zip. Next quote - you ready? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: \"We have decided to launch a campaign to educate the public, politicians and civil servants about the unique problems we face.\" </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Oh. </p><p>TONY ROMM: That could be anything. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Yeah. I was going to say. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: What marginalized community announced this week that they were going to have a march to celebrate themselves? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Oh. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Is this the straight pride thing? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Straight pride? </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, Jesus. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'll give that to both of you. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, no. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So as we know, June is LGBTQ Pride month, and there are parades and celebrations and honoring of that community all month. But in response, a group called Super Happy Fun America wrote a blog post this week announcing that, in the Boston area, these guys are planning a straight pride parade. </p><p>TONY ROMM: What's in it? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I don't even know - cargo shorts? </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Socks and sandals. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>TONY ROMM: I have no words. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Final quote - I think the game is - well, the game is whatever. It doesn't matter. Final quote... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Here's a quote. \"Tonight's the night. Let's live it up. I got my money. Let's spend it up.\" Y'all know that quote. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's from a song. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: It is from a song. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, I know. And I'm like - I'm going to embarrass myself. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I love - no. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Let me do it again. Tonight's the night. </p><p>TONY ROMM: That's what it sounded like to... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Let's live it up. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Oh, it's... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I got my money. Let's spend it up... </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I know this. The... </p><p>TONY ROMM: Black Eyed Peas. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. Oh, my God. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Gosh. We're dragging over here. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, my God. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Why was it so hard? </p><p>TONY ROMM: I don't know. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: What really happened there is Tony and I totally knew the answer. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Uh-huh. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: We just wanted to hear you sing again - twice. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Uh-huh. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Twice, yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So I was reciting some of the lyrics of the Black Eyed Peas' classic \"I Gotta Feeling\" because, to the best of our knowledge from what Apple has revealed, that has been the best-selling song on iTunes. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Really? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And iTunes is in the news this week because Apple is kind of killing iTunes. iTunes is over. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yep. RIP. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I'm not going to be sad about that. </p><p>TONY ROMM: RIP, iTunes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Basically, iTunes allows you to, like, download songs. Now we've all moved to streaming. Right? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, yeah. I mean - and also, that software is terrible, and nobody likes using it. Whenever it opens up your laptop, you're like, damn this thing. It's like (laughter).... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, yeah. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I mean, I'm pretty sure I still have a phone somewhere that has that U2 album that they made you get from iTunes on your phone. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Oh, my God. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: God. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Remember that? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So annoying. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So annoying. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah. But they're, like, splitting it up into multiple things now. So it's like sort of gone but not gone. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So like, you can still use iTunes and download the song. But it'll be hidden, and Apple's going to prioritize streaming. But this is just a sign that, like, the industry has changed. You know, when iTunes came out, everyone wanted to download their songs and have them on their device. And now we've moved to streaming, and people just download this stuff less. So RIP. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Maybe they should just download podcasts more. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Ba-da-ba (ph). </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: NPR plugs. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Anyways, the game is oh (ph) - who won? </p><p>TONY ROMM: Not me. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I really don't know. </p><p>TONY ROMM: (Laughter) Celine Dion won. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That's right. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: At the end of the day, Celine is the winner. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Now it's time to end the show. Usually in this segment, we ask our listeners to share with us the best things that happened to them all week. We encourage folks to brag. We listen. It's always great. But this week, want to try something different. We have been asking listeners to share with us the strangest, weirdest, quirkiest parts of their week. We wanted folks to give us that audio. So we've put it together. </p><p>Brent, Anjuli - hit the tape. </p><p>IAN DOESCHER: Hi, Sam. This Ian Doescher (ph) from Portland, Ore. Here's the weirdest thing that happened to me this week. My sons and I were on vacation in New York City. And while we walked through Central Park, we overheard snippets of conversations. One person said, and then if you accidentally eat the child... </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>IAN DOESCHER: ...Not sure what that was about. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: OK. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>MAGGIE RINEY: Hi, Sam. Maggie Riney (ph) here. Something weird that happened to me this week is that I was returning from a local amusement park in Santa Claus, Ind., actually named Holiday World when a bald eagle swooped down, talons blazing, and almost landed on the hood of my car. </p><p>MELINDA: I was sitting on a bench on my patio with a cup of coffee in one hand and the hose in the other watering the plants, and a skunk walked across my feet. I think it was the weirdest thing that happened to the skunk, too. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>JASMINE: I recently started watching \"Sex And The City\" because I had never seen it. And last night, I came across the episode where the Russian hands Carrie a banana and tells her to put it in her purse. Today as I was walking to dinner, I said hello to my fruit stand guy, and he gave me a big hug, said hello and then gave me a banana to take with me. And since I was on my way to dinner, decided to save it for later by putting it in my purse. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAMANTHA: Hey, Sam. This is Samantha (ph). I had something really weird but special happen this past week. It was about my dad. He was a nurse, and I followed in his footsteps. This past week, there was a day I was feeling really down because I thought about how he wasn't around to trade crazy nursing stories or give me instructions on things. But when I was asked to start an IV on a patient, I thought about the instructions he'd given me a really long time ago - how to look for a site, how to approach it. I got the IV in one try and started talking with the patient only to realize that she had known my father once upon a time because he had hired her to work with him in the surgical department 15 years ago. She shared with me how well-liked he had been and how he always liked to laugh. She was right. He always liked to laugh. And that was the weird, special and awesome thing that happened to me this past week. </p><p>JASMINE: Thanks so much. Have a good weekend. </p><p>IAN DOESCHER: Thanks for everything you do, Sam. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: My goodness. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: I'm also still a little hung up on, A, Santa Claus, Ind., and, B, a local amusement park. Like, there's a lot going on in that story. </p><p>TONY ROMM: I want a fruit stand guy. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Our listeners are pretty great. Oh, my goodness. Thanks to all those listeners - Ian, Maggie, Melinda (ph), Jasmine (ph) and Samantha. We listen to and read everything you send us, so keep it coming. Send me the sound of your voice. Send me an email or a note. Email all that stuff to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:samsanders@npr.org\">samsanders@npr.org</email> - <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:samsanders@npr.org\">samsanders@npr.org</email> All right. That's a wrap. The two of y'all were the best parts of my week. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Aw. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Aw. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thanks to Tony Romm, who covers tech policy at the Washington Post, for being here this week and Kelsey Snell, who covers Congress for NPR. </p><p>KELSEY SNELL: Thanks for having us. </p><p>TONY ROMM: Yeah, thanks. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This week, IT'S BEEN A MINUTE was produced by Brent Baughman and Anjuli Sastry.

He was joined by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet/Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook.</p><p>All appeared remotely because of the pandemic, reducing some of the drama of a crowded hearing room.</p><p>Under the disciplined leadership of Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., the committee focused on big issues: the enormous market power of these companies and their harm to competition; ways they weaken, snap up or destroy rivals; their danger to consumer privacy, and how data they collect is used.</p><p>As Cicilline put it in his opening remarks, \"Simply put: They have too much power. Their ability to dictate terms, call the shots, upend entire sectors and inspire fear represents the powers of a private government. Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\"</p><p>Also, Republicans, who typically go easy on antitrust issues, asked tough questions along with their Democratic colleagues on the committee. One hot-button issue for them is alleged censorship of conservative voices. Another was whether Big Tech is doing business with China, including allegedly peddling products made by slave labor.</p><p>Oh, and if you're wondering why you can't get Purell in the time of COVID-19? The hearing offered no answer to this supply chain mystery, but pump bottles of the coveted hand sanitizer were in abundant view on the committee dais.</p><p>The lawmakers (and their staffs) were admirably prepared on complex and highly technical topics. Still, the CEOs mostly denied, promised to get back to them or elided over uncomfortable topics.</p><p>As my colleague Benjamin Romano reported, Bezos faced some uncomfortable questions, especially from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who represents the district where Amazon's headquarters is located, and from Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, both Democrats.</p><p>The only time I noticed Bezos thrown off balance, though, was when Jayapal brought up an April Wall Street Journal report detailing how the company gathered data from its third-party sellers to launch competing products.</p><p>Last year, an Amazon lawyer testified that \"we don't use individual seller data directly to compete\" with the third-party sellers on its platform.</p><p>However, on Wednesday, Bezos said, \"I can't answer that question yes or no.\" He said he couldn't guarantee Amazon's policy to protect the sellers had never been violated, but now the company was examining the issue \"very carefully.\"</p><p>Still, Amazon got off relatively lightly compared with criticism leveled against Google and Facebook.</p><p>Bezos was poised and as deferential and cooperative-seeming as possible for the world's richest person. He was far from John Pierpont Morgan's infamous 1901 quote, \"I owe the public nothing.\"</p><p>His opening statement was a paean to the American rags-to-riches story, the son first of a single mother and then a poor immigrant stepfather, starting a business out of his garage with no guarantee of success.</p><p>\"You earn trust slowly, over time, by doing hard things well - delivering on time; offering everyday low prices; making promises and keeping them; making principled decisions, even when they're unpopular; and giving customers more time to spend with their families by inventing more convenient ways of shopping, reading and automating their homes.\"</p><p>He said Amazon created more jobs than any other company over the past decade and now employs 1 million.</p><p>He also mentioned a program to help 100,000 Amazon workers gain training for in-demand fields.</p><p>Bezos cleans up well and should spend more time talking to the public like this, rather than remaining silent behind lawyers, PR people or no comments at all. Of course, he'd have to engage on uncomfortable topics such as lack of unionization, and the effect of speed and intensity on workers at Amazon warehouses (which are still coveted by most localities).</p><p>The Amazon CEO would do himself good to take the Giving Pledge spearheaded by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. The wealthy participants promise to give away at least half their wealth. MacKenzie Scott, Bezos' ex-wife, took it.</p><p>At the hearings, Bezos was in agreement with the other CEOs that their companies faced abundant and vigorous competition, including internationally. And maybe that's true seen through the lens of this moment, but certainly not compared with the American economy that existed even a few years ago.</p><p>But the bigness problem, which includes competition-stifling market power and even systemic risks to the economy, is not confined to tech. Overconcentration includes Walmart, the big banks, and such sectors as airlines, broadcasting, telecom, railroads, health care and food.</p><p>This grew up over decades of lax antitrust enforcement, where regulators looked mainly at the so-called consumer welfare standard. This was easily met by giants offering convenience and low prices. The risks to employment, unionization and disparate corporate headquarters distributed broadly across the country were not relevant.</p><p>But they should be. Today's concentration is a big cause of rising inequality, stagnant incomes for most households and lower levels of business formation and innovation. To take one example, the national market share of the top three drugstore chains grew from 30% in 2002 to 67% in 2017. In 2018, the top four cellphone companies controlled 97% of the market - now it's three, Sprint being acquired by Bellevue-based T-Mobile.</p><p>The change in antitrust enforcement can be traced to the late 1970s, when deregulation began. In most cases, it opened the door to ever-larger companies controlling markets. Not surprisingly, the Federal Trade Commission stopped keeping and publishing data on industry concentration in 1981.</p><p>Will Wednesday's hearing resonate with most people? Political will and Democrats controlling both houses of Congress as well as the White House could break up this toxic concentration. This would require shedding the ideology that focused only on \"consumer welfare.\"</p><p>But a cynic would answer, \"The hearing will resonate until Americans buy the next item on Amazon that they found on Google using their iPhone and telling their friends on Facebook.\"</p><p>The \"cyberbarons\" aren't like the robber barons of the late 19th century railroads; the backlash against those created the Progressive movement and its historic reforms.</p><p>Bezos and his peers make life seem easy, amuse us, beguile us, keep us spending. The likes of J.P. Morgan are looking down with envy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-49d4960ed2b011eaa211c3ab69492f16</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GX-TBP1-DY2P-4001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1134\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The 10-year Treasury yield touched its lowest level since it dropped to a record low in March. Gold also continued its record-setting run as investors searched for safety, while the majority of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 sank.</p><p>Among the laggards were companies that most need the economy to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d and the pandemic to subside, including many in the travel industry. Expedia Group slumped 4.6%. The company\u2019s CEO, Peter Kern, called it \u201clikely the worst quarter the travel industry has seen in modern history.\u201d</p><p>Energy companies were also weak as the pandemic sucked away demand for oil.</p><p>Washington</p><p>Talks on jobless benefits reach an impasse</p><p>Nearly 30 million workers are set to lose $600 in enhanced weekly unemployment benefits that have kept much of the economy afloat these past four months during the coronavirus pandemic, as top lawmakers in Congress and the White House remain at an impasse over how and whether to extend the benefits.</p><p>Most of the last checks went out this week, but the program officially ended yesterday, a day that Democrats and Republicans spent trading barbs over who was to blame for the failed negotiations.</p><p>White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Democrats had rejected reasonable offers, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., derided Republicans for trying to advance a short-term fix that would have extended the benefits for just a week.</p><p>As many as 30 million workers, including gig workers and the self-employed, are currently receiving some form of unemployment insurance, which has been supplemented by $600 in extra benefits each week \u2013 on top of whatever state unemployment benefits a worker gets \u2013 since the crisis deepened in March.</p><p>HOUSTON</p><p>Men\u2019s Wearhouse parent preps for bankruptcy</p><p>Tailored Brands, the owner of Men\u2019s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank, is preparing a bankruptcy filing that would shutter 400 to 500 stores after the coronavirus lockdown kept America\u2019s office workers at home and stifled demand for new suits.</p><p>The filing, which could come as soon as this weekend, will give the retailer a chance to cut its borrowings and close unprofitable locations, according to people familiar with the matter. The plan calls for asset-based lenders to provide the company with a loan to keep it operating through the court process, the people said.</p><p>Tailored Brands said this week it was unlikely to make good on a July 1 missed bond payment and probably would file for bankruptcy during its third fiscal quarter, which starts Aug. 2. Term-loan lenders would see part of their holdings exchanged for equity in a reorganized company, with as much as half the $877 million loan reinstated as take-back paper, according to the people.</p><p>The company, which counted 19,300 employees in last year\u2019s annual report, is getting advice from restructuring lawyers at Kirkland &amp; Ellis and investment bank PJT Partners.</p><p>Detroit</p><p>Ford plan on debt a \u2018concerning sign\u2019</p><p>Ford Motor Co. confirmed yesterday that it sought and won permission from the U.S. Department of Energy to defer debt payments owed for a 2009 government loan.</p><p>The action is viewed as \u201cworrisome\u201d to an expert who closely follows bankruptcy trends.</p><p>Regulatory documents filed by Ford showed the company owed payments of $591 million in 2020, $591 million in 2021 and $289 million in 2022.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that Ford Motor Co., a multibillion-dollar organization, finds it necessary to defer loan payments of that size would be a concerning sign to their investors,\u201d said Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.</p><p>Ford confirmed the company modified the government loan in June to drop quarterly payments on the principal owed from $148 million to $37 million. Ford also confirmed $1.26 billion remains on the principal, and deferral will include additional costs involving interest and a higher interest rate.</p><p>\u2014 Compiled from wire reports</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPRREP-MERLIN_90627638</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPRREP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-R8K1-F08V-619M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">308103</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Republican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)</publicationName><edition>ALL S EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097WW</classCode><className>UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEUyNDQ5RTc4RDI2NDc3Q0I3MUE0OEE2NTA3QjYzRkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM</classCode><className>Unemployment Compensation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000228</classCode><className>BUSINESS INSOLVENCY &amp;

The leagues are anti-police, anti-military, and anti-American. They do not respect our great country; they want to tear it apart and down.</p><p>In 2016, five Dallas police officers were murdered. The Dallas Cowboys were going to put a decal on their helmets to honor the fallen officers. The NFL said \u201cNo,\u201d it violates the uniform policy. Now, the NFL is encouraging players to put political statements on helmets. Why the change all of a sudden?</p><p>If pro sports leagues wish to do that, fine. Police should refuse to work at the games. Why should they, when the players are against them? Let the leagues hire rent-a-cops to protect the teams and players. Disrespect the police, get your own protection. Also, military honor guards carrying flags should refuse to enter any games.</p><p>These teams and leagues do not deserve any taxpayer funding of sports facilities. There should be a recall vote of the taxes used for these facilities. We need to send a message to the teams and leagues.</p><p>Geza John Vamos, Cleveland</p><p>President Trump should build a wall around Portland protesters</p><p>Lately, we have seen images of a Portland, Oregon, police precinct station burning, police cars vandalized, windows smashed, items stolen, and people burning the American flag.

DeWine\u2019s mask order does not infringe on rights</p><p>I am so grateful that Gov. Mike DeWine has mandated face masks for the state of Ohio, albeit waiting too long before he determined it. It is a simple yet effective means for saving lives. For those who are still having issues with civil liberties being infringed upon, I have an idea that might make you approach the whole mask thing differently.</p><p>In the United States, we are mandated to drive on the right side of the road. We are forced not to drive on the left. If one does so, one is arrested, at the least, and at worst becomes a hood ornament for a semi.</p><p>So think of mask-wearing as right-side-of-the-road driving. In the short run, it may impinge a bit on your right to express yourself, but in the long run. it will keep you or one you love from being in the lead car of a funeral procession.</p><p>Thanks for getting on the \u201cright side\u201d of this issue.</p><p>James J.

And Congress is taking dead aim at breaking up the \"Big Four\" tech companies that comprise the dreaded FAANGs, with only Netflix spared from current scrutiny. Here are the combatants.</p><p>In one corner are the \"bad guys,\" the four tech giants who together employ 750,000 Americans, earn $700 billion annually and enjoy an aggregate stock market value of $3 trillion benefitting millions of American shareholders (Full disclosure, including me!).</p><p>They also supply an irreplaceable daily service on which hundreds of millions of Americans have come to depend, in most cases charging users $0 for the privilege.</p><p>In the other corner are the \"good guys,\" a motley collection of publicity-seeking politicians, egghead academics and crusading anti-business journalists, hell bent on destroying these four tech titans, primarily because they've been too dominant and successful.</p><p>With the ominous specter of driverless cars, delivery drones and artificial intelligence around the corner, the Big Tech Four stand squarely in the antitrust crosshairs. So what kind of public relations strategy should these four notoriously closed-mouthed companies adopt?</p><p>Here's the three-part plan I'd recommend:</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Be seen</emphasis></h><p>Ever since its Cambridge Analytica data mining debacle, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his more loquacious COO Sheryl Sandberg have become gun-shy to go public. The same has generally been true about executives at the other three firms.</p><p>This is a losing strategy. What Big Tech needs now is for its highest executives to become more willing to go on television, give speeches and appear before an admittedly hostile and showboating Congress.</p><p>One CEO who recognizes this is Apple's Tim Cook, whose recent commencement speech at Stanford provides a perfect example of what all his fellow CEOs should be doing. After citing the many innovations to advance society for which Silicon Valley should be given credit, Cook acknowledged that companies like his should take \"responsibility\" for fixing problems in areas like privacy.</p><p>The Apple CEO demonstrated that standing up to critics by going on offense is a much better strategy.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Be heard</emphasis></h><p>For many years, the standard for antitrust in this country, developed principally by Judge Robert Bork, has been one based on the welfare of the consumer. If companies got too large and anti-competitive, this thinking went, they could charge oppressive prices that consumers would be forced to pay.</p><p>But for consumers, Google, Facebook and Amazon are essentially free, and Apple charges a competitive price for its hardware and nominally for its apps. The fact is, consumers adore the services provided by the Big Four, and this argument should be broadcast loudly and frequently by every Big Tech executive.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Be strong</emphasis></h><p>Finally, the Big Tech Four must remain strong in the face of supercilious critics who would dismantle them.</p><p>That means continuing to innovate and announce new products. By contrast, last week's New York City Code Conference, usually a showplace for Big Tech innovation, instead became a piling-on exercise for criticism, led by conference organizer Kara Swisher, who ironically owes her journalistic success to access to tech executives but has become the industry's biggest turncoat.</p><p>The tech companies' best PR response to the Swishers of the world is to keep on keepin' on.</p><p>That's what Facebook did last week in introducing its new crypto currency, Libra. The immediate response from Maxine Waters, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, was typically \"upbeat and optimistic.\" Said the gentle congresswoman from California, \"It's very important for them to stop right now what they're doing so that we can get a handle on this.\"</p><p>Facebook and the others must stand strong against such naysayers, introducing products but also contributing to the public good and letting people know. Last week, for instance, Google pledged $1 billion in land and money to work with local governments to build affordable housing. Exactly the right course!</p><p>Such public displays of goodwill will remind people that Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google are the best businesses our nation has and the envy of the world. Should they be free of scrutiny? No. Should they be subject to increased regulation in certain areas? Sure.</p><p>But the last thing we should do is kill America's four golden geese by dismantling them. And the worst thing these companies can do is sit back and take the abuse of politicians and regulators. Alternatively, they must seek to win public opinion by showing their FAANGs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fraser P. Seitel has been a communications consultant, author and teacher for 40 years.

Market concentration has become of great interest for central bankers  Over the years central bankers have devoted a lot of attention to the relationship between labor markets and monetary policy. In comparison the link between monetary policy and developments on product markets has been a road less travelled. Yet structural changes in the product markets have been no less impressive.  There is a growing consensus that industry concentration has been increasing in some advanced economies over the past 20 years and that it had important macroeconomic consequences. </p><p>This increase in concentration mostly stems from a \u201cwinner-take-most\u201d reallocation of market shares towards larger firms that acquire \u201csuperstar\u201d status[1], without necessarily an associated reduction of the total number of firms. Reallocation of market shares towards larger firms explains (i) the decline in the labor share in the US[2] and in some advanced economies, (ii) the increase in average markups in the US[3], as stressed by Thomas Philippon and others. This is by the way one complete chapter of the next WEO to be discussed at the IMF meeting in Washington this week.  The underlying forces behind this reallocation are still poorly understood. Are those superstar firms really more productive? If it were the case, is this reallocation caused by a growing dispersion in productivities and costs, allowing more productive firms to underbid their way to bigger market shares? Or is it caused by a change in the nature of competition that amplifies firms\u2019 heterogeneity and shifts consumer demand towards low-price producers? One can think of price comparison websites for instance. Actually, both factors could be at play and would lead to a lower price level.  Conversely, increasing concentration and big data provide opportunities for concentrated online market places to tailor prices to individual consumers.  Such behavior could increase both the dispersion and the average level of prices. 2. How do competition and market structure affect prices?  Because competition directly affects firms\u2019 markup, which is a key determinant of their price, higher markups due to less competition should put upward pressures on average prices. However, if higher markups are driven by those superstar firms with lower production costs, the immediate effect on the price level is unclear[4] but  could raise an issue in the future when those firms begin using their market power to raise their prices.  Given these uncertainties, pro-competition reforms whose aim is to reduce rents in the economy are welcome but must be meticulously fine-tuned because of their impact on prices. If reforms aimed at increasing competition reduce markups (without altering production costs), then they may trigger deflationary pressures[5].   II. Competition in the financial sector  Let me now address another perspective where competition bears on the responsibilities of central banks and regulators: the changes in competition in the financial services landscape associated with digitalisation. 1. The surge of digitalisation and a revived competition  The digital revolution has fostered tougher competition in the financial sector over the past 10 years due to a combination of lower barriers to entry and the emergence of economies of scale-driven business models, challenging the traditional economies of scope (i.e. universal) business models. Both developments are enabled by technology and often facilitated by regulation as well as, for retail financial services, by cultural changes.  To take just one example, last year in France, online banks and neobanks accounted for a third of customer acquisitions. This competition holds many promises. We are indeed facing a unique digital opportunity[6] with the potential to deliver better, more affordable and more efficient financial services bringing benefits from financial inclusion to financial stability.  Willing to make the most of this opportunity, regulators are revisiting their practices to avoid unnecessary barriers to entry or biases against new solutions. ACPR and, more broadly, Banque de France have supported challengers and demonstrated that even the most requiring licenses are not out of the reach of new entrants[7]. Rather than being a business impediment, these requirements and the engagement with the supervisor have proven to be business accelerating. 2. This competition is however of a new kind and nurtures many challenges\u2026  Beyond their own success, tech challengers have an impact on others: their very business model is challenging established markets equilibrium. They tend to focus on a niche market or seek to unbundle the value chain, while incumbents (especially in the banking sector) usually sought to master the whole process (product design, distribution and management, customer relationship) and provide a wide diversity of products.  For incumbents: innovation is the only effective answer - regulation will not protect existing situations - and partnerships with Fintech is a way to address this challenge;  For fintechs: achieving profitability with high customer acquisition costs and in a model which is not based on synergies between products or services also suggests partnerships as a key development strategy.  Such features pose new challenges to supervisors. How should we regulate and supervise more complex value chains, where responsibilities are disseminated between many players and where the design, the distribution and the management of financial products become more complex? 3. \u2026 the most significant of which is the surge of big tech and its implication for the future of competition  These challenges are exacerbated as, more and more, large tech players (big tech) rather than the smaller fintechs drive this value chain unbundling. Rather than a cooperation between complementary partners, big tech might approach the provision of financial services either as providers of essential solutions (tech enablers) or as gates to data and customers, or both. They might price their services according to their unique position while strategically designing their involvement so as to largely escape regulatory scrutiny. This would pose two concerns for us.  First, existing regulations were designed in a world where outsourcing was meant to be reversible. The reliance on very few and rather elaborate technological solutions challenges this approach and raises at the same time the profile of cybersecurity, as some IT infrastructures become systemic nodes, from an operational risk perspective, in the financial system. Second, the dissymmetric bargaining power could lead to an unsustainable split in value, with the responsibilities and cost of regulation disproportionately falling on the weaker party.       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN949691720190409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVK-9Y91-DXCW-D4D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1143\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But right now, there are no obvious contenders - and that won't change in the run-up to an election where we'll see politicians and parties throw money at Facebook rather than regulate it.  </p><p>4 Mandatory data breach disclosure  </p><p>A revamp of our privacy law should finally be passed into law this year. Privacy Commissioner John Edwards didn't get everything on his wish list, including the ability to levy $1 million fines, but he did win the concession that organisations will have to disclose when they lose your data, or when it gets stolen.  </p><p>5 More cut-out-the-middleman streaming services  </p><p>Once upon a time, scarce satellite capacity monopolised by Sky was the only way to deliver pay-TV content to all Kiwis. Then came the likes of Netflix, which began life by aggregating content made by others. Now, with the rise of broadband, content creators are wondering if they need middlemen old or new. In 2019, we saw Disney decide it was better off reaching consumers directly with its Disney+ streaming services, and pulling most of its content from both Sky and online rivals. Maybe this year will see HBO follow suit with HBO Max. And given Disney+'s success (the streaming service attracted 15 million subs in its first five days), it's unlikely to be the last.  </p><p>6 A big old social media mess of an election  </p><p>This year's general election will likely see a full-on descent into US and UK style social media mayhem - and if so, my pick is that we'll see only tepid attempts by the Electoral Commission, the Advertising Standards Authority and social media platforms themselves to referee as multinational Big Tech companies and the content they publish continues to slip between the cracks.  </p><p>7 The rise of micro-mobility  </p><p>Don't like e-scooters? Too bad. Auckland Council has just increased its e-scooter licence limit from 1875 to 3200 (even if most of the newcomers won't be on streets til next month). Watch for other local bodies to follow suit, even though central government has yet to modernise laws about whether the likes of e-scooters can invade footpaths, and investments in cycleways lags. And 2020 will also see the rise of mass-market e-bike sharing. Uber says it will have 655 of its Jump bikes on Auckland streets by next month.  </p><p>8 Bendy-screen smart devices  </p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Fold landed at the tail-end of 2019. This year we'll see more bendy screen phones, plus foldable-screen laptops from the likes of Lenovo, Dell and HP. They look cool, but cost the Earth and are a little chunky - and after several false-starts, there are question marks over reliability. Wait for Version 2.0 in 2021.  </p><p>9 Fulminating over net censorship - but no real action  </p><p>Whether you believe in blocking certain online content or not, 2019 was a confused mess in this department. The Government leaned on internet service providers to block some sites post-March 15, and they did - and they subsequently voluntarily blocked other content. But Vodafone, Spark and 2degrees also said they were reluctant sheriffs. They wanted the Government to clarify which agency was responsible for censoring content, and when. Meanwhile, Chief Censor Bill Hastings moved strongly against some mosque massacre content, but most streaming video and game content was outside his jurisdiction. InternetNZ put emergency measures in place to make some content impossible for most people to find. And Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin put online porn in her sights, but it was not clear how NZ could overcome the technical issues that stymied similar censorship efforts in the UK and Australia. It would be good to see some more co-ordination this year, but it's not obvious who will take the lead with practical, achievable measures that don't overstep civil liberties. Another muddle-through seems the most likely outcome.  </p><p>10 The world's fastest fibre  </p><p>After the UFB fibre rollout, New Zealand already has some of the best landline broadband in the world. It will get even better in a couple of months as Chorus and other network providers launch 2 gigabit-per-second and 4 Gbit/s services - with 10 Gbit/s on the cards by year's end. That's a bananas amount of broadband - more than any household could ever use and scads for any business competing in the online economy. But you can never have enough broadband, and new uses will follow just as night follows day.
