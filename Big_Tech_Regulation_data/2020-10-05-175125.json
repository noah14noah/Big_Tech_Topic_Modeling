Its preview trailer runs through a litany of problems linked to the internet, from surveillance to misinformation to algorithmic bias.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"What if we just tried turning it off for, like, a week,\" jokes Vox's Jane Coaston, \"just to see what would happen?\" The ill effects of the internet are also examined in a clutch of current books from Coders by journalist Clive Thompson (no relation to Derek) to Tools and Weapons by Microsoft president Brad Smith and Carol Ann Browne.</p><p>In Coders, Thompson profiles programmers at social media giants including Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest and examines their role in making the internet what it is today. Early America was run by lawyers, he observes, and 20th-century America by engineers. Now the coders are in charge. They have played a disproportionate role in creating the major internet platforms, transforming economies, cultures and governments in the process.</p><p>That's less than ideal, Thompson believes, because coders are disproportionately young, white men from privileged backgrounds who design products to solve problems in their own lives. \"When you have a homogenous cohort of people making software and hardware, they tend to produce work that works great for them but can be useless, or even a disaster, for people in other walks of life,\" he says. In Beyond the Valley, media studies professor Ramesh Srinivasan extends that critique to include a geographic caveat: \"Chinese, Western and white male interests dominate the content and systems that power the internet, rather than those who reflect the full diversity of us online,\" he writes.</p><p>We were promised \"an internet that acts as a 'global village' ... that creates, or at least supports, equality\" but that's an internet \"we haven't yet received\".</p><p>The pursuit of profits - that is, the internet's transition from a non-commercial Eden for researchers and hobbyists into a bonanza of capitalism - is another force driving things off the rails. The founders of Instagram didn't \"actively set out to erode anyone's self-esteem\", says Thompson. But the need to continually expand the user base to fuel ad sales - by encouraging people to showcase their best moments in the addictive pursuit of \"likes\" - overrode concerns about the feelings of inadequacy and the unhealthy fear of missing out that users were reporting.</p><p>\"The money was deforming decisions - what code gets written and why.\" Srinivasan concurs, pointing out that many of the big tech companies \"are branded as public, civic and virtuous but, in reality, are dominated by a single logic - extending profitability and economic value\". Technologists' relentless focus on efficiency has also led us astray. Coders enjoy automating and optimising, but \"even the programmers themselves can be surprised, and disenchanted, by how their zeal for optimisation can produce unexpected and freaky side effects\", says Thompson. \"Uber flooded the streets ... with cars, which was terrific for riders but less so for drivers, many of whom began to find it harder and harder to piece together a steady living, given the frenetic competition.\" Srinivasan contends that \"efficiency on our consumer platforms can ... disturb our sense of security and privacy\". Targeted ads are incredibly efficient, for example, but they can also be incredibly creepy.</p><p>The relentless drive toward optimisation relies on an entirely new category of workers who toil behind the scenes. In Ghost Work, anthropologist Mary Gray and computer scientist Siddharth Suri explore the lives of people who, using crowdsourcing marketplaces like Amazon Turk, carry out essential online microtasks, such as filtering harmful content for Google. The book reveals that although some internet work is rewarded and celebrated, much of it is poorly compensated and invisible, and takes a sometimes devastating human toll.</p><p>Even assuming that, overall, the internet does far more good than harm, it will remain broken unless our institutions, culture and policies change to make the most of it. And that challenge is becoming only more urgent as more people come online. As technologist Jim Cashel writes in The Great Connecting, it took 25 years from the launch of the web browser Mosaic, in 1993, for half the world to come online. But the other half will gain access in the next three to five years. He asks: \"What are the major players involved in connecting the planet doing to prepare [for] expanded connectivity?\" Cashel's advice boils down to: anticipate, facilitate, mitigate, regulate and celebrate. To date, there's been too much of the last and too little of all the rest - especially regulation. Cashel calls for an international \"digital tribunal\" to help countries co-ordinate regulatory efforts.</p><p>For Gray and Suri, a first step in fixing the internet is empathy. We need to recognise what happens behind the scenes of the sites and services we use every day and better understand the consequences of our actions. They recommend that more ghost work platforms take a \"double bottom line\" approach to their business, balancing profits with concern for their workforce.</p><p>Srinivasan would like to put more control in the hands of users and argues for spreading a more robust version of digital literacy that includes \"the capacity to reflect, analyse, and create\" so that more of us can contribute to technological development.</p><p>In Tools and Weapons, Microsoft's Smith puts his hope in the rule of law. \"The tech sector cannot address these challenges by itself,\" he writes. \"The world needs a mixture of self-regulation and government action.\" That means more than just the public sector holding the private one to account; it also works the other way around. To illustrate, Smith points to Microsoft's decision to sue the US government after the National Security Agency issued warrants requiring it to turn over customer data.</p><p>To improve the internet, we must fight the tendency to ignore its tremendous potential. A few years ago, a Reddit user wondered what would be the hardest thing to explain to someone arriving from 50 years in the past. One user answered: \"I possess a device, in my pocket, that is capable of accessing the entirety of information known to man. I use it to look at pictures of cats and get in arguments with strangers.\" I love that quote because it so perfectly captures our inability to put the internet to good use.</p><p>Surely we can do better.</p><p>Walter Frick is an editor at HBRFor more exclusive HBR content go to: theaustralian.com.au/ business/ harvardbusiness-review</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20190816DealNSW27000400193661</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTP-2PY1-JD3N-53C5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1121\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>DealNSW Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 16, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Yet the system remains fragile, inefficient, and dangerous. Despite reforms put in place after crises, bankers, politicians, and regulators consistently overstate the system's health and the effectiveness of new rules.</p><p>Doing more to prevent crises requires the political will to address the underlying flaws in the system. But governments' relationships with their country's financial sector can often be too close to enable substantial reform. Financial institutions themselves, meanwhile, have little incentive to change.</p><p>As it stands, poorly-designed regulation continues to allow the largest institutions to borrow on privileged terms and remain opaque, while fears of another \"Lehman moment\" mean that, in the event of a crisis, policymakers are likely to ensure that ordinary depositors are paid in full to prevent system collapse.</p><p>This situation normalises recklessness. As we have seen in the past, by the time problems are visible, they can easily escalate. Individuals lack the right expertise and are unable to bring about meaningful change even if they know or sense that something is wrong.</p><p>The dysfunction of governance and policy is among the reasons that ordinary people are currently turning away from capitalism as a system. This situation fuels polarisation that can enable populist demagogues to manipulate public anger away from these issues.</p><p>Economic analyses do not always help if, as is often the case, they are obscure or seem to justify the system.</p><p>Focusing on how to respond to sudden \"shocks\" obscures the possibility of reducing the likelihood of crises without sacrificing the system's benefits.</p><p>The financial sector illustrates prevalent corporate governance problems elsewhere. Carillion, for example, used accounting tricks and other tactics to hide its weakness, digging itself into a hole that caused more collateral harm when it finally collapsed.</p><p>Meanwhile tech companies' abuse or carelessness with personal data has caused identity theft and helped spread propaganda and fake news.</p><p>If the global financial crisis wasn't enough to drive effective reforms, what will work to ensure that corporations serve society without causing unnecessary harm? Will the backlash against Facebook, for example, force long-term change to Big Tech, or better data security? The next financial crisis may well start from a massive cyber attack.</p><p>Fortunately, we need not abandon capitalism to make it work better. The obstacles to change, while challenging, are man-made.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Wednesday to you.  It is Wednesday,  October 25th.  Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jeff Flake is out, the Arizona senator says that he will not run for  reelection when his term expires next year just like his Tennessee  colleague, Bob Corker.  Flake blamed \"outrageous and undignified behavior\"  by President Trump as the reason behind this decision.  The White House was  quick to respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The  president is focused on doing this.  He went to the Hill and met with  republican senators to talk about tax reform, to push his legislative  agendas.</p><p>The voters of these individual senator states are speaking in pretty loud  volumes.  I think that they were not likely to be reelected and I think  that shows that the support is more behind this president than it is those  two individuals.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The decisions come as the GOP pushes for tax reform.  The  commander-in-chief himself made an appearance on Capitol Hill yesterday to  rally the party to get this done.  </p><p>Speaker of the House Paul Ryan also weighed in insisting that the tensions  would not hurt the effort.</p><p>Meanwhile, a little bit of earnings blitz on Wall Street, among the top  names reporting earnings today, Boeing and Coca Cola.  We will bring you  the analysis and the numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  Tell you how  they may impact markets.</p><p>The meantime markets are flat right now, Futures indicating a flat opening  at the start of trading, DOW Industrial down about four points, Nasdaq down  about 10 points as you see there.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are mixed, similar story there.  Take a look as we get  earnings streaming now, we're going to run it on the tape there.   Indications here, FTSE100 is down 15 points, the CAC Krones in Paris is up  12, and the DAX Index right around breakeven.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher as you see here with the  exception of the Nikkei Average in Japan pulling back by half of one  percent.</p><p>Bank rolling controversy, the salacious dossier that target President Trump  during the election now we find out reportedly funded in part by the  Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.  More on the  shocking news claims just ahead this morning.</p><p>Total devastation, new satellite images from NASA revealing the extent of  the immense damage left behind by the California wildfires, we've got that  for you.</p><p>And batter up, we've got all the highlights as the World Series gets  underway in Los Angeles.  All that coming up.</p><p>Plus, I am coming to you live this morning from Saudi Arabia once again.   I'm live, day two of the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh this  morning.  A lot happening.  People are praising his royal highness, the  crowned prince, of course yesterday.</p><p>You saw my panel when I spoke with the crown prince about what he's trying  to do opening up the country to foreign investment, as well allowing women  to drive, that doesn't sound radical to us but it's certainly is a radical  idea here in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In fact, this crowned prince is not afraid to attack the issues that are  important to the world.  He is trying to reduce extremism in Saudi Arabia  to less than five percent in the next two to three years.  </p><p>Apparently it is some 20 percent which is what we're hearing.  He's got the  investment fund called the PIF, he's seeking return of between six and nine  percent annually.  He's looking at six pools of investment and hoping to  get the overall value of the fund up $2 trillion by 2030.</p><p>In fact, they're saying behind closed doors it's a joke that it's $2  trillion, we're actually looking to even exceed $2 trillion.  We know that  the Saudis gave Softbank and their vision fund $45 billion, that's $45  billion of the $100 billion of that Softbank fund which is investing in  technology so aggressively.</p><p>That's one of the sources of revenue for the PIF here, that fund.  Also  they have invested with the Blackstone Group, a big infrastructure fund, so  they're looking to invest in infrastructure around the world.</p><p>They're also hoping to privatize things here in Saudi Arabia.  They want to  privatize the rail system, the airports, lot of infrastructure that they're  expecting to also bring big returns.  They're talking about oil prices that  they just cannot rely on the price of oil, where it is right now.</p><p>So they're looking to diversify.  Real fundamental change happening in  Saudi Arabia, I can't tell you what I've learned enough here that there is  serious change happening here in Saudi Arabia and that is why you have so  many big hitters from across the world here trying to get a piece of this  action.</p><p>It's another big day of exclusive news making interviews this morning.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with coming up, Treasury Secretary  Steven MNuchin is with me today.  The CEO of Blackstone Group, Steve  Schwarzman. </p><p>EY Global Chairman and CEO, Mark Weinberger.  The CEO of the London Stock  Exchange, Xavier Rolet is here.  And Revolution Chairman and CEO, Steve  Case.</p><p>And joining from New York this morning is Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell.  CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  And Business and  Economics Professor of the King's College, Brian Brenberg.  Good morning  everybody, great to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, KING'S COLLEGE PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS:  Good  morning.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, CFRA INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lots to talk about Dagen.  What's on your agenda?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That Hillary Clinton and her team and the DNC were behind that  controversial discredited dossier put together.  I hope they own it and I  hope the hammer comes down on everybody associated with the dossier put  together against President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible Dagen.  How long have we been saying on this  program collusion between the Trump Administration and the Russians does  not exist.  And here we are looking at this other collusion with the  democrats.  It's just outrageous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your compass on this story from its first breath, everything to  do with Russia and Hillary Clinton, her campaign and the DNC, you have been  spot on from moment one and I can't reiterate that enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We've got a lot to talk about this morning.  </p><p>Our top story right now, a Republican Party feud on Capitol Hill, two  senators taking aim at President Trump.  The president renewing his attacks  against Bob Corker after the Tennessee senator said that the White House  should leave it to Congress to decide how to pay for the tax cuts.  Corker  fired back questioning his own support for the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The beginning of the administration you supported the  president, do you regret that now?</p><p>BOB CORKER (R-TN):  Well, what do you think?  Like if -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that's a yes.</p><p>CORKER:  I think people -- like I think there were many people, I was one  of those that hope that he would rise to the occasion as president and he  aspire to lead our nation instead of dividing it.  And it's obvious his  political model and governing model is to divide.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Arizona Senator Jeff Flake announcing that he will  not seek reelection next year.  Flake have been facing a tough race after  repeatedly criticizing President Trump.  </p><p>Announcing his decision on the Senate floor, Flake echoed Corker once again  slamming the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA:  Reckless, outrageous and undignified  behavior has become excused and countenanced as tone it like it is when it  is actually just reckless, outrageous, and undignified.  </p><p>And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government it is  something else, it is dangerous to a democracy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Paul Ryan insisted  that these tensions going on would not hurt efforts to pass tax reform.   Something the president echoed when I sat down with him late last week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I don't think it changes our  efforts on tax reform.  I know Bob who supported the budget wants to get  tax reform, I know the president wants to get tax reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even your supporter say, \"He's got fantastic policies, we want  to see this through\" but the bickering and the feuding actually gets in the  way.  So obviously the feuding with Senator Corker, I think there's a  personal thing going on between you and Senator McCain.</p><p>Do you worry that this bickering and feuding gets in the way of your  agenda?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  No, and sometimes it helps  to be honest with you.  So we'll see what happens at the end.  But I think  actually sometimes it helps.  Sometimes it gets people to do what they're  supposed to be doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And joining me right now is special interview, Colony NorthStar  Executive Chairman, Thomas Barrack, Jr. is with me.  And Tom, it's great to  have you on the program this morning.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK, JR., EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, COLONY NORTHSTAR:  Thanks Maria,  great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Now I know that you are long  time friends, you've been an adviser to President Trump.  Do you think tax  reform can get passed even though we've got all of these fights happening?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Absolutely.  I think it's a necessity for everybody.  What  we've witnessed is not a misfire by President Trump, it's boys playing  badly in the sandbox.  </p><p>And for midterm elections, everybody just has to get on with business and  do the right thing and I think tax reform is the key to corporate  restructuring and organization, capital expenditure investment, and a  couple hundred dollars more in the average American's pocket is going to be  meaningful.  So they have to get it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think this will move the needle on economic growth?  You  think that it will do what the president is hoping it will do in terms to  create jobs?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Growth and production are the only two components that can  move the needle.  So growth is very difficult in an environment like this,  so increased production is the answer and increase investment to get that  production as a necessity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when the senators arrive for their weekly policy lunch  yesterday with the president, some of the senators apparently were ready  for show.  Watch this, got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you envision any problems at this luncheon when the  president will be there with Senator Corker?</p><p>SEN THOM TILLIS, (R) NORTH CAROLINA:  No, I don't think so.  I'm going to  bring some popcorn.  It will be interesting to watch.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator Thom Tillis tweeted out this photo as well.  According  to reports there were not any fireworks at the meeting.  So how would you  recommend, how do you advice the president here that the proceed with these  senators especially Flake and Corker while he's trying to get things done  and needs their votes?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Well I think he's proceeding with his intention, he has two  of the best individuals capable of monitoring this and Secretary MNuchin  who you're going to talk to this afternoon and Gary Cohn.</p><p>So the machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a  necessity for them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done  and to stop bickering and nobody toys with president.  He's very well  equipped to handle himself and these battles and I think it will get done  and it will get done well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think this pushback on the state and local tax  deduction is going to get in the way of passage?  Lot of people like a  Peter King, like other New Jersey and New York senators -- congressman  rather are saying, \"Look, we can't vote for this because my constituents  are going to get the tax increase.\"</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Well you're going to have concessions everywhere.  And when  you think about it, that's actually an easy thing to give away if you had  to.  So at the end of the day, the consensus of what gets done will be a  blend of those things but it will happen in the last day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom, let me ask you about the news of the day, even the  \"Washington Post\" is reporting this this morning which, of course, they are  hard press to report anything against the Clinton campaign.</p><p>But Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped  fund research that resulted in that now infamous dossier with allegations  about President Trump's connections to Russia according to sources familiar  with the matter.  What did you make of that?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  What I make of it is that the same issues that have  alienated America to drive them to elect President Trump.  Everybody's just  fed up with it all.  It's not one side or the other, we're ready for  something else.  President Trump has been that.  I think that's all it is  to say about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- you're right.  You know what, people wanted to shake  up.</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's why President Trump was voted into office because  they're sick and tired of just not understanding where the fairness is.  </p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Because there is no fairness.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Yes.  All right.  Let me turn to Colony, obviously one  of the biggest names in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein, we've been talking  about the terrible situation for the women.</p><p>More than half a dozen women now accused Weinstein of sexual assault, more  than 50 women have publicly detailed a range of inappropriate behavior by  the movie mogul, over decades by the way.  </p><p>It has been reported that your private equity arm of the company, Colony  Capital maybe par -- or may want to buy (INAUDIBLE) all of the Weinstein  Company, where does that stand right now Tom?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Well we've looked at -- if you remember, we owned Miramax  and Miramax was a Weinstein creation that Disney had on for almost a  decade.  And we bought Miramax and Disney and it was a great investment for  us.</p><p>The Weinstein Company has some of the same elements, it has a video  library, it has a TV production group, and it has a lot of great people who  work within it.  The Weinstein name is finished, Harvey's actions  regardless of what are unacceptable, inappropriate, and despicable.</p><p>And the company needed a capital gauge of clog to stop the bleeding while  you could evaluate what's left of the pieces to salvage and that's what  we've been doing.  It's still a question as to whether we'll be successful  or not but it's not a resuscitation of the Weinsteins, it's trying to  salvage the pieces of the company so the creative talent and the production  group can go forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they are good assets, they are very good assets, right?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Great assets.  I mean, regardless of what else, one of the  great independent filmmaking companies ever in history was at the hands of  the Weinsteins, that's the good news and that's the bad news.</p><p>So in an area where content is everything and the digital era is making  content even more valuable, that library harvested correctly can be of  great value.  It's separating the liabilities and the toxicity of what  happened from the good people and the good product that's within the  company and that's sometimes an art form, not a science.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The negotiation right now, is it overpriced?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  No, it's over what it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What it is, yes.  Because you just said a minute ago Weinstein  name is done, I mean how can you go on with after what has happened, it's  incredible.</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  You can.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom, good to have you on the program.</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom Barrack.  We'll take a break.  We're live from Saudi, next.   Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A suicide live streamed on Facebook, Cheryl  Casone with these details now, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE:  Well Maria, good morning.  Shocked viewers could not believe what  they were watching.  A distraught father in Turkey upset that his daughter  got engaged without his permission committed suicide on Facebook Live.</p><p>The violent scene unfolded as he was speaking directly into the camera  before he pulled a handgun with his left hand fired a single shot into his  temple.  Facebook has removed that video from the site.</p><p>Well President Trump allowing refugee admissions to resume under a stricter  screening rules.  This comes after the administration's 120-day ban on  refugee admissions expired yesterday.  Now, the president has also ordered  refugees from 11 countries that post higher risk to U.S. national security  to face even tougher scrutiny.  The administration hasn't identified though  yet those 11 countries.  </p><p>Well Congress voting to overturn a banking rule from the Obama  Administration that would have allowed consumers to bring class action law  suits against their bank or credit card company.  Vice President Pence cast  the final vote to break the 50-50 tie.</p><p>The banking industry was pushing hard to rollback this regulation that came  from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau years ago.  The Trump  Administration and republicans say the rule harms the free market.  The  president now expected to sign that measure into law.</p><p>Well, earnings season in full swing, Anthem is out with better than  expected third quarter adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share, of course, this  company revenue of $22 billion slighted ahead of expectations.</p><p>And then Alaska Airlines out with a profit of $2.24 a share, $0.02 below  the estimate.  The stock is down about 11 percent so far year-to-date.   There is the one year chart as well on Alaska.  </p><p>And then let's take a look at Chipotle, they came out with pretty  disappointing quarterly numbers.  Same store sales falling short of what  analyst were looking for.  The stock is lower in the premarket Maria, down  more than 10 percent from hurricanes, the consumer taste changing, to the  higher price of avocadoes.  </p><p>A lot of issues factored into these negative numbers coming out of  Chipotle.  And those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, 10 percent big move there Cheryl on the downside.  Okay,  thank you so much.  We should point out that these are just reported  earnings and revenue better than expected.  </p><p>We'll see if the stock moves on this but we've got revenue at $4.8 billion,  better than the estimate earnings as well.  Visa in the news right now.   Stock is up about two percent right now higher on Visa.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, mixed signals on healthcare after  the president ended subsidies to the insurance companies and you said that  they got rich off of ObamaCare.  How is the industry reacting?  I'll have  an exclusive interview right here in Riyadh with the CEO of Prudential  Financial, John Strangfeld coming up, that's next.</p><p>And then Amazon now giving businesses to prime treatment, two day shipping  for some deliveries, what it will cost you, that story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this  morning from the future investment initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>Over in Washington, the republican controlled Congress is still looking to  deliver win for President Trump on healthcare but Senate Majority Leader,  Mitch McConnell is putting the responsibility back on the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  What I'm waiting is  to hear from President Trump what kind of healthcare bill he might sign.   If there is a need for some kind of interim step here to stabilize the  market we need a bill, the president will actually sign.</p><p>And I'm not certain yet what the president is looking for here but I'll be  happy to bring a bill to the floor if I know President Trump would sign it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now and a FOX Business Exclusive is the CEO of  Prudential Financial, John Strangfeld.  John, it's good to see you, thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p>JOHN STRANGFELD, CEO, PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL:  Thank you.  Good to see you  too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about all this uncertainty over what the  president actually wants to replace ObamaCare with, impacting the industry  overall, uncertainty over the tax package.  </p><p>Are these pieces of legislation going to impact markets if we actually  don't see closure soon?  </p><p>STRANGFELD:  I don't see the healthcare having a big impact on that.  I  think the uncertainty around tax and what the outcome of the taxes I think  actually has a bigger impact.  And it can be linked to other public policy  objectives as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you really have to see a movement in economic growth  and you think that happens from tax reform.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  I think that can happen from tax reform and I also think  there's certain public policy objectives that are important to be reflected  in the tax reform as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about Prudential Financial for a moment, you've  changed the company obviously not a healthcare company, you've got a huge  asset management -- wealth management division, $1.2 trillion assets under  management.</p><p>How are you investing today?  How are your clients viewing this market  sentiment which obviously has been record setting?</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Well, it takes different forms in different places.  And so  for example, in our particular case, we're a large insurance company, we're  a large retirement company, and we're a large asset management.</p><p>$1.2 trillion, about two-thirds of that are institutional investors, such  as those here in the Saudi Kingdom which is partly why I'm here.  Everyone  has a different objective in terms of what they're trying to accomplish.   But many of them are apprehensive about what's going on in the marketplace  and how the returns they can achieve match up with the obligations that  they have in front of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want to ask about retirement because we just came off of  a couple of weeks of uncertainty with regard to what this administration  might do with 401K plans and finally the president comes out and says there  will be no change to your 401K.  What was your take on that?</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Well, that was a good conclusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it was.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  So if you think about this, aging population not only in U.S.  but in many countries shrinking government safety nets, corporate employers  plans are less generous than they once were and people are living longer.</p><p>So when you combine all this together, it's a big challenge for people to  maintain their quality of life in retirement.  And the more we can do to  have public policy that aligns with people's objectives of achieving that  is really, really critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you don't want any change in policy in terms of 401K?</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Absolutely not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, what -- we're already looking at a situation  where people don't have enough money in retirement.  </p><p>STRANGFELD:  They absolutely don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want to change a 401K where an employee is able to  get a match from the company.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Absolutely.  In fact, we have -- we need more incentives to  encourage people along the way.  Not only that, many people have had their  retirement risks shifted to their shoulders whether it's the savings or  whether it's the risk of knowing how long they're going to live.</p><p>None of us know whether we're going to live to 72 or 102, so it's very  difficult to know how we can save for that.  Our parents generation had a  pension check show up in the mailbox once a month.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  We don't have that today.  So people have to address that  individually which is a much harder way to manage risk.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now you're here as you just mentioned, you've got clients  obviously -- a lot of your institutional clients including the Kingdom, I  thought it was really interesting what the crowned prince has been saying  in terms of the private investment fund.</p><p>They've got six pools of capital, they're -- they gave $45 billion to  Softbank in that vision fund, they're investing in the Blackstone  infrastructure fund.  Where else do you think there's opportunity for an  international investor like the Saudi Kingdom?</p><p>Are they looking U.S., Europe, where's the attractions?</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Well what they have historically done is exported a lot of  capital.  Meaning, investments into other regions of the world, it takes  many different forms (INAUDIBLE) examples that you mentioned.</p><p>But it's interesting from what the crowned prince was talking about  yesterday is there's also going to be an added initiative, we're investing  more extensively in their domestic marketplace as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And Saudi is changing.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Yes.  Saudi is changing and what's also fascinating about his  efforts that were reflected in your moderated panel yesterday was the  desire to link public policy with those objectives in ways (INAUDIBLE)  other countries should consider replicating as well.</p><p>You have a much better prospect of achieving your objectives if public  policy is an enabler to outcomes and clearly, he's focusing on having an  enabling public policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think it's incredible that he wants to get that Private  Investment Fund, the PIF up to above $2 trillion in assets by 2030.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Yes.  Yes, that's a big number.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  And I think it's -- I think it's actually quite achievable  given what they've done and given what they (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>And by the way, they're very long-term investors which as are we which is  what made -- we've been here for over 20 years which has made that  relationship as strong as it is, they're thinking very long-term.</p><p>But the neat thing about his, the crowned prince was his thinking around  the use of public policy to enable things that happened.  Frankly, we could  take a page out of the book in our country.  We spend so much time on  regulating versus enabling is a real opportunity there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's one of the reason that the Trump Administration has rolled  back regulation so much really.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Exactly right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John, it's good to see you. </p><p>STRANGFELD:  Nice to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nice to see you here in Saudi.  </p><p>STRANGFELD:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Strangfeld joining us there.  Thank you John.  </p><p>Coming up next, incredible new images of the devastating California  wildfires and they're from space.  NASA releasing the revealing pictures  and we've got them for you.  And then the L.A. Dodgers taking one of the  World Series, but the real winner may be the team's right fielder, whose  hair, well, took on Dodger blue and took it to a whole new level.  We'll  tell you about it.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  Mornings with Maria, live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the future  investment initiative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, October  25th, happy Wednesday to you, everybody, thanks for joining me, your top  stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Mark Cuban means business.   The billionaire sits down with Fox News to talk about a possible White  House run in 2020.  How Cuban claims he would help the middle class if he  decides to take on President Trump, coming up.  Meanwhile, earnings  expected to drive markets once again.  </p><p>We are in the thick of earnings season for the third quarter, three Dow  components out before the opening bell this morning.  Coca-Cola and Boeing  are both due in the next two hours.  We will bring you the numbers as soon  as they hit the tapes.  Visa reported a moment ago, delivering solid fiscal  fourth-quarter results for visa.  The credit card company beat expectations  on both earnings and on revenue.  We are breaking down those numbers,  coming up.  The stock is already up two percent as expected to tackle on 15  points on the Dow at the open, with a two percent rally in Visa.  </p><p>Futures meanwhile, indicating a flat opening so far for the broader  averages as you can see.  European stocks are also mixed to a really flat  on the session.  Take a look at the European indices right here, and we see  the FT 100 down about 10 points and the CAC Quarante up 15, the DAX Index  in Germany up about 8.  Fractional moves there.  In Asia overnight, markets  closed mostly higher.  Take a look, as you see there, best performer, Hang  Seng in Hong Kong, up half a percent.  </p><p>California chard, NASA releasing stunning new satellite pictures revealing  the true scope of the damage left behind by the massive wildfires still  raging in the state.  Twitter getting transparent, how the company is  fighting back this morning amid revelations that Russia used social media  to meddle in the U.S. election plus, the Dodgers scorch the Astros last  night, the hottest World Series game, game one on record, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMMENTATOR:  Left field and it's deep and a wall and a turn.  It's a two- run home run.  Marwin Gonzalez runs out of room, Turner runs around the  bases and the Dodgers take a 3-1 lead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, we have the highlights from the sizzling summer-like start  to the fall classic, coming up this morning.  But first, I am live, at day  two at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this  morning.  It's another big day of exclusive interviews, news-making  interviews.  We've got huge titans from across the world coming here  because Saudi Arabia is in the midst of fundamental change.  </p><p>I will be speaking, coming up, with Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin, the  CEO of the Blackstone Group Stephen Schwarzman, EY Global Chairman and CEO  Mark Weinberger and London Stock Exchange CEO Xavier Rolet, coming up.  But  first, tax reform in the road to 2020, billionaire Mark Cuban seems to be  setting up a primary challenge to President Trump during an interview with  Fox News host Tucker Carlson last night.  Cuban slammed Trump's tax plan  and weighed in on how he would help the stagnant middle class. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK CUBAN, OWNER OF NBA'S DALLAS MAVERICKS:  The first thing I would do  rather than a tax reform we're looking at right now, a decrease payroll  taxes significantly, so that that money, instead of being -- instead of  having every hour tax as it is now, that money would go right into the  hands of the people who need it the most.  I would focus on creating  technology solutions.  I think there's a way that we can reduce the size of  government, the size of bureaucracy that deals with healthcare, but it's  going to take somebody who understands technology that can introduce  technology to find those solutions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now and the first on Fox Business interview is  Revolution CEO and Chairman, and Former CEO of AOL, Steve Case, Steve,  great to see you.</p><p>STEVE CASE, CEO AND CHAIRMAN OF REVOLUTION:  Great to be back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, so your thoughts on this,  Mark Cuban, going to run for president?</p><p>CASE:  What (INAUDIBLE) I think we have three more years to go, but I love  the fact that Mark's going to -- trying to throw some ideas out there to  help the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, so far, there's been such divisiveness in this  country.  What do you think about what the policies coming out of this  administration have been so far?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think they are trying to focus onto things like tax reform  (INAUDIBLE) get some traction.  I've talked to the President and some of  his advisors, Gary Cohn and Wilbur Ross and others about making sure that  as they look at tax reform, they -- and try to focus on simplification.   They also create the right investment in (INAUDIBLE) so entrepreneurs  particularly (INAUDIBLE) have access to Capitol, so they can start  companies and create jobs there.  </p><p>We have this growing divide in the country where a lot of innovation and  wealth creation and job creations happening in the coast.  There are a lot  of people in the country that do feel left out and left behind, so  hopefully, that would be one of the areas as tax reform moves forward.  It  will be a more inclusive innovation economy.  Last year, 75 percent of  (INAUDIBLE) went to just three states.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASE:  And so, we need to make sure everybody, everywhere really has a shot  at the American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do you see growth?  I mean, you're really one of the  first people to get on this, sort of, longevity bandwagon, wellness  longevity with your Revolution Company.  Tell me where do you see growth in  the world today?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think the big opportunity is what I've called the third wave  of the earn, the first wave is just getting everybody connected that we  started AOL over three decades ago, only three percent of people are  online, so getting (INAUDIBLE) was the first wave.  The last 15 or 20 years  is really the second wave building apps and services on top of the  internet, Facebook and Google and so forth.  </p><p>But the third wave is just now happening, it's really integrating the  internet in seamless ways throughout healthcare and energy, food,  agriculture, transportation, smart cities, a lot of things are up for grabs  in the third wave, but I think it's going to require a different mind-set  for entrepreneurs, partnerships, companies are going to be more important,  policy, regulatory issues are going to become more important.  And I also  believe they will tie with (INAUDIBLE) the expertise and a lot of sectors  like healthcare and farming is in the middle of the country.  </p><p>So we're backing entrepreneurs who are close to those, you know, those  industries, that's where the third break really will break out.  It won't  just be -- and I think we're kind of peak silicon valley here (INAUDIBLE)  inside and people talking about peak oil.  I think we're kind of peak  silicon valley and talking about it will continue to be strong and vibrant.   We're going to see a more inclusive innovation economy and entrepreneurs  will regionalize within the United States and globalized really all around  the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you make a good point, because when you -- when you were  first, obviously, with AOL, it was a different moment in time in terms of  the internet.  We were -- we were on the doorstep of a new revolution, if  you will, but today, it's about adding on to that.  It's about really  different stool -- different legs to the stool.</p><p>CASE:  And integrating it.  Something like Smart Cities.  I was in Columbus  a couple of weeks ago to get another Rise of the Rest tour to Ohio and  Indiana and Michigan states like that.  Columbus won the Smart City's  challenge.  They've got $50 million from the government to match that with  $500 million and they're trying to create a model of Smart City which is  exciting.  </p><p>But, it's not just about the technology, it's not just about the software,  how do you partner with other companies, G.E. and IBM, some of the biggest  companies in the world, are partnering with the start-ups to create Smart  Cities and how do you deal with some of the policies?  Is there some tough  privacy big brother issues, risk around cyberterrorism bringing down some  of these Smart Cities, so that third wave innovation is not going to just  going to be about coding and writing software and apps.  </p><p>It's going to be really dealing with some of the most fundamental aspects  of our lives, how we stay healthy, how we move around cities and doing - that in partnership with other companies and understanding growing  importance of policy and therefore, you have to interact and engage with  government which entrepreneurs generally are resistant of doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this part of the discussion on your panel today?  You're  here, you're going to be doing a panel, the world in 2030, creating value  with the next generation which Richard Branson and David Bonderman.</p><p>CASE:  Yes.  That's really talking about what's happening in the next 10 or  20 years.  I will talk a lot about a third wave and why it's going to  require a different, kind of, approached entrepreneurship.  We'll talk  about it the Rise of the Rest, and how we're trying to encourage more  entrepreneurship in more parts of the country, more parts of the world.   We're also talking about impact investing.  </p><p>We are hearing that theme at this conference and having business not just  focused on profit, but also focus on purpose to having a broader impact  that's resonating a lot of people -- young people who want to work for  companies that stand for more than short-term profit, do business with  companies as well as invest in those companies.  So, the third wave  innovation will be a big thing, the rise of the rest and more regional  entrepreneurship and impact investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's really interesting that so many large technology  companies have investment arms and they're acquiring some of these start- ups, you know, those companies that don't want to go public because they  don't want to deal with the regulatory environment, you've got the arm of  Google, an arm -- an investment arm in Amazon, buying up some of these  companies.</p><p>CASE:  Which is actually great, a good way for them to drive forward and  innovate some of the most interesting businesses now, that something like  Google has android or things like that came through acquisition.  And a  great example that I saw two weeks ago in Indianapolis, sales acquired a  company they called exact target for nearly $3 billion.  They've now  doubled the size were exact target for nearly$3 billion.  </p><p>They've now doubled the size of that company, it's now 2,000 employees in  downtown Indianapolis and the founder Scott Dorsey has gone on to start a  venture fund and invest in the next generation of companies in  Indianapolis.  Look, everybody thinks the sales worth is a Silicon Valley  company, and it is, their second largest outside of California is now  Indianapolis.  And that's what a perfect example of this idea to have Rise  the Rest.  </p><p>There's more cities that are rising, the brain drain where people leaving  those cities are slowing, there's a boomerang of talent.  We just need to  follow with the venture capital.  I think we can do to get more capital in  hands and more entrepreneurs doing more interesting things in this third  wave, will result in a much more inclusive innovation economy.  We'll have  a country where everybody feels optimistic about the future, not fearful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is really fascinating.  You're absolutely right.  Steve, I  will be watching that panel.  Thank you so much.</p><p>CASE:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you today, Steve Case joining us there.  Coming  up, Twitters big reveal, the social media company says that it will become  more clear when it comes to who is posting political ads on the platform,  in the wake of the surge or fake news during the last election.  Plus, more  big earnings out this morning, including Walgreens, does the healthcare  debate affecting the company?  We will bring It to you, next, back in a  moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live this  morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  We are watching major changes here in  Saudi; we're also watching markets, of course, that is expected to open  fractionally lower this morning.  We'll see what happens after the earnings  come out because that will likely dictate the numbers.  </p><p>General Dynamics is one to watch today.  The company is set to report  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts are  expecting earnings of $2.44 a share.  The stock is up more than 40 percent  over the last year.  A pretty-good looking chart on General Dynamics.  </p><p>Meanwhile, another name, SiriusXM, the broadcasting company also set to  report its third-quarter earnings this morning.  The analysis there --  analysts expecting earnings of four cents a share.  Shares of SiriusXM are  up nearly 30 percent this year.  </p><p>NASA, meanwhile, releasing satellite photo which revealed the destruction  caused by massive wildfires across Northern California.  It's just  incredible photos.  Cheryl Casone with all the details right now in New  York, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Maria and these pictures are incredible.  This NASA image  we're going to show, you could see that the vegetation is in red, burned  areas appear dark gray.  More than 8,000 homes have burned in dozens of  wildfires in Northern California.  Firefighters are still trying to fully  contain these fires; 42 people have been killed.  </p><p>Well, Twitter says it will make its ads more transparent in an attempt to  stay ahead of potential regulation.  The company says people and groups  that advertise on Twitter are going to be listed on Web site which will  include details like how long the ads have been running.  Remember Russian- backed accounts planted ads on Twitter and Facebook in an effort to  influence the 2016 presidential election.  Shares of Twitter up about six  percent so far, this year.</p><p>Well, Amazon Prime is now available for businesses.  The service started  for companies who want free two-day shipping for certain things.  So far,  it's only available to businesses that are based here in the United States  or Germany.  Companies are going to be charged annual fees based on the  size of the company.  Shares of Amazon, though, under pressure a little  bit, down a quarter percent in the premarket.  </p><p>Well, the heat was on, literally, in Los Angeles last night.  The  temperature hit 103 for day one of the World Series, making it the hottest  ever.  No sweat though for the Dodgers, Chris Taylor smacking home run off  the first pitch and the bottom of the first, giving Dodgers the early 1-0  lead.  There it is.  Clayton Kershaw, masterful, by the way, for the  Dodgers; he erased all the postseason demons.  And then, the big blow  coming from Justin Turner.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Turner lost a fly ball to left, it's hit pretty well.  And it's  gone!  The two-run shot, Justin Turner!  Dodger stadium erupts as they take  a 3-1 lead here in the sixth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Turner already has four homers this post-season.   Dodgers went on to beat Astros 3-1.  And then, check this out: Yasiel Puig  showing his true colors on his head.  Before the game, he prepared himself  for the series by dying his hair, his Mohawk, anyway, a special color.   Here's what it looks like.  We'll show the big reveal -- yes, it's pure  Dodger blue, Maria.  So, big night in L.A.  Another game tonight, by the  way, we should add.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you.  I don't know, I've heard of  highlights, Dagen McDowell.  But blue?  I don't know that's a new one. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, on the T.V., it looks Vikings purple.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, CHAIR, BUSINESS AND FINANCE PROGRAM AT THE KING'S COLLEGE:   I like that.</p><p>(LAUGHER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think you have to actually bleach your hair white first, like,  white, white, white.  Then -- and then, put the color on it to make it look  like that.  Although, I -- yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To get just the right color.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Not that I know anything about hair dye.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about earnings.  I know you've Lindsey sitting  there.  I don't know what you're looking at, Lindsey, as far as more  important this earnings period, but what's it looking like so far?  When we  spoke last week, you said that the overall earnings expectation was profit  growth of four percent, not so hot, are they exceeding the number?  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Yes, well, earnings  growth now is looking at three percent.  I used the S&amp;P capital consensus  estimate, so that's come down.  G.E. had a lot to do with that.  There is  weak number on Friday.  There's a huge weight in the index, so I'm looking  forward to hearing more from these industrial and aerospace companies  today.  We'll get some big tech giants tomorrow.  And that's going to be  huge because those stocks have run off into the report.  It could be a  challenging quarter for them to see the stocks continue after that report.   But the important thing is that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, we've got dossier -- yes? Go ahead, Lindsey.  </p><p>BELL: -- the topline sales are beating 71 percent of companies, that's  huge.  Usually, 55 percent beat, so that's a good sign for corporate  America.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, we've got to talk about the other major story.  We'll  take a short break.  When we come back, that's on the document -- maybe we  should start calling it the Clinton dossier, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live from  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia today.  We want to look at investment happening here  and across the world.  We kick it off right now in Washington.  Yesterday,  President Trump reportedly had Republican leadership cast an informal vote  between Jerome Powell and John Taylor for the said chair vacancy, coming in  a few months.  Reportedly, Taylor came as the winner.  Brian Brenberg,  let's talk about this.  Because when I sat down with the president at the  end of last week, he really did narrow it down to Taylor and Powell.  But  our sources say that when he asked the leadership: who would like to see  John Taylor as head of the Fed, it was almost unanimous.  They all raised  their hand.  What do you know? </p><p>BRENBERG:  Well, John Taylor is very well-known in those circles.  But I  think this is an interesting question because if the president goes with  Taylor, the question is: will Taylor do what everyone thinks Taylor will  do, which is raise rates much more quickly than the Janet Yellen Fed has  done.  That could really move markets, Maria.  So, this is a big question.   Now, others say, look, even if Taylor ends up in this role, once you get  into the seat, you moderate your views just a little bit because now you're  actually in a decision-making role.  So, there's a big question there.  And  I think that's going to create some uncertainty in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that the markets, given the kind of jubilant market that  you've seen are not factoring in the potential unknown of a new Fed chief.   And again, you get into this guessing game as Brian was pointing out: who  would do what?  Again, Kevin Warsh's name was out there, earlier this week.   J. Powell, J. Powell is going to be more like Janet Yellen.  Is it going to  be Janet Yellen?  But if you get a new name in there, particularly John  Taylor, you'll go to have potentially months of uncertainty.  I think that  that maybe not cause a market crash, but it could cause a lot of volatility  that you are not seeing today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, and what Brian said, you know, here's a guy who has  voiced, you know, his feeling that rates have to be much higher, John  Taylor has said it.  But, you know, when I asked the president who'd he  wanted to see running the Fed, he said, well, I'm looking at Taylor and I'm  looking at Powell.  So, he basically said, you know, I mean, he didn't  mention Gary Cohn, he didn't mention Kevin Warsh.  But you're right, those  are two very different people in terms of their approach to interest rates.   And we don't know, Lindsey, if the whole experiment is going to work  whereas as they're winding down the balance sheet $4.5 trillion, and how  disrupted that could be to markets.  Meanwhile, so far, earnings have been  the story in terms of driving market action.  </p><p>BELL:  Right.  And I think when it comes to the Fed chair, it's going to  be: what does Trump want higher rates or lower rates?  It's going to be  something to watch.  Earnings, so far, though, are supporting the market  right now.  One thing I will say is we've seen 2018 estimates, 12 percent  growth.  It hasn't moved too much, and while that doesn't include any  reform in there, it'll be interesting -- the reform is priced into the  market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's 12 percent profit growth, Lindsey, for 2018?  </p><p>BELL:  Correct.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  We'll be right back, much more from the Future Investment  Initiative here in Riyadh.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Wednesday to you.  It is Wednesday,  October 25th.  Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jeff Flake is out, the Arizona senator says that he will not run for  reelection when his term expires next year just like his Tennessee  colleague, Bob Corker.  Flake blamed \"outrageous and undignified behavior\"  by President Trump as the reason behind this decision.  The White House was  quick to respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The  president is focused on doing this.  He went to the Hill and met with  republican senators to talk about tax reform, to push his legislative  agendas.</p><p>The voters of these individual senator states are speaking in pretty loud  volumes.  I think that they were not likely to be reelected and I think  that shows that the support is more behind this president than it is those  two individuals.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The decisions come as the GOP pushes for tax reform.  The  commander-in-chief himself made an appearance on Capitol Hill yesterday to  rally the party to get this done.  </p><p>Speaker of the House Paul Ryan also weighed in insisting that the tensions  would not hurt the effort.</p><p>Meanwhile, a little bit of earnings blitz on Wall Street, among the top  names reporting earnings today, Boeing and Coca Cola.  We will bring you  the analysis and the numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  Tell you how  they may impact markets.</p><p>The meantime markets are flat right now, Futures indicating a flat opening  at the start of trading, DOW Industrial down about four points, Nasdaq down  about 10 points as you see there.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are mixed, similar story there.  Take a look as we get  earnings streaming now, we're going to run it on the tape there.   Indications here, FTSE100 is down 15 points, the CAC Krones in Paris is up  12, and the DAX Index right around breakeven.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher as you see here with the  exception of the Nikkei Average in Japan pulling back by half of one  percent.</p><p>Bank rolling controversy, the salacious dossier that target President Trump  during the election now we find out reportedly funded in part by the  Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.  More on the  shocking news claims just ahead this morning.</p><p>Total devastation, new satellite images from NASA revealing the extent of  the immense damage left behind by the California wildfires, we've got that  for you.</p><p>And batter up, we've got all the highlights as the World Series gets  underway in Los Angeles.  All that coming up.</p><p>Plus, I am coming to you live this morning from Saudi Arabia once again.   I'm live, day two of the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh this  morning.  A lot happening.  People are praising his royal highness, the  crowned prince, of course yesterday.</p><p>You saw my panel when I spoke with the crown prince about what he's trying  to do opening up the country to foreign investment, as well allowing women  to drive, that doesn't sound radical to us but it's certainly is a radical  idea here in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In fact, this crowned prince is not afraid to attack the issues that are  important to the world.  He is trying to reduce extremism in Saudi Arabia  to less than five percent in the next two to three years.  </p><p>Apparently it is some 20 percent which is what we're hearing.  He's got the  investment fund called the PIF, he's seeking return of between six and nine  percent annually.  He's looking at six pools of investment and hoping to  get the overall value of the fund up $2 trillion by 2030.</p><p>In fact, they're saying behind closed doors it's a joke that it's $2  trillion, we're actually looking to even exceed $2 trillion.  We know that  the Saudis gave Softbank and their vision fund $45 billion, that's $45  billion of the $100 billion of that Softbank fund which is investing in  technology so aggressively.</p><p>That's one of the sources of revenue for the PIF here, that fund.  Also  they have invested with the Blackstone Group, a big infrastructure fund, so  they're looking to invest in infrastructure around the world.</p><p>They're also hoping to privatize things here in Saudi Arabia.  They want to  privatize the rail system, the airports, lot of infrastructure that they're  expecting to also bring big returns.  They're talking about oil prices that  they just cannot rely on the price of oil, where it is right now.</p><p>So they're looking to diversify.  Real fundamental change happening in  Saudi Arabia, I can't tell you what I've learned enough here that there is  serious change happening here in Saudi Arabia and that is why you have so  many big hitters from across the world here trying to get a piece of this  action.</p><p>It's another big day of exclusive news making interviews this morning.   Among the big names I'll be speaking with coming up, Treasury Secretary  Steven MNuchin is with me today.  The CEO of Blackstone Group, Steve  Schwarzman. </p><p>EY Global Chairman and CEO, Mark Weinberger.  The CEO of the London Stock  Exchange, Xavier Rolet is here.  And Revolution Chairman and CEO, Steve  Case.</p><p>And joining from New York this morning is Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell.  CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  And Business and  Economics Professor of the King's College, Brian Brenberg.  Good morning  everybody, great to see you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, KING'S COLLEGE PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS:  Good  morning.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, CFRA INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lots to talk about Dagen.  What's on your agenda?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That Hillary Clinton and her team and the DNC were behind that  controversial discredited dossier put together.  I hope they own it and I  hope the hammer comes down on everybody associated with the dossier put  together against President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible Dagen.  How long have we been saying on this  program collusion between the Trump Administration and the Russians does  not exist.  And here we are looking at this other collusion with the  democrats.  It's just outrageous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Your compass on this story from its first breath, everything to  do with Russia and Hillary Clinton, her campaign and the DNC, you have been  spot on from moment one and I can't reiterate that enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  We've got a lot to talk about this morning.  </p><p>Our top story right now, a Republican Party feud on Capitol Hill, two  senators taking aim at President Trump.  The president renewing his attacks  against Bob Corker after the Tennessee senator said that the White House  should leave it to Congress to decide how to pay for the tax cuts.  Corker  fired back questioning his own support for the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The beginning of the administration you supported the  president, do you regret that now?</p><p>BOB CORKER (R-TN):  Well, what do you think?  Like if -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that's a yes.</p><p>CORKER:  I think people -- like I think there were many people, I was one  of those that hope that he would rise to the occasion as president and he  aspire to lead our nation instead of dividing it.  And it's obvious his  political model and governing model is to divide.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Arizona Senator Jeff Flake announcing that he will  not seek reelection next year.  Flake have been facing a tough race after  repeatedly criticizing President Trump.  </p><p>Announcing his decision on the Senate floor, Flake echoed Corker once again  slamming the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA:  Reckless, outrageous and undignified  behavior has become excused and countenanced as tone it like it is when it  is actually just reckless, outrageous, and undignified.  </p><p>And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government it is  something else, it is dangerous to a democracy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Paul Ryan insisted  that these tensions going on would not hurt efforts to pass tax reform.   Something the president echoed when I sat down with him late last week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I don't think it changes our  efforts on tax reform.  I know Bob who supported the budget wants to get  tax reform, I know the president wants to get tax reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even your supporter say, \"He's got fantastic policies, we want  to see this through\" but the bickering and the feuding actually gets in the  way.  So obviously the feuding with Senator Corker, I think there's a  personal thing going on between you and Senator McCain.</p><p>Do you worry that this bickering and feuding gets in the way of your  agenda?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  No, and sometimes it helps  to be honest with you.  So we'll see what happens at the end.  But I think  actually sometimes it helps.  Sometimes it gets people to do what they're  supposed to be doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And joining me right now is special interview, Colony NorthStar  Executive Chairman, Thomas Barrack, Jr. is with me.  And Tom, it's great to  have you on the program this morning.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK, JR., EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, COLONY NORTHSTAR:  Thanks Maria,  great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Now I know that you are long  time friends, you've been an adviser to President Trump.  Do you think tax  reform can get passed even though we've got all of these fights happening?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Absolutely.  I think it's a necessity for everybody.  What  we've witnessed is not a misfire by President Trump, it's boys playing  badly in the sandbox.  </p><p>And for midterm elections, everybody just has to get on with business and  do the right thing and I think tax reform is the key to corporate  restructuring and organization, capital expenditure investment, and a  couple hundred dollars more in the average American's pocket is going to be  meaningful.  So they have to get it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think this will move the needle on economic growth?  You  think that it will do what the president is hoping it will do in terms to  create jobs?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Growth and production are the only two components that can  move the needle.  So growth is very difficult in an environment like this,  so increased production is the answer and increase investment to get that  production as a necessity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when the senators arrive for their weekly policy lunch  yesterday with the president, some of the senators apparently were ready  for show.  Watch this, got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you envision any problems at this luncheon when the  president will be there with Senator Corker?</p><p>SEN THOM TILLIS, (R) NORTH CAROLINA:  No, I don't think so.  I'm going to  bring some popcorn.  It will be interesting to watch.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator Thom Tillis tweeted out this photo as well.  According  to reports there were not any fireworks at the meeting.  So how would you  recommend, how do you advice the president here that the proceed with these  senators especially Flake and Corker while he's trying to get things done  and needs their votes?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Well I think he's proceeding with his intention, he has two  of the best individuals capable of monitoring this and Secretary MNuchin  who you're going to talk to this afternoon and Gary Cohn.</p><p>So the machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a  necessity for them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done  and to stop bickering and nobody toys with president.  He's very well  equipped to handle himself and these battles and I think it will get done  and it will get done well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think this pushback on the state and local tax  deduction is going to get in the way of passage?  Lot of people like a  Peter King, like other New Jersey and New York senators -- congressman  rather are saying, \"Look, we can't vote for this because my constituents  are going to get the tax increase.\"</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Well you're going to have concessions everywhere.  And when  you think about it, that's actually an easy thing to give away if you had  to.  So at the end of the day, the consensus of what gets done will be a  blend of those things but it will happen in the last day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom, let me ask you about the news of the day, even the  \"Washington Post\" is reporting this this morning which, of course, they are  hard press to report anything against the Clinton campaign.</p><p>But Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped  fund research that resulted in that now infamous dossier with allegations  about President Trump's connections to Russia according to sources familiar  with the matter.  What did you make of that?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  What I make of it is that the same issues that have  alienated America to drive them to elect President Trump.  Everybody's just  fed up with it all.  It's not one side or the other, we're ready for  something else.  President Trump has been that.  I think that's all it is  to say about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- you're right.  You know what, people wanted to shake  up.</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's why President Trump was voted into office because  they're sick and tired of just not understanding where the fairness is.  </p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Because there is no fairness.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Yes.  All right.  Let me turn to Colony, obviously one  of the biggest names in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein, we've been talking  about the terrible situation for the women.</p><p>More than half a dozen women now accused Weinstein of sexual assault, more  than 50 women have publicly detailed a range of inappropriate behavior by  the movie mogul, over decades by the way.  </p><p>It has been reported that your private equity arm of the company, Colony  Capital maybe par -- or may want to buy (INAUDIBLE) all of the Weinstein  Company, where does that stand right now Tom?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Well we've looked at -- if you remember, we owned Miramax  and Miramax was a Weinstein creation that Disney had on for almost a  decade.  And we bought Miramax and Disney and it was a great investment for  us.</p><p>The Weinstein Company has some of the same elements, it has a video  library, it has a TV production group, and it has a lot of great people who  work within it.  The Weinstein name is finished, Harvey's actions  regardless of what are unacceptable, inappropriate, and despicable.</p><p>And the company needed a capital gauge of clog to stop the bleeding while  you could evaluate what's left of the pieces to salvage and that's what  we've been doing.  It's still a question as to whether we'll be successful  or not but it's not a resuscitation of the Weinsteins, it's trying to  salvage the pieces of the company so the creative talent and the production  group can go forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they are good assets, they are very good assets, right?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Great assets.  I mean, regardless of what else, one of the  great independent filmmaking companies ever in history was at the hands of  the Weinsteins, that's the good news and that's the bad news.</p><p>So in an area where content is everything and the digital era is making  content even more valuable, that library harvested correctly can be of  great value.  It's separating the liabilities and the toxicity of what  happened from the good people and the good product that's within the  company and that's sometimes an art form, not a science.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The negotiation right now, is it overpriced?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  No, it's over what it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What it is, yes.  Because you just said a minute ago Weinstein  name is done, I mean how can you go on with after what has happened, it's  incredible.</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  You can.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom, good to have you on the program.</p><p>BARRACK, JR.:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom Barrack.  We'll take a break.  We're live from Saudi, next.   Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A suicide live streamed on Facebook, Cheryl  Casone with these details now, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE:  Well Maria, good morning.  Shocked viewers could not believe what  they were watching.  A distraught father in Turkey upset that his daughter  got engaged without his permission committed suicide on Facebook Live.</p><p>The violent scene unfolded as he was speaking directly into the camera  before he pulled a handgun with his left hand fired a single shot into his  temple.  Facebook has removed that video from the site.</p><p>Well President Trump allowing refugee admissions to resume under a stricter  screening rules.  This comes after the administration's 120-day ban on  refugee admissions expired yesterday.  Now, the president has also ordered  refugees from 11 countries that post higher risk to U.S. national security  to face even tougher scrutiny.  The administration hasn't identified though  yet those 11 countries.  </p><p>Well Congress voting to overturn a banking rule from the Obama  Administration that would have allowed consumers to bring class action law  suits against their bank or credit card company.  Vice President Pence cast  the final vote to break the 50-50 tie.</p><p>The banking industry was pushing hard to rollback this regulation that came  from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau years ago.  The Trump  Administration and republicans say the rule harms the free market.  The  president now expected to sign that measure into law.</p><p>Well, earnings season in full swing, Anthem is out with better than  expected third quarter adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share, of course, this  company revenue of $22 billion slighted ahead of expectations.</p><p>And then Alaska Airlines out with a profit of $2.24 a share, $0.02 below  the estimate.  The stock is down about 11 percent so far year-to-date.   There is the one year chart as well on Alaska.  </p><p>And then let's take a look at Chipotle, they came out with pretty  disappointing quarterly numbers.  Same store sales falling short of what  analyst were looking for.  The stock is lower in the premarket Maria, down  more than 10 percent from hurricanes, the consumer taste changing, to the  higher price of avocadoes.  </p><p>A lot of issues factored into these negative numbers coming out of  Chipotle.  And those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, 10 percent big move there Cheryl on the downside.  Okay,  thank you so much.  We should point out that these are just reported  earnings and revenue better than expected.  </p><p>We'll see if the stock moves on this but we've got revenue at $4.8 billion,  better than the estimate earnings as well.  Visa in the news right now.   Stock is up about two percent right now higher on Visa.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, mixed signals on healthcare after  the president ended subsidies to the insurance companies and you said that  they got rich off of ObamaCare.  How is the industry reacting?  I'll have  an exclusive interview right here in Riyadh with the CEO of Prudential  Financial, John Strangfeld coming up, that's next.</p><p>And then Amazon now giving businesses to prime treatment, two day shipping  for some deliveries, what it will cost you, that story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this  morning from the future investment initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>Over in Washington, the republican controlled Congress is still looking to  deliver win for President Trump on healthcare but Senate Majority Leader,  Mitch McConnell is putting the responsibility back on the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  What I'm waiting is  to hear from President Trump what kind of healthcare bill he might sign.   If there is a need for some kind of interim step here to stabilize the  market we need a bill, the president will actually sign.</p><p>And I'm not certain yet what the president is looking for here but I'll be  happy to bring a bill to the floor if I know President Trump would sign it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now and a FOX Business Exclusive is the CEO of  Prudential Financial, John Strangfeld.  John, it's good to see you, thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p>JOHN STRANGFELD, CEO, PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL:  Thank you.  Good to see you  too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about all this uncertainty over what the  president actually wants to replace ObamaCare with, impacting the industry  overall, uncertainty over the tax package.  </p><p>Are these pieces of legislation going to impact markets if we actually  don't see closure soon?  </p><p>STRANGFELD:  I don't see the healthcare having a big impact on that.  I  think the uncertainty around tax and what the outcome of the taxes I think  actually has a bigger impact.  And it can be linked to other public policy  objectives as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you really have to see a movement in economic growth  and you think that happens from tax reform.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  I think that can happen from tax reform and I also think  there's certain public policy objectives that are important to be reflected  in the tax reform as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about Prudential Financial for a moment, you've  changed the company obviously not a healthcare company, you've got a huge  asset management -- wealth management division, $1.2 trillion assets under  management.</p><p>How are you investing today?  How are your clients viewing this market  sentiment which obviously has been record setting?</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Well, it takes different forms in different places.  And so  for example, in our particular case, we're a large insurance company, we're  a large retirement company, and we're a large asset management.</p><p>$1.2 trillion, about two-thirds of that are institutional investors, such  as those here in the Saudi Kingdom which is partly why I'm here.  Everyone  has a different objective in terms of what they're trying to accomplish.   But many of them are apprehensive about what's going on in the marketplace  and how the returns they can achieve match up with the obligations that  they have in front of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want to ask about retirement because we just came off of  a couple of weeks of uncertainty with regard to what this administration  might do with 401K plans and finally the president comes out and says there  will be no change to your 401K.  What was your take on that?</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Well, that was a good conclusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it was.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  So if you think about this, aging population not only in U.S.  but in many countries shrinking government safety nets, corporate employers  plans are less generous than they once were and people are living longer.</p><p>So when you combine all this together, it's a big challenge for people to  maintain their quality of life in retirement.  And the more we can do to  have public policy that aligns with people's objectives of achieving that  is really, really critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you don't want any change in policy in terms of 401K?</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Absolutely not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, what -- we're already looking at a situation  where people don't have enough money in retirement.  </p><p>STRANGFELD:  They absolutely don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want to change a 401K where an employee is able to  get a match from the company.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Absolutely.  In fact, we have -- we need more incentives to  encourage people along the way.  Not only that, many people have had their  retirement risks shifted to their shoulders whether it's the savings or  whether it's the risk of knowing how long they're going to live.</p><p>None of us know whether we're going to live to 72 or 102, so it's very  difficult to know how we can save for that.  Our parents generation had a  pension check show up in the mailbox once a month.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  We don't have that today.  So people have to address that  individually which is a much harder way to manage risk.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now you're here as you just mentioned, you've got clients  obviously -- a lot of your institutional clients including the Kingdom, I  thought it was really interesting what the crowned prince has been saying  in terms of the private investment fund.</p><p>They've got six pools of capital, they're -- they gave $45 billion to  Softbank in that vision fund, they're investing in the Blackstone  infrastructure fund.  Where else do you think there's opportunity for an  international investor like the Saudi Kingdom?</p><p>Are they looking U.S., Europe, where's the attractions?</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Well what they have historically done is exported a lot of  capital.  Meaning, investments into other regions of the world, it takes  many different forms (INAUDIBLE) examples that you mentioned.</p><p>But it's interesting from what the crowned prince was talking about  yesterday is there's also going to be an added initiative, we're investing  more extensively in their domestic marketplace as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And Saudi is changing.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Yes.  Saudi is changing and what's also fascinating about his  efforts that were reflected in your moderated panel yesterday was the  desire to link public policy with those objectives in ways (INAUDIBLE)  other countries should consider replicating as well.</p><p>You have a much better prospect of achieving your objectives if public  policy is an enabler to outcomes and clearly, he's focusing on having an  enabling public policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I think it's incredible that he wants to get that Private  Investment Fund, the PIF up to above $2 trillion in assets by 2030.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Yes.  Yes, that's a big number.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  And I think it's -- I think it's actually quite achievable  given what they've done and given what they (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>And by the way, they're very long-term investors which as are we which is  what made -- we've been here for over 20 years which has made that  relationship as strong as it is, they're thinking very long-term.</p><p>But the neat thing about his, the crowned prince was his thinking around  the use of public policy to enable things that happened.  Frankly, we could  take a page out of the book in our country.  We spend so much time on  regulating versus enabling is a real opportunity there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's one of the reason that the Trump Administration has rolled  back regulation so much really.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Exactly right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John, it's good to see you. </p><p>STRANGFELD:  Nice to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>STRANGFELD:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nice to see you here in Saudi.  </p><p>STRANGFELD:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Strangfeld joining us there.  Thank you John.  </p><p>Coming up next, incredible new images of the devastating California  wildfires and they're from space.  NASA releasing the revealing pictures  and we've got them for you.  And then the L.A. Dodgers taking one of the  World Series, but the real winner may be the team's right fielder, whose  hair, well, took on Dodger blue and took it to a whole new level.  We'll  tell you about it.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of  Mornings with Maria, live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the future  investment initiative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, October  25th, happy Wednesday to you, everybody, thanks for joining me, your top  stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Mark Cuban means business.   The billionaire sits down with Fox News to talk about a possible White  House run in 2020.  How Cuban claims he would help the middle class if he  decides to take on President Trump, coming up.  Meanwhile, earnings  expected to drive markets once again.  </p><p>We are in the thick of earnings season for the third quarter, three Dow  components out before the opening bell this morning.  Coca-Cola and Boeing  are both due in the next two hours.  We will bring you the numbers as soon  as they hit the tapes.  Visa reported a moment ago, delivering solid fiscal  fourth-quarter results for visa.  The credit card company beat expectations  on both earnings and on revenue.  We are breaking down those numbers,  coming up.  The stock is already up two percent as expected to tackle on 15  points on the Dow at the open, with a two percent rally in Visa.  </p><p>Futures meanwhile, indicating a flat opening so far for the broader  averages as you can see.  European stocks are also mixed to a really flat  on the session.  Take a look at the European indices right here, and we see  the FT 100 down about 10 points and the CAC Quarante up 15, the DAX Index  in Germany up about 8.  Fractional moves there.  In Asia overnight, markets  closed mostly higher.  Take a look, as you see there, best performer, Hang  Seng in Hong Kong, up half a percent.  </p><p>California chard, NASA releasing stunning new satellite pictures revealing  the true scope of the damage left behind by the massive wildfires still  raging in the state.  Twitter getting transparent, how the company is  fighting back this morning amid revelations that Russia used social media  to meddle in the U.S. election plus, the Dodgers scorch the Astros last  night, the hottest World Series game, game one on record, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMMENTATOR:  Left field and it's deep and a wall and a turn.  It's a two- run home run.  Marwin Gonzalez runs out of room, Turner runs around the  bases and the Dodgers take a 3-1 lead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, we have the highlights from the sizzling summer-like start  to the fall classic, coming up this morning.  But first, I am live, at day  two at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this  morning.  It's another big day of exclusive interviews, news-making  interviews.  We've got huge titans from across the world coming here  because Saudi Arabia is in the midst of fundamental change.  </p><p>I will be speaking, coming up, with Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin, the  CEO of the Blackstone Group Stephen Schwarzman, EY Global Chairman and CEO  Mark Weinberger and London Stock Exchange CEO Xavier Rolet, coming up.  But  first, tax reform in the road to 2020, billionaire Mark Cuban seems to be  setting up a primary challenge to President Trump during an interview with  Fox News host Tucker Carlson last night.  Cuban slammed Trump's tax plan  and weighed in on how he would help the stagnant middle class. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK CUBAN, OWNER OF NBA'S DALLAS MAVERICKS:  The first thing I would do  rather than a tax reform we're looking at right now, a decrease payroll  taxes significantly, so that that money, instead of being -- instead of  having every hour tax as it is now, that money would go right into the  hands of the people who need it the most.  I would focus on creating  technology solutions.  I think there's a way that we can reduce the size of  government, the size of bureaucracy that deals with healthcare, but it's  going to take somebody who understands technology that can introduce  technology to find those solutions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now and the first on Fox Business interview is  Revolution CEO and Chairman, and Former CEO of AOL, Steve Case, Steve,  great to see you.</p><p>STEVE CASE, CEO AND CHAIRMAN OF REVOLUTION:  Great to be back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, so your thoughts on this,  Mark Cuban, going to run for president?</p><p>CASE:  What (INAUDIBLE) I think we have three more years to go, but I love  the fact that Mark's going to -- trying to throw some ideas out there to  help the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, so far, there's been such divisiveness in this  country.  What do you think about what the policies coming out of this  administration have been so far?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think they are trying to focus onto things like tax reform  (INAUDIBLE) get some traction.  I've talked to the President and some of  his advisors, Gary Cohn and Wilbur Ross and others about making sure that  as they look at tax reform, they -- and try to focus on simplification.   They also create the right investment in (INAUDIBLE) so entrepreneurs  particularly (INAUDIBLE) have access to Capitol, so they can start  companies and create jobs there.  </p><p>We have this growing divide in the country where a lot of innovation and  wealth creation and job creations happening in the coast.  There are a lot  of people in the country that do feel left out and left behind, so  hopefully, that would be one of the areas as tax reform moves forward.  It  will be a more inclusive innovation economy.  Last year, 75 percent of  (INAUDIBLE) went to just three states.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CASE:  And so, we need to make sure everybody, everywhere really has a shot  at the American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do you see growth?  I mean, you're really one of the  first people to get on this, sort of, longevity bandwagon, wellness  longevity with your Revolution Company.  Tell me where do you see growth in  the world today?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think the big opportunity is what I've called the third wave  of the earn, the first wave is just getting everybody connected that we  started AOL over three decades ago, only three percent of people are  online, so getting (INAUDIBLE) was the first wave.  The last 15 or 20 years  is really the second wave building apps and services on top of the  internet, Facebook and Google and so forth.  </p><p>But the third wave is just now happening, it's really integrating the  internet in seamless ways throughout healthcare and energy, food,  agriculture, transportation, smart cities, a lot of things are up for grabs  in the third wave, but I think it's going to require a different mind-set  for entrepreneurs, partnerships, companies are going to be more important,  policy, regulatory issues are going to become more important.  And I also  believe they will tie with (INAUDIBLE) the expertise and a lot of sectors  like healthcare and farming is in the middle of the country.  </p><p>So we're backing entrepreneurs who are close to those, you know, those  industries, that's where the third break really will break out.  It won't  just be -- and I think we're kind of peak silicon valley here (INAUDIBLE)  inside and people talking about peak oil.  I think we're kind of peak  silicon valley and talking about it will continue to be strong and vibrant.   We're going to see a more inclusive innovation economy and entrepreneurs  will regionalize within the United States and globalized really all around  the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you make a good point, because when you -- when you were  first, obviously, with AOL, it was a different moment in time in terms of  the internet.  We were -- we were on the doorstep of a new revolution, if  you will, but today, it's about adding on to that.  It's about really  different stool -- different legs to the stool.</p><p>CASE:  And integrating it.  Something like Smart Cities.  I was in Columbus  a couple of weeks ago to get another Rise of the Rest tour to Ohio and  Indiana and Michigan states like that.  Columbus won the Smart City's  challenge.  They've got $50 million from the government to match that with  $500 million and they're trying to create a model of Smart City which is  exciting.  </p><p>But, it's not just about the technology, it's not just about the software,  how do you partner with other companies, G.E. and IBM, some of the biggest  companies in the world, are partnering with the start-ups to create Smart  Cities and how do you deal with some of the policies?  Is there some tough  privacy big brother issues, risk around cyberterrorism bringing down some  of these Smart Cities, so that third wave innovation is not going to just  going to be about coding and writing software and apps.  </p><p>It's going to be really dealing with some of the most fundamental aspects  of our lives, how we stay healthy, how we move around cities and doing - that in partnership with other companies and understanding growing  importance of policy and therefore, you have to interact and engage with  government which entrepreneurs generally are resistant of doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this part of the discussion on your panel today?  You're  here, you're going to be doing a panel, the world in 2030, creating value  with the next generation which Richard Branson and David Bonderman.</p><p>CASE:  Yes.  That's really talking about what's happening in the next 10 or  20 years.  I will talk a lot about a third wave and why it's going to  require a different, kind of, approached entrepreneurship.  We'll talk  about it the Rise of the Rest, and how we're trying to encourage more  entrepreneurship in more parts of the country, more parts of the world.   We're also talking about impact investing.  </p><p>We are hearing that theme at this conference and having business not just  focused on profit, but also focus on purpose to having a broader impact  that's resonating a lot of people -- young people who want to work for  companies that stand for more than short-term profit, do business with  companies as well as invest in those companies.  So, the third wave  innovation will be a big thing, the rise of the rest and more regional  entrepreneurship and impact investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's really interesting that so many large technology  companies have investment arms and they're acquiring some of these start- ups, you know, those companies that don't want to go public because they  don't want to deal with the regulatory environment, you've got the arm of  Google, an arm -- an investment arm in Amazon, buying up some of these  companies.</p><p>CASE:  Which is actually great, a good way for them to drive forward and  innovate some of the most interesting businesses now, that something like  Google has android or things like that came through acquisition.  And a  great example that I saw two weeks ago in Indianapolis, sales acquired a  company they called exact target for nearly $3 billion.  They've now  doubled the size were exact target for nearly$3 billion.  </p><p>They've now doubled the size of that company, it's now 2,000 employees in  downtown Indianapolis and the founder Scott Dorsey has gone on to start a  venture fund and invest in the next generation of companies in  Indianapolis.  Look, everybody thinks the sales worth is a Silicon Valley  company, and it is, their second largest outside of California is now  Indianapolis.  And that's what a perfect example of this idea to have Rise  the Rest.  </p><p>There's more cities that are rising, the brain drain where people leaving  those cities are slowing, there's a boomerang of talent.  We just need to  follow with the venture capital.  I think we can do to get more capital in  hands and more entrepreneurs doing more interesting things in this third  wave, will result in a much more inclusive innovation economy.  We'll have  a country where everybody feels optimistic about the future, not fearful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is really fascinating.  You're absolutely right.  Steve, I  will be watching that panel.  Thank you so much.</p><p>CASE:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you today, Steve Case joining us there.  Coming  up, Twitters big reveal, the social media company says that it will become  more clear when it comes to who is posting political ads on the platform,  in the wake of the surge or fake news during the last election.  Plus, more  big earnings out this morning, including Walgreens, does the healthcare  debate affecting the company?  We will bring It to you, next, back in a  moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live this  morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  We are watching major changes here in  Saudi; we're also watching markets, of course, that is expected to open  fractionally lower this morning.  We'll see what happens after the earnings  come out because that will likely dictate the numbers.  </p><p>General Dynamics is one to watch today.  The company is set to report  third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning.  Analysts are  expecting earnings of $2.44 a share.  The stock is up more than 40 percent  over the last year.  A pretty-good looking chart on General Dynamics.  </p><p>Meanwhile, another name, SiriusXM, the broadcasting company also set to  report its third-quarter earnings this morning.  The analysis there --  analysts expecting earnings of four cents a share.  Shares of SiriusXM are  up nearly 30 percent this year.  </p><p>NASA, meanwhile, releasing satellite photo which revealed the destruction  caused by massive wildfires across Northern California.  It's just  incredible photos.  Cheryl Casone with all the details right now in New  York, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Maria and these pictures are incredible.  This NASA image  we're going to show, you could see that the vegetation is in red, burned  areas appear dark gray.  More than 8,000 homes have burned in dozens of  wildfires in Northern California.  Firefighters are still trying to fully  contain these fires; 42 people have been killed.  </p><p>Well, Twitter says it will make its ads more transparent in an attempt to  stay ahead of potential regulation.  The company says people and groups  that advertise on Twitter are going to be listed on Web site which will  include details like how long the ads have been running.  Remember Russian- backed accounts planted ads on Twitter and Facebook in an effort to  influence the 2016 presidential election.  Shares of Twitter up about six  percent so far, this year.</p><p>Well, Amazon Prime is now available for businesses.  The service started  for companies who want free two-day shipping for certain things.  So far,  it's only available to businesses that are based here in the United States  or Germany.  Companies are going to be charged annual fees based on the  size of the company.  Shares of Amazon, though, under pressure a little  bit, down a quarter percent in the premarket.  </p><p>Well, the heat was on, literally, in Los Angeles last night.  The  temperature hit 103 for day one of the World Series, making it the hottest  ever.  No sweat though for the Dodgers, Chris Taylor smacking home run off  the first pitch and the bottom of the first, giving Dodgers the early 1-0  lead.  There it is.  Clayton Kershaw, masterful, by the way, for the  Dodgers; he erased all the postseason demons.  And then, the big blow  coming from Justin Turner.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Turner lost a fly ball to left, it's hit pretty well.  And it's  gone!  The two-run shot, Justin Turner!  Dodger stadium erupts as they take  a 3-1 lead here in the sixth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Turner already has four homers this post-season.   Dodgers went on to beat Astros 3-1.  And then, check this out: Yasiel Puig  showing his true colors on his head.  Before the game, he prepared himself  for the series by dying his hair, his Mohawk, anyway, a special color.   Here's what it looks like.  We'll show the big reveal -- yes, it's pure  Dodger blue, Maria.  So, big night in L.A.  Another game tonight, by the  way, we should add.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you.  I don't know, I've heard of  highlights, Dagen McDowell.  But blue?  I don't know that's a new one. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, on the T.V., it looks Vikings purple.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, CHAIR, BUSINESS AND FINANCE PROGRAM AT THE KING'S COLLEGE:   I like that.</p><p>(LAUGHER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think you have to actually bleach your hair white first, like,  white, white, white.  Then -- and then, put the color on it to make it look  like that.  Although, I -- yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To get just the right color.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  Not that I know anything about hair dye.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about earnings.  I know you've Lindsey sitting  there.  I don't know what you're looking at, Lindsey, as far as more  important this earnings period, but what's it looking like so far?  When we  spoke last week, you said that the overall earnings expectation was profit  growth of four percent, not so hot, are they exceeding the number?  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Yes, well, earnings  growth now is looking at three percent.  I used the S&amp;P capital consensus  estimate, so that's come down.  G.E. had a lot to do with that.  There is  weak number on Friday.  There's a huge weight in the index, so I'm looking  forward to hearing more from these industrial and aerospace companies  today.  We'll get some big tech giants tomorrow.  And that's going to be  huge because those stocks have run off into the report.  It could be a  challenging quarter for them to see the stocks continue after that report.   But the important thing is that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, we've got dossier -- yes? Go ahead, Lindsey.  </p><p>BELL: -- the topline sales are beating 71 percent of companies, that's  huge.  Usually, 55 percent beat, so that's a good sign for corporate  America.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, we've got to talk about the other major story.  We'll  take a short break.  When we come back, that's on the document -- maybe we  should start calling it the Clinton dossier, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live from  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia today.  We want to look at investment happening here  and across the world.  We kick it off right now in Washington.  Yesterday,  President Trump reportedly had Republican leadership cast an informal vote  between Jerome Powell and John Taylor for the said chair vacancy, coming in  a few months.  Reportedly, Taylor came as the winner.  Brian Brenberg,  let's talk about this.  Because when I sat down with the president at the  end of last week, he really did narrow it down to Taylor and Powell.  But  our sources say that when he asked the leadership: who would like to see  John Taylor as head of the Fed, it was almost unanimous.  They all raised  their hand.  What do you know? </p><p>BRENBERG:  Well, John Taylor is very well-known in those circles.  But I  think this is an interesting question because if the president goes with  Taylor, the question is: will Taylor do what everyone thinks Taylor will  do, which is raise rates much more quickly than the Janet Yellen Fed has  done.  That could really move markets, Maria.  So, this is a big question.   Now, others say, look, even if Taylor ends up in this role, once you get  into the seat, you moderate your views just a little bit because now you're  actually in a decision-making role.  So, there's a big question there.  And  I think that's going to create some uncertainty in the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that the markets, given the kind of jubilant market that  you've seen are not factoring in the potential unknown of a new Fed chief.   And again, you get into this guessing game as Brian was pointing out: who  would do what?  Again, Kevin Warsh's name was out there, earlier this week.   J. Powell, J. Powell is going to be more like Janet Yellen.  Is it going to  be Janet Yellen?  But if you get a new name in there, particularly John  Taylor, you'll go to have potentially months of uncertainty.  I think that  that maybe not cause a market crash, but it could cause a lot of volatility  that you are not seeing today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, and what Brian said, you know, here's a guy who has  voiced, you know, his feeling that rates have to be much higher, John  Taylor has said it.  But, you know, when I asked the president who'd he  wanted to see running the Fed, he said, well, I'm looking at Taylor and I'm  looking at Powell.  So, he basically said, you know, I mean, he didn't  mention Gary Cohn, he didn't mention Kevin Warsh.  But you're right, those  are two very different people in terms of their approach to interest rates.   And we don't know, Lindsey, if the whole experiment is going to work  whereas as they're winding down the balance sheet $4.5 trillion, and how  disrupted that could be to markets.  Meanwhile, so far, earnings have been  the story in terms of driving market action.  </p><p>BELL:  Right.  And I think when it comes to the Fed chair, it's going to  be: what does Trump want higher rates or lower rates?  It's going to be  something to watch.  Earnings, so far, though, are supporting the market  right now.  One thing I will say is we've seen 2018 estimates, 12 percent  growth.  It hasn't moved too much, and while that doesn't include any  reform in there, it'll be interesting -- the reform is priced into the  market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's 12 percent profit growth, Lindsey, for 2018?  </p><p>BELL:  Correct.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  We'll be right back, much more from the Future Investment  Initiative here in Riyadh.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo, </nameText></person>happy Wednesday to you. It is Wednesday, October 25th. Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Jeff Flake </nameText></person>is out, the Arizona senator says that he will not run for reelection when his term expires next year just like his Tennessee colleague, <person><nameText>Bob Corker. </nameText></person>Flake blamed \"outrageous and undignified behavior\" by <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>as the reason behind this decision. The White House was quick to respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president is focused on doing this. He went to the Hill and met with republican senators to talk about tax reform, to push his legislative agendas.</p><p>The voters of these individual senator states are speaking in pretty loud volumes. I think that they were not likely to be reelected and I think that shows that the support is more behind this president than it is those two individuals.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The decisions come as the GOP pushes for tax reform. The commander-in-chief himself made an appearance on Capitol Hill yesterday to rally the party to get this done.</p><p>Speaker of the House <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>also weighed in insisting that the tensions would not hurt the effort.</p><p>Meanwhile, a little bit of earnings blitz on Wall Street, among the top names reporting earnings today, Boeing and Coca Cola. We will bring you the analysis and the numbers as soon as they hit the tape. Tell you how they may impact markets.</p><p>The meantime markets are flat right now, Futures indicating a flat opening at the start of trading, DOW Industrial down about four points, Nasdaq down about 10 points as you see there.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are mixed, similar story there. Take a look as we get earnings streaming now, we're going to run it on the tape there. Indications here, FTSE100 is down 15 points, the CAC Krones in Paris is up 12, and the DAX Index right around breakeven.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly higher as you see here with the exception of the Nikkei Average in Japan pulling back by half of one percent.</p><p>Bank rolling controversy, the salacious dossier that target <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>during the election now we find out reportedly funded in part by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. More on the shocking news claims just ahead this morning.</p><p>Total devastation, new satellite images from NASA revealing the extent of the immense damage left behind by the California wildfires, we've got that for you.</p><p>And batter up, we've got all the highlights as the World Series gets underway in Los Angeles. All that coming up.</p><p>Plus, I am coming to you live this morning from Saudi Arabia once again. I'm live, day two of the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh this morning. A lot happening. People are praising his royal highness, the crowned prince, of course yesterday.</p><p>You saw my panel when I spoke with the crown prince about what he's trying to do opening up the country to foreign investment, as well allowing women to drive, that doesn't sound radical to us but it's certainly is a radical idea here in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In fact, this crowned prince is not afraid to attack the issues that are important to the world. He is trying to reduce extremism in Saudi Arabia to less than five percent in the next two to three years.</p><p>Apparently it is some 20 percent which is what we're hearing. He's got the investment fund called the PIF, he's seeking return of between six and nine percent annually. He's looking at six pools of investment and hoping to get the overall value of the fund up $2 trillion by 2030.</p><p>In fact, they're saying behind closed doors it's a joke that it's $2 trillion, we're actually looking to even exceed $2 trillion. We know that the Saudis gave Softbank and their vision fund $45 billion, that's $45 billion of the $100 billion of that Softbank fund which is investing in technology so aggressively.</p><p>That's one of the sources of revenue for the PIF here, that fund. Also they have invested with the Blackstone Group, a big infrastructure fund, so they're looking to invest in infrastructure around the world.</p><p>They're also hoping to privatize things here in Saudi Arabia. They want to privatize the rail system, the airports, lot of infrastructure that they're expecting to also bring big returns. They're talking about oil prices that they just cannot rely on the price of oil, where it is right now.</p><p>So they're looking to diversify. Real fundamental change happening in Saudi Arabia, I can't tell you what I've learned enough here that there is serious change happening here in Saudi Arabia and that is why you have so many big hitters from across the world here trying to get a piece of this action.</p><p>It's another big day of exclusive news making interviews this morning. Among the big names I'll be speaking with coming up, Treasury Secretary Steven MNuchin is with me today. The CEO of Blackstone Group, Steve Schwarzman.</p><p>EY Global Chairman and CEO, Mark Weinberger. The CEO of the London Stock Exchange, Xavier Rolet is here. And Revolution Chairman and CEO, Steve Case.</p><p>And joining from New York this morning is Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell. CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell. And Business and Economics Professor of the King's College, Brian Brenberg. Good morning everybody, great to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Great to see you Maria.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, KING'S COLLEGE PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS: Good morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, CFRA INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lots to talk about Dagen. What's on your agenda?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That Hillary Clinton and her team and the DNC were behind that controversial discredited dossier put together. I hope they own it and I hope the hammer comes down on everybody associated with the dossier put together against <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>BARTIROMO: It's incredible Dagen. How long have we been saying on this program collusion between the Trump Administration and the Russians does not exist. And here we are looking at this other collusion with the democrats. It's just outrageous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Your compass on this story from its first breath, everything to do with Russia and Hillary Clinton, her campaign and the DNC, you have been spot on from moment one and I can't reiterate that enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. We've got a lot to talk about this morning.</p><p>Our top story right now, a Republican Party feud on Capitol Hill, two senators taking aim at <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>The president renewing his attacks against <person><nameText>Bob Corker </nameText></person>after the Tennessee senator said that the White House should leave it to Congress to decide how to pay for the tax cuts. Corker fired back questioning his own support for the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The beginning of the administration you supported the president, do you regret that now?</p><p><person><nameText>BOB CORKER </nameText></person>(R-TN): Well, what do you think? Like if --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that's a yes.</p><p>CORKER: I think people -- like I think there were many people, I was one of those that hope that he would rise to the occasion as president and he aspire to lead our nation instead of dividing it. And it's obvious his political model and governing model is to divide.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Arizona Senator <person><nameText>Jeff Flake </nameText></person>announcing that he will not seek reelection next year. Flake have been facing a tough race after repeatedly criticizing <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>Announcing his decision on the Senate floor, Flake echoed Corker once again slamming the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JEFF FLAKE, </nameText></person>(R) ARIZONA: Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as tone it like it is when it is actually just reckless, outrageous, and undignified.</p><p>And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government it is something else, it is dangerous to a democracy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, House Speaker <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>insisted that these tensions going on would not hurt efforts to pass tax reform. Something the president echoed when I sat down with him late last week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>PAUL RYAN, </nameText></person>(R-WI) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I don't think it changes our efforts on tax reform. I know Bob who supported the budget wants to get tax reform, I know the president wants to get tax reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even your supporter say, \"He's got fantastic policies, we want to see this through\" but the bickering and the feuding actually gets in the way. So obviously the feuding with Senator Corker, I think there's a personal thing going on between you and Senator McCain.</p><p>Do you worry that this bickering and feuding gets in the way of your agenda?</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, and sometimes it helps to be honest with you. So we'll see what happens at the end. But I think actually sometimes it helps. Sometimes it gets people to do what they're supposed to be doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And joining me right now is special interview, Colony NorthStar Executive Chairman, Thomas Barrack, Jr. is with me. And Tom, it's great to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>THOMAS BARRACK, JR., EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, COLONY NORTHSTAR: Thanks Maria, great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Now I know that you are long time friends, you've been an adviser to <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>Do you think tax reform can get passed even though we've got all of these fights happening?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: Absolutely. I think it's a necessity for everybody. What we've witnessed is not a misfire by <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>it's boys playing badly in the sandbox.</p><p>And for midterm elections, everybody just has to get on with business and do the right thing and I think tax reform is the key to corporate restructuring and organization, capital expenditure investment, and a couple hundred dollars more in the average American's pocket is going to be meaningful. So they have to get it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you think this will move the needle on economic growth? You think that it will do what the president is hoping it will do in terms to create jobs?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: Growth and production are the only two components that can move the needle. So growth is very difficult in an environment like this, so increased production is the answer and increase investment to get that production as a necessity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So when the senators arrive for their weekly policy lunch yesterday with the president, some of the senators apparently were ready for show. Watch this, got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you envision any problems at this luncheon when the president will be there with Senator Corker?</p><p>SEN THOM TILLIS, (R) NORTH CAROLINA: No, I don't think so. I'm going to bring some popcorn. It will be interesting to watch.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator Thom Tillis tweeted out this photo as well. According to reports there were not any fireworks at the meeting. So how would you recommend, how do you advice the president here that the proceed with these senators especially Flake and Corker while he's trying to get things done and needs their votes?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: Well I think he's proceeding with his intention, he has two of the best individuals capable of monitoring this and Secretary MNuchin who you're going to talk to this afternoon and Gary Cohn.</p><p>So the machinery is working and these politicians know that it's a necessity for them on behalf of their constituencies to get something done and to stop bickering and nobody toys with president. He's very well equipped to handle himself and these battles and I think it will get done and it will get done well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you don't think this pushback on the state and local tax deduction is going to get in the way of passage? Lot of people like a Peter King, like other New Jersey and New York senators -- congressman rather are saying, \"Look, we can't vote for this because my constituents are going to get the tax increase.\"</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: Well you're going to have concessions everywhere. And when you think about it, that's actually an easy thing to give away if you had to. So at the end of the day, the consensus of what gets done will be a blend of those things but it will happen in the last day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom, let me ask you about the news of the day, even the \"Washington Post\" is reporting this this morning which, of course, they are hard press to report anything against the Clinton campaign.</p><p>But Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in that now infamous dossier with allegations about <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>connections to Russia according to sources familiar with the matter. What did you make of that?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: What I make of it is that the same issues that have alienated America to drive them to elect <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>Everybody's just fed up with it all. It's not one side or the other, we're ready for something else. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has been that. I think that's all it is to say about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's -- you're right. You know what, people wanted to shake up.</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: Totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's why <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>was voted into office because they're sick and tired of just not understanding where the fairness is.</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: Because there is no fairness.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Yes. All right. Let me turn to Colony, obviously one of the biggest names in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein, we've been talking about the terrible situation for the women.</p><p>More than half a dozen women now accused Weinstein of sexual assault, more than 50 women have publicly detailed a range of inappropriate behavior by the movie mogul, over decades by the way.</p><p>It has been reported that your private equity arm of the company, Colony Capital maybe par -- or may want to buy (INAUDIBLE) all of the Weinstein Company, where does that stand right now Tom?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: Well we've looked at -- if you remember, we owned Miramax and Miramax was a Weinstein creation that Disney had on for almost a decade. And we bought Miramax and Disney and it was a great investment for us.</p><p>The Weinstein Company has some of the same elements, it has a video library, it has a TV production group, and it has a lot of great people who work within it. The Weinstein name is finished, Harvey's actions regardless of what are unacceptable, inappropriate, and despicable.</p><p>And the company needed a capital gauge of clog to stop the bleeding while you could evaluate what's left of the pieces to salvage and that's what we've been doing. It's still a question as to whether we'll be successful or not but it's not a resuscitation of the Weinsteins, it's trying to salvage the pieces of the company so the creative talent and the production group can go forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because they are good assets, they are very good assets, right?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: Great assets. I mean, regardless of what else, one of the great independent filmmaking companies ever in history was at the hands of the Weinsteins, that's the good news and that's the bad news.</p><p>So in an area where content is everything and the digital era is making content even more valuable, that library harvested correctly can be of great value. It's separating the liabilities and the toxicity of what happened from the good people and the good product that's within the company and that's sometimes an art form, not a science.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The negotiation right now, is it overpriced?</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: No, it's over what it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What it is, yes. Because you just said a minute ago Weinstein name is done, I mean how can you go on with after what has happened, it's incredible.</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: You can.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom, good to have you on the program.</p><p>BARRACK, JR.: Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom Barrack. We'll take a break. We're live from Saudi, next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A suicide live streamed on Facebook, Cheryl Casone with these details now, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE: Well Maria, good morning. Shocked viewers could not believe what they were watching. A distraught father in Turkey upset that his daughter got engaged without his permission committed suicide on Facebook Live.</p><p>The violent scene unfolded as he was speaking directly into the camera before he pulled a handgun with his left hand fired a single shot into his temple. Facebook has removed that video from the site.</p><p>Well <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>allowing refugee admissions to resume under a stricter screening rules. This comes after the administration's 120-day ban on refugee admissions expired yesterday. Now, the president has also ordered refugees from 11 countries that post higher risk to U.S. national security to face even tougher scrutiny. The administration hasn't identified though yet those 11 countries.</p><p>Well Congress voting to overturn a banking rule from the Obama Administration that would have allowed consumers to bring class action law suits against their bank or credit card company. Vice President Pence cast the final vote to break the 50-50 tie.</p><p>The banking industry was pushing hard to rollback this regulation that came from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau years ago. The Trump Administration and republicans say the rule harms the free market. The president now expected to sign that measure into law.</p><p>Well, earnings season in full swing, Anthem is out with better than expected third quarter adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share, of course, this company revenue of $22 billion slighted ahead of expectations.</p><p>And then Alaska Airlines out with a profit of $2.24 a share, $0.02 below the estimate. The stock is down about 11 percent so far year-to-date. There is the one year chart as well on Alaska.</p><p>And then let's take a look at Chipotle, they came out with pretty disappointing quarterly numbers. Same store sales falling short of what analyst were looking for. The stock is lower in the premarket Maria, down more than 10 percent from hurricanes, the consumer taste changing, to the higher price of avocadoes.</p><p>A lot of issues factored into these negative numbers coming out of Chipotle. And those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, 10 percent big move there Cheryl on the downside. Okay, thank you so much. We should point out that these are just reported earnings and revenue better than expected.</p><p>We'll see if the stock moves on this but we've got revenue at $4.8 billion, better than the estimate earnings as well. Visa in the news right now. Stock is up about two percent right now higher on Visa.</p><p>We'll take a break. When we come back, mixed signals on healthcare after the president ended subsidies to the insurance companies and you said that they got rich off of ObamaCare. How is the industry reacting? I'll have an exclusive interview right here in Riyadh with the CEO of Prudential Financial, John Strangfeld coming up, that's next.</p><p>And then Amazon now giving businesses to prime treatment, two day shipping for some deliveries, what it will cost you, that story coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo </nameText></person>coming to you live this morning from the future investment initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Over in Washington, the republican controlled Congress is still looking to deliver win for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>on healthcare but Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell is putting the responsibility back on the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: What I'm waiting is to hear from <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>what kind of healthcare bill he might sign. If there is a need for some kind of interim step here to stabilize the market we need a bill, the president will actually sign.</p><p>And I'm not certain yet what the president is looking for here but I'll be happy to bring a bill to the floor if I know <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>would sign it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now and a FOX Business Exclusive is the CEO of Prudential Financial, John Strangfeld. John, it's good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>JOHN STRANGFELD, CEO, PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL: Thank you. Good to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think about all this uncertainty over what the president actually wants to replace ObamaCare with, impacting the industry overall, uncertainty over the tax package.</p><p>Are these pieces of legislation going to impact markets if we actually don't see closure soon?</p><p>STRANGFELD: I don't see the healthcare having a big impact on that. I think the uncertainty around tax and what the outcome of the taxes I think actually has a bigger impact. And it can be linked to other public policy objectives as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you really have to see a movement in economic growth and you think that happens from tax reform.</p><p>STRANGFELD: I think that can happen from tax reform and I also think there's certain public policy objectives that are important to be reflected in the tax reform as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about Prudential Financial for a moment, you've changed the company obviously not a healthcare company, you've got a huge asset management -- wealth management division, $1.2 trillion assets under management.</p><p>How are you investing today? How are your clients viewing this market sentiment which obviously has been record setting?</p><p>STRANGFELD: Well, it takes different forms in different places. And so for example, in our particular case, we're a large insurance company, we're a large retirement company, and we're a large asset management.</p><p>$1.2 trillion, about two-thirds of that are institutional investors, such as those here in the Saudi Kingdom which is partly why I'm here. Everyone has a different objective in terms of what they're trying to accomplish. But many of them are apprehensive about what's going on in the marketplace and how the returns they can achieve match up with the obligations that they have in front of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to ask about retirement because we just came off of a couple of weeks of uncertainty with regard to what this administration might do with 401K plans and finally the president comes out and says there will be no change to your 401K. What was your take on that?</p><p>STRANGFELD: Well, that was a good conclusion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it was.</p><p>STRANGFELD: So if you think about this, aging population not only in U.S. but in many countries shrinking government safety nets, corporate employers plans are less generous than they once were and people are living longer.</p><p>So when you combine all this together, it's a big challenge for people to maintain their quality of life in retirement. And the more we can do to have public policy that aligns with people's objectives of achieving that is really, really critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you don't want any change in policy in terms of 401K?</p><p>STRANGFELD: Absolutely not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, what -- we're already looking at a situation where people don't have enough money in retirement.</p><p>STRANGFELD: They absolutely don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You don't want to change a 401K where an employee is able to get a match from the company.</p><p>STRANGFELD: Absolutely. In fact, we have -- we need more incentives to encourage people along the way. Not only that, many people have had their retirement risks shifted to their shoulders whether it's the savings or whether it's the risk of knowing how long they're going to live.</p><p>None of us know whether we're going to live to 72 or 102, so it's very difficult to know how we can save for that. Our parents generation had a pension check show up in the mailbox once a month.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, exactly.</p><p>STRANGFELD: We don't have that today. So people have to address that individually which is a much harder way to manage risk.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now you're here as you just mentioned, you've got clients obviously -- a lot of your institutional clients including the Kingdom, I thought it was really interesting what the crowned prince has been saying in terms of the private investment fund.</p><p>They've got six pools of capital, they're -- they gave $45 billion to Softbank in that vision fund, they're investing in the Blackstone infrastructure fund. Where else do you think there's opportunity for an international investor like the Saudi Kingdom?</p><p>Are they looking U.S., Europe, where's the attractions?</p><p>STRANGFELD: Well what they have historically done is exported a lot of capital. Meaning, investments into other regions of the world, it takes many different forms (INAUDIBLE) examples that you mentioned.</p><p>But it's interesting from what the crowned prince was talking about yesterday is there's also going to be an added initiative, we're investing more extensively in their domestic marketplace as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And Saudi is changing.</p><p>STRANGFELD: Yes. Saudi is changing and what's also fascinating about his efforts that were reflected in your moderated panel yesterday was the desire to link public policy with those objectives in ways (INAUDIBLE) other countries should consider replicating as well.</p><p>You have a much better prospect of achieving your objectives if public policy is an enabler to outcomes and clearly, he's focusing on having an enabling public policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think it's incredible that he wants to get that Private Investment Fund, the PIF up to above $2 trillion in assets by 2030.</p><p>STRANGFELD: Yes. Yes, that's a big number.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>STRANGFELD: And I think it's -- I think it's actually quite achievable given what they've done and given what they (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>And by the way, they're very long-term investors which as are we which is what made -- we've been here for over 20 years which has made that relationship as strong as it is, they're thinking very long-term.</p><p>But the neat thing about his, the crowned prince was his thinking around the use of public policy to enable things that happened. Frankly, we could take a page out of the book in our country. We spend so much time on regulating versus enabling is a real opportunity there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's one of the reason that the Trump Administration has rolled back regulation so much really.</p><p>STRANGFELD: Exactly right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: John, it's good to see you.</p><p>STRANGFELD: Nice to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>STRANGFELD: Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nice to see you here in Saudi.</p><p>STRANGFELD: Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: John Strangfeld joining us there. Thank you John.</p><p>Coming up next, incredible new images of the devastating California wildfires and they're from space. NASA releasing the revealing pictures and we've got them for you. And then the L.A. Dodgers taking one of the World Series, but the real winner may be the team's right fielder, whose hair, well, took on Dodger blue and took it to a whole new level. We'll tell you about it. Stay with us.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Here again is <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo </nameText></person>with a special edition of Mornings with Maria, live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the future investment initiative.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo. </nameText></person>It is Wednesday, October 25th, happy Wednesday to you, everybody, thanks for joining me, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Mark Cuban means business. The billionaire sits down with Fox News to talk about a possible White House run in 2020. How Cuban claims he would help the middle class if he decides to take on <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>coming up. Meanwhile, earnings expected to drive markets once again.</p><p>We are in the thick of earnings season for the third quarter, three Dow components out before the opening bell this morning. Coca-Cola and Boeing are both due in the next two hours. We will bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tapes. Visa reported a moment ago, delivering solid fiscal fourth-quarter results for visa. The credit card company beat expectations on both earnings and on revenue. We are breaking down those numbers, coming up. The stock is already up two percent as expected to tackle on 15 points on the Dow at the open, with a two percent rally in Visa.</p><p>Futures meanwhile, indicating a flat opening so far for the broader averages as you can see. European stocks are also mixed to a really flat on the session. Take a look at the European indices right here, and we see the FT 100 down about 10 points and the CAC Quarante up 15, the DAX Index in Germany up about 8. Fractional moves there. In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher. Take a look, as you see there, best performer, Hang Seng in Hong Kong, up half a percent.</p><p>California chard, NASA releasing stunning new satellite pictures revealing the true scope of the damage left behind by the massive wildfires still raging in the state. Twitter getting transparent, how the company is fighting back this morning amid revelations that Russia used social media to meddle in the U.S. election plus, the Dodgers scorch the Astros last night, the hottest World Series game, game one on record, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMMENTATOR: Left field and it's deep and a wall and a turn. It's a two- run home run. Marwin Gonzalez runs out of room, Turner runs around the bases and the Dodgers take a 3-1 lead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, we have the highlights from the sizzling summer-like start to the fall classic, coming up this morning. But first, I am live, at day two at the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this morning. It's another big day of exclusive interviews, news-making interviews. We've got huge titans from across the world coming here because Saudi Arabia is in the midst of fundamental change.</p><p>I will be speaking, coming up, with Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin, the CEO of the Blackstone Group Stephen Schwarzman, EY Global Chairman and CEO Mark Weinberger and London Stock Exchange CEO Xavier Rolet, coming up. But first, tax reform in the road to 2020, billionaire Mark Cuban seems to be setting up a primary challenge to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>during an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson last night. Cuban slammed Trump's tax plan and weighed in on how he would help the stagnant middle class.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK CUBAN, OWNER OF NBA'S DALLAS MAVERICKS: The first thing I would do rather than a tax reform we're looking at right now, a decrease payroll taxes significantly, so that that money, instead of being -- instead of having every hour tax as it is now, that money would go right into the hands of the people who need it the most. I would focus on creating technology solutions. I think there's a way that we can reduce the size of government, the size of bureaucracy that deals with healthcare, but it's going to take somebody who understands technology that can introduce technology to find those solutions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now and the first on Fox Business interview is Revolution CEO and Chairman, and Former CEO of AOL, Steve Case, Steve, great to see you.</p><p>STEVE CASE, CEO AND CHAIRMAN OF REVOLUTION: Great to be back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us, so your thoughts on this, Mark Cuban, going to run for president?</p><p>CASE: What (INAUDIBLE) I think we have three more years to go, but I love the fact that Mark's going to -- trying to throw some ideas out there to help the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, so far, there's been such divisiveness in this country. What do you think about what the policies coming out of this administration have been so far?</p><p>CASE: Well, I think they are trying to focus onto things like tax reform (INAUDIBLE) get some traction. I've talked to the President and some of his advisors, Gary Cohn and Wilbur Ross and others about making sure that as they look at tax reform, they -- and try to focus on simplification. They also create the right investment in (INAUDIBLE) so entrepreneurs particularly (INAUDIBLE) have access to Capitol, so they can start companies and create jobs there.</p><p>We have this growing divide in the country where a lot of innovation and wealth creation and job creations happening in the coast. There are a lot of people in the country that do feel left out and left behind, so hopefully, that would be one of the areas as tax reform moves forward. It will be a more inclusive innovation economy. Last year, 75 percent of (INAUDIBLE) went to just three states.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>CASE: And so, we need to make sure everybody, everywhere really has a shot at the American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where do you see growth? I mean, you're really one of the first people to get on this, sort of, longevity bandwagon, wellness longevity with your Revolution Company. Tell me where do you see growth in the world today?</p><p>CASE: Well, I think the big opportunity is what I've called the third wave of the earn, the first wave is just getting everybody connected that we started AOL over three decades ago, only three percent of people are online, so getting (INAUDIBLE) was the first wave. The last 15 or 20 years is really the second wave building apps and services on top of the internet, Facebook and Google and so forth.</p><p>But the third wave is just now happening, it's really integrating the internet in seamless ways throughout healthcare and energy, food, agriculture, transportation, smart cities, a lot of things are up for grabs in the third wave, but I think it's going to require a different mind-set for entrepreneurs, partnerships, companies are going to be more important, policy, regulatory issues are going to become more important. And I also believe they will tie with (INAUDIBLE) the expertise and a lot of sectors like healthcare and farming is in the middle of the country.</p><p>So we're backing entrepreneurs who are close to those, you know, those industries, that's where the third break really will break out. It won't just be -- and I think we're kind of peak silicon valley here (INAUDIBLE) inside and people talking about peak oil. I think we're kind of peak silicon valley and talking about it will continue to be strong and vibrant. We're going to see a more inclusive innovation economy and entrepreneurs will regionalize within the United States and globalized really all around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you make a good point, because when you -- when you were first, obviously, with AOL, it was a different moment in time in terms of the internet. We were -- we were on the doorstep of a new revolution, if you will, but today, it's about adding on to that. It's about really different stool -- different legs to the stool.</p><p>CASE: And integrating it. Something like Smart Cities. I was in Columbus a couple of weeks ago to get another Rise of the Rest tour to Ohio and Indiana and Michigan states like that. Columbus won the Smart City's challenge. They've got $50 million from the government to match that with $500 million and they're trying to create a model of Smart City which is exciting.</p><p>But, it's not just about the technology, it's not just about the software, how do you partner with other companies, G.E. and IBM, some of the biggest companies in the world, are partnering with the start-ups to create Smart Cities and how do you deal with some of the policies? Is there some tough privacy big brother issues, risk around cyberterrorism bringing down some of these Smart Cities, so that third wave innovation is not going to just going to be about coding and writing software and apps.</p><p>It's going to be really dealing with some of the most fundamental aspects of our lives, how we stay healthy, how we move around cities and doing - that in partnership with other companies and understanding growing importance of policy and therefore, you have to interact and engage with government which entrepreneurs generally are resistant of doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is this part of the discussion on your panel today? You're here, you're going to be doing a panel, the world in 2030, creating value with the next generation which Richard Branson and David Bonderman.</p><p>CASE: Yes. That's really talking about what's happening in the next 10 or 20 years. I will talk a lot about a third wave and why it's going to require a different, kind of, approached entrepreneurship. We'll talk about it the Rise of the Rest, and how we're trying to encourage more entrepreneurship in more parts of the country, more parts of the world. We're also talking about impact investing.</p><p>We are hearing that theme at this conference and having business not just focused on profit, but also focus on purpose to having a broader impact that's resonating a lot of people -- young people who want to work for companies that stand for more than short-term profit, do business with companies as well as invest in those companies. So, the third wave innovation will be a big thing, the rise of the rest and more regional entrepreneurship and impact investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think it's really interesting that so many large technology companies have investment arms and they're acquiring some of these start- ups, you know, those companies that don't want to go public because they don't want to deal with the regulatory environment, you've got the arm of Google, an arm -- an investment arm in Amazon, buying up some of these companies.</p><p>CASE: Which is actually great, a good way for them to drive forward and innovate some of the most interesting businesses now, that something like Google has android or things like that came through acquisition. And a great example that I saw two weeks ago in Indianapolis, sales acquired a company they called exact target for nearly $3 billion. They've now doubled the size were exact target for nearly$3 billion.</p><p>They've now doubled the size of that company, it's now 2,000 employees in downtown Indianapolis and the founder Scott Dorsey has gone on to start a venture fund and invest in the next generation of companies in Indianapolis. Look, everybody thinks the sales worth is a Silicon Valley company, and it is, their second largest outside of California is now Indianapolis. And that's what a perfect example of this idea to have Rise the Rest.</p><p>There's more cities that are rising, the brain drain where people leaving those cities are slowing, there's a boomerang of talent. We just need to follow with the venture capital. I think we can do to get more capital in hands and more entrepreneurs doing more interesting things in this third wave, will result in a much more inclusive innovation economy. We'll have a country where everybody feels optimistic about the future, not fearful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is really fascinating. You're absolutely right. Steve, I will be watching that panel. Thank you so much.</p><p>CASE: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you today, Steve Case joining us there. Coming up, Twitters big reveal, the social media company says that it will become more clear when it comes to who is posting political ads on the platform, in the wake of the surge or fake news during the last election. Plus, more big earnings out this morning, including Walgreens, does the healthcare debate affecting the company? We will bring It to you, next, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo, </nameText></person>coming to you live this morning from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We are watching major changes here in Saudi; we're also watching markets, of course, that is expected to open fractionally lower this morning. We'll see what happens after the earnings come out because that will likely dictate the numbers.</p><p>General Dynamics is one to watch today. The company is set to report third-quarter earnings before the opening bell this morning. Analysts are expecting earnings of $2.44 a share. The stock is up more than 40 percent over the last year. A pretty-good looking chart on General Dynamics.</p><p>Meanwhile, another name, SiriusXM, the broadcasting company also set to report its third-quarter earnings this morning. The analysis there -- analysts expecting earnings of four cents a share. Shares of SiriusXM are up nearly 30 percent this year.</p><p>NASA, meanwhile, releasing satellite photo which revealed the destruction caused by massive wildfires across Northern California. It's just incredible photos. Cheryl Casone with all the details right now in New York, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria and these pictures are incredible. This NASA image we're going to show, you could see that the vegetation is in red, burned areas appear dark gray. More than 8,000 homes have burned in dozens of wildfires in Northern California. Firefighters are still trying to fully contain these fires; 42 people have been killed.</p><p>Well, Twitter says it will make its ads more transparent in an attempt to stay ahead of potential regulation. The company says people and groups that advertise on Twitter are going to be listed on Web site which will include details like how long the ads have been running. Remember Russian- backed accounts planted ads on Twitter and Facebook in an effort to influence the 2016 presidential election. Shares of Twitter up about six percent so far, this year.</p><p>Well, Amazon Prime is now available for businesses. The service started for companies who want free two-day shipping for certain things. So far, it's only available to businesses that are based here in the United States or Germany. Companies are going to be charged annual fees based on the size of the company. Shares of Amazon, though, under pressure a little bit, down a quarter percent in the premarket.</p><p>Well, the heat was on, literally, in Los Angeles last night. The temperature hit 103 for day one of the World Series, making it the hottest ever. No sweat though for the Dodgers, Chris Taylor smacking home run off the first pitch and the bottom of the first, giving Dodgers the early 1-0 lead. There it is. Clayton Kershaw, masterful, by the way, for the Dodgers; he erased all the postseason demons. And then, the big blow coming from Justin Turner.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Turner lost a fly ball to left, it's hit pretty well. And it's gone! The two-run shot, Justin Turner! Dodger stadium erupts as they take a 3-1 lead here in the sixth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: All right. Turner already has four homers this post-season. Dodgers went on to beat Astros 3-1. And then, check this out: Yasiel Puig showing his true colors on his head. Before the game, he prepared himself for the series by dying his hair, his Mohawk, anyway, a special color. Here's what it looks like. We'll show the big reveal -- yes, it's pure Dodger blue, Maria. So, big night in L.A. Another game tonight, by the way, we should add. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. I don't know, I've heard of highlights, Dagen McDowell. But blue? I don't know that's a new one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, on the T.V., it looks Vikings purple.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, CHAIR, BUSINESS AND FINANCE PROGRAM AT THE KING'S COLLEGE: I like that.</p><p>(LAUGHER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think you have to actually bleach your hair white first, like, white, white, white. Then -- and then, put the color on it to make it look like that. Although, I -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: To get just the right color.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. Not that I know anything about hair dye.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're talking about earnings. I know you've Lindsey sitting there. I don't know what you're looking at, Lindsey, as far as more important this earnings period, but what's it looking like so far? When we spoke last week, you said that the overall earnings expectation was profit growth of four percent, not so hot, are they exceeding the number?</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Yes, well, earnings growth now is looking at three percent. I used the S&amp;P capital consensus estimate, so that's come down. G.E. had a lot to do with that. There is weak number on Friday. There's a huge weight in the index, so I'm looking forward to hearing more from these industrial and aerospace companies today. We'll get some big tech giants tomorrow. And that's going to be huge because those stocks have run off into the report. It could be a challenging quarter for them to see the stocks continue after that report. But the important thing is that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen, we've got dossier -- yes? Go ahead, Lindsey.</p><p>BELL: -- the topline sales are beating 71 percent of companies, that's huge. Usually, 55 percent beat, so that's a good sign for corporate America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen, we've got to talk about the other major story. We'll take a short break. When we come back, that's on the document -- maybe we should start calling it the Clinton dossier, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back! I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo, </nameText></person>coming to you live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia today. We want to look at investment happening here and across the world. We kick it off right now in Washington. Yesterday, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>reportedly had Republican leadership cast an informal vote between Jerome Powell and John Taylor for the said chair vacancy, coming in a few months. Reportedly, Taylor came as the winner. Brian Brenberg, let's talk about this. Because when I sat down with the president at the end of last week, he really did narrow it down to Taylor and Powell. But our sources say that when he asked the leadership: who would like to see John Taylor as head of the Fed, it was almost unanimous. They all raised their hand. What do you know?</p><p>BRENBERG: Well, John Taylor is very well-known in those circles. But I think this is an interesting question because if the president goes with Taylor, the question is: will Taylor do what everyone thinks Taylor will do, which is raise rates much more quickly than the Janet Yellen Fed has done. That could really move markets, Maria. So, this is a big question. Now, others say, look, even if Taylor ends up in this role, once you get into the seat, you moderate your views just a little bit because now you're actually in a decision-making role. So, there's a big question there. And I think that's going to create some uncertainty in the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that the markets, given the kind of jubilant market that you've seen are not factoring in the potential unknown of a new Fed chief. And again, you get into this guessing game as Brian was pointing out: who would do what? Again, Kevin Warsh's name was out there, earlier this week. J. Powell, J. Powell is going to be more like Janet Yellen. Is it going to be Janet Yellen? But if you get a new name in there, particularly John Taylor, you'll go to have potentially months of uncertainty. I think that that maybe not cause a market crash, but it could cause a lot of volatility that you are not seeing today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, and what Brian said, you know, here's a guy who has voiced, you know, his feeling that rates have to be much higher, John Taylor has said it. But, you know, when I asked the president who'd he wanted to see running the Fed, he said, well, I'm looking at Taylor and I'm looking at Powell. So, he basically said, you know, I mean, he didn't mention Gary Cohn, he didn't mention Kevin Warsh. But you're right, those are two very different people in terms of their approach to interest rates. And we don't know, Lindsey, if the whole experiment is going to work whereas as they're winding down the balance sheet $4.5 trillion, and how disrupted that could be to markets. Meanwhile, so far, earnings have been the story in terms of driving market action.</p><p>BELL: Right. And I think when it comes to the Fed chair, it's going to be: what does Trump want higher rates or lower rates? It's going to be something to watch. Earnings, so far, though, are supporting the market right now. One thing I will say is we've seen 2018 estimates, 12 percent growth. It hasn't moved too much, and while that doesn't include any reform in there, it'll be interesting -- the reform is priced into the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, it's 12 percent profit growth, Lindsey, for 2018?</p><p>BELL: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. We'll be right back, much more from the Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2017102501cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PT8-8WD1-JB20-G49K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7940\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 25, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000A2R8</classCode><className>WEINSTEIN CO LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002LOB</classCode><className>DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS512120 MOTION PICTURE &amp;

But in the data, they're something else: a miraculous small-business success story. Mom-and-pop vape shops are the fastest-growing retail segment of the past decade, as well as the one with the highest share of employees at small businesses. But a government ban on flavored vapes and increased regulation could wipe them out and leave an opening for big tobacco and big tech to dominate the fast-growing industry. Tobacconists - the broader category that includes vape shops - have lapped every other retail segment since 2009 thanks to an explosion of tiny businesses, Labor Department data show. </p><p>Two-thirds of vape-shop workers are employed by the 93 percent of businesses with fewer than 10 employees - a higher rate than for any other retail segment. Yelp's vast databases, which allow us to break out segments not yet tracked by the government, agree. Since the end of 2012, vape shops have been the fastest-growing large retail segment tracked by the online review site. The shops are concentrated in the West and South, Yelp data show, with Nevada and Oklahoma competing for the title of vapingest state. The entire industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as an unidentified lung illness, thought to be vaping related, has killed at least seven people and sickened more than 500. Investigators have focused on black-market products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, but they are casting a wide net. In response to alarm over those mystery illnesses, as well as to broader concerns about vaping's growing appeal to high-school students, the Trump administration has announced plans to ban all flavored vaping liquids, or juices. The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner. Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options. On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Mich., plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons their Facebook page, and their website lists faux edgy flavors such as Alien Piss (blue raspberry lemonade) and Your Mom (sweet tangy strawberry yogurt topped with nectarine). But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, they are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\" The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands upon thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. In May of next year, the FDA will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval which its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape-shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse. Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, N.Y. \"After the mom and pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria. Rules that make running a vape shop more expensive will accelerate a classic cycle in which a few major players muscle out their small-business competition as an industry matures, Notre Dame economist Benjamin Pugsley said. \"When you have regulations that are increasing the entry cost of any particular industry, that tends to favor the large incumbents,\" he said. Vape shops already previewed the process once, in August 2016, when the FDA began regulating e-cigarettes and associated items as tobacco products. The change coincided with a sharp drop in vape-shop employment. The industry later resumed its growth, albeit at a slower pace. Hints of vaping's future may be seen in beer's past. In 1873, when transport challenges limited competition and regulation was light, there were more than 4,000 breweries in the U.S., according to figures from the book American Breweries II provided by the Brewers Association. But the rise of lager-syle beers, railroads and refrigeration, combined with expensive technological advancements such as pasteurization and bottling, squeezed out smaller brewers. In 1920, Prohibition dealt a death blow to many of the operations that remained. \"Smaller-scale producers are less likely to be diversified, less likely to have capital reserves, less likely to be able to use influence to move into other markets or find exceptions,\" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association. \"The companies that survived were the ones that were able to rapidly shift markets and weather the storm.\" He pointed that, Yuengling, for example, entered the ice cream business during the lean years. Those bigger players swung back into the industry when prohibition lifted, because they were positioned to navigate costly state and local regulations that proliferated in the wake of repeal. It consolidated their advantage. By 1978, there were just 89 brewers in the country. In that same year, regulations finally eased. President Jimmy Carter signed a bill that legalized homebrewing. In the years that followed, states relaxed their brewpub bans, Watson said. There were more than 1,500 U.S. breweries by the year 2000, and by 2018 there were 7,450. There's an important caveat, however. A few enormous corporations still sell six out of every seven U.S. beers, leaving about 7,447 craft brewers to split the remaining 14 percent of the market. \"These regulatory decisions that were made a long time ago have very long historical trajectories,\" Watson said. Heavyweights like Anheuser-Busch InBev (41 percent of the market) and Molson Coors (23.5 percent) have also elbowed into the craft beer boom, buying smaller brewers and distributing their beverages under myriad craft labels. We're seeing echoes of that in the vaping industry. Late last year, Altria sought to regain lost ground with a $12.8 billion investment in Juul. It also acquired 45 percent of a Canadian marijuana firm. Vape-shop managers like Pritchard and Brown say they got into the industry to help people stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At vape shops, customers often taper to lower and lower nicotine concentrations, until they're vaping a zero-nicotine product. Eventually, some will quit entirely.

But in the data, they're something else: a miraculous small-business success story. Mom-and-pop vape shops are the fastest-growing retail segment of the past decade, as well as the one with the highest share of employees at small businesses. But a government ban on flavored vapes and increased regulation could wipe them out and leave an opening for big tobacco and big tech to dominate the fast-growing industry. Tobacconists - the broader category that includes vape shops - have lapped every other retail segment since 2009 thanks to an explosion of tiny businesses, Labor Department data show. </p><p>Two-thirds of vape-shop workers are employed by the 93 percent of businesses with fewer than 10 employees - a higher rate than for any other retail segment. Yelp's vast databases, which allow us to break out segments not yet tracked by the government, agree. Since the end of 2012, vape shops have been the fastest-growing large retail segment tracked by the online review site. The shops are concentrated in the West and South, Yelp data show, with Nevada and Oklahoma competing for the title of vapingest state. The entire industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as an unidentified lung illness, thought to be vaping related, has killed at least seven people and sickened more than 500. Investigators have focused on black-market products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, but they are casting a wide net. In response to alarm over those mystery illnesses, as well as to broader concerns about vaping's growing appeal to high-school students, the Trump administration has announced plans to ban all flavored vaping liquids, or juices. The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner. Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options. On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Mich., plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons their Facebook page, and their website lists faux edgy flavors such as Alien Piss (blue raspberry lemonade) and Your Mom (sweet tangy strawberry yogurt topped with nectarine). But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, they are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\" The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands upon thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. In May of next year, the FDA will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval which its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape-shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse. Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, N.Y. \"After the mom and pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria. Rules that make running a vape shop more expensive will accelerate a classic cycle in which a few major players muscle out their small-business competition as an industry matures, Notre Dame economist Benjamin Pugsley said. \"When you have regulations that are increasing the entry cost of any particular industry, that tends to favor the large incumbents,\" he said. Vape shops already previewed the process once, in August 2016, when the FDA began regulating e-cigarettes and associated items as tobacco products. The change coincided with a sharp drop in vape-shop employment. The industry later resumed its growth, albeit at a slower pace. Hints of vaping's future may be seen in beer's past. In 1873, when transport challenges limited competition and regulation was light, there were more than 4,000 breweries in the U.S., according to figures from the book American Breweries II provided by the Brewers Association. But the rise of lager-syle beers, railroads and refrigeration, combined with expensive technological advancements such as pasteurization and bottling, squeezed out smaller brewers. In 1920, Prohibition dealt a death blow to many of the operations that remained. \"Smaller-scale producers are less likely to be diversified, less likely to have capital reserves, less likely to be able to use influence to move into other markets or find exceptions,\" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association. \"The companies that survived were the ones that were able to rapidly shift markets and weather the storm.\" He pointed that, Yuengling, for example, entered the ice cream business during the lean years. Those bigger players swung back into the industry when prohibition lifted, because they were positioned to navigate costly state and local regulations that proliferated in the wake of repeal. It consolidated their advantage. By 1978, there were just 89 brewers in the country. In that same year, regulations finally eased. President Jimmy Carter signed a bill that legalized homebrewing. In the years that followed, states relaxed their brewpub bans, Watson said. There were more than 1,500 U.S. breweries by the year 2000, and by 2018 there were 7,450. There's an important caveat, however. A few enormous corporations still sell six out of every seven U.S. beers, leaving about 7,447 craft brewers to split the remaining 14 percent of the market. \"These regulatory decisions that were made a long time ago have very long historical trajectories,\" Watson said. Heavyweights like Anheuser-Busch InBev (41 percent of the market) and Molson Coors (23.5 percent) have also elbowed into the craft beer boom, buying smaller brewers and distributing their beverages under myriad craft labels. We're seeing echoes of that in the vaping industry. Late last year, Altria sought to regain lost ground with a $12.8 billion investment in Juul. It also acquired 45 percent of a Canadian marijuana firm. Vape-shop managers like Pritchard and Brown say they got into the industry to help people stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At vape shops, customers often taper to lower and lower nicotine concentrations, until they're vaping a zero-nicotine product. Eventually, some will quit entirely. But while adult smokers seem to have benefited from the vaping boom, officials point to a worrying spike in teen use. A 2018 survey found 37.3 percent of high-school seniors had vaped at some point in the prior year, up from 27.8 percent in 2017. Only 3.6 percent of them reported smoking cigarettes daily.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN71297694</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X62-NCW1-DYRV-41DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1265\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

But in the data, they're something else: a miraculous small-business success story. Mom-and-pop vape shops are the fastest-growing retail segment of the past decade, as well as the one with the highest share of employees at small businesses. But a government ban on flavored vapes and increased regulation could wipe them out and leave an opening for big tobacco and big tech to dominate the fast-growing industry. Tobacconists - the broader category that includes vape shops - have lapped every other retail segment since 2009 thanks to an explosion of tiny businesses, Labor Department data show. </p><p>Two-thirds of vape-shop workers are employed by the 93 percent of businesses with fewer than 10 employees - a higher rate than for any other retail segment. Yelp's vast databases, which allow us to break out segments not yet tracked by the government, agree. Since the end of 2012, vape shops have been the fastest-growing large retail segment tracked by the online review site. The shops are concentrated in the West and South, Yelp data show, with Nevada and Oklahoma competing for the title of vapingest state. The entire industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as an unidentified lung illness, thought to be vaping related, has killed at least seven people and sickened more than 500. Investigators have focused on black-market products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, but they are casting a wide net. In response to alarm over those mystery illnesses, as well as to broader concerns about vaping's growing appeal to high-school students, the Trump administration has announced plans to ban all flavored vaping liquids, or juices. The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner. Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options. On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Mich., plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons their Facebook page, and their website lists faux edgy flavors such as Alien Piss (blue raspberry lemonade) and Your Mom (sweet tangy strawberry yogurt topped with nectarine). But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, they are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\" The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands upon thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. In May of next year, the FDA will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval which its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape-shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse. Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, N.Y. \"After the mom and pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria. Rules that make running a vape shop more expensive will accelerate a classic cycle in which a few major players muscle out their small-business competition as an industry matures, Notre Dame economist Benjamin Pugsley said. \"When you have regulations that are increasing the entry cost of any particular industry, that tends to favor the large incumbents,\" he said. Vape shops already previewed the process once, in August 2016, when the FDA began regulating e-cigarettes and associated items as tobacco products. The change coincided with a sharp drop in vape-shop employment. The industry later resumed its growth, albeit at a slower pace. Hints of vaping's future may be seen in beer's past. In 1873, when transport challenges limited competition and regulation was light, there were more than 4,000 breweries in the U.S., according to figures from the book American Breweries II provided by the Brewers Association. But the rise of lager-syle beers, railroads and refrigeration, combined with expensive technological advancements such as pasteurization and bottling, squeezed out smaller brewers. In 1920, Prohibition dealt a death blow to many of the operations that remained. \"Smaller-scale producers are less likely to be diversified, less likely to have capital reserves, less likely to be able to use influence to move into other markets or find exceptions,\" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association. \"The companies that survived were the ones that were able to rapidly shift markets and weather the storm.\" He pointed that, Yuengling, for example, entered the ice cream business during the lean years. Those bigger players swung back into the industry when prohibition lifted, because they were positioned to navigate costly state and local regulations that proliferated in the wake of repeal. It consolidated their advantage. By 1978, there were just 89 brewers in the country. In that same year, regulations finally eased. President Jimmy Carter signed a bill that legalized homebrewing. In the years that followed, states relaxed their brewpub bans, Watson said. There were more than 1,500 U.S. breweries by the year 2000, and by 2018 there were 7,450. There's an important caveat, however. A few enormous corporations still sell six out of every seven U.S. beers, leaving about 7,447 craft brewers to split the remaining 14 percent of the market. \"These regulatory decisions that were made a long time ago have very long historical trajectories,\" Watson said. Heavyweights like Anheuser-Busch InBev (41 percent of the market) and Molson Coors (23.5 percent) have also elbowed into the craft beer boom, buying smaller brewers and distributing their beverages under myriad craft labels. We're seeing echoes of that in the vaping industry. Late last year, Altria sought to regain lost ground with a $12.8 billion investment in Juul. It also acquired 45 percent of a Canadian marijuana firm. Vape-shop managers like Pritchard and Brown say they got into the industry to help people stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At vape shops, customers often taper to lower and lower nicotine concentrations, until they're vaping a zero-nicotine product. Eventually, some will quit entirely. But while adult smokers seem to have benefited from the vaping boom, officials point to a worrying spike in teen use. A 2018 survey found 37.3 percent of high-school seniors had vaped at some point in the prior year, up from 27.8 percent in 2017. Only 3.6 percent of them reported smoking cigarettes daily.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN71297688</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X62-NCW1-DYRV-41DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1265\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Since the end of 2012, vape shops have been the fastest-growing large retail segment tracked by the online review site. The shops are concentrated in the West and South, Yelp data show, with Nevada and Oklahoma competing for the title of vapingest state. The entire industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as an unidentified lung illness, thought to be vaping related, has killed at least seven people and sickened more than 500. Investigators have focused on black-market products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, but they are casting a wide net. In response to alarm over those mystery illnesses, as well as to broader concerns about vaping's growing appeal to high-school students, the Trump administration has announced plans to ban all flavored vaping liquids, or juices. The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner. Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options. On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Mich., plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons their Facebook page, and their website lists faux edgy flavors such as Alien Piss (blue raspberry lemonade) and Your Mom (sweet tangy strawberry yogurt topped with nectarine). But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, they are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\" The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands upon thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. In May of next year, the FDA will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval which its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape-shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse. Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, N.Y. \"After the mom and pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria. Rules that make running a vape shop more expensive will accelerate a classic cycle in which a few major players muscle out their small-business competition as an industry matures, Notre Dame economist Benjamin Pugsley said. \"When you have regulations that are increasing the entry cost of any particular industry, that tends to favor the large incumbents,\" he said. Vape shops already previewed the process once, in August 2016, when the FDA began regulating e-cigarettes and associated items as tobacco products. The change coincided with a sharp drop in vape-shop employment. The industry later resumed its growth, albeit at a slower pace. Hints of vaping's future may be seen in beer's past. In 1873, when transport challenges limited competition and regulation was light, there were more than 4,000 breweries in the U.S., according to figures from the book American Breweries II provided by the Brewers Association. But the rise of lager-syle beers, railroads and refrigeration, combined with expensive technological advancements such as pasteurization and bottling, squeezed out smaller brewers. In 1920, Prohibition dealt a death blow to many of the operations that remained. \"Smaller-scale producers are less likely to be diversified, less likely to have capital reserves, less likely to be able to use influence to move into other markets or find exceptions,\" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association. \"The companies that survived were the ones that were able to rapidly shift markets and weather the storm.\" He pointed that, Yuengling, for example, entered the ice cream business during the lean years. Those bigger players swung back into the industry when prohibition lifted, because they were positioned to navigate costly state and local regulations that proliferated in the wake of repeal. It consolidated their advantage. By 1978, there were just 89 brewers in the country. In that same year, regulations finally eased. President Jimmy Carter signed a bill that legalized homebrewing. In the years that followed, states relaxed their brewpub bans, Watson said. There were more than 1,500 U.S. breweries by the year 2000, and by 2018 there were 7,450. There's an important caveat, however. A few enormous corporations still sell six out of every seven U.S. beers, leaving about 7,447 craft brewers to split the remaining 14 percent of the market. \"These regulatory decisions that were made a long time ago have very long historical trajectories,\" Watson said. Heavyweights like Anheuser-Busch InBev (41 percent of the market) and Molson Coors (23.5 percent) have also elbowed into the craft beer boom, buying smaller brewers and distributing their beverages under myriad craft labels. We're seeing echoes of that in the vaping industry. Late last year, Altria sought to regain lost ground with a $12.8 billion investment in Juul. It also acquired 45 percent of a Canadian marijuana firm. Vape-shop managers like Pritchard and Brown say they got into the industry to help people stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At vape shops, customers often taper to lower and lower nicotine concentrations, until they're vaping a zero-nicotine product. Eventually, some will quit entirely. But while adult smokers seem to have benefited from the vaping boom, officials point to a worrying spike in teen use. A 2018 survey found 37.3 percent of high-school seniors had vaped at some point in the prior year, up from 27.8 percent in 2017. Only 3.6 percent of them reported smoking cigarettes daily.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN71255389</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X62-NCW1-DYRV-419S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1265\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

And that is why we voted to leave the European Union nearly three years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I voted to leave because I believe the EU is simply incompatible with national democracy. Free trade across borders creates prosperity, but the EU is a political project that resembles not a single market but an empire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">National democracy is the only tried and tested way to govern fairly. It allows us to run the economy in our national interest, fund services and show solidarity with one another, by creating good, well-paid jobs for everyone, taxing people fairly and providing welfare for those who need it.</p><p>The EU cannot do these things. Just ask the young unemployed workers of Spain. Or almost anybody in Greece.</p><p>Or the people of places such as Boston, Lincs, who experienced their communities change almost overnight thanks to the unlimited free movement of people.</p><p>And just ask any minister or diplomat whether the EU is capable of heeding public concern and changing direction. Or save yourself the time and listen to last week's grandstanding by the French President, Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>Out of the EU, free to govern ourselves, we can take back control. We can free ourselves from protectionist EU regulations, develop our own regional development funds and introduce free ports and enterprise zones to boost the regional economy.</p><p>We can cut energy costs, support local businesses in public procurement, and reduce NHS commissioning costs.</p><p>We can regulate big tech and cut VAT bills on everything from gas bills to tampons. We can negotiate our own trade deals, control immigration and protect ourselves from terrorism unhindered by idiotic rulings by the European Court of Justice.</p><p>Right now, this optimistic vision for life after Brexit seems a long way away.</p><p>Last night the Government said it had won new assurances from Brussels that would mean the EU is legally bound to find alternative arrangements to the dreaded \"backstop\". Despite the warm words from Mrs May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Strasbourg, the details are yet to be fully scrutinised.</p><p>Leave supporters in Parliament and beyond are understandably wary.</p><p>This is because, in essence, the Government's Withdrawal Agreement is flawed.</p><p>There is still a risk, if we cannot agree our long-term future relationship with Europe, that Britain will end up trapped in some way by the backstop.</p><p>And there is still a worry that there will be only one way for us to escape. And that is if we sign up to a permanent customs union and countless more European laws.</p><p>Sabine Weyand, one of the EU's negotiators, boasts that the Withdrawal Agreement, \"requires the customs union as the basis of the future relationship\".</p><p>Thanks to the withdrawal agreement, she says, \"the EU will retain all the controls\" over Britain.</p><p>Surely this means Eurosceptic MPs who, like me, voted for Brexit, believe passionately in Britain's independence, and hate the Withdrawal Agreement should vote against it tonight? If only life was so simple.</p><p>If MPs reject Theresa May's \"improved\" deal, the Commons will certainly vote tomorrow to prevent a No Deal departure and on Thursday to delay Brexit instead.</p><p>The EU says it will agree a delay, but we do not know how long we might have to wait to leave.</p><p>Some Leave supporters say this is fine, and we can leave without a deal at the end of the delay. The EU, they reason, will not keep granting extensions, and without an agreement in place, Britain can simply get out.</p><p>But the EU might well grant further extensions. And during the delay, Remainers in Parliament will bring new challenges to Brexit.</p><p>Some are working towards a Norway-style relationship, in which Britain would follow almost all EU rules and laws, including those on free movement, as well as a customs union.</p><p>Others are trying to stop Brexit altogether through a second referendum.</p><p>And if they get their way, do not expect either rules or the choice put to the people to be fair.</p><p>They want to rig a second referendum in favour of staying in. The Leavers - a minority in Parliament, remember - have nowhere to go. Those who want to leave without a deal will be thwarted by the majority of MPs who are against it.</p><p>Those who want a different deal to the Withdrawal Agreement have been timed out by the Prime Minister.</p><p>They therefore face an awful choice. Vote against Theresa May's deal, and risk certain death with a Norway-style relationship or, worse, a rigged second referendum.</p><p>Or back the deal, risking only probable death, as the backstop might yet lead Britain to an eventual customs union.</p><p>Leave supporters in Parliament are understandably angry about the situation they find themselves in. Not only is the choice they are being forced to make unpalatable, it is about Brexit: The cause to which many of them have dedicated their careers.</p><p>They feel conned by a Prime Minister, a Cabinet and a Parliament they suspect never believed in their cause.</p><p>With the Commons divided along party lines and between a minority of Leavers and a majority of Remainers, leaving the EU was never going to be easy. David Cameron knew this when he resigned in 2016, saying he did not want to stay on and do \"the hard s**t\".</p><p>But after so many missteps, so much lost trust, and swathes of her party feeling betrayed, Theresa May will soon face a day of reckoning with her MPs.</p><p>Before then, however, there is tonight's vote.</p><p>Brexit supporters hate this deal, and so do I. But as flawed as it is, MPs who want to see Brexit through should vote in its favour.</p><p>In a choice between certain death and probable death, it is better to stay alive.</p><p>Nick Timothy is a former chief of staff to the Prime Minister.</p><p>Awful choice</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>KISS IS IT \u2026 Mrs May embraces EUBREAKTHROUGH \u2026 Juncker and May</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THESUN-147267717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THESUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-VGY1-JCBW-N1X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sun (England)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31984\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 2, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Initiative &amp;

They have since floated other changes as well, like making Facebook or other platforms liable when opioids are sold on their sites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now, as the real-world effects of the sex-trafficking change take hold, some experts and politicians say the results are not all positive. And even some lawmakers who have championed a crackdown on Big Tech are now calling to revisit the change. On Tuesday, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, two of the tech industry's loudest critics, joined 11 other lawmakers in backing a federal study of its effects.</p><p>Law enforcement officials say that it is sometimes more difficult to track traffickers because the law pushed them further underground. Advocates say that sex workers now face higher safety risks. The removal of sites advertising sex hinders their ability to vet their clients, the advocates say, and is pushing more of them onto the streets.</p><p>The renewed focus on the 2018 measure illustrates the difficulty of regulating the Internet, including changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the 1996 law that enshrined platforms' widespread immunity for what their users post. Even when lawmakers reach a consensus that a change is necessary - as was the case with sex trafficking - the ramifications can be wider than many expect.</p><p>\"It's really a good test case as we're looking at other types of carve-outs to Section 230,\" said Jeff Kosseff, an expert on the Section 230 protections. Lawyers across the country have also fought to limit the protections, arguing they don't apply in cases where a digital product is defective.</p><p>When lawmakers approved the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act last year, it was hailed as a way to catch up to the reality that the bartering of children and adults had moved from the streets to the web. It came after alarming allegations emerged about how Backpage, a classifieds site, may have been playing a role in trafficking.</p><p>Advocates for sex workers warned ahead of the vote in Washington about some of the potential downsides of the law. But they struggled to break through to lawmakers, who were hearing testimony from groups representing trafficking survivors.</p><p>\"It misunderstands the way that trafficking works, if you think that making it less visible reduces the occurrence,\" said Kate D'Adamo, an advocate for sex workers' rights.</p><p>Their concerns have found a broader audience in recent months, even bubbling up on the campaign trail. During a CNN town hall with the Democratic candidates this fall, for example, a questioner asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who had voted for the bill, what she would do to \"counteract the negative impact this law has had.\"</p><p>Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who was one of the few votes against the bill last year, said he believed Congress should have heard more about those concerns. He helped write the new legislation to study the law after hearing more from sex worker advocates.</p><p>\"They didn't hear the perspective of the impact it's having on sex workers,\" he said of his colleagues. \"This is a cautionary tale that we have to be very deliberate, thoughtful, inclusive in how we regulate the internet.\"</p><p>Khanna said that if a study of the law showed harm to sex workers, he hoped it would bolster the case for a repeal of the 2018 law.</p><p>Many supporters of the 2018 law say it has had a positive effect on the Internet and has helped curb sex trafficking. They note that no site has cropped up to replace Backpage, which was taken down as part of a federal criminal case before the law passed.</p><p>McCabe and Conger write</p><p> for The New York Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0106731187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSH-JR81-JBM5-R1G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Australia, along with other G20 countries, has been party to a statement of principles which essentially says the rule of law should apply online as well as offline.\" Mr Fletcher said that while global regulatory action against the big tech firms was needed for a consistent policy approach across jurisdictions, Australia would act alone if necessary.</p><p>\"At the end of the day the Australian government has a responsibility to the Australian people to keep them safe, and we certainly have a set of economic policy objectives, and that is why we are asking a major economic regulator in the agency to look at the operation of internet-based businesses and particularly digital platforms,\" he said.</p><p>In 2017 the then Turnbull government gave in to the demands of struggling television broad-casters to abolish licence fees and lower spectrum costs, but that, combined with dwindling tax revenues, has left a gap in government coffers.</p><p>As an adviser to Howard government communications minister Richard Alston, Mr Fletcher helped devise the \"Alston Determination\" which excluded radio and television programs delivered over the internet from being defined as broadcast.</p><p>That determination has a sunset clause that finishes in October this year, which could open the door to greater revenue streams for the government.</p><p>When asked if a levy could be introduced on streaming services like Netflix to make up the shortfall, Mr Fletcher said there was definitely a rationale for new fees for offshore streamers with oblique tax arrangements.</p><p>\"The changes that we made under Mitch Fifield as minister in relation to the way that the holders of broadcast television licences are regulated was in essence to move them to a treatment where it was more consistent with the way other forms of radio frequency spectrum are dealt with,\" Mr Fletcher said.</p><p>\"You try and have the most consistent approach between different users of that asset. So I can find myself saying I think a principle of competitive neutrality is a very desirable thing.</p><p>\"The more you can have companies that are in the same market subject to broadly the same set of regulatory requirements and obligations the better.\" Digital platforms have been under increasing pressure to justify their use of platforms like Google News and its accompanying dominance in ad revenue, riding on the back of work created by journalists. A report released this week from the US-based New Media Alliance estimated Google made $US4.7 billion from digital publishers in 2018.</p><p>In its submission to the ACCC's final report, News Corp Australia (publisher of The Australian) has suggested breaking up Google's search engine and retail advertising arms in Australia, saying Google was \"threatening and undermining the security of funding of news and journalism (which) strikes at the heart of our system of democracy.\" In his draft report on digital platforms, ACCC chairman Rod Sims said Google and Facebook had \"substantial market power\" in online search, advertising and media markets, which was \"unlikely to erode in the short to medium term\".</p><p>Asked if the Morrison government would break up Google if recommended by the ACCC, Mr Fletcher said: \"I expect there will be recommendations which will be things that we will take account of when it comes to developing policy.\" On the National Broadband Network, Mr Fletcher said the government had no plans for a writedown of the multi-billion-dollar project. Many in the industry were expecting Labor to write down the project if elected, returning the cost to the taxpayer.\"It's something people suggest from time to time but the fact is there are accounting principles that deal with these matters.

Australia, along with other G20 countries, has been party to a statement of principles which essentially says the rule of law should apply online as well as offline.\" Mr Fletcher said that while global regulatory action against the big tech firms was needed for a consistent policy approach across jurisdictions, Australia would act alone if necessary.</p><p>\"At the end of the day the Australian government has a responsibility to the Australian people to keep them safe, and we certainly have a set of economic policy objectives, and that is why we are asking a major economic regulator in the agency to look at the operation of internet-based businesses and particularly digital platforms,\" he said.</p><p>In 2017 the then Turnbull government gave in to the demands of struggling television broad-casters to abolish licence fees and lower spectrum costs, but that, combined with dwindling tax revenues, has left a gap in government coffers.</p><p>As an adviser to Howard government communications minister Richard Alston, Mr Fletcher helped devise the \"Alston Determination\" which excluded radio and television programs delivered over the internet from being defined as broadcast.</p><p>That determination has a sunset clause that finishes in October this year, which could open the door to greater revenue streams for the government.</p><p>When asked if a levy could be introduced on streaming services like Netflix to make up the shortfall, Mr Fletcher said there was definitely a rationale for new fees for offshore streamers with oblique tax arrangements.</p><p>\"The changes that we made under Mitch Fifield as minister in relation to the way that the holders of broadcast television licences are regulated was in essence to move them to a treatment where it was more consistent with the way other forms of radio frequency spectrum are dealt with,\" Mr Fletcher said.</p><p>\"You try and have the most consistent approach between different users of that asset. So I can find myself saying I think a principle of competitive neutrality is a very desirable thing.</p><p>\"The more you can have companies that are in the same market subject to broadly the same set of regulatory requirements and obligations the better.\" Digital platforms have been under increasing pressure to justify their use of platforms like Google News and its accompanying dominance in ad revenue, riding on the back of work created by journalists. A report released this week from the US-based New Media Alliance estimated Google made $US4.7 billion from digital publishers in 2018.</p><p>In its submission to the ACCC's final report, News Corp Australia (publisher of The Australian) has suggested breaking up Google's search engine and retail advertising arms in Australia, saying Google was \"threatening and undermining the security of funding of news and journalism (which) strikes at the heart of our system of democracy.\" In his draft report on digital platforms, ACCC chairman Rod Sims said Google and Facebook had \"substantial market power\" in online search, advertising and media markets, which was \"unlikely to erode in the short to medium term\".</p><p>Asked if the Morrison government would break up Google if recommended by the ACCC, Mr Fletcher said: \"I expect there will be recommendations which will be things that we will take account of when it comes to developing policy.\" On the National Broadband Network, Mr Fletcher said the government had no plans for a writedown of the multi-billion-dollar project.

But are they too big and powerful? And have they used their clout improperly? It's good to see Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody joining her peers from other states to probe those questions. It's time for answers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forty-eight attorneys general jointly announced an investigation into Google and its business practices on Monday. Moody was among those who joined Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a fellow Republican whose state is leading this effort, on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, where he said Google \"dominates all aspects of advertising on the Internet and searching on the Internet.\" For now, this is an investigation, not a lawsuit. That's the right course, but it's also proper to let the facts lead where they may. This follows Friday's news that Facebook is facing similar scrutiny by eight states, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, in an antitrust investigation. Moody, again, has correctly brought Florida into that action.</p><p>The probes of the two tech giants likely will be somewhat different. Potential rivals accuse Facebook of smothering competition by paying a premium to buy start-ups that could pose a threat, effectively cornering the market. They point to Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram, the photo-sharing app, and WhatsApp, the global messaging app, as examples. Facebook has done itself no favors by failing to properly acknowledge its responsibilities during the Russian misinformation campaigns of the 2016 presidential election and other episodes. Similarly, it has created distrust by its failure to safeguard user data. Users should know if their data is private or not. A vigorous investigation will shed more light on these issues.</p><p>Google is likely going to have to explain to regulators how its search function - which, after all, is now a verb - doesn't give it monopoly powers. Google.com is the most-visited website in the world, and a recent online search analysis shows that more than half of Google searches never leave Google at all, a threshold that was crossed just this summer. They don't result in a click to another site. Such a walled-in garden, competitors say, deprives them of clicks that lead to cash. Google makes most of its money from digital ads, a market that it dominates. Google's Android operating system for smartphones is free, but the company requires phone manufacturers to give its search engine priority of place. Google claims that it favors competition. A full investigation would make clear if that's true.</p><p>Big Tech has wrought massive changes in all of our lives, and not all of it is positive. It's hard to imagine a world without smartphones and computers that can answer queries with a few keystrokes or social networks that connect us with friends and family. Yet those changes have come at a cost, even if users haven't paid the price in cash. Those corporations have made massive amounts of money profiting from our personal information, and it's time to investigate how those high-tech companies conduct business, whether they treat private data with due care and whether they exert monopoly powers over competitors and users. It's smart that Moody has gotten Florida a seat at the table in both of these cases.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STPETE-510631657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STPETE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1D-YCH1-JCBJ-Y1WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Times Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tampa Bay Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31675\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>4st Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The commission's rollback of net neutrality rules were ''arbitrary and capricious,'' the attorneys general said, and a reversal of the agency's longstanding policy to prevent internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for faster delivery of content to consumers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the Firefox web browser, said the new F.C.C. rules would harm internet entrepreneurs who could be forced to pay fees for faster delivery of their content and services to consumers. A similar argument was made by another group that filed a suit, the Open Technology Institute, a part of a liberal think tank, the New America Foundation.</p><p>  Suits were also filed on Tuesday by Free Press and Public Knowledge, two public interest groups. Four of the suits were filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Free Press suit was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</p><p>  ''The repeal of net neutrality would turn internet service providers into gatekeepers -- allowing them to put profits over consumers while controlling what we see, what we do, and what we say online,'' said Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, who led the suit by the state officials.</p><p>  The lawsuits have long been expected. The filings on Tuesday, petitions to begin the suits, kick off what is expected to be an extended legal and political debate about the future of internet policy.</p><p>  Democrats have rallied to fight the F.C.C.'s repeal of net neutrality, which was passed in a 3-to-2 party line vote in December. The agency is led by Ajit Pai, a Republican nominated by President Trump. All of the attorneys general involved in the suit filed on Tuesday are Democrats.</p><p>  The lawsuits have the support of the Internet Association, a trade group representing big tech firms including Google and Netflix, giving the various legal challenges financial support and the clout of companies. The companies say internet service providers have the incentive to block and throttle their sites in order to garner extra fees.</p><p>  The F.C.C. declined to comment on the suits. But it did point to a part of its order that prohibits legal challenges until the new rules are submitted into the federal registry. The F.C.C. is expected to enter the new rules into the federal registry in the coming days or weeks.</p><p>  The states said they could file a petition to the United States Court of Appeals, starting the process to determine which court would hear the case. That is the action the attorneys general, as well as Mozilla and the Open Technology Institute, took on Tuesday.</p><p>  The states that signed onto the lawsuit include California, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts and Oregon, as well as the District of Columbia. Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said the decision to roll back the agency's declaration of broadband as a utility-like service will harm consumers.</p><p>  ''Internet access is a utility -- just like water and electricity,'' Mr. Becerra said in a statement. ''And every consumer has a right to access online content without interference or manipulation by their internet service provider.''</p><p>  In a release, Mr. Schneiderman said the agency's roll back disregarded a record of evidence that internet service providers' could harm consumers without rules. A similar argument was made by Mozilla.</p><p>  ''Ending net neutrality could end the internet as we know it,'' said Denelle Dixon, Mozilla's chief business and legal officer in a blog post. ''That's why we are committed to fighting the order. In particular, we filed our petition today because we believe the recent F.C.C. decision violates both federal law as well as harms internet users and innovators.''</p><p>  The issue of net neutrality has been fought in court challenges twice before in the past decade. The rules adopted in 2015, which set rules that sites could not be blocked or throttled, were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals in 2016 after legal challenges by telecom companies. The F.C.C. vote in December was to roll back those 2015 rules.</p><p>  The new lawsuits are among several efforts to restore net neutrality rules. On Tuesday, Senate Democrats announced they were one supporter away from winning a vote to restore net neutrality rules. All 49 members of their caucus, as well as one Republican, have signed on to a resolution to overturn the rules. A similar effort initiated in the House has the support of 80 members.</p><p>  Success by members of Congress is unlikely, particularly in the House, where Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, would have to agree to bring the resolution to a vote. The president will also have to agree to the resolutions, if they were passed, but the White House has expressed its support of the rollback of net neutrality rules.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-763748180117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RF1-5XN1-JBG3-60JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/technology/net-neutrality-lawsuit-attorneys-general.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/technology/net-neutrality-lawsuit-attorneys-general.html</url><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 17, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The commission\u2019s rollback of net neutrality rules were \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d the attorneys general said, and a reversal of the agency\u2019s longstanding policy to prevent internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for faster delivery of content to consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the Firefox web browser, said the new F.C.C. rules would harm internet entrepreneurs who could be forced to pay fees for faster delivery of their content and services to consumers. A similar argument was made by another group that filed a suit, the Open Technology Institute, a part of a liberal think tank, the New America Foundation.</p><p>Suits were also filed on Tuesday by Free Press and Public Knowledge, two public interest groups. Four of the suits were filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Free Press suit was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</p><p>\u201cThe repeal of net neutrality would turn internet service providers into gatekeepers \u2014 allowing them to put profits over consumers while controlling what we see, what we do, and what we say online,\u201d said Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, who led the suit by the state officials.</p><p>The lawsuits have long been expected. The filings on Tuesday, petitions to begin the suits, kick off what is expected to be an extended legal and political debate about the future of internet policy.</p><p>Democrats have rallied to fight the F.C.C.\u2019s repeal of net neutrality, which was passed in a 3-to-2 party line vote in December. The agency is led by Ajit Pai, a Republican nominated by President Trump. All of the attorneys general involved in the suit filed on Tuesday are Democrats.</p><p>The lawsuits have the support of the Internet Association, a trade group representing big tech firms including Google and Netflix, giving the various legal challenges financial support and the clout of companies. The companies say internet service providers have the incentive to block and throttle their sites in order to garner extra fees.</p><p>The F.C.C. declined to comment on the suits. But it did point to a part of its order that prohibits legal challenges until the new rules are submitted into the federal registry. The F.C.C. is expected to enter the new rules into the federal registry in the coming days or weeks.</p><p>The states said they could file a petition to the United States Court of Appeals, starting the process to determine which court would hear the case. That is the action the attorneys general, as well as Mozilla and the Open Technology Institute, took on Tuesday.</p><p>The states that signed onto the lawsuit include California, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts and Oregon, as well as the District of Columbia. Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said the decision to roll back the agency\u2019s declaration of broadband as a utility-like service will harm consumers.</p><p>\u201cInternet access is a utility \u2014 just like water and electricity,\u201d Mr. Becerra said in a statement. \u201cAnd every consumer has a right to access online content without interference or manipulation by their internet service provider.\u201d</p><p>In a release, Mr. Schneiderman said the agency\u2019s roll back disregarded a record of evidence that internet service providers\u2019 could harm consumers without rules. A similar argument was made by Mozilla.</p><p>\u201cEnding net neutrality could end the internet as we know it,\u201d said Denelle Dixon, Mozilla\u2019s chief business and legal officer in a blog post. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are committed to fighting the order. In particular, we filed our petition today because we believe the recent F.C.C. decision violates both federal law as well as harms internet users and innovators.\u201d</p><p>The issue of net neutrality has been fought in court challenges twice before in the past decade. The rules adopted in 2015, which set rules that sites could not be blocked or throttled, were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals in 2016 after legal challenges by telecom companies. The F.C.C. vote in December was to roll back those 2015 rules.</p><p>The new lawsuits are among several efforts to restore net neutrality rules. On Tuesday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/technology/senate-net-neutrality.html\">Senate Democrats announced</url> they were one supporter away from winning a vote to restore net neutrality rules. All 49 members of their caucus, as well as one Republican, have signed on to a resolution to overturn the rules. A similar effort initiated in the House has the support of 80 members.</p><p>Success by members of Congress is unlikely, particularly in the House, where Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, would have to agree to bring the resolution to a vote. The president will also have to agree to the resolutions, if they were passed, but the White House has expressed its support of the rollback of net neutrality rules.</p><p>PHOTO: Eric Schneiderman, New York State\u2019s attorney general, is leading a lawsuit to block the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s repeal of net neutrality regulations.

Sidney Powell writing and even harsher critique of Gleeson, accusing him of conducting a wrap up smear against Flynn that demonstrates the difference between the Department of Prosecutions and the Department of Justice.</p><p>Powell concluded in her argument that the only lawful action left for the court to take is to dismiss in its entirety, the case against General Flynn.</p><p>And more breaking news from the Department of Justice. They are now recommending that lawmakers strip away all legal protections for Big Tech giants including Twitter, Facebook and Google. Those protections fall under the Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. A law supported and defended by Republicans and Democrats alike for decades.</p><p>Under that law, Big Tech companies have found safe harbor from any lawsuits arising from user generated content or their decisions to censor what appears on their platforms. In other words, they have had the best of all world's Big Tech and social media.</p><p>The Justice Department now says it's time for change, partly because, quote, \"Criminals and other wrongdoers are increasingly turning to online platforms to engage in a host of unlawful activities, including child sexual exploitation, selling illicit drugs, cyber stalking, human trafficking, and terrorism.\"</p><p>The President has been wanting to bring this suit for years. He campaigned in 2016 against Big Tech's awesome, immense power.</p><p>Last month, President Trump signed an Executive Order directly addressing the partisan activism of social media platforms, calling their censorship practices one of the greatest threats to free speech, and those practices practice primarily against conservatives.</p><p>It is a view shared by Attorney General William Barr and here is what he had to say last week on this matter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, I think there are clearly, these entities are now engaged in censorship and they originally held themselves out as an open forum where people -- third parties -- could come and express their views and they have built up a tremendous network of eyeballs.</p><p>They have got a lot of market power based on that presentation, and now, they are acting much more like publishers, because they're censoring particular viewpoints and putting their own content in there to diminish the impact of various people's views.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: How powerful have those platforms become? Big Tech -- how powerful has it become? Only the Federal government has sufficient power to be a countervailing influence against those platforms and those tech firms.</p><p>Social media has a clear cut bias against conservatives. Conservatives have long complained about their blatant bias, whether on the part of TwitterFacebook, Google. In an astonishing development yesterday, an activist group linked to the U.K.'s leftwing Labour Party was partly responsible for Google threatening to block ads of ZeroHedge and \"The Federalist.\"</p><p>NBC reporter did, as it turns out, erroneously, a story in which it claimed Google had banned ads of \"The Federalist\" over policy violations found in the comments section of stories about recent Black Lives Matter protests. NBC says those policy violations were compiled by the Center for Countering Digital Hate and shared with Google.</p><p>\"The Federalists\" ads, however, have not been blacklisted nor banned by Google. They have been warned of a possible suspension by Google of those ads because of the policy violations, they say in its comment section.</p><p>Google effectively now in control of a substantial portion of \"The Federalist\" content and its revenue, and that's only one example of Big Tech's giant and ever growing power. It is obvious that Big Tech and Silicon Valley intend to exert even more of that power over Americans First Amendment rights and not less.</p><p>James Baker, the former F.B.I. General Counsel, involved in many ways and levels with the Deep State's efforts to overthrow the President has now been hired by Twitter to act as their Deputy General Counsel. This is the same man who helped craft a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign who will now be involved in defending Twitter's decisions, to quote, \"censor and fact check\" the very same President.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says his social media plans to get four million people to register to vote this year, Zuckerberg also defended Facebook's decision not to fact check political ads saying the best way to hold politicians accountable is through voting.</p><p>Big Tech's foray into politics is nothing new. Between 2005 and 2018, the likes of Microsoft and Google and Facebook and Amazon spent a half billion dollars or more lobbying Congress and sending money to candidates on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>One senator says that should stop. He is Senator Josh Hawley, and today he introduced a Bill that would allow users to sue Big Tech. His Bill would put companies on notice for the user's legal fees and require them to pay a $5,000.00 fine.</p><p>Senator Hawley, however, doesn't seem confident his Bill will pass.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): I mean, I hope that -- I hope we will be able to debate it and vote on the floor of the Senate. This is obviously something, with the President being censored by Twitter effectively with conservative websites like \"The Federalist\" being deplatformed by Google just yesterday. This is a pressing importance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, his concerns and skepticism are well placed and the pressing issue of constraining technology oligarchs and their trillions of dollars in market power and influence is one that at this point, only the Federal government, as I said, has the power to constrain.</p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer today on Capitol Hill, testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee today, he dismissed any plans for the United States to decouple from Communist China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE SECRETARY: I think that was a policy option years ago, I don't think it's a policy -- a reasonable policy option at this point.</p><p>So -- but I think that you will see supply chains come back as a result of U.S. policy, including the kinds of things that you all did in the Tax Bill, but also with a regulatory space that the President has done, as well as the tariffs that we put in place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: While the Trade Representative using ambiguous language, if he was intending to assert whether the People's Republic of China is meeting its obligations under the Phase 1 Trade Treaty, all he would say with any specificity is that they are quite on track to meet their obligations, not that they are doing so currently.</p><p>And in declaring that decoupling from China is not a policy option of the Trump administration that statement is clear and its implications, namely, that the United States as of right now has no volition over what nations it will do business with nor under what terms.</p><p>Perhaps even worse, it can be interpreted as saying China will decide whether we do business with China irrespective of the number of Americans they choose to infect with a deadly virus, and without warning. It further means the United States has no volition, perhaps no stomach to hold accountable the Communist Chinese for the deaths of more than a hundred thousand Americans, when President Xi chose not to warn the world of the deadly contagion it unleashed six months ago.</p><p>In other words, it is not an overstatement to say the Trump administration did not have a good day on Capitol Hill, nor did America.</p><p>In an editorial today, \"The Wall Street Journal\" joining the chorus of globalist elites in asking President Trump to increase the number of foreign workers in the United States. Claiming those workers are what this economic recovery needs, despite the fact we have more than 40 million Americans right now unemployed who've lost their jobs because of that China virus pandemic.</p><p>\"The Wall Street Journal\" used the tired canard that foreign workers are needed, because Americans just won't do jobs like picking produce or processing craft. \"The Journal\" also used a 2004 study -- timely, isn't it -- a 2004 study to claim that limiting H-1B visas actually reduces employment opportunities for American workers. That is hardly an established relationship or correlation, and certainly not a cause.</p><p>Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies points to a 2016 study by researchers of the University of Notre Dame, UC Berkeley and the U.S. Treasury Department, a study that found, quote, \"Winning additional H- 1B visas causes at most, a moderate increase in firm's overall employment, and these H-1Bs therefore substantially crowd out firms employment other workers.\"</p><p>And that, quote, \"There is evidence that additional H-1Bs lead to lower average employee earnings and higher firm profits.\" Ah. We're getting to the heart of the thing, aren't we? And according to the Center for Immigration Studies, foreign workers, who have received a non-United States college degree have roughly the same literacy skills as our American high school graduates.</p><p>So, when people tell you we need their skills, you might think about this next element. In Math Americans with a college degree are far more skilled than immigrants with a foreign degree.</p><p>All ignored, of course, by the advocates for more guest workers, H-1B visas and so forth.</p><p>On Wall Street today, stocks finished mix. The Dow down 170 points. The S&amp;P lost 11. The NASDAQ gained 15. Volume on the big board dropping to 4.6 billion shares today.</p><p>Crude oil down two percent to $37.60 a barrel and a reminder to listen to my reports three times a day, coast-to-coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Up next, John Bolton continues to carry out acts of betrayal against his former boss, saying House Dems should have done more during their sham impeachment investigation.</p><p>Jason Chaffetz has a few thoughts about the former National Security Adviser and his betrayals. Jason Chaffetz joins me when we come back. Please stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Former National Security Adviser John Bolton's betrayal of the President he served goes on. Today, \"The New York Times\" reported in his new book, Bolton claims the radical Dems should have looked into the President's dealings with Turkey and China during their sham impeachment inquiries.</p><p>Bolton alleged President Trump trying to curry favor with Turkish President Erdogan and Chinese President Xi by intervening in several investigations. It's only in Paragraph 20 of a 21-page story that \"The Times\" does report Bolton doesn't know exactly what happened at those times and those episodes, nor was he sure they were even -- well, offenses -- but they still, he says should have been investigated by House Democrats.</p><p>That's the level you could expect from this little literary masterpiece of John Bolton's.</p><p>Here is White House Press Secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, her response today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAYLEIGH, MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: What I would note is this book is full of classified information, which is inexcusable. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton should know all too well that it's unacceptable to have highly classified information from the government of the United States in a book that will be published, it's unacceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Unacceptable, but it's ongoing. Joining us now former Congressman, former Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz, also Fox Business contributor.</p><p>Jason, good to have you with us. What do you make of John Bolton and his encouragement of the sham impeachment inquiry to look into things that he doesn't even know about?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: I'm terribly disappointed in John Bolton. He was supposed to be the career professional who could come in there as an adult and be the National Security Adviser. But I've got to tell you, the antics and the ranting and raving that he is doing in trying to publish this book to line his own pockets at the expense of national security, that's just not acceptable.</p><p>And you know, one thing I want them to go back and look at, Lou, it's amazing how John Bolton leaves and now we have the very competent Robert O'Brien in as the National Security Adviser, and guess what? We don't have the same type of leaking that we did when John Bolton was the National Security Adviser.</p><p>Remember, all those calls that were going out the door? The information that was flowing out to these media sources? \"The New York Times\" now has more Bolton information. Maybe we're looking at the source of those, it's at least something they should look at in terms of the leaking.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it's an excellent point and Bolton has a lot to answer for and the list gets longer every day. He is an extraordinary, extraordinarily disappointing, petty and vindictive person. It's just -- it's sad to see what perhaps he always was, but certainly what he has become.</p><p>Let's turn to the Pompeo meeting. Why are we being kept in the dark about what the Chinese and the Secretary of State are meeting about? This is annoying as hell as you might guess, to someone who works in media.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, I don't know exactly what they're going to be talking about. I have a great deal of trust in Secretary Pompeo. There are a lot of high level talks that need to happen.</p><p>I've got to tell you, I don't like what was happening on Capitol Hill today. That did disturb me. But I think we need to see what the result of these Pompeo meetings are.</p><p>I think dialogue is good in general. I want there to be good, strong dialogue back and forth, and we'll see what comes of it.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let's take a look at what was happening and part of it happening with the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has been the lead in these negotiations, he and Secretary Mnuchin with the Chinese.</p><p>He said that decoupling with the Chinese is not a policy option for the Trump administration. Your reaction to that statement?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, that's all what the President had campaigned on. It's not what he did for the three and a half years. The President took the very reasonable stance and said, what's fair with China is going to be fair with us. It's got to be fair. It's got to be reciprocal. And if they're not going to play fair, then hey, we're not going to allow you access to our markets.</p><p>I think that is a reasonable approach, and something that he has taken a pretty good hardline stance on, to back off of that in some obscure hearing on Capitol Hill sends the wrong message to the Chinese to their U.S. personnel and people like Mr. Pompeo, I don't know if this is planned or planned for by the President, but it seems like Mark Meadows, maybe the Chief of Staff needs to have a little discussion with Mr. Lighthizer and what happened there on Capitol Hill.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it looks like if, if he, Lighthizer, has had a record of saying exactly what he means, the extension of what he said is that the United States is no longer a sovereign nation. We're incapable of making a decision who we do business with. We will not be holding anyone accountable for the death of a hundred thousand Americans, the infection of two million more.</p><p>We're no longer a sovereign nation and might as well turn over his sword and surrender to the Chinese, and I am not -- I hope you understand -- indulging in hyperbole here. This is absolutely devastating to the base what was said by Lighthizer on Capitol Hill today.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Oh, it was. It was totally foreign to the policy in the position and part of the reason a lot of people voted for Donald Trump in the first place. So, we'll see where it goes from here.</p><p>I mean, I was just reading stories today about some illicit cash, some forged $1.00 bills that were just flooding into our markets. Again, the source being the Chinese. We'll see if that plays out and if that is true. But the Secret Service is working on that as well.</p><p>So add that to the ongoing and long, long list of things and issues and problems and challenges we have with the Chinese. We should take a tougher stance and negotiate our right position, not just lay down and die in front of the United States Congress and say, \"Oh, well.\"</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. You know, it seems to be exactly that, Jason. Let's hope that you and I are both wrong about that. We're going to have to believe our lying eyes and ears to this point.</p><p>Jason, thanks so much. Good to have you with us, Jason Chaffetz.</p><p>We'd like to hear your thoughts about all of this. Share your comments follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, and like me on Facebook. Follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>A programming note, investigative reporter John Solomon, Dr. Michael Pillsbury, among our guests here tomorrow evening. Please join us for those gentlemen and our other guests as well of course.</p><p>And up next here tonight, Red Storm Rising: China's increased aggression across Asia without response by the United States. Now, one congressman is working to block U.S. investments in China's military. Jim Banks joins us next.</p><p>DOBBS: The Communist Chinese continue to ratchet up their aggression throughout the Pacific-Asia region, and specifically now, over the skies of Taiwan.</p><p>Two of China's aircraft, the J-10 and X-8 -- there you see them -- entered Taiwan's airspace today, and were chased away and warned by Taiwanese fighter jets. This is the fourth time that China has overflown Taiwan airspace over the course of the past nine days.</p><p>A top People's Liberation Army General recently said China could take Taiwan by force, and must quote, \"resolutely smash any separatist moves by the nation of Taiwan.\"</p><p>Mike Pompeo is in Honolulu, Hawaii to meet with China's Foreign Affairs head. That meeting scheduled for 3:00 p.m. Eastern. We have received absolutely no information about today's talks being held at Hickam Air Force Base. No details of the agenda of the talks nor exactly who is attending that meeting.</p><p>It's an extraordinary -- an extraordinary meeting in the regard that we know absolutely nothing about what is going on. And joining us tonight and yes, that's right, I'm absolutely furious about that.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Congressman Jim Banks, a member of the Republican China Taskforce, as well as the House Armed Services Committee. He introduced Bills to stop U.S. investment and China's military as well as demanding reparations from China.</p><p>Congressman, always good to have you with us. I want to get first your reaction to the idea that a meeting would be held -- I guess we're supposed to send a thank you note to the administration that they would at least let us know that the meeting was being held.</p><p>I mean, this is really outside the tradition of U.S. government foreign policy, particularly foreign policy meetings. It's outrageous. The public right to know is no longer a right in this country.</p><p>REP. JIM BANKS (R-IN): Well, Lou, what we do know is that the Chinese requested the meeting. Like you, I'm eager to hear how the meeting went between Secretary Pompeo and Chinese officials in Honolulu.</p><p>Hopefully, we will learn here soon what happened, what was agreed to in that meeting. But the bottom line of what gives me some comfort in knowing that President Trump has continued to get the attention of the Chinese is that they requested the meeting with Secretary Pompeo. They are meeting with them soon.</p><p>Like you, I look forward to hearing how it went.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, I admire the positivity you express, but I think it sort of ignores these flyovers of Taiwan, the aggression by China and the PLA, throughout the South China Sea. I mean, it's becoming their lake. Let's be straightforward about this.</p><p>This is not a President who wants it to be said that the South China Sea was lost to China in his presidency. This is outrageous conduct we are witnessing by China. Period. Simple as it can be.</p><p>And what we are seeing at every turn, whether it's killing a hundred thousand Americans, infecting four million people around -- eight million people around the world, 400,000 deaths around the world. There's not a single bloody damn response to any of it.</p><p>Everything is just fine today on Capitol Hill, telling your colleagues, Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative that decoupling from China is not a policy option for this administration. Are you kidding me? What in hell is there to be optimistic about?</p><p>What is -- how in the world can we even account for ourselves being responsive to the aggression of this outrageous Xi Jinping led China?</p><p>BANKS: Not to mention, Lou, what's occurring on the China-Indian border at the moment, as well. I spoke with the Ambassador from India to the United States today and spoke with him about India standing up to China. And here's what he told me, he said we will not be bullied by China.</p><p>And those were words that like you, I wish we would hear from more American leaders today for the same reasons. I mean, this is how a powerful authoritarian regime like China operates. Yes, go ahead.</p><p>DOBBS: I'm sorry to interrupt you. I'm sitting here thinking General Milley, the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is more concerned by making a rather noxious and untrue statement and apologizing for what? I mean, it's just -- it's insane what the military has turned into. And this -- and it's swapping, if you will, this administration apparently.</p><p>BANKS: I concur with you, Lou, every bit of it. We know what China is up to. This is an authoritarian regime with global domination on their mind. That is their ambition. We can't turn a blind eye to it.</p><p>The Ambassador from India told me today they will not be bullied by China and we shouldn't be bullied by China, either. Like you, I can't believe what I heard from Ambassador Lighthizer today. It's not consistent with what this President has vowed to do in holding China accountable. What he's done recently to delist Chinese companies from the Stock Exchange, to ban Chinese students that are associated with the Chinese Communist Party, threatening sanctions and tariffs on China.</p><p>This President has remained tough. Members of his administration at times have like, Lighthizer have been inconsistent with that message. It's not acceptable, and I can't imagine that this President is pleased with what he heard from the Ambassador before the Ways and Means Committee today.</p><p>DOBBS: One can't imagine it. One can't imagine that Lighthizer would have ever mouthed such words. The man that I thought I knew wouldn't have. Congressman Jim banks. You get the last word here. At this juncture, where are we headed with China in your judgment?</p><p>BANKS: Well, we've got to be tough. We've got to hold them accountable. That's what the China Task Force is exploring and exactly how we can do that, I can assure you that there are many members in the Republican Conference in Congress who are studying ways that we can do exactly the opposite of what Lighthizer was saying that we're doing and how we decouple the American economy from China, so that we're not left to the whims of the Chinese authoritarian leadership's ambitions to dominate the United States of America any longer.</p><p>That's what I'm committed to, Lou and that's what I'll be focused on in the days and weeks to come in the Congress.</p><p>DOBBS: This is a President who is historic in large measure, because he has kept his word and kept his promises and held faith with each of them. To see where he is right now, whether at the Council of his senior advisers, clever fellows all, or simply a direct pipeline to Wall Street into the Oval Office. I don't know. But it is -- there are storm clouds over that Oval Office right now.</p><p>Congressman Jim Banks, good to have you with us. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Up next, the American people aren't buying into the radical leftist plans to defund police departments. Bob Woodson is the former head of the National Urban League's Department of Criminal Justice. He joins us here next. You don't want to miss a word this man says.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, if there were a time to worry about this nation and our direction, it appears that this is one of those times.</p><p>Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan says the Seattle Police Department will not enter the zone styled as Capitol Hill Organized Protest or CHOP, except in the event of a, quote, \"significant life safety issue,\" whatever that is.</p><p>The police define a life safety issue as, \"An active shooter, an assault, structure fire or a significant medical emergency like a heart attack or stroke,\" end quote.</p><p>But since the radical left has taken over those city blocks, police response time is more than tripled in the precinct, including the so-called CHOP. So, not much of what she's saying has much relevance.</p><p>The radical left has been leading the charge for weeks to defund the police department. The message not catching on with the American people for some reason.</p><p>According to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, by a two to one margin, American voters oppose the defunding of the police department. Fifty seven percent to 29 percent, 43 percent say they're strongly opposed to that so- called movement -- not much of a movement.</p><p>Joining us now is Bob Woodson, former Civil Rights activist. He's the founder of the Woodson Center, which helps residents of low income neighborhoods. And Bob, were delighted to have you with us to talk about all that's going on.</p><p>First, your reaction if we may to this organized protests they are now styling it in Seattle, the leftwing activist groups, your thoughts about the way the city is handling it, the Governor handling it as well.</p><p>ROBERT WOODSON, FOUNDER, WOODSON INSTITUTE: Well, it's really organized anarchy, but this is a part of a long struggle, Lou, that goes back 60 years where low income blacks are America's silent victim, and they have been victimized and exploited by the left using the legitimate concerns about racial discrimination in America as the battering ram, and they use those miseries of low income black as the bait, and switch occurs when the resources arrived.</p><p>And so what is happening is that they have, for instance, one of the demands of Black Lives Matter out there in Seattle, is that all violent offenders -- black offenders -- to get a retrial and what they're advocating is destructive to the very people they say they're doing -- they are trying to help.</p><p>For the blacks in the cities, actually, Lou, there's a close correlation between police withdrawing from these communities when they're covering the riots. It means there are fewer police around to protect people, and since the police are being accused of being racist, they are reluctant to enforce the laws at low income high crime areas as vigorously as they would at other times.</p><p>For instance, St. Louis, last summer, 14 young people under the age of 14, were killed within three months and only one arrest made. They call it the Ferguson effect.</p><p>And so the more police withdraw, the higher the murder rate goes up in the black community. So, the black community low income blacks are being injured by the helping hands of those who supposed to be their champions. And that's what harming the most --</p><p>DOBBS: Is it going too far to say that those are the -- I'm sorry, go ahead, Bob.</p><p>WOODSON: No, go ahead, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Is it going too far to say that the black community, the poorest among them, in our inner cities are being exploited by the Democratic activists for purposes that don't include their own safety and welfare.</p><p>WOODSON: It is coming at the expense. It's like people being paid to solve a problem that they helped create. One of the things that was a strength of the black community, when slavery ended in 1865, there was a study done by one of our 1776 scholars that documented that 75 percent of those slaves on six major plantations have 75 percent of their families had a man and a woman raising children.</p><p>And that solid black family continued for another hundred years through virulent racism and discrimination. And up until 1965, eighty five percent of all blacks families had a man and a woman raising children. In fact, on the 10 years of the depression from 1930 to 1940, black Americans had a higher marriage rate than any other group in the nation. Elderly people could walk safely without fear of being mugged by their grandchildren.</p><p>That's because of our Christian values and a nuclear family, and that has been destroyed in 1965 ...</p><p>DOBBS: That's extraordinary.</p><p>WOODSON: ... with the poverty programs. We went from 85 percent of families down to 30 percent, Lou, that the welfare system destroy -- did more destruction to black America than anything that discrimination did.</p><p>And so for them to say that the problems of inequity in these cities are attributed to institutional racism is being used -- so race is being used as a ruse because it prevents us from asking more critical questions such as, if racism were the culprit, then why are blacks are failing in systems run by their own people?</p><p>DOBBS: It has, as Bob Woodson has pointed out for a very long time. We're going to continue with Bob Woodson here on the other side of this commercial break.</p><p>And amongst the many questions I'd like to take up with him are a number of questions surrounding his \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed. Also, I would like to ask why it is that inner cities are not more mobile. Why is one of the great characteristics of this great free enterprise capitalist system of ours is mobility of working men and women. Why in the world haven't we done more to be certain that there's broader assimilation for those who need most of all -- jobs and opportunity?</p><p>We'll be back to talk about that with Bob Woodson. Please stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: We're back with former Civil Rights activist, Bob Woodson. He is the President of the Woodson Center. Bob, it's great to have you with us tonight and thank you for being here.</p><p>I want to ask you about mobility and how critical it is as part of the solution in terms of poverty, in terms of the opportunity that we're trying to create for all citizens in this country.</p><p>WOODSON: Well, you have to understand that any minority group participation in the economy depends upon their small business formation rate.</p><p>A healthy economy generates two and a half businesses per thousand people per year. The business formation rate in the black community is more like three businesses per hundred thousand per year. Plus, we do not have -- where only 30 percent of the families have a man and a woman raising children.</p><p>But in the days of, for instance, in 1929, in Chicago, for instance, you had a lot of mobility. Even in face of redlining in Chicago's Southside, there was 731,000 businesses in Chicago, $100 million in real estate assets alone in the Bronzeville section of Chicago with an out-of-wedlock birth of only 15 percent.</p><p>And so, when you have money and you your ability to move. There was a great migration from the south to the north. Again, it has to do with income and family composition. And so if we have accomplished these successes in the midst of discrimination, the question is, why can't we do it now in cities that are controlled by black politicians for the past 50 years? And talk about institutional racism --</p><p>DOBBS: Yes and when we look at black politicians who will --</p><p>WOODSON: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Right. Right. And when we talk about black politicians, we are also talking about Democratic politicians in so many of these cities where we saw so much protest turn to violence, to vandalism, rioting, they are Democratically-run cities with programmatic efforts for years, for decades without result.</p><p>What are the solutions, Bob? We've got a few minutes here to talk about solutions.</p><p>WOODSON: The solutions -- the solutions have to occur from within. If you say that 70 percent of the families are raising children that are dropping out of school and jail and drug, it means 30 percent on that.</p><p>What the Woodson Center does, we go into those low income communities, and we find out what is happening among the 30 percent, assist them. They are the social entrepreneurs, the healing agents.</p><p>We have examples that when you invest in those entrepreneurs, you invest in these neighborhood leaders, you can create islands of excellence. Pastor Buster Soaries in Somerset, New Jersey, has taken his church in the last 20 years and has demonstrated when you take old values and replace them in a new vision and involves the people, you can transform of an entire community from the inside out as a hedge against gentrification.</p><p>And so there are models, but we must invest, not in those who are -- Black Lives Matters picking up $100 million in the name of helping low income people. If a fraction of that were invested in institutions within their communities, we have groups like the Alliance of Concerned Men in Washington that has created zones of peace among very troubled communities.</p><p>In other words, we must build on the entrepreneurial spirit that abides in all low income communities, recognize that we need to strengthen these communities so they can begin to reform, redeem and rebuild from the inside out.</p><p>But we cannot do that as long as we are transfixed on race, and we are saying that the cause of that despair is institutional racism. It is an institutional racism that is retarding this movement, it is institutional betrayal by those who have been empowered and trusted to lead these cities. That's the problem.</p><p>Bigotry isn't as bad as betrayal.</p><p>DOBBS: And with that, we are out of time, Bob, but I would like to make an offer to. I'd like to take up these issues as frequently as we can have you on this broadcast. I'd like to give you a portion of it every week for us to talk about solutions.</p><p>WOODSON: Oh, my goodness.</p><p>DOBBS: And we would be delighted if you would consider that offer. Bob, that's it for tonight. I have to say thank you.</p><p>WOODSON: I am flattered beyond means, Lou. Just flattered.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, we're appreciative beyond means. Thanks so much, Bob. Good to have you with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Jason Chaffetz tonight blasted John Bolton for undercutting America's national security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm terribly disappointed in John Bolton. He was supposed to be the career professional who could come in there as an adult and be the National Security Adviser.</p><p>But I've got to tell you, the antics and the ranting and raving that he is doing in trying to publish this book to line his own pockets at the expense of national security, that's just is not acceptable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And that's it for us tonight. Investigative reporter, John Solomon, justthenews.com editor and Dr. Michael Pillsbury among our guests here tomorrow. We will take up China. What is going on?</p><p>Thanks for being with us tonight.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2020061701cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6059-KNP1-JB20-G514-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5944\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

ACTING DIRECTOR: I like to fix things, and I think they'll get back on track.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Ronald, it was great to have you. Unfortunately, we are out of time, but we'll have you back again soon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Jackie DeAngelis, in for Liz MacDonald. You are watching \"The Evening Edit\" on Fox Business. And that does it for us. Thanks and have a great evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST, LOU DOBBS TONIGHT: Good evening, everybody. President Trump this hour is set to hold a news conference in the White House Briefing Room. We've received no guidance yet from the White House as to what he will be addressing. We will be bringing you the President's remarks as soon as he takes the podium.</p><p>A reminder, I will be interviewing President Trump next week. The President hasn't decided exactly which day, but as soon as we know, we'll be telling you precisely which day so just join us all five days and be safe and enjoy the interview.</p><p>As we await the President, the radical left's persecution of his former National Security Adviser, General Michael Flan has taken yet on another extraordinary and unprecedented twist. The full D.C. Appellate Court today announced that they will be re-examining the Justice Department's decision to drop its prosecution of General Flynn.</p><p>They activist Clinton appointed judge who is overseeing this case for two years, the District Court Judge who asked the Appellate Court to take the unprecedented action of reviewing the entire case, Judge Emmet Sullivan.</p><p>A recent ruling from three judges on that same Appellate Court ruled that the case should be dismissed, but the full court has now reversed them as well without basis in law, without precedent anywhere in our court system, and has set oral arguments for August 11th to effectively retry General Flynn and to extend further the judiciary's persecution of him, as if three years has not been more than enough to watch as a corrupt -- politically corrupt Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation needed the help of the leftwing judges who make up the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p>Seven of those 11 judges appointed by either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. That's right. This is an obvious and outrageous, politically motivated and politically corrupt judiciary. Seven of the 11 judges leftwing and acting as if they constituted a leftwing organization.</p><p>It is a disturbing trend to say the least, emerging in our legal system. Progressive groups and leftwing billionaires like George Soros are packing courthouses and district attorney's offices with leftwing sympathetic judges and prosecutors all across the country. All who support the radical left's agenda, and in most cases, support the violence in America's Democrat-run cities.</p><p>St. Louis Circuit Attorney -- called a District Attorney in most regions -- Kim Gardner is one of those candidates supported by Soros. She recently announced that felony charges against the St. Louis couple who were pictured across the country with their weapons in their arms and hands, but within their property and at their home would be charged.</p><p>And Kim Foxx, notoriously from Cook County, Illinois, another Soros-back State's Attorney, she infamously drew national attention for dismissing the case against hate hoaxer, Jussie Smollett and when asked about charging violent protesters in Chicago, Foxx told the \"Chicago Sun Times,\" it wouldn't be a good use of time and resources to, I guess, bring justice in her community.</p><p>Other beneficiaries of the Soros contributions are advocating to fundamentally transform the justice system. District Attorneys from San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston, have all been participating in a project founded by leftwing radical activists, Shaun King.</p><p>That group is called the, quote, \"Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission.\" Their website says the justice system is quote, \"Operating exactly the way it was designed and built to function. That's why we're imagining and building something new.\"</p><p>A political action committee co-founded by King has also supported several Soros-backed prosecutors and State Attorneys General since 2018. One of their candidates is Mike Schmidt, who won his election to become the top prosecutor in -- that's right, Portland, Oregon.</p><p>His term begins this Saturday in this critical moment when violent leftwing activists and anarchists are trying to burn down the Federal courthouse every day, attacking law enforcement including Federal officers and agents protecting that Federal courthouse.</p><p>Schmidt telling a local NBC affiliate, he potentially would drop charges against nonviolent protesters when he is in office, if he can find a nonviolent protester while with supporting video, that would be quite astonishing in itself.</p><p>Former President Barack Obama today in Atlanta for the John Lewis services, the former President chose the moment to raise his voice to further attack the Trump administration and support mail-in voting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There are those in power who are doing their darndest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws and attacking our voting rights, with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run up to an election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: In the run up to the election, the former President sounds like someone running for office, doesn't he? Mr. Obama's worry for people getting sick from the China virus made before a packed church with people standing shoulder to shoulder in the pews.</p><p>I'm sorry. What is that about?</p><p>Twitter is defending their decision to block tweets from President Trump and allow anti-Semitic tweets to be published and stay up from Iran's Ayatollah.</p><p>A policy executive for Twitter, who strangely represents both the Nordic countries and Israel, telling Israeli lawmakers that Khomeini's tweets were just, quote, \"foreign policy saber rattling on military economic issues that are generally not in violation of our rules.\" Is there a more corrupt arbiter of what should be permitted to be expressed than Twitter?</p><p>Well, a reminder, the former Deep State F.B.I. attorney, James Baker is now on the Twitter legal team. Actions like these raise more questions as to why the House Judiciary and one of their subcommittees failed to bring up the Section 230 protections for Big Tech and the lawsuits that are underway by the Justice Department and State's Attorneys General to deal with their massive and deeply anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>Neither of the hearings over the past few days that is featuring the Attorney General and four tech Titans, they decided not to talk about the central issue.</p><p>Joining us tonight to talk about the central issue involved here is Brendan Carr, Commissioner of the F.C.C. He previously served as the F.C.C.'s General Counsel. Brendan, it is good to have you with us and thanks for being here.</p><p>This is quite a remarkable display with all the time spent on Capitol Hill in a Democratic-led house that the central issue here, the behavior of those massively powerful economically and politically, Titans of technology wasn't even discussed. How could that be?</p><p>BRENDAN CARR, COMMISSIONER OF THE F.C.C.: Hey, look, Lou. This is one of the most important conversations we can be having within the conservative movement right now. When it comes to Big Tech, there are many on the right, including a lot of people here in D.C., who say we simply have to sit on our hands and do nothing.</p><p>Faced with a massive accumulation and abuse of power, they take an ostrich like approach. I don't think that's right and there's some in D.C. that are standing up.</p><p>I think the Trump administration this week took a big step in the right direction. As you noted, they filed a petition at the F.C.C. where I work on Section 230, which is going to look at some of the special protections that these social media platforms have enjoyed above and beyond the First Amendment rights that you have here and that I have.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, watching Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz and Andy Biggs and a handful of others. They raised a voice in defense of our Constitution and conservatives who were being crushed by each one of the people that you saw there, whether it's Amazon and Jeff Bezos, Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>It is just stunning to watch what they are doing, and with almost without comment from the national media, which should be standing up for you would think, of all things freedom of expression.</p><p>Let's take -- 230 -- Section 230 to protect these technology companies, these social media companies in particular from liability for their users. That has become an artifact, has it not? It is a relic of a moment that nobody longer exists in our history.</p><p>Why should there be special protection and immunity for these massively powerful technology companies who are swinging that power in the direction of the conservatives with seemingly every opportunity they get?</p><p>CARR: What's interesting is there's actually bipartisan support for this. Vice President Biden has said that Section 230 should be revoked immediately.</p><p>Section 230 was passed in the 1990s to deal with the limited content moderation that nascent websites like Prodigy and Compuserve messaging boards were engaged in. To your point, flash forward 20 years. The type of content moderation that's going on today looks nothing like it did in the 1990s.</p><p>Courts have taken Section 230 and given it expansive reading, so the Trump administration appropriately sought a petition at the F.C.C. asking us to adopt rules that clarified the scope of Section 230 so we can hew more closely to the text and the purpose of that law.</p><p>DOBBS: The text, the purpose and the conclusive action, it seems to me should be, Brendan, get the hell rid of it. Just get rid of it all together. Why should there be any immunity for them for any reason? There should be, if anything else, protection from them for every American citizen.</p><p>CARR: There's a lot of strawman arguments out there about preserving the status quo of what 230 says. It's the law that created the internet; not so, we don't have Section 230 in Europe. These websites still exist in Europe. People say we can't touch 230 consistent with the First Amendment. Not right. There is no First Amendment right to Section 230.</p><p>And so I think there's plenty of paths where we can go forth that can promote more speech. That's what 230 is about. The law itself talks about promoting a diversity of views and empowering users to engage with their own content moderation filtering.</p><p>So I think we should turn off the bias filters and let people make their own decisions about the content moderation and what they want to see online.</p><p>DOBBS: What is the mood and the appetite of the F.C.C. to, as you evaluate this and interpret it, what is the likely timeframe for a decision? And how quickly will we see that?</p><p>CARR: The administration's petition came in this week, it was a very interesting sort of academic petition. We will move to put that petition out for public comment. Everyone can participate, and I hope we move expeditiously from that point.</p><p>I put out three ideas: transparency, accountability, and user empowerment. Look at internet providers today, we have a rule in place that says if you're going to manipulate traffic, block traffic, throttle traffic lawful content, you need to be transparent about it.</p><p>If you violate that, you can be held accountable. That's a good baseline, I think for Big Tech. Right now, it is a black box. Let's let people know what's going on when they post these things on the internet.</p><p>DOBBS: I've got an addendum for that. If one of these firms manipulates or blocks traffic, or in any way shows any favor to one political view or another, it should be shut down forthwith. That is that effort to do so, and that power should reside with the F.C.C.</p><p>Brendan Carr, great to have you with us. Thanks. Come back soon. We'll be talking about this for some time, I can tell.</p><p>Up next, NASA launches a U.S.A. mission to Mars. But a member of the Bush family is helping the Chinese in their own space venture to the Red Planet. We will tell you all about it.</p><p>Also, tonight, the F.B.I. defends its fraudulent FISA applications. Congressman Andy Biggs is with us in just a few moments and my new book, preorder \"The Trump Century: How Our President Changed the Course of History Forever.\" This is an important building block in our effort to save the Republic and drive the left nuts. You can do so preordering at thetrumpcentury.com, amazon.com, or barnesandnoble.com.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news now. China getting some help in the space race from a member of the Bush family. Neil Bush, the younger brother of George W. Bush is the co-chairman of a Chinese real estate firm that's partnering with a Communist Party's principal producer of space and military equipment.</p><p>Senate Republicans also continuing their investigation into Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden and his business practices in China. We'll be taking all of this up later in the broadcast with the Hudson Institute's Michael Pillsbury.</p><p>Also breaking tonight, the F.B.I. and Department of Justice found 29 Pfizer court applications during Obamagate had quote, \"inaccuracies, but not enough to affect how the court rule.\" This adds to the 17 errors or omissions the F.B.I. made in applications to spy on Carter Page and the Trump campaign.</p><p>A reminder, the FISA Court has approved more than 99 percent of all the warrants sought in its 42-year history. Doing important work for the nation, don't you think?</p><p>Well, joining us tonight is Congressman Andy Biggs. He is Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, who was at the hearing with the Attorney General Barr.</p><p>First of all, great to have you with us, Congressman. Let's start with finding out that a member the Bush family is doing business with the Chinese on a level that I find outrageous. Hunter Biden, the same situation and in fact, it's corruption. It is driven by the trading on their fathers, and in one instance brothers standing as a public servant. It's outrageous. It's sickening that it is permitted. Your thoughts.</p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): Yes, I agree with you, Lou. I look back, the reason China is economically viable and strong today, they have this advanced rocket telemetry, deep water Navy in middle class. And stealing our intellectual property is a direct result of the Washington elite establishment that has been in place for 20 some odd years, dealing with the Chinese and giving this them this information and these opportunities.</p><p>That's a huge problem, and this is just one more example of that.</p><p>DOBBS: And don't leave out the people who fund their corruption. That is, of course K Street, the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable ...</p><p>BIGGS: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: ... representing the interest in pleasures of this -- of the big business establishment and of course, Wall Street with sloshing fortunes around in pursuit of further profit.</p><p>It's disgusting. It's appalling.</p><p>I have to say I was encouraged by you, by Matt Gaetz, by Jim Jordan, and others to take on the issue before Attorney General William Barr, which is the absolute despicable conduct. It is as if every Democratic district in the country sends the biggest lowlifes and liars that they can find in their communities to represent them.</p><p>It is outrageous what these people stand for.</p><p>BIGGS: Yes, Lou, it was despicable. And, you know, you had everything from a Barbara Boxer moment where you had a member saying I can't believe you would treat a Member of Congress with such lack of respect.</p><p>After they just pummeled this guy, wouldn't let him answer questions, maltreated him, misrepresentative and it was quite frankly -- it was an old style, Soviet style of hearing and it was reprehensible and we were in there trying to allow him to make these opportunities to respond to them. They didn't want that.</p><p>You know, Bill Barr sat there stoically and patiently. And when he asked for a bathroom break, you had Jerry Nadler who didn't want to give him the bathroom break.</p><p>They've asked him a question and they would not give him a minute to even answer the question. They would say, we're going to reclaim our time which is -- that is not the usual method of doing that.</p><p>DOBBS: I have to tell you as I watched that. You know what my takeaway was, though? I was really very angry with you, Republicans and with Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, who actually sacrificed 40 seats and turned over control to a leftwing that is as obnoxious and inept as one could imagine and corrupt.</p><p>This is disgusting what the Republican Party did to good people like Attorney General Barr. And I don't -- by the way, I don't see the fire amongst you, Republicans. A handful of you, yes. But it looks to me like the same just sordid nonchalance about critical issues and a fight for the soul of this country in November.</p><p>It's as if much of your party doesn't give a damn how it comes out. Am I wrong about that?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, I pray you're wrong because we have got to fight. I know that there's plenty of people fighting with me, but sometimes, look, we look back, and we think they're behind us all right, but they're way behind us.</p><p>We have got to take this back, Lou, if there was nothing that we have seen -- your first story about the China intervention, that is part of this unit party that's here. You've got to fight that and get through that. And we saw the way they treated Bill Barr, and the way they're trying to suppress President Trump and his agenda. Those types of things are actually going to lead to defeat.</p><p>We have got to recognize the President Trump is the standard bearer. He is going to get out the vote and he is going to be the guy that we have our wagons hitch to. That is where you have to be, and that's the argument.</p><p>So we have leaders who want to undermine the President and that we can't stand for that. We've got to call them out when they do that and we've got to keep fighting for the agenda he ran on and quite frankly, we ran on, including people who don't really want to support him.</p><p>But we've got to take this back. We have got to take this back. It is a crisis moment.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, it is a crisis moment and it's my judgment that the President will be reelected. And I don't know what's going to happen to the House and to the Senate, because those are some of the most callow and I think cowardly people I've ever seen in politics and I've been covering politics for a very long time to see the lowlifes of the Democrats and the gutless wonders of the RINOs and the Republican Party.</p><p>It's a hell of a -- it's a hell of a situation in the nation's capital. Thank God, we've got this President, and a handful of folks like you and Jordan and Gaetz to lead the way. Appreciate it, Congressman Andy Biggs.</p><p>BIGGS: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, we'll be taking up more on this remarkable President of ours who has been hit with everything imaginable and then some during the course of his first term, and managed to be a historic President, despite being savaged every day by the media and conspired against by the left and the radical Dems without pause.</p><p>We'd like to hear your thoughts about all of this. Share your comments. Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs. Like me on Facebook. Follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>I'll be talking with President Trump next week. Be with us for that.</p><p>And up next, we're awaiting a news conference by President Trump. we will take you to it just as soon as it begins.</p><p>Plus, Lindsey Graham, gives himself a big old pat on the back for his weak, feeble and copycat effort at legislation, this he says, to hold China accountable. We'll take that up and more with Michael Pillsbury. Stay with us. We're coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking News now. We have a date for you. We're pleased to announce that we'll be interviewing President Trump Tuesday. Be sure to join us Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. Eastern for the conversation. Be sure to join us each and every weekday at 5:00 Eastern Time for the conversation.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham once again doing a lot of talking. He was outright gleeful that the Judiciary Committee he chairs is finally doing something. It passed a bill that would allow Americans to sue China for the impact of the China virus.</p><p>He said quote, \"I promised to hold China accountable for the coronavirus and I am.\" This is patterned on the legislation to hold Saudi Arabia accountable after September 11th. You know how that worked out.</p><p>The globalists at \"The Economist\" Magazine seeking mightily to appease the Communist Chinese Party. The globalist magazine saying a treaty is the best way to stop the Chinese fishing fleets' encroachment on the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>\"The Economist\" suggested Ecuador was overreacting to the Chinese fishing armada, 260 fishing trawlers moving in within 20 miles of the marine reserve that surrounds those islands, saying there's a little Ecuador can do to stop China from ransacking marine life in international waters.</p><p>Well, there's something the United States and other nations can do. There's something here the United Nations should be doing, but no one -- no one -- I assure you, is holding their breath about that.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture and the F.B.I. say the mysterious Chinese seeds that were mailed to Americans may be a marketing scam known as brushing. They suspect it is also a way to artificially boosts their sales by sending free seeds to all 50 states.</p><p>There's no word yet on who mailed the seeds, whether they are harmful, nor how that particular scam works. But that's what we're getting. Just wanted to bring you up to date. Now you know what we do, which is not enough about this sorry business that mystery batch of seeds. They are all over the country.</p><p>Joining us tonight, Dr. Michael Pillsbury, Director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute. Mike, great to have you with us. Let's start, first of all, with a quick reaction to Senator Graham complementing himself for coming up with an answer to holding China accountable by allowing Americans to sue the Chinese.</p><p>How effective do you think that would be? I mean, are they quivering in Beijing at the prospect?</p><p>DR. MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR CHINESE STRATEGY, THE HUDSON INSTITUTE: No, they're not quivering in Beijing, Lou. I think I've heard you use a wonderful term that applies to Senator Graham. It's virtue signaling, when you claim you're doing something, but you actually know that it's not going to be effective.</p><p>The Chinese have responded to pressure in the past, usually when it has to do with like President Trump putting the tariffs on as very effective. Military maneuvers and exercises have an effect.</p><p>There's a list of things you can do to get China's attention. I don't think this is one of them.</p><p>DOBBS: No, and the other question immediately before us is Neil Bush, George W's brother doing business with one of the preeminent Chinese technology and space companies, and at the same time, I'd like to share with you of what he said in a statement this from Neil Bush, in which he said effectively that this is all about pro-America rhetoric.</p><p>This is about, you know, nationalism rising in the United States, manifested in anti-immigrant, anti-Chinese, pro-America first rhetoric.</p><p>I will tell you something, I believe Neil Bush is a -- he's absolute scum to talk like that about his native land, and I really -- I find him absolutely disgusting. Your thoughts?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, I think we need to make a list of people like Neil Bush who have benefited enormously. Maybe they pretend it is because of their native genius that they can make so much money, but outsiders know it's not that at all. It's their relationship to the President.</p><p>It's really a major --</p><p>DOBBS: Nobody is fooled here by any -- yes, there's nothing here. There's nothing here that the American people don't understand. They're trading on a family name, both he and Hunter Biden and those like them.</p><p>It is disgusting. It ought to be -- you would think that there would be enough class into two families that have been so fortunate in politics that they would at least hold their family accountable for the way they trade on a name, but it's not to be done.</p><p>I want to turn to the trawler fleet off the -- just off the federal marine reserve around the Galapagos. What can be done to turn these sorry fishing vessels in their cruise back? I mean, the Chinese government is really pushing it. I've had a belly full of their nonsense, frankly.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes. Lou, I think we need to find effective measures that China is afraid of. There are a few of those, but applying anything else but effective pressure seems to me is a waste of time and even encourages additional Chinese aggression.</p><p>DOBBS: There is no effective pressure. You know, you and I know that. There's no rhetoric. There's no pressure. This is about nose to nose confrontation with the Chinese, and if they're going to pick on the weak, and that's Ecuador, here's a nation of 1.4 billion people going after the precious natural wildlife and a marine reserve because they are bigger than anyone else.</p><p>Where the hell are we? We need to be standing up for countries like this and against this behemoth that thinks it's our equal or perhaps better.</p><p>DOBBS: We are back with Dr. Michael Pillsbury. Mike, this -- two Chinese nationals charged with trying to steal secrets from those companies, the biotechs that are building vaccines. We know Moderna today has been under attack since at least January.</p><p>What are we doing about this? This is -- there's just one front after another, one act of aggression after another and we do absolutely nothing but give speeches. Speeches are important. But by God action is far more important because they are assailing this country every damn day without response.</p><p>PILLSBURY: I agree with you, Lou. I think what the Chinese are afraid of is prosecutions. If the Department of Justice prosecutes a lot of these cases, it tells the F.B.I., okay, investigations are over. We're going to court.</p><p>The effect on China to see so many of their people arrested and put in prison, that'll have some deterrent effect. But so far they need our technology and capital so much, Lou, that almost nothing seems to deter them.</p><p>President Trump has said that we built China and he means we allow them to steal and get away with this.</p><p>DOBBS: They stole -- China from us, are you kidding? Half a trillion dollars a year in intellectual property. We've turned over technology, military secrets to them. We have -- without us, you know, who knows? Let's hope for better times. Thanks so much.</p><p>The President on the stage now approaching the podium. Here he is.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... with the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain. He was a very special person. I got to know him very well, and unfortunately, he passed away from thing called the China virus.</p><p>We send our prayers to Herman's great wife, Gloria, wonderful family. And I have to say America grieves for all of the 150,000 Americans who had their lives taken by this horrible, invisible enemy.</p><p>We mourn their loss as a nation. We mourn their loss as people, as people that love one another, and we're working very hard to not only contain this horrible event, this horrible plague, it's what it is, it is a plague, but also to come up with therapeutics and vaccines and we're making a lot of strides.</p><p>All over the world, they are having tremendous problems, a resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well.</p><p>Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic between countries, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong, places where they thought it was -- they had really done great. It came back and in a couple of cases, came back very strongly.</p><p>The virus was said to be under control, but new cases have risen very significantly once again. So when you think somebody is doing well, sometimes you have to hold your decision on that. You have to hold your statement.</p><p>Since the beginning of June, daily new cases have increased by a factor of 14 times in Israel, 35 times -- that's 35 times in Japan and nearly 30 times in Australia just to name a few. These were countries that were doing incredibly well. Leadership was being praised.</p><p>Latin America now leads the world in confirmed infections. And with the scarcity of testing in Latin America, the true numbers, you have no idea what they might be. And I can say scarcity of testing almost anywhere except for our country.</p><p>This disease is highly contagious and presents unique challenges to our border states. Meanwhile, states like California, Washington State, Maryland, Virginia, Nevada, Illinois, Oregon and many others, they were thought to be doing well and they had a big resurgence and were hit very hard and governors that were extremely popular, are not so popular anymore.</p><p>They were held up as models to follow and then, they got hit. Now I'm not even saying this is their fault. It's probably not their fault. It's just the way it is. That's the way it is -- highly infectious. One of the most infectious diseases that anybody has ever seen, not since 1917, over a hundred years ago. Has anyone seen anything like what we're witnessing now?</p><p>But these states have also seen the virus substantially rebound and again, no one is immune. No one is immune. These facts illustrate the imposing determinant and it is a determinant that a blanket shutdown to achieve a temporary reduction in cases is certainly not a viable long term strategy for any country.</p><p>People are starting to understand the disease no. We certainly have understood a lot about the disease that we didn't have any idea. We didn't -- nobody ever saw anything like this. The primary purpose of a shutdown was to flatten the curve, ensure sufficient hospital capacity and develop effective treatments and therapies to reduce mortality, and we've done that. But it can come rearing back when you least suspect it.</p><p>We did the right thing initially. We saved millions of lives, what we did. We did the right thing. But a permanent shutdown would no longer be the answer at all.</p><p>A small shutdown of certain areas, but we don't want to do that. Small shutdowns can be very helpful, but not for long periods of time.</p><p>We understand what we're dealing with now, but it's a very complex situation, and I can only say, thank heaven that we are so advanced in what we're doing in terms of vaccines and therapies.</p><p>We now know a great deal about the virus and how to treat it and who it targets. Almost half of the deaths come from less than one percent of our population. Think of it. Half of the deaths -- really, a tremendous number -- half of the deaths come from less than one percent of our population. Those living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The average age of those who die from the illness is 78.</p><p>We've announced very strong measures to protect those who are most vulnerable. The scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions.</p><p>I'm once again urging the American people to protect their dear family and friends and anybody who is elderly, especially if somebody is elderly and they have heart problems, if they have certain illnesses. Diabetes is a very bad one, having to do with what we're discussing.</p><p>But you want to protect the elderly and socially distance. Wear a mask if you cannot socially distance and practice vigorous hygiene.</p><p>Everyone, even healthy young people should be taking extraordinary care to avoid infecting those at the highest risk from this terrible disease.</p><p>The elderly and those with chronic health issues have to be protected. In the current hotspots across the Sunbelt, the data is showing very encouraging signs. Arizona in particular has crossed an important threshold.</p><p>For every person with a virus, we're now seeing an average of less than one additional person infected, and the numbers are coming down and coming down very substantially.</p><p>They're starting to come down in Florida. Arizona is really leading away. I was in Texas yesterday and they're starting to come down significantly, we believe in Texas, we need another few days to figure that one out, but it looks like they're coming down very significantly.</p><p>Earlier today, I visited the Red Cross headquarters to discuss plasma therapy, which is a tremendous, tremendous thing that they're looking at, and they have a lot of experience with it. Potentially life-saving treatments that infuse sick patients with powerful antibodies donated by those who have recovered successfully from this disease.</p><p>More than two million Americans have recovered from the virus and today, we're asking them to visit coronavirus.gov, coronavirus.gov and volunteer to donate plasma. We need plasma. It's something that's been very effective and we need plasma from those that were infected and successfully recovered, as most people do -- most people do.</p><p>Plasma is one of the many promising treatments my administration is accelerating. We've secured over 90 percent of the world's supply of remdesivir, which is terrific, an encouraging antiviral drugs that can effectively block replication of the virus.</p><p>We've also approved the use of the widely available steroid which has been very successful, dexamethasone, which has shown success even in patients at more advanced stages of the disease.</p><p>On July 17th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to build manufacturing plants and hundreds of thousands of doses of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late stage, clinical trials moving along very rapidly. That's Regeneron.</p><p>As a result of such significant strides in treatment, the mortality rate in those over the age of 18 is 85 percent lower than it was just in April. So in a very short period of time. Think of that, just eighteen, 85 percent lower than it was in April. It's a big statement.</p><p>Now, I want to provide an update on our efforts to ensure a strong economic comeback, including our negotiations on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to rescue American workers. We love our American workers. And we've set records on job creation -- records -- two months in a row.</p><p>We enacted a $3 trillion economic relief package, the Paycheck Protection Program alone saved over 50 million jobs. We delivered $300 billion to direct cash payments to Americans. We approved $500 billion for our hardest hit industries -- $500 billion.</p><p>We allowed struggling homeowners to reduce or defer their mortgage payments, and we put a nationwide moratorium on evictions from federally backed properties, it is a big thing, a very big thing.</p><p>We also suspended student loan payments for six months and we're looking to do that, additionally and for additional periods of time.</p><p>As a result of these extraordinary steps by the administration, we added a record seven million jobs in the two months past alone. To ensure this comeback continues, which we think it will, we had great foundation to build. We were the strongest country in the world. Nobody close. We were out doing everybody from China.</p><p>If you remember for many years, you heard that in 2019, China would surpass the United States. Well, it didn't. We gained on them very significantly. We took it to a level that nobody has ever seen in 2019 and we'll be back there very shortly. It won't take very long based on everything that we're seeing.</p><p>It's not going to take very long. I think next year is going to be an excellent year, maybe one of our best years ever from an economic standpoint.</p><p>We can never, ever forget the people that have been lost. We never will. We'll never forget them. We will forget what happened. This could have been stopped in China. They should have stopped it and they didn't.</p><p>But I'm asking Congress to pass additional legislation to support Americans in need. First, we want a temporary extension of expanded unemployment benefits. This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own. This was not anybody's fault. From the standpoint of jobs, it happened. A terrible thing happened. It could have been stopped. It happened.</p><p>I want to thank Senate Republicans for fighting to extend unemployment benefits today in the face of very strong Democratic obstruction, which I'm surprised at because this is great for our country, and it's great for our workers, and it wasn't our workers fault.</p><p>Second, we're asking Democrats to work with us to find a solution that will temporarily stop evictions. We do not want people who have lost their jobs due to the virus to be evicted from their homes or apartments. We don't want that to happen.</p><p>Third, we need Democrats to join us to pass additional economic relief payments for American citizens like the payments sent directly to 160 million Americans earlier this year, which was a tremendously successful program.</p><p>This money will help millions of hard working families get by. My administration is also asking Democrats to work with us to pass $105 billion to help schools safely reopen. Children are not at the lowest risk.</p><p>If you look at what's going on, the younger the better. Amazing, their immune system. For children, the lower they are an age, the lower the risk in terms of the age group itself.</p><p>I tell the story that in New Jersey with thousands and thousands of people dying, sadly dying, the Governor was telling me that only one, Phil Murphy, only one died under the age of 18. That's incredible with thousands of people that died in the State of New Jersey, one made an impact. One died under the age of 18.</p><p>Children are at the lowest risk of any age group from the virus. Indefinite school closures will inflict lasting harm to our nation's children. We must follow the science and get students safely back to school while protecting children, teachers, staff, and family.</p><p>We have to remember that there's another side to this, keeping them out of school and keeping work closed is causing death also, economic harm, but causing death for different reasons, but death, probably more death.</p><p>If governors do not want to open the public schools, the money should go to parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. So, we say if a school doesn't want to open or if a governor doesn't want to open, maybe for political reason and maybe not. But there is some of that going on. The money should go to the parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice.</p><p>If schools stay close, the money should follow the students. So families are in control of decisions about their sons and daughters, about their children. But to pass a bill, Democrats must reject the extreme partisan voices in their party. They have tremendous voices.</p><p>They are looking at November 3rd, and probably a day later, they'll say let's open up the country. But the Democrats have to reject the extreme partisan voices in their party so that we can get our country going even quicker than it's going right now.</p><p>We have a lot opening, and we have a lot of states that you thought were doing pretty poorly from the standpoint of the virus and are actually coming back very strong.</p><p>This pandemic has underscored the importance of economic policies that put American families and workers first. I got elected on the fact that I put America first.</p><p>For many, many decades, in my opinion, we put America last. If you look at the crazy, horrible, disgraceful trade deals that we've watched for many years destroy our country. NAFTA, we terminated it. We have USMCA now, which is a great deal and the farmers are doing really well despite the pandemic.</p><p>But we put America first, America's families first, and America's workers first. But that means bringing jobs and factories back to our shores, reducing unnecessary regulations and creating new training opportunities for jobs and for the future.</p><p>We've cut regulations at a level that no President has ever cut regulations, and we've cut taxes more than any President in the history of our country. Americans always rise to the challenge and we will emerge more resilient, more self-reliant, more independent and more prosperous than ever before.</p><p>So I just want to thank you all, and if you'd like, we'll take a few questions. Steve, please.</p><p>QUESTION: Are you going to launch an effort to try to delay the election? Or was that just trial in this --</p><p>TRUMP: Well, what I want to explain to people, but it doesn't need much explanation. I mean, you look at article after article, New York's mail vote disaster. Tens of thousands of mail ballots have been tossed out in this year's primaries. What will happen in November? It's a mess.</p><p>This is done by \"Washington Post.\" Can you believe it? \"The Washington Post\" of wallpapers. Fake news, but in this case, it is not fake, it is true.</p><p>DOBBS: That's it for us tonight. The President wrapping up his news conference. Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton and Pastor Robert Jeffress among our guests tomorrow. We'll be taking up mail-in voting.</p><p>And President Trump our special guest, Tuesday. We hope you'll be with us for that. Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.</p><p>\"The Trump Century,\" my new book, \"How Our President Changed the Course of History Forever.\" You can preorder it at thetrumpcentury.com, amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com.</p><p>Thanks for joining us.

JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining us straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\":  a crime at the epidemic sweeping the United States and cities across the country, amid calls to defund the police. The murder rate spikes in California, New Orleans, Los Angeles, with shootings in Chicago jumping 75 percent in June alone.</p><p>Coming up, America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, with a message for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, shootings there up 130 percent, the violence unfolding against the backdrop of the 2020 election, now just 113 days away.</p><p>What's President Trump's plan to get us out of this? White House trade adviser Peter Navarro is here to lay out POTUS' second-term agenda.</p><p>We will also hear from Donald Trump Jr. this morning on the one issue he thinks will determine the winner, all of this as John Durham continues his deep dive into the origins of the Russia probe. Will he finish his investigation before the election? Congressman Jim Jordan, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, will weigh in.</p><p>Also here this morning, Senator John Barrasso with breaking news on the next stimulus package and when to expect it.</p><p>All that and a lot more, as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>And we begin with Joe Biden unveiling his $700 billion buy America plan last week, with an emphasis on U.S. goods, jobs and manufacturing.</p><p>Biden's proposal may ring the bell for viewers of this program.</p><p>Here's White House trade adviser Peter Navarro just a few weeks ago on the president's first plan back on March 15.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY:  It's a three-pronged strategy consistent with what President Trump has done from the get-go in terms of onshoring jobs.</p><p>It's buy American, it's deregulate, and it's innovate technology. The buy American issue, Maria, is, we have HHS, the VA and DOD as large consumers of pharmaceuticals. We have got to get them to buy American over the long term, so we have a stable source of demand, so that that will attract investment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And joining me right now is Peter Navarro, back with us. He's assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing.</p><p>Peter, it is good to see you this morning.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Hey, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, obviously, Joe Biden agrees...</p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... with your plan to buy America.</p><p>Your reaction to the former vice president's economic plan released this past week.</p><p>NAVARRO:  A poll-driven, plagiarist, buy China Joe Biden.</p><p>I was astonished by that, given Joe Biden's history. I think everybody remembers back in 1988, when Biden ran for president, and did the trifecta of plagiarism, when he ripped off JFK, RFK and Neil Kinnock in speeches and had to withdraw from the race in shame and embarrassment.</p><p>And now he's just blatantly ripping off the president's buy American agenda, which goes back to the president going down the escalator with beautiful Melania. It started back then. Guess what?</p><p>I have personally been at the president's side when he has signed at least seven buy American orders. That's seven more than Biden signed or Obama signed during their term. And every one of those has worked to create American jobs.</p><p>We dramatically reduced the waivers, increased the amount of buy American in-government procurement. We upped the amount of iron and steel to close to 100 percent.</p><p>And so, listening to Joe Biden, I thought it was a really bad judgment. And whoever wrote that speech and put that in the puppet's head there, I think they might be looking for a new job soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Peter, he also said that he will take the corporate tax rate back up.</p><p>The president, of course, in his tax legislation of 2017 cut the corporate rate to 21 percent. Biden says it should be at 28 percent. Wall Street seems to think Elizabeth Warren is the key economic voice in Biden's plan. She wants to raise taxes on everyone and also institute a wealth tax for the wealthiest individuals.</p><p>And he's also talking about changing -- he said he wants to change shareholder capitalism.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you make of all of that?</p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, I think that's a good way of talking about what President Trump is going to do in his second term, because what President Trump is going to do is finish what he started.</p><p>And the whole four points of the policy compass going back to the campaign was deregulation, cut taxes, dominate in energy, and have fair trade deals.</p><p>And everything that Biden wants to do and is running on is directly opposite that, directly opposite to the direction of growing the economy. So, that's what the president is going to do.</p><p>And we got to a point with this president, best jobs president in history, where he had the best economy in American history, in middle of January, we had the unemployment rate down for record lows for blacks, Hispanics, Asians, women.</p><p>And we were cruising along, until the Chinese Communist Party basically hit us with that deadly virus, that weaponized virus. And I don't think it's any coincidence that the first year that China had a down economy was the same year now that they're coming after us in all sorts of ways.</p><p>And Joe Biden is the candidate of the Chinese Communist Party. Trump, buy American, Joe Biden, buy China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>Let me ask you about China, because, of course, we saw now a pushback in terms of sanctions on individuals in China responsible for taking away Hong Kong freedoms. People are waiting for the president to sign that in terms of the sanctions on those individuals.</p><p>Why should the U.S. be acting aggressively on Hong Kong?</p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want to open borders for Hong Kong citizens to come to America? What's the plan?</p><p>NAVARRO:  For decades, the Chinese Communist Party used Hong Kong as a weapon to attack the American manufacturing base and vacuum jobs and capital back to the Chinese mainland.</p><p>Do you know what, Maria? We put up with that, in support of a free and Democratic Hong Kong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO:  But now that China has taken away their economy, they have effectively turned it just into another concentration camp, like Xinjiang, Tibet, and the rest of the Chinese mainland, now that that has happened, President Trump, going back to a speech in the Rose Garden at the end of May, said, we're going to strip them of all preferential treatment, so that they can't harm American workers anymore, and we're going to punish those responsible.</p><p>And so you can expect, early this week, the president to sign both the Hong Kong Autonomy Act and an executive order which will complete the process that the president started on May 29 in the Rose Garden. We cannot let Chinese Communist Party use Hong Kong anymore to attack the American economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK. Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO:  So that's coming.</p><p>The other thing that's on the table that we need to talk about is this whole TikTok, WeChat social media thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Here is the thing, Maria.</p><p>What the American people have to understand is, all the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and seem so convenient, it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party, and the agencies which want to steal our intellectual property.</p><p>Those apps can be used to steal personal and financial information for blackmail and extortion. They can be used to steal business intellectual property and proprietary secrets.</p><p>The worst thing they use them for, besides surveilling and tracking Americans, the worst thing they do is engage in information warfare against the American people, against this president. The Chinese Communist Party wants Joe Biden more than anything right now, and the American people should not be subject to information warfare.</p><p>The other thing about TikTok, for example, and WeChat...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO:  ... even what -- this is really interesting. They're running the same playbook as Huawei, right? Put an American puppet in charge of Huawei as the CEO and say, hey, everything is going to be fine. We're going to be separate.</p><p>They're trying that game with TikTok. Not going to work. TikTok is the biggest -- TikTok and WeChat are the biggest forms of censorship on the Chinese mainland. And so expect strong action on that. Expect action, action, action from this president on buy American, on China, on jobs.</p><p>And this is the president that gets things done for the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>You know, you mentioned the person running TikTok. It is actually extraordinary. This is -- this was the number two guy at Disney, Kevin Mayer, who is now the CEO of TikTok...</p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... an American, but, obviously, the Chinese -- the Chinese individual...</p><p>NAVARRO:  Running dog puppet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... who is a Communist member is the chairman.</p><p>But this is what I thought was really interesting. This week, we had a headline that says Democratic National Committee is warning that campaign -- against campaigns on using TikTok.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even the Democratic National Committee is voicing concern.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazon, of course, we know already banned TikTok from employee phones.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Actually, Maria, they didn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you say these are data collectors?</p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes, Amazon actually...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said he was going to, Jeff Bezos.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes. Yes. They announced it, and then they backed away from it, which shows the power of the Chinese Communist Party on corporate America.</p><p>And that's the problem. This guy who is running TikTok now, a Disney executive, who is more compromised than the Disney kingdom over in China? Because they want to sell all their Disney World tickets over there. They want to sell all their Disney content.</p><p>And so what -- if TikTok, if it separates as an American company, that doesn't help us, because it's going to be worth -- we're going to have to give China billions of dollars for the privilege of having TikTok operate on U.S. soil.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well...</p><p>NAVARRO:  So, TikTok, WeChat and -- India banned 70 of these things. So TikTok and WeChat, I suspect that the president is just getting started with those two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I was just going to say, because India has banned TikTok. Is the president going to?</p><p>NAVARRO:  I never get ahead of the president, but we are looking very closely at this problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>NAVARRO:  And just run through the checklist.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>NAVARRO:  The information warfare, surveillance and tracking, stealing your data.</p><p>No American -- the parents -- their kids are sitting there with TikTok. I mean, data right out of the household is going to the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO:  What can go wrong there?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter...</p><p>NAVARRO:  So, what we need to do -- jobs and China, that's what this campaign is about.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will be watching.</p><p>Great to talk with you, as always, Peter. Thank you so much, Peter Navarro from the White House this morning.</p><p>Coming up:  Will John Durham complete his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe in time to impact the 2020 election?</p><p>The ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, will weigh in after this break.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, welcome back.</p><p>Attorney General Bill Barr told me that the Russian collusion narrative was the closest the U.S. has ever come to a coup since the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>Yet, according to a new Rasmussen poll, most voters do not know there's evidence that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were even involved in it.</p><p>A.G. Barr recently spoke to me about the status of John Durham's investigation on the FBI's probe into the Trump campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  He's pressing ahead as hard as he can. And I expect that we will have some developments hopefully before the end of this summer.</p><p>But, as I have said, his investigation will continue. It's not going to stop because of the election. What happens after the election may depend on who wins the election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Jim Jordan is the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  You bet. Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are we on the John Durham investigation, sir? What do you know?</p><p>JORDAN:  Well, we know what Bill Barr has told us.</p><p>Now, the attorney general will be in front of the Judiciary Committee in two weeks. I'm sure he will get asked about this and a number of other issues.</p><p>But the attorney general has said that he expects something this summer. We're obviously -- we're hitting the summer, so let's hope it happens. Let's hope it happens before the election.</p><p>I will tell you this, Maria. The number one question I get, whether I'm in the Fourth District of Ohio or traveling around our state or traveling around the country, the number one question I get from people is, they will walk up to me and says, when is somebody going to jail?</p><p>And the reason they say that is because they're sick of the double standard, this idea that there's one set of rules for the politically connected in D.C. and a different set for us regular folks.</p><p>So let's hope we have the investigation done before the election. Let's hope that someone is going to be held accountable for the major wrongdoing that took place when they targeted the president's campaign and spied on the president's campaign.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's pretty extraordinary.</p><p>And we know that there was always criminality done, whether it's leaking confidential information, or changing a document of evidence, which is -- one of the FBI agents already did that. They changed a document.</p><p>JORDAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or maybe it was entrapment, lying to investigators.</p><p>So, how come we haven't seen any charges yet? I mean, there are, what, 14 referrals of criminal charges already from you and your colleagues?</p><p>JORDAN:  Yes. I mean, who knows.</p><p>But here is how bad it was. Michael Flynn, 38 different people 49 different times unmasked Michael Flynn's name between Election Day 2016 and Inauguration Day in January 2017. So, in that short two-month time period, 49 separate times, they were unmasking his name, even though they already knew, all these people already knew that there was no basis for the investigation to begin with.</p><p>And how do we know that they knew there was no basis, there was no proper predicate? Because, when they testified, they told us that. Ric Grenell released the testimony of Comey and Clapper and Brennan and Rice and Samantha Power, released all of the testimony.</p><p>And they all said the same thing:  We never saw any evidence of any type of coordination, collusion, conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. But they investigated it anyway, even up until the time when Bob Mueller was named special counsel.</p><p>Jim Comey, when we deposed him in the House last Congress, when we deposed him, he said:  After 10 months, we didn't have anything.</p><p>But Comey does what? Leaks his memo, so we get two years of Bob Mueller, leaks his memos for the express purpose of getting a special counsel named. And then we had the 19 lawyers, 40 agents, 500 subpoenas, 2,800 or 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas, and $30 million to tell us what we already knew, what they already knew, that there was nothing there.</p><p>So let's hope that, ultimately, someone is held accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think there will be indictments?</p><p>JORDAN:  I hope so. I mean, I have said this all along.</p><p>I think Jim Comey is the biggest culprit here. It was the Comey cabal, this small handful of people at the top of the FBI. And then, remember, Bill Barr, the first time he testified, said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI</p><p>Comey, McCabe, Baker, Strzok, Page, they all left or had to be fired as the key people...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JORDAN:  ... who ran the Clinton investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation.</p><p>Comey is the ringleader here. I hope they give him a second look. And I hope he's ultimately held accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you.</p><p>Let me switch gears, ask you about your committee, the Judiciary Committee's closed-door testimony of Geoffrey Berman. I have in front of me your takeaways from the committee's transcribed interview with Berman.</p><p>Nadler says that Barr dealings with Berman often came close to bribery. Your reaction? And tell us what you can about that closed-door hearing.</p><p>JORDAN:  Well, first of all, Mr. Nadler's statement is ridiculous.</p><p>When we deposed Mr. Berman, he said very clearly -- we asked him about his meeting with Bill Barr on June 19 in New York. We said, did you talk about any cases? No. Did you talk about any suspects? No. Did you talk about any witnesses to any cases? No. Did you talk about the president? No,.</p><p>There was nothing there. The attorney general and the president of the United States are entitled to have the people they want as U.S. attorneys around the country. That's all this was.</p><p>The Democrats, because they don't like the fact that Bill Barr is trying to get to the bottom of what took place in the previous Justice Department, the Obama-Biden-Comey Justice Department, because they don't like the fact that he's trying to clean up the politics that existed in the previous administration, they continue to go after him, so much so that they filed articles of impeachment against the attorney general just a week-and-a-half ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JORDAN:  That's how ridiculous the Democrats are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, I have got to ask you about tech tyranny and the upcoming hearings that you're going to have in Judiciary.</p><p>We will hear from people like Apple's CEO, Google's CEO, Facebook, Twitter in a hearing on July 25 or 28. Tell me about your letter to Jack Dorsey about the president's tweets and what you're expecting out of technology, big tech.</p><p>Are they going to try to sway the election in November?</p><p>JORDAN:  Well, Maria, I always start with this simple question. Why is does always seem that it's just conservatives who get censored or shadowbanned by these big tech companies?</p><p>Why was it two years ago that there are 435 members of the House, there are 100 members of the Senate, 535, but only four were shadowbanned, Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan?</p><p>Interesting four. I always say -- when we send a letter to Jack Dorsey, when we brought this to his attention, he indicated that, oh, it was just a glitch in our algorithm, to which I responded, glitch in your algorithm? What did you put in the algorithm, the names Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan?</p><p>I mean, it's always conservatives.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JORDAN:  Why is it only the president -- why is it only the president who gets censored? You never see them going after Joe Biden.</p><p>Why is it just -- why was it The Federalist that Google tried to demonetize?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>JORDAN:  You never see a liberal news outlet trying to be demonetized.</p><p>So, that, to me, is the fundamental question. And that has got to change, because, in America today, if only one side is allowed to talk, that's not the First Amendment. You got to have a real debate. And this cancel culture mob and the impact they have on these big tech companies is a scary road we're traveling down.</p><p>And it needs to stop. And that's what we're going to focus on as Republicans in these hearings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's great to have you this morning.</p><p>We will be watching, certainly, closely. It's so wonderful to get your take on all of this, Congressman Jim Jordan.</p><p>Coming up, Rudy Giuliani is here on the Supreme Court decision that President Trump should turn over his tax returns.</p><p>That's coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Supreme Court making headlines on Thursday, ruling that President Trump's financial and tax records are fair game for New York prosecutors.</p><p>The president since calling decision not fair. But is it really the slam-dunk victory his critics were hoping for?</p><p>Joining me right now is former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who also served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York for six years.</p><p>And, Rudy, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK:  Always a pleasure, Maria, yes, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So...</p><p>GIULIANI:  So, that case is really terribly decided.</p><p>But go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, about the tax returns.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Oh.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going -- are you going to be responding in any way? Will the tax releases have any bearing on the election, in your view?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Well, first of all, there's still room for opposition.</p><p>You could make the argument that they have no particularized need for it. You could also make the argument that they are not investigating any particularized crime.</p><p>They have no reason to believe that there's anything wrong with his tax returns. I mean, all these tax returns have been, by and large -- maybe not the last one -- but all of them have been audited. All of them have been either passed on or settled.</p><p>And there should be something in your tax returns. In other words, we get audited, we make a deal, we pay the government, you don't come after me forever for that.</p><p>And, also, this is the president of the United States. There are literally 400 -- 4,000 prosecutors who can now come after his records. I don't think the court ever thought of that.</p><p>So there may be a chance to revisit this. The burden this would place on the executive, like, if you had an opposition party -- and look at the DAs we have now. We have Soros-elected anarchist DAs. They're not there to prosecute the law. They are there to undermine the law.</p><p>He put them there. Why would Soros pay for DAs, other than to undermine our government?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>GIULIANI:  He got people elected who release criminals, don't prosecute cases. In Philadelphia, they won't even bring a case to the DA, he's so anti-police, pro-criminal.</p><p>Five years, Soros has been funding these. And nobody paid attention to it. But he had a reason. It's to undermine our government. And I think we have a chance to revisit this.</p><p>Also, we can argue that they have no need for it. This is a fishing expedition. I mean, I think we fight them right down to the wire.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about what's happening to our cities, Rudy.</p><p>You oversaw New York City becoming the safest city on your leadership because of the moves you made. Look at New York City right now, shootings soaring to 205 percent. What will it take to get this city back with law and order? Shooting incidences up 130 percent, murder up 23 percent, burglary up 118 percent.</p><p>What is your reaction to Mayor de Blasio's new plan, he says, to take back the blocks, relying heavily on community members on the streets?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Well, I mean, the reality is, he's already amended that plan, because it was -- I mean, it's stupid throughout, but he was going to have community leaders accompany the police, until, last night, he had another night of violence that was unreal.</p><p>So now the community leaders are not going to accompany the police. I think they got an idea, hey, Mayor, you go with them. Maybe we don't want to go, because they shoot at us. We had a terrible situation with a domestic violence thing last night.</p><p>I mean, it's a disaster, Maria. I have never seen it like this. I mean, there were more murders in the city under Dinkins, 2,400, 2,200, but we never had this total disrespect for the police. Even in those bad old days, nobody was going to spit at a police officer, nobody was going to punch a police officer.</p><p>And they took advantage of the no choke hold last night in an incident that I have a videotape of, where the police officer couldn't get ahold of him. The guy put a choke hold on the cop and almost killed him, and he couldn't defend himself.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.</p><p>GIULIANI:  I mean, we're going to get a cop killed with that stupid no choke hold thing, the way it's interpreted.</p><p>We're getting cops killed. And the reaction -- the reality is, it's worse because this is a breakdown in general respect for the police, for our government, and hatred for our country.</p><p>And there's a purpose to it. These people are Marxists. They want to take over our government. When are we going to wake up and realize that? Just go read what they write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well...</p><p>GIULIANI:  Look at the fact that the woman who is taking in the money for the BLM is a convicted terrorist who should be in jail for 58 years, except crooked Clinton pardoned her, a terrorist who was involved in police killings.</p><p>She is handling the money for the Black Lives Matter. This is a woman dedicated to the overthrow of our government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, look, Mayor de Blasio obviously cut the budget for the NYPD by a billion dollars.</p><p>You said the last time you were with me that Governor Cuomo can replace Mayor de Blasio. How come he hasn't done it yet then? The New York A.G. is recommending de Blasio should no longer have the authority in New York enforcement matters. Is that enough?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Well, you know, I will give him the citation.</p><p>It's Article 1, Section 9 of the New York City charter, which I pretty much have memorized. It says that the governor can remove the mayor. You don't even have to have cause. Now precedent would say it would have to be corruption, like they attempted to remove Jimmy Walker, but he resigned.</p><p>Or it could be gross incompetence. Or it could be putting the lives of New Yorkers in jeopardy. Bill de Blasio, through his incompetence, has killed New Yorkers. His negligence in dealing with COVID is outrageous, the things he didn't do and the things that he encouraged.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GIULIANI:  They criticize President Trump for being late. He was telling people to go to gyms two weeks into it, two weeks after the president made it clear, this is very dangerous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>It certainly feels like a different city today, I will tell you. You just don't feel safe in New York City.</p><p>I want to switch gears. You were the A.G. for the Southern District of New York from 1983 to 1989, where Ghislaine Maxwell is now being indicted. Reaction to the charges. Do you think she's going to name names? What's your reaction to this Jeffrey Epstein-Ghislaine Maxwell situation?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Well, I don't know all the people there now, but the person in charge, Audrey Strauss, was a colleague of mine. And she's a very, very -- she's a very good lawyer and a very honest and down-the-middle-kind of prosecutor.</p><p>I can only guess what Maxwell has. And it sounds like she's got tapes, and it would not make sense if they didn't. I mean, they were pretty smart people. They have been protected for a long time. There must be a reason for that. They must have a lot of things on a lot of people. And it's going to be really interesting to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GIULIANI:  You can't argue with a tape. You can't argue. There's got to be a lot of people very scared over the last couple of days.</p><p>And I'd like to keep her alive, guys. I mean, you know, she is in a prison.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GIULIANI:  You can keep somebody alive in a prison.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>GIULIANI:  And if they need any help, if they need any help on how to keep somebody alive in a prison, I used to also run the Bureau of Prisons. I think I could show them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Rudy, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.</p><p>GIULIANI:  You know you're the best.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next:  Donald Trump Jr. is here with his reaction to the Black Lives Matter mural in New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio helped paint right outside of Trump Tower this week, where he works every day.</p><p>We are going to get his reaction when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New photographs this morning of President Trump wearing a mask publicly for the first time yesterday during his visit to Walter Reed Hospital.</p><p>The president, who met with wounded soldiers and medical workers, told reporters he loves masks in the appropriate locations, but still believes they have a time and place.</p><p>Joining us right now with reaction is the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Donald Trump Jr.</p><p>And, Don, it is good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: It's my pleasure, Maria. How are you?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, great.</p><p>Interesting to see your dad donning a mask. Obviously, things are serious. You have got the potential of a second spike.</p><p>How is Kimberly doing? We know that Kimberly has contracted COVID, along with a top convention person. Is she OK?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  She's 100 percent fine.</p><p>She's -- zero symptoms, zero anything. We're in quarantine, obviously, and I am too because of proximity. But, other than that, you really wouldn't know that there's anything even going on.</p><p>So, it's been good. I -- under the circumstances, it's as good as it can get.</p><p>And I also saw my father looked pretty good in the mask the other day.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  And I think what people also have to realize, when he talks about there being a time and place, anyone who comes into proximity with him is literally tested that day, is literally tested moments before they allow access.</p><p>So he's obviously going to be much less susceptible to this than anyone else, because, literally, there is a daily screening process if you're going to even be within proximity to him.</p><p>So I think that's important for people to note. But when he's going to Walter Reed to visit our sick and our wounded soldiers, he's going to take that very seriously.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but people are taking seriously the idea that we are seeing a second wave potentially, and spikes in some hot spots across the country.</p><p>What does that mean for the convention, Don? And what about the idea that, look, the Democrats have already said they're going to do a virtual convention? There are polls that have Biden either tied with Trump or actually leading Donald Trump.</p><p>Your thoughts of all of these worries going into the convention and then, of course, the election?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Well, I think, for the Democrats, of course they want to do a virtual convention, because there's no enthusiasm for Joe Biden. He can't get people to show up a rally, if he was able to do rallies.</p><p>So this whole scenario is really the ultimate best-case scenario for Joe Biden and his campaign. They don't want him on the stump. They don't want him speaking to reporters. They don't want him ad-libbed. Honestly, they don't even want him on a teleprompter, because he can't even get that right.</p><p>So, for them, it's sort of the ultimate. I think, with our convention, there's a lot of people that want to do it. They want to be enthusiastic. But we can do that and we can do it safely. We can take the necessary precautions. We can protect the people that are going to be there. We can implement things that you wouldn't necessarily normally implement at a convention to do so.</p><p>So, they're going to take it very seriously. We're going to do a great job with it, and it's going to be an awesome event.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What does the president need to get these numbers up? Are you buying these polls? It looks like one after the next. It is a real tight race. And, in many cases, Biden is leading the president.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Well, listen, I think, when you have the media onslaught, where a media has just totally abdicated their position to objectively look at both sides, they're not looking into any of Biden's past.</p><p>They're not looking into any of his history. They're not looking into his family's graft. They're not looking into how insanely soft he's been on China throughout his entire career. And let's not forget, this is a 50-year career in Washington, D.C.</p><p>They're trying to run him like he's a moderate outsider. This guy is the epitome of the swamp. So they want to do whatever they can to keep the American people from actually seeing Biden.</p><p>He hasn't been defined. And the media is trying to make sure that no one gets to define Joe Biden, because, once he is, you will see how terrible this notion could be for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why you're out with a upcoming book, \"Liberal Privilege.\"</p><p>You're going to talk a lot about Biden in this book, right? You're self-publishing a book? When is it coming out, Don?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  A hundred percent.</p><p>I guess one of offshoots, one of the only positive things of quarantine for the last few months was, I had a lot of free time. And I was looking into it, and actually went on and hired a researcher just to do it myself, because I said, if the media is going to totally neglect this guy, this history, these terrible trade deals, especially now, in the post-COVID-19 world, where we are going to actually have to deal with China and deal tough with China, which is what Donald Trump's -- that's his wheelhouse.</p><p>That's his forte. He's the only guy to do it in the modern American history. That Joe Biden can sell this notion of, well, now we're going to be buy American, after 50 years of legislation that sent our jobs, that sent our American dream to China, it's asinine.</p><p>But I'm sitting there looking, whether it's Hunter Biden, whether it's Joe's brother, whether it's the sister -- the entire family has enriched themselves off of Joe Biden's publicly funded office.</p><p>He won't release his documents from 30-something years in the Senate that are sitting at the University of Delaware. These aren't like private notes that he had as a citizen. This is while he was a senator in the United States, paid for by the American taxpayer, and, somehow, that's magically off-limits?</p><p>Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook was not off-limits, according to Democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  His high school yearbook.</p><p>But Joe Biden's Senate papers, no, no, no, we can't touch this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  so, it's about hypocrisy. It's about the double standard.</p><p>And I called it \"Liberal Privilege,\" because we hear a lot about privilege these days, but liberal privilege is the ultimate...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  ... because they can say one thing, do the other, and never get called on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm.</p><p>Well, look, in the meantime, the critics of your father continue stepping it up. Just in the last two weeks, you had the mayor of New York actually painting a Black Lives Matter mural right outside of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City.</p><p>This is where you work every day, right?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  I...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you pass this new mural here? Here is the shots of the mayor actually painting it right outside of Trump Tower.</p><p>Your reaction?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Well, listen, it would be nice if the mayor actually did something to help the people of his city.</p><p>He's busy there playing arts and crafts, but what has he actually done, other than oversee the destruction of New York City? The guy is -- it's literally gross incompetence, but he will go there for a photo op.</p><p>What happened to the billion dollars, almost a billion dollars that were literally just lost on him and his wife's pet projects in New York City? Now he wants to defund the police, take $1 billion out of New York City's police department's budget.</p><p>What do you think is going to happen with that? You see police officers retiring in droves. You want to stop senseless killings, like George Floyd? Guess what. The answer is not driving experienced, dedicated, loyal police officers into early retirement, and filling those -- that void with inexperienced people who may not have qualified otherwise, but are only getting the job because you need someone there.</p><p>The guy doesn't know what he's doing. It's gross negligence. And, honestly, it's worse. It's just sheer incompetence. But, again, he can play arts and crafts for the photo-op, and it's as though all of the things and all of his failures are totally forgotten. But the media will give him that benefit of the doubt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but it's going -- it's going to keep going.</p><p>And, in fact, de Blasio, Hillary Clinton, they all want mail-in voting. I want to talk to you about the, at because there was a city councilman among four people facing voter fraud charges in New Jersey.</p><p>We have got umpteen stories of this delusion, mail-in ballots forcing election officials in New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky to take two times as long to count votes in primary elections.</p><p>How much of this election is going to be mail-in voting, do you think, Don?</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  Well, the Democrats would like it all to be mail-in voting. You have seen that.</p><p>How often have Republicans won after the fact when people show up? Oh, look, magically I found a bucket of ballots in my car, they're all Democrats, four days later.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  It's truly disgusting.</p><p>Over the weekend, we saw a cat, a cat that has been dead for 12 years, since the end of the Bush administration, got a voter regulation form in its home in Atlanta.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  This is what's going on.</p><p>A mail -- a mail clerk, someone who worked for the U.S. Postal Service...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  ... pleaded guilty over the weekend for altering ballots.</p><p>You think the Democrats aren't going to take full advantage of this? They are running around bragging that they were able to manipulate Trump rallies on TikTok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is -- this is...</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  But they are not going to take advantage of mail-in voting.</p><p>Democrats have even said it's terrible. But now, when it seems to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  ... work against Trump, it's over.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. This is really serious stuff going into the election. You're right.</p><p>All right, real quick, final question here, Don. Will you run for the mayor of New York?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  No.</p><p>My only focus right now is making sure that my father wins in 2020. I see the policies that he's done. I see the economic results. We have seen it in the job numbers.</p><p>Donald Trump did the impossible. Donald Trump accomplished the Holy Grail of American politics, raising the job numbers for people, raising the minimum wages for the lowest-income earners, watching their wages go up for the first time in modern history.</p><p>Donald Trump did it all before. He's the guy that can do it again, clearly not swamp creature Joe Biden, who has an accomplishment record that is nonexistent in 50 years in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, maybe you will consider it after the president wins, then, Mayor of New York Donald Trump Jr.</p><p>TRUMP JR.:  I don't know. That's not really my kind of job, but who knows.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, good to see you, Don.</p><p>Thanks very much for being here.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>On July 20, Congress will return to Washington, with just one objective, hammering out the next stimulus bill.</p><p>The bipartisan talks happening just as the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits is set to expire at the end of the month.</p><p>Joining me right now is Republican Conference Chairman Senator John Barrasso.</p><p>And, Senator, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY):  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me what the plans are in terms of the CARES Act or the next part of the CARES Act, another stimulus plan.</p><p>BARRASSO:  Yes, there's a consensus we need to do another bill. That will be in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>And let me just tell you what I believe needs to be in it. And I think your viewers will agree.</p><p>Number one, it has to focus on getting people back to work and children back in school.</p><p>Number two, it has to focus on saving lives. And, to me, that means more testing, better treatment, and then, of course, a vaccine. And, finally, we need to provide the liability insurance for our health care workers, for our mom-and-pop small businesses, and for our schools, so they can all open in a good way.</p><p>Now, the Democrats have a proposal already. They passed it a month or so ago. And it's Nancy Pelosi living in handout heaven. It's direct checks to illegal immigrants. It's bailouts to big city and state pension plans that are run by Democrats.</p><p>We're not going to do that. The focus of this bill has to be getting people back to work and paychecks back into their pockets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're back on July 20, but then there's another recess beginning on August 8, right?</p><p>Do you think, in that three-week period, you're going to get another stimulus plan passed and signed before you leave again August 8?</p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, there are a couple of deadlines, as you mentioned.</p><p>One is the enhanced uninsured -- unemployment insurance benefits that run out on July 31. The other is the Paycheck Protection Program, which has been so successful. That runs out on August 8. That's helped keep about 50 million people on their -- on a payroll. And, in Wyoming, we had 13,000 of those loans.</p><p>So, yes, there's an urgency to get this done, a lot of different things in the components of it. The question is, should it include additional relief checks for people who have still not been able to get back to work, certainly in hard-hit industries, whether it's the service industry, the hospitality industry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>BARRASSO:  You know, we did that once before, but that was at people up to $95,000. We're looking at a lower number there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>BARRASSO:  And then the unemployment insurance, as you raised, these are enhanced benefits, where they have been paying people $600 a week above their own state unemployment benefits.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To make -- right.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some of them are making more to stay home, rather than to go to work.</p><p>Stay with us, Senator. I want to ask you about masks and whether it should be a policy in that next act as well.</p><p>We're talking with Senator Barrasso. We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>And we are back with Senator John Barrasso.</p><p>And, Senator, I want to ask you about masks and whether or not that should be part of your CARES Act. There are some states that have made wearing a mask a policy. Should it be a national policy?</p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, let me just say, Maria, as a doctor, I want to congratulate President Trump for wearing his mask yesterday in public for the world to see. I think that sends a very strong message to everyone.</p><p>We know that masks lower the risk of infection. We know it lowers the risk of death. And in this recent uptick, I just think it's even more important than ever.</p><p>And when it comes to opening schools, these are going to be local decisions, state decisions. But I just think, in terms of good planning and good health, as people try to resume their normal lives, masks, personal hygiene, washing their hands, socially distancing, that's all part of this as we continue to fight this disease.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.</p><p>And real quick, on the next CARES Act, when you get back on the 20th, it doesn't sound like you're going to leave on August 8 without anything getting done. Should I assume we will have another -- another stimulus package in that three week period?</p><p>BARRASSO:  There is general agreement we need to work to that end, and we need to deal with the issues affecting our nation.</p><p>There are still people who can't go back to work, through no fault of their own, because of the disease, because of maybe medical conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BARRASSO:  We need to make sure that they are cared for.</p><p>But we cannot continue to pay people more to sit at home than to go to work. And we have so many help wanted signs around Wyoming and the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BARRASSO:  We need to do all we can to get people back to work and help them earn that paycheck</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, real quick, before we go.</p><p>The Senate unanimously passed that bipartisan bill to sanction Chinese officials who threaten Hong Kong's authority, but the president hasn't signed it yet, right? What message does this send to the Communist Party? And will we see this get signed into law, do you think?</p><p>BARRASSO:  Well the communist Chinese are not our friends. There is no question about it.</p><p>My message to the Chinese is, never again. Never again will we, as Americans, be dependent upon you, the communist Chinese, for medicines, for materials, for minerals.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>BARRASSO:  But what you're seeing here with what they're doing, Maria, with this group, with Hong Kong...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BARRASSO:  ... with their -- the Chinese incursion into the South China Sea, it's all a part of their big plan to the -- to be the military, the economic and the technological superpower of the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.</p><p>BARRASSO:  We cannot allow it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks. Senator, thank you.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.   </p><p>      Joining us straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\":  a crime at the epidemic sweeping the United States and cities across the country, amid calls to defund the police. The murder rate spikes in California, New Orleans, Los Angeles, with shootings in Chicago jumping 75 percent in June alone.  </p><p>      Coming up, America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, with a message for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, shootings there up 130 percent, the violence unfolding against the backdrop of the 2020 election, now just 113 days away.  </p><p>      What's President Trump's plan to get us out of this? White House trade adviser Peter Navarro is here to lay out POTUS' second-term agenda.  </p><p>      We will also hear from Donald Trump Jr. this morning on the one issue he thinks will determine the winner, all of this as John Durham continues his deep dive into the origins of the Russia probe. Will he finish his investigation before the election? Congressman Jim Jordan, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, will weigh in.   </p><p>      Also here this morning, Senator John Barrasso with breaking news on the next stimulus package and when to expect it.  </p><p>      All that and a lot more, as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"   </p><p>      And we begin with Joe Biden unveiling his $700 billion buy America plan last week, with an emphasis on U.S. goods, jobs and manufacturing.  </p><p>      Biden's proposal may ring the bell for viewers of this program.   </p><p>      Here's White House trade adviser Peter Navarro just a few weeks ago on the president's first plan back on March 15.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>      PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF TRADE AND </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MANUFACTURING POLICY</emphasis>:  It's a three-pronged strategy consistent with what President Trump has done from the get-go in terms of onshoring jobs.  </p><p>      It's buy American, it's deregulate, and it's innovate technology. The buy American issue, Maria, is, we have HHS, the VA and DOD as large consumers of pharmaceuticals. We have got to get them to buy American over the long term, so we have a stable source of demand, so that that will attract investment.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And joining me right now is Peter Navarro, back with us. He's assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing.  </p><p>      Peter, it is good to see you this morning.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Hey, Maria.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, obviously, Joe Biden agrees...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Yes. Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  ... with your plan to buy America.   </p><p>      Your reaction to the former vice president's economic plan released this past week.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  A poll-driven, plagiarist, buy China Joe Biden.  </p><p>      I was astonished by that, given Joe Biden's history. I think everybody remembers back in 1988, when Biden ran for president, and did the trifecta of plagiarism, when he ripped off JFK, RFK and Neil Kinnock in speeches and had to withdraw from the race in shame and embarrassment.  </p><p>      And now he's just blatantly ripping off the president's buy American agenda, which goes back to the president going down the escalator with beautiful Melania. It started back then. Guess what?  </p><p>      I have personally been at the president's side when he has signed at least seven buy American orders. That's seven more than Biden signed or Obama signed during their term. And every one of those has worked to create American jobs.  </p><p>      We dramatically reduced the waivers, increased the amount of buy American in-government procurement. We upped the amount of iron and steel to close to 100 percent.  </p><p>      And so, listening to Joe Biden, I thought it was a really bad judgment. And whoever wrote that speech and put that in the puppet's head there, I think they might be looking for a new job soon.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, Peter, he also said that he will take the corporate tax rate back up.   </p><p>      The president, of course, in his tax legislation of 2017 cut the corporate rate to 21 percent. Biden says it should be at 28 percent. Wall Street seems to think Elizabeth Warren is the key economic voice in Biden's plan. She wants to raise taxes on everyone and also institute a wealth tax for the wealthiest individuals.  </p><p>      And he's also talking about changing -- he said he wants to change shareholder capitalism.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  What do you make of all of that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Well, I think that's a good way of talking about what President Trump is going to do in his second term, because what President Trump is going to do is finish what he started.  </p><p>      And the whole four points of the policy compass going back to the campaign was deregulation, cut taxes, dominate in energy, and have fair trade deals.  </p><p>      And everything that Biden wants to do and is running on is directly opposite that, directly opposite to the direction of growing the economy. So, that's what the president is going to do.   </p><p>      And we got to a point with this president, best jobs president in history, where he had the best economy in American history, in middle of January, we had the unemployment rate down for record lows for blacks, Hispanics, Asians, women.   </p><p>      And we were cruising along, until the Chinese Communist Party basically hit us with that deadly virus, that weaponized virus. And I don't think it's any coincidence that the first year that China had a down economy was the same year now that they're coming after us in all sorts of ways.  </p><p>      And Joe Biden is the candidate of the Chinese Communist Party. Trump, buy American, Joe Biden, buy China.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right.  </p><p>      Let me ask you about China, because, of course, we saw now a pushback in terms of sanctions on individuals in China responsible for taking away Hong Kong freedoms. People are waiting for the president to sign that in terms of the sanctions on those individuals.   </p><p>      Why should the U.S. be acting aggressively on Hong Kong?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Do you want to open borders for Hong Kong citizens to come to America? What's the plan?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  For decades, the Chinese Communist Party used Hong Kong as a weapon to attack the American manufacturing base and vacuum jobs and capital back to the Chinese mainland.   </p><p>      Do you know what, Maria? We put up with that, in support of a free and Democratic Hong Kong.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  But now that China has taken away their economy, they have effectively turned it just into another concentration camp, like Xinjiang, Tibet, and the rest of the Chinese mainland, now that that has happened, President Trump, going back to a speech in the Rose Garden at the end of May, said, we're going to strip them of all preferential treatment, so that they can't harm American workers anymore, and we're going to punish those responsible.  </p><p>      And so you can expect, early this week, the president to sign both the Hong Kong Autonomy Act and an executive order which will complete the process that the president started on May 29 in the Rose Garden. We cannot let Chinese Communist Party use Hong Kong anymore to attack the American economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  OK. Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  So that's coming.   </p><p>      The other thing that's on the table that we need to talk about is this whole TikTok, WeChat social media thing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Here is the thing, Maria.   </p><p>      What the American people have to understand is, all the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and seem so convenient, it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party, and the agencies which want to steal our intellectual property.   </p><p>      Those apps can be used to steal personal and financial information for blackmail and extortion. They can be used to steal business intellectual property and proprietary secrets.  </p><p>      The worst thing they use them for, besides surveilling and tracking Americans, the worst thing they do is engage in information warfare against the American people, against this president. The Chinese Communist Party wants Joe Biden more than anything right now, and the American people should not be subject to information warfare.   </p><p>      The other thing about TikTok, for example, and WeChat...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  ... even what -- this is really interesting. They're running the same playbook as Huawei, right? Put an American puppet in charge of Huawei as the CEO and say, hey, everything is going to be fine. We're going to be separate.  </p><p>      They're trying that game with TikTok. Not going to work. TikTok is the biggest -- TikTok and WeChat are the biggest forms of censorship on the Chinese mainland. And so expect strong action on that. Expect action, action, action from this president on buy American, on China, on jobs.  </p><p>      And this is the president that gets things done for the American people.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p>      You know, you mentioned the person running TikTok. It is actually extraordinary. This is -- this was the number two guy at Disney, Kevin Mayer, who is now the CEO of TikTok...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  ... an American, but, obviously, the Chinese -- the Chinese individual...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Running dog puppet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  ... who is a Communist member is the chairman.  </p><p>      But this is what I thought was really interesting. This week, we had a headline that says Democratic National Committee is warning that campaign -- against campaigns on using TikTok.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Yes. Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Even the Democratic National Committee is voicing concern.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Amazon, of course, we know already banned TikTok from employee phones.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Actually, Maria, they didn't.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So, you say these are data collectors?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Yes, Amazon actually...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  He said he was going to, Jeff Bezos.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  Yes. Yes. They announced it, and then they backed away from it, which shows the power of the Chinese Communist Party on corporate America.  </p><p>      And that's the problem. This guy who is running TikTok now, a Disney executive, who is more compromised than the Disney kingdom over in China? Because they want to sell all their Disney World tickets over there. They want to sell all their Disney content.  </p><p>      And so what -- if TikTok, if it separates as an American company, that doesn't help us, because it's going to be worth -- we're going to have to give China billions of dollars for the privilege of having TikTok operate on U.S. soil.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  So, TikTok, WeChat and -- India banned 70 of these things. So TikTok and WeChat, I suspect that the president is just getting started with those two.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, that's what I was just going to say, because India has banned TikTok. Is the president going to?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  I never get ahead of the president, but we are looking very closely at this problem.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  And just run through the checklist.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  The information warfare, surveillance and tracking, stealing your data.   </p><p>      No American -- the parents -- their kids are sitting there with TikTok. I mean, data right out of the household is going to the Chinese Communist Party.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  What can go wrong there?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Peter...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NAVARRO</emphasis>:  So, what we need to do -- jobs and China, that's what this campaign is about.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right, we will be watching.  </p><p>      Great to talk with you, as always, Peter. Thank you so much, Peter Navarro from the White House this morning.   </p><p>      Coming up:  Will John Durham complete his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe in time to impact the 2020 election?  </p><p>      The ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, will weigh in after this break.   </p><p>      Stay with us.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, welcome back.   </p><p>      Attorney General Bill Barr told me that the Russian collusion narrative was the closest the U.S. has ever come to a coup since the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.   </p><p>      Yet, according to a new Rasmussen poll, most voters do not know there's evidence that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were even involved in it.   </p><p>      A.G. Barr recently spoke to me about the status of John Durham's investigation on the FBI's probe into the Trump campaign.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL</emphasis>:  He's pressing ahead as hard as he can. And I expect that we will have some developments hopefully before the end of this summer.  </p><p>      But, as I have said, his investigation will continue. It's not going to stop because of the election. What happens after the election may depend on who wins the election.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Congressman Jim Jordan is the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.  </p><p>      Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH)</emphasis>:  You bet. Good to be with you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Where are we on the John Durham investigation, sir? What do you know?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Well, we know what Bill Barr has told us.  </p><p>      Now, the attorney general will be in front of the Judiciary Committee in two weeks. I'm sure he will get asked about this and a number of other issues.  </p><p>      But the attorney general has said that he expects something this summer. We're obviously -- we're hitting the summer, so let's hope it happens. Let's hope it happens before the election.   </p><p>      I will tell you this, Maria. The number one question I get, whether I'm in the Fourth District of Ohio or traveling around our state or traveling around the country, the number one question I get from people is, they will walk up to me and says, when is somebody going to jail?   </p><p>      And the reason they say that is because they're sick of the double standard, this idea that there's one set of rules for the politically connected in D.C. and a different set for us regular folks.  </p><p>      So let's hope we have the investigation done before the election. Let's hope that someone is going to be held accountable for the major wrongdoing that took place when they targeted the president's campaign and spied on the president's campaign.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, it's pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>      And we know that there was always criminality done, whether it's leaking confidential information, or changing a document of evidence, which is -- one of the FBI agents already did that. They changed a document.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Or maybe it was entrapment, lying to investigators.  </p><p>      So, how come we haven't seen any charges yet? I mean, there are, what, 14 referrals of criminal charges already from you and your colleagues?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Yes. I mean, who knows.  </p><p>      But here is how bad it was. Michael Flynn, 38 different people 49 different times unmasked Michael Flynn's name between Election Day 2016 and Inauguration Day in January 2017. So, in that short two-month time period, 49 separate times, they were unmasking his name, even though they already knew, all these people already knew that there was no basis for the investigation to begin with.  </p><p>      And how do we know that they knew there was no basis, there was no proper predicate? Because, when they testified, they told us that. Ric Grenell released the testimony of Comey and Clapper and Brennan and Rice and Samantha Power, released all of the testimony.  </p><p>      And they all said the same thing:  We never saw any evidence of any type of coordination, collusion, conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. But they investigated it anyway, even up until the time when Bob Mueller was named special counsel.  </p><p>      Jim Comey, when we deposed him in the House last Congress, when we deposed him, he said:  After 10 months, we didn't have anything.   </p><p>      But Comey does what? Leaks his memo, so we get two years of Bob Mueller, leaks his memos for the express purpose of getting a special counsel named. And then we had the 19 lawyers, 40 agents, 500 subpoenas, 2,800 or 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas, and $30 million to tell us what we already knew, what they already knew, that there was nothing there.  </p><p>      So let's hope that, ultimately, someone is held accountable.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Do you think there will be indictments?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  I hope so. I mean, I have said this all along.   </p><p>      I think Jim Comey is the biggest culprit here. It was the Comey cabal, this small handful of people at the top of the FBI. And then, remember, Bill Barr, the first time he testified, said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI  </p><p>      Comey, McCabe, Baker, Strzok, Page, they all left or had to be fired as the key people...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  ... who ran the Clinton investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation.   </p><p>      Comey is the ringleader here. I hope they give him a second look. And I hope he's ultimately held accountable.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Let me ask you.   </p><p>      Let me switch gears, ask you about your committee, the Judiciary Committee's closed-door testimony of Geoffrey Berman. I have in front of me your takeaways from the committee's transcribed interview with Berman.   </p><p>      Nadler says that Barr dealings with Berman often came close to bribery. Your reaction? And tell us what you can about that closed-door hearing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, Mr. Nadler's statement is ridiculous.   </p><p>      When we deposed Mr. Berman, he said very clearly -- we asked him about his meeting with Bill Barr on June 19 in New York. We said, did you talk about any cases? No. Did you talk about any suspects? No. Did you talk about any witnesses to any cases? No. Did you talk about the president? No,.  </p><p>      There was nothing there. The attorney general and the president of the United States are entitled to have the people they want as U.S. attorneys around the country. That's all this was.   </p><p>      The Democrats, because they don't like the fact that Bill Barr is trying to get to the bottom of what took place in the previous Justice Department, the Obama-Biden-Comey Justice Department, because they don't like the fact that he's trying to clean up the politics that existed in the previous administration, they continue to go after him, so much so that they filed articles of impeachment against the attorney general just a week-and-a-half ago.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  That's how ridiculous the Democrats are.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Congressman, I have got to ask you about tech tyranny and the upcoming hearings that you're going to have in Judiciary.   </p><p>      We will hear from people like Apple's CEO, Google's CEO, Facebook, Twitter in a hearing on July 25 or 28. Tell me about your letter to Jack Dorsey about the president's tweets and what you're expecting out of technology, big tech.   </p><p>      Are they going to try to sway the election in November?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Well, Maria, I always start with this simple question. Why is does always seem that it's just conservatives who get censored or shadowbanned by these big tech companies?   </p><p>      Why was it two years ago that there are 435 members of the House, there are 100 members of the Senate, 535, but only four were shadowbanned, Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan?  </p><p>      Interesting four. I always say -- when we send a letter to Jack Dorsey, when we brought this to his attention, he indicated that, oh, it was just a glitch in our algorithm, to which I responded, glitch in your algorithm? What did you put in the algorithm, the names Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan?  </p><p>      I mean, it's always conservatives.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  Why is it only the president -- why is it only the president who gets censored? You never see them going after Joe Biden.   </p><p>      Why is it just -- why was it The Federalist that Google tried to demonetize?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JORDAN</emphasis>:  You never see a liberal news outlet trying to be demonetized.  </p><p>      So, that, to me, is the fundamental question. And that has got to change, because, in America today, if only one side is allowed to talk, that's not the First Amendment. You got to have a real debate. And this cancel culture mob and the impact they have on these big tech companies is a scary road we're traveling down.  </p><p>      And it needs to stop. And that's what we're going to focus on as Republicans in these hearings.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Congressman, it's great to have you this morning.  </p><p>      We will be watching, certainly, closely. It's so wonderful to get your take on all of this, Congressman Jim Jordan.   </p><p>      Coming up, Rudy Giuliani is here on the Supreme Court decision that President Trump should turn over his tax returns.  </p><p>      That's coming up next.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  The Supreme Court making headlines on Thursday, ruling that President Trump's financial and tax records are fair game for New York prosecutors.  </p><p>      The president since calling decision not fair. But is it really the slam-dunk victory his critics were hoping for?  </p><p>      Joining me right now is former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who also served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York for six years.  </p><p>      And, Rudy, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK</emphasis>:  Always a pleasure, Maria, yes, absolutely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  So, that case is really terribly decided.   </p><p>      But go ahead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  No, about the tax returns.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  Oh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Are you going -- are you going to be responding in any way? Will the tax releases have any bearing on the election, in your view?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, there's still room for opposition.   </p><p>      You could make the argument that they have no particularized need for it. You could also make the argument that they are not investigating any particularized crime.   </p><p>      They have no reason to believe that there's anything wrong with his tax returns. I mean, all these tax returns have been, by and large -- maybe not the last one -- but all of them have been audited. All of them have been either passed on or settled.  </p><p>      And there should be something in your tax returns. In other words, we get audited, we make a deal, we pay the government, you don't come after me forever for that.   </p><p>      And, also, this is the president of the United States. There are literally 400 -- 4,000 prosecutors who can now come after his records. I don't think the court ever thought of that.  </p><p>      So there may be a chance to revisit this. The burden this would place on the executive, like, if you had an opposition party -- and look at the DAs we have now. We have Soros-elected anarchist DAs. They're not there to prosecute the law. They are there to undermine the law.   </p><p>      He put them there. Why would Soros pay for DAs, other than to undermine our government?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Wow.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  He got people elected who release criminals, don't prosecute cases. In Philadelphia, they won't even bring a case to the DA, he's so anti-police, pro-criminal.   </p><p>      Five years, Soros has been funding these. And nobody paid attention to it. But he had a reason. It's to undermine our government. And I think we have a chance to revisit this.  </p><p>      Also, we can argue that they have no need for it. This is a fishing expedition. I mean, I think we fight them right down to the wire.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Let me ask you about what's happening to our cities, Rudy.   </p><p>      You oversaw New York City becoming the safest city on your leadership because of the moves you made. Look at New York City right now, shootings soaring to 205 percent. What will it take to get this city back with law and order? Shooting incidences up 130 percent, murder up 23 percent, burglary up 118 percent.  </p><p>      What is your reaction to Mayor de Blasio's new plan, he says, to take back the blocks, relying heavily on community members on the streets?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, the reality is, he's already amended that plan, because it was -- I mean, it's stupid throughout, but he was going to have community leaders accompany the police, until, last night, he had another night of violence that was unreal.  </p><p>      So now the community leaders are not going to accompany the police. I think they got an idea, hey, Mayor, you go with them. Maybe we don't want to go, because they shoot at us. We had a terrible situation with a domestic violence thing last night.   </p><p>      I mean, it's a disaster, Maria. I have never seen it like this. I mean, there were more murders in the city under Dinkins, 2,400, 2,200, but we never had this total disrespect for the police. Even in those bad old days, nobody was going to spit at a police officer, nobody was going to punch a police officer.  </p><p>      And they took advantage of the no choke hold last night in an incident that I have a videotape of, where the police officer couldn't get ahold of him. The guy put a choke hold on the cop and almost killed him, and he couldn't defend himself.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Oh, my God.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  I mean, we're going to get a cop killed with that stupid no choke hold thing, the way it's interpreted.  </p><p>      We're getting cops killed. And the reaction -- the reality is, it's worse because this is a breakdown in general respect for the police, for our government, and hatred for our country.  </p><p>      And there's a purpose to it. These people are Marxists. They want to take over our government. When are we going to wake up and realize that? Just go read what they write.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  Look at the fact that the woman who is taking in the money for the BLM is a convicted terrorist who should be in jail for 58 years, except crooked Clinton pardoned her, a terrorist who was involved in police killings.   </p><p>      She is handling the money for the Black Lives Matter. This is a woman dedicated to the overthrow of our government.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And, look, Mayor de Blasio obviously cut the budget for the NYPD by a billion dollars.   </p><p>      You said the last time you were with me that Governor Cuomo can replace Mayor de Blasio. How come he hasn't done it yet then? The New York A.G. is recommending de Blasio should no longer have the authority in New York enforcement matters. Is that enough?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  Well, you know, I will give him the citation.  </p><p>      It's Article 1, Section 9 of the New York City charter, which I pretty much have memorized. It says that the governor can remove the mayor. You don't even have to have cause. Now precedent would say it would have to be corruption, like they attempted to remove Jimmy Walker, but he resigned.  </p><p>      Or it could be gross incompetence. Or it could be putting the lives of New Yorkers in jeopardy. Bill de Blasio, through his incompetence, has killed New Yorkers. His negligence in dealing with COVID is outrageous, the things he didn't do and the things that he encouraged.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  They criticize President Trump for being late. He was telling people to go to gyms two weeks into it, two weeks after the president made it clear, this is very dangerous.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Wow.  </p><p>      It certainly feels like a different city today, I will tell you. You just don't feel safe in New York City.   </p><p>      I want to switch gears. You were the A.G. for the Southern District of New York from 1983 to 1989, where Ghislaine Maxwell is now being indicted. Reaction to the charges. Do you think she's going to name names? What's your reaction to this Jeffrey Epstein-Ghislaine Maxwell situation?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  Well, I don't know all the people there now, but the person in charge, Audrey Strauss, was a colleague of mine. And she's a very, very -- she's a very good lawyer and a very honest and down-the-middle-kind of prosecutor.   </p><p>      I can only guess what Maxwell has. And it sounds like she's got tapes, and it would not make sense if they didn't. I mean, they were pretty smart people. They have been protected for a long time. There must be a reason for that. They must have a lot of things on a lot of people. And it's going to be really interesting to see.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  You can't argue with a tape. You can't argue. There's got to be a lot of people very scared over the last couple of days.  </p><p>      And I'd like to keep her alive, guys. I mean, you know, she is in a prison.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  You can keep somebody alive in a prison.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  And if they need any help, if they need any help on how to keep somebody alive in a prison, I used to also run the Bureau of Prisons. I think I could show them.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right, Rudy, it's great to see you this morning.  </p><p>      Thanks very much for joining us.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Great to see you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIULIANI</emphasis>:  You know you're the best.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Coming up next:  Donald Trump Jr. is here with his reaction to the Black Lives Matter mural in New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio helped paint right outside of Trump Tower this week, where he works every day.   </p><p>      We are going to get his reaction when we come back.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Welcome back.   </p><p>      New photographs this morning of President Trump wearing a mask publicly for the first time yesterday during his visit to Walter Reed Hospital.   </p><p>      The president, who met with wounded soldiers and medical workers, told reporters he loves masks in the appropriate locations, but still believes they have a time and place.  </p><p>      Joining us right now with reaction is the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Donald Trump Jr.   </p><p>      And, Don, it is good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION</emphasis>: It's my pleasure, Maria. How are you?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, great.  </p><p>      Interesting to see your dad donning a mask. Obviously, things are serious. You have got the potential of a second spike.   </p><p>      How is Kimberly doing? We know that Kimberly has contracted COVID, along with a top convention person. Is she OK?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  She's 100 percent fine.   </p><p>      She's -- zero symptoms, zero anything. We're in quarantine, obviously, and I am too because of proximity. But, other than that, you really wouldn't know that there's anything even going on.  </p><p>      So, it's been good. I -- under the circumstances, it's as good as it can get.  </p><p>      And I also saw my father looked pretty good in the mask the other day.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  And I think what people also have to realize, when he talks about there being a time and place, anyone who comes into proximity with him is literally tested that day, is literally tested moments before they allow access.  </p><p>      So he's obviously going to be much less susceptible to this than anyone else, because, literally, there is a daily screening process if you're going to even be within proximity to him.  </p><p>      So I think that's important for people to note. But when he's going to Walter Reed to visit our sick and our wounded soldiers, he's going to take that very seriously.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, but people are taking seriously the idea that we are seeing a second wave potentially, and spikes in some hot spots across the country.  </p><p>      What does that mean for the convention, Don? And what about the idea that, look, the Democrats have already said they're going to do a virtual convention? There are polls that have Biden either tied with Trump or actually leading Donald Trump.   </p><p>      Your thoughts of all of these worries going into the convention and then, of course, the election?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  Well, I think, for the Democrats, of course they want to do a virtual convention, because there's no enthusiasm for Joe Biden. He can't get people to show up a rally, if he was able to do rallies.  </p><p>      So this whole scenario is really the ultimate best-case scenario for Joe Biden and his campaign. They don't want him on the stump. They don't want him speaking to reporters. They don't want him ad-libbed. Honestly, they don't even want him on a teleprompter, because he can't even get that right.  </p><p>      So, for them, it's sort of the ultimate. I think, with our convention, there's a lot of people that want to do it. They want to be enthusiastic. But we can do that and we can do it safely. We can take the necessary precautions. We can protect the people that are going to be there. We can implement things that you wouldn't necessarily normally implement at a convention to do so.  </p><p>      So, they're going to take it very seriously. We're going to do a great job with it, and it's going to be an awesome event.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  What does the president need to get these numbers up? Are you buying these polls? It looks like one after the next. It is a real tight race. And, in many cases, Biden is leading the president.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  Well, listen, I think, when you have the media onslaught, where a media has just totally abdicated their position to objectively look at both sides, they're not looking into any of Biden's past.  </p><p>      They're not looking into any of his history. They're not looking into his family's graft. They're not looking into how insanely soft he's been on China throughout his entire career. And let's not forget, this is a 50-year career in Washington, D.C.</p><p>      They're trying to run him like he's a moderate outsider. This guy is the epitome of the swamp. So they want to do whatever they can to keep the American people from actually seeing Biden.   </p><p>      He hasn't been defined. And the media is trying to make sure that no one gets to define Joe Biden, because, once he is, you will see how terrible this notion could be for America.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Which is why you're out with a upcoming book, \"Liberal Privilege.\"   </p><p>      You're going to talk a lot about Biden in this book, right? You're self-publishing a book? When is it coming out, Don?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  A hundred percent.  </p><p>      I guess one of offshoots, one of the only positive things of quarantine for the last few months was, I had a lot of free time. And I was looking into it, and actually went on and hired a researcher just to do it myself, because I said, if the media is going to totally neglect this guy, this history, these terrible trade deals, especially now, in the post-COVID-19 world, where we are going to actually have to deal with China and deal tough with China, which is what Donald Trump's -- that's his wheelhouse.   </p><p>      That's his forte. He's the only guy to do it in the modern American history. That Joe Biden can sell this notion of, well, now we're going to be buy American, after 50 years of legislation that sent our jobs, that sent our American dream to China, it's asinine.  </p><p>      But I'm sitting there looking, whether it's Hunter Biden, whether it's Joe's brother, whether it's the sister -- the entire family has enriched themselves off of Joe Biden's publicly funded office.   </p><p>      He won't release his documents from 30-something years in the Senate that are sitting at the University of Delaware. These aren't like private notes that he had as a citizen. This is while he was a senator in the United States, paid for by the American taxpayer, and, somehow, that's magically off-limits?   </p><p>      Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook was not off-limits, according to Democrats.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  His high school yearbook.  </p><p>      But Joe Biden's Senate papers, no, no, no, we can't touch this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes. Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  so, it's about hypocrisy. It's about the double standard.  </p><p>      And I called it \"Liberal Privilege,\" because we hear a lot about privilege these days, but liberal privilege is the ultimate...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  ... because they can say one thing, do the other, and never get called on it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Hmm.  </p><p>      Well, look, in the meantime, the critics of your father continue stepping it up. Just in the last two weeks, you had the mayor of New York actually painting a Black Lives Matter mural right outside of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City.   </p><p>      This is where you work every day, right?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  I...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Do you pass this new mural here? Here is the shots of the mayor actually painting it right outside of Trump Tower.   </p><p>      Your reaction?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  Well, listen, it would be nice if the mayor actually did something to help the people of his city.   </p><p>      He's busy there playing arts and crafts, but what has he actually done, other than oversee the destruction of New York City? The guy is -- it's literally gross incompetence, but he will go there for a photo op.   </p><p>      What happened to the billion dollars, almost a billion dollars that were literally just lost on him and his wife's pet projects in New York City? Now he wants to defund the police, take $1 billion out of New York City's police department's budget.   </p><p>      What do you think is going to happen with that? You see police officers retiring in droves. You want to stop senseless killings, like George Floyd? Guess what. The answer is not driving experienced, dedicated, loyal police officers into early retirement, and filling those -- that void with inexperienced people who may not have qualified otherwise, but are only getting the job because you need someone there.   </p><p>      The guy doesn't know what he's doing. It's gross negligence. And, honestly, it's worse. It's just sheer incompetence. But, again, he can play arts and crafts for the photo-op, and it's as though all of the things and all of his failures are totally forgotten. But the media will give him that benefit of the doubt.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, but it's going -- it's going to keep going.  </p><p>      And, in fact, de Blasio, Hillary Clinton, they all want mail-in voting. I want to talk to you about the, at because there was a city councilman among four people facing voter fraud charges in New Jersey.  </p><p>      We have got umpteen stories of this delusion, mail-in ballots forcing election officials in New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky to take two times as long to count votes in primary elections.   </p><p>      How much of this election is going to be mail-in voting, do you think, Don?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  Well, the Democrats would like it all to be mail-in voting. You have seen that.   </p><p>      How often have Republicans won after the fact when people show up? Oh, look, magically I found a bucket of ballots in my car, they're all Democrats, four days later.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  It's truly disgusting.  </p><p>      Over the weekend, we saw a cat, a cat that has been dead for 12 years, since the end of the Bush administration, got a voter regulation form in its home in Atlanta.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Oh, my goodness.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  This is what's going on.  </p><p>      A mail -- a mail clerk, someone who worked for the U.S. Postal Service...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  ... pleaded guilty over the weekend for altering ballots.   </p><p>      You think the Democrats aren't going to take full advantage of this? They are running around bragging that they were able to manipulate Trump rallies on TikTok.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  This is -- this is...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  But they are not going to take advantage of mail-in voting.  </p><p>      Democrats have even said it's terrible. But now, when it seems to...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  ... work against Trump, it's over.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes. This is really serious stuff going into the election. You're right.   </p><p>      All right, real quick, final question here, Don. Will you run for the mayor of New York?   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p>      My only focus right now is making sure that my father wins in 2020. I see the policies that he's done. I see the economic results. We have seen it in the job numbers.   </p><p>      Donald Trump did the impossible. Donald Trump accomplished the Holy Grail of American politics, raising the job numbers for people, raising the minimum wages for the lowest-income earners, watching their wages go up for the first time in modern history.   </p><p>      Donald Trump did it all before. He's the guy that can do it again, clearly not swamp creature Joe Biden, who has an accomplishment record that is nonexistent in 50 years in Washington, D.C.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So, maybe you will consider it after the president wins, then, Mayor of New York Donald Trump Jr.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP JR.</emphasis>:  I don't know. That's not really my kind of job, but who knows.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right, good to see you, Don.   </p><p>      Thanks very much for being here.  </p><p>      We will be right back.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Welcome back.   </p><p>      On July 20, Congress will return to Washington, with just one objective, hammering out the next stimulus bill.   </p><p>      The bipartisan talks happening just as the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits is set to expire at the end of the month.   </p><p>      Joining me right now is Republican Conference Chairman Senator John Barrasso.  </p><p>      And, Senator, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY)</emphasis>:  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Tell me what the plans are in terms of the CARES Act or the next part of the CARES Act, another stimulus plan.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  Yes, there's a consensus we need to do another bill. That will be in the next couple of weeks.  </p><p>      And let me just tell you what I believe needs to be in it. And I think your viewers will agree.   </p><p>      Number one, it has to focus on getting people back to work and children back in school.   </p><p>      Number two, it has to focus on saving lives. And, to me, that means more testing, better treatment, and then, of course, a vaccine. And, finally, we need to provide the liability insurance for our health care workers, for our mom-and-pop small businesses, and for our schools, so they can all open in a good way.   </p><p>      Now, the Democrats have a proposal already. They passed it a month or so ago. And it's Nancy Pelosi living in handout heaven. It's direct checks to illegal immigrants. It's bailouts to big city and state pension plans that are run by Democrats.   </p><p>      We're not going to do that. The focus of this bill has to be getting people back to work and paychecks back into their pockets.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So, you're back on July 20, but then there's another recess beginning on August 8, right?   </p><p>      Do you think, in that three-week period, you're going to get another stimulus plan passed and signed before you leave again August 8?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  Well, there are a couple of deadlines, as you mentioned.  </p><p>      One is the enhanced uninsured -- unemployment insurance benefits that run out on July 31. The other is the Paycheck Protection Program, which has been so successful. That runs out on August 8. That's helped keep about 50 million people on their -- on a payroll. And, in Wyoming, we had 13,000 of those loans.   </p><p>      So, yes, there's an urgency to get this done, a lot of different things in the components of it. The question is, should it include additional relief checks for people who have still not been able to get back to work, certainly in hard-hit industries, whether it's the service industry, the hospitality industry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I see.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  You know, we did that once before, but that was at people up to $95,000. We're looking at a lower number there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  And then the unemployment insurance, as you raised, these are enhanced benefits, where they have been paying people $600 a week above their own state unemployment benefits.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  To make -- right.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And some of them are making more to stay home, rather than to go to work.   </p><p>      Stay with us, Senator. I want to ask you about masks and whether it should be a policy in that next act as well.  </p><p>      We're talking with Senator Barrasso. We will be right back.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Welcome back.   </p><p>      And we are back with Senator John Barrasso.   </p><p>      And, Senator, I want to ask you about masks and whether or not that should be part of your CARES Act. There are some states that have made wearing a mask a policy. Should it be a national policy?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  Well, let me just say, Maria, as a doctor, I want to congratulate President Trump for wearing his mask yesterday in public for the world to see. I think that sends a very strong message to everyone.   </p><p>      We know that masks lower the risk of infection. We know it lowers the risk of death. And in this recent uptick, I just think it's even more important than ever.  </p><p>      And when it comes to opening schools, these are going to be local decisions, state decisions. But I just think, in terms of good planning and good health, as people try to resume their normal lives, masks, personal hygiene, washing their hands, socially distancing, that's all part of this as we continue to fight this disease.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right.  </p><p>      And real quick, on the next CARES Act, when you get back on the 20th, it doesn't sound like you're going to leave on August 8 without anything getting done. Should I assume we will have another -- another stimulus package in that three week period?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  There is general agreement we need to work to that end, and we need to deal with the issues affecting our nation.   </p><p>      There are still people who can't go back to work, through no fault of their own, because of the disease, because of maybe medical conditions.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  We need to make sure that they are cared for.  </p><p>      But we cannot continue to pay people more to sit at home than to go to work. And we have so many help wanted signs around Wyoming and the country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  We need to do all we can to get people back to work and help them earn that paycheck   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Senator, real quick, before we go.  </p><p>      The Senate unanimously passed that bipartisan bill to sanction Chinese officials who threaten Hong Kong's authority, but the president hasn't signed it yet, right? What message does this send to the Communist Party? And will we see this get signed into law, do you think?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  Well the communist Chinese are not our friends. There is no question about it.   </p><p>      My message to the Chinese is, never again. Never again will we, as Americans, be dependent upon you, the communist Chinese, for medicines, for materials, for minerals.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I see.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  But what you're seeing here with what they're doing, Maria, with this group, with Hong Kong...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  ... with their -- the Chinese incursion into the South China Sea, it's all a part of their big plan to the -- to be the military, the economic and the technological superpower of the world.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARRASSO</emphasis>:  We cannot allow it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Thanks. Senator, thank you.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BK-R881-F15W-H1C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

TOM COTTON (R-AR)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JUNE 18, 2020</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS:      SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL CAVUTO, FNC ANCHOR</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Senator Tom Cotton is working on a big crackdown. He joins us right now, the Arkansas senator with us right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator, good to have you.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR):  Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  What are we looking at doing here? What do you want to see done?</p><p>COTTON:  Well, Neil, too often, big tech companies, especially social media companies, engage in unfair and biased moderation of comments or posts. Sometimes, they delete them. Sometimes, they lock down accounts entirely.</p><p>I revealed this week on the FOX News website my own story of that kind of censorship. Just a little over a couple weeks ago, Twitter contacted me about posts I made about the writing and the looting and the way to respond to them and said...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>COTTON:  ... these were in violation of our policies, and you have 30 minutes to delete them. They gave us shifting explanations.</p><p>Sometimes, they were conflicting explanations. We called their bluff. We sent them my arguments for why those posts should remain up. We didn't hear back from them for almost two hours. And they said, you can keep your account.</p><p>Now, I'm a United States senator. I have other ways to make my voice heard on the Senate floor, for instance. But just imagine all the conservatives out there on social media or who run conservative websites who are at the whims of big tech.</p><p>You saw that this week, when NBC News and Google almost deplatformed \"The Federalist,\" a popular conservative news site, for the comments, not articles posted on \"The Federalist,\" but for the comments.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>COTTON:  So, what we propose to do, Senators Hawley, Rubio, Braun and I, is to limit the immunity that these social media companies have from legal liability if they're engaged in that kind of censorship, that kind of curation of content.</p><p>They can either be neutral platforms, where everyone can speak, or they can be regulated platforms, and have to face the consequences for those actions. But they can't be both.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Or you can have no fact-checkers, no one policing, and like the Wild West, right? I mean, there is a separate concern.</p><p>I think Facebook is trying to walk this line, we don't believe in fact-checkers. It can come back to bite us if we fact-check the president or if you fact-check a prominent liberal.</p><p>So, what do you think of that? Is that the solution? Because what's at stake, as you know, Senator, is a very successful, thriving technology industry. And these behemoths, say what you will of them, make Americans a lot of money. Obviously, they make a lot of money, and they are the standard for the world.</p><p>What do you do? How do you balance that?</p><p>COTTON:  Well, Neil, at a minimum, these companies need to provide more transparency and consistency.</p><p>Again, take my example from a couple of weeks ago. We got an ultimatum that gave us less than 30 minutes to either censor my own posts or to allow Twitter to permanently lock down my account. They wouldn't put anything in writing. They very carefully avoided putting anything in writing.</p><p>And when we pointed out some of the policy inconsistencies that they cited to us, then they just came up with new explanations. And, again, if they will do that to a sitting United States senator, what will they do to a regular website or to conservative citizens who just want to make their voices heard?</p><p>That's why, at a minimum, they need to be more transparent and consistent. And if they're not going to offer that kind of transparency and consistency, if they are going to engage in carefully moderating the content they provide, and censoring opinions that they don't like, even when those opinions garner majority support repeatedly at the polls or in surveys, then they ought not to enjoy the extraordinary immunity from liability that the laws have given them.</p><p>CAVUTO:  If I can switch gears a little here, because you're right, there's a back-and-forth here. A lot of liberals have typically gone after these guys who have gotten too big for their britches, so there's an effort to rein them in that way, the same abroad, Senator.</p><p>But I did want to get your quick thoughts on this Bolton book that is out on the president, more or less saying that he got a little too cozy with China and, through Xi Jinping, was even trying to all but plead that the Chinese buy agricultural goods, that it would help him out in the 2020 election.</p><p>A, do you believe that? And, B, if he did something like that, Bolton seemed to be intimating that's an impeachable offense. What do you think?</p><p>COTTON:  Well, so, first, Neil, let me say, I haven't read the book. I have seen some of the media excerpts on it. But, no, I thought many of the claims to be simply implausible.</p><p>Let's take one about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Bolton claims that Mike Pompeo passed him a note during a summit with President Trump and Kim Jong-un, and that that handwritten note by Secretary Pompeo insulted the president.</p><p>I find that to be completely implausible, based on my personal relationship and years of history with Mike Pompeo. If it is the case, then Mr. Bolton could presumably produce that note in Mike Pompeo's handwriting, since he is, as everyone knows, a very careful and methodical notetaker and collector of information.</p><p>And I think that one episode reflects on many of the claims. To cite the one you gave, I'm sure that President Trump repeatedly, in his conversations with Xi Jinping, emphasized that America's farmers have not been getting a fair shake from the Chinese Communist Party for years, and that, in fact, that was one of the main objectives of the president in trying to get better trade terms with China, is to get their markets opened up to our farmers.</p><p>That's a completely appropriate posture for the president to take.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we will see.</p><p>The passing note thing, you're not buying.

He joins us right now, the Arkansas senator with us right now.  </p><p>      Senator, good to have you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR)</emphasis>:  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  What are we looking at doing here? What do you want to see done?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COTTON</emphasis>:  Well, Neil, too often, big tech companies, especially social media companies, engage in unfair and biased moderation of comments or posts. Sometimes, they delete them. Sometimes, they lock down accounts entirely.  </p><p>      I revealed this week on the FOX News website my own story of that kind of censorship. Just a little over a couple weeks ago, Twitter contacted me about posts I made about the writing and the looting and the way to respond to them and said...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COTTON</emphasis>:  ... these were in violation of our policies, and you have 30 minutes to delete them. They gave us shifting explanations.  </p><p>      Sometimes, they were conflicting explanations. We called their bluff. We sent them my arguments for why those posts should remain up. We didn't hear back from them for almost two hours. And they said, you can keep your account.  </p><p>      Now, I'm a United States senator. I have other ways to make my voice heard on the Senate floor, for instance. But just imagine all the conservatives out there on social media or who run conservative websites who are at the whims of big tech.  </p><p>      You saw that this week, when NBC News and Google almost deplatformed \"The Federalist,\" a popular conservative news site, for the comments, not articles posted on \"The Federalist,\" but for the comments.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COTTON</emphasis>:  So, what we propose to do, Senators Hawley, Rubio, Braun and I, is to limit the immunity that these social media companies have from legal liability if they're engaged in that kind of censorship, that kind of curation of content.  </p><p>      They can either be neutral platforms, where everyone can speak, or they can be regulated platforms, and have to face the consequences for those actions. But they can't be both.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  Or you can have no fact-checkers, no one policing, and like the Wild West, right? I mean, there is a separate concern.  </p><p>      I think Facebook is trying to walk this line, we don't believe in fact-checkers. It can come back to bite us if we fact-check the president or if you fact-check a prominent liberal.  </p><p>      So, what do you think of that? Is that the solution? Because what's at stake, as you know, Senator, is a very successful, thriving technology industry. And these behemoths, say what you will of them, make Americans a lot of money. Obviously, they make a lot of money, and they are the standard for the world.  </p><p>      What do you do? How do you balance that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COTTON</emphasis>:  Well, Neil, at a minimum, these companies need to provide more transparency and consistency.  </p><p>      Again, take my example from a couple of weeks ago. We got an ultimatum that gave us less than 30 minutes to either censor my own posts or to allow Twitter to permanently lock down my account. They wouldn't put anything in writing. They very carefully avoided putting anything in writing.  </p><p>      And when we pointed out some of the policy inconsistencies that they cited to us, then they just came up with new explanations. And, again, if they will do that to a sitting United States senator, what will they do to a regular website or to conservative citizens who just want to make their voices heard?  </p><p>      That's why, at a minimum, they need to be more transparent and consistent. And if they're not going to offer that kind of transparency and consistency, if they are going to engage in carefully moderating the content they provide, and censoring opinions that they don't like, even when those opinions garner majority support repeatedly at the polls or in surveys, then they ought not to enjoy the extraordinary immunity from liability that the laws have given them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  If I can switch gears a little here, because you're right, there's a back-and-forth here. A lot of liberals have typically gone after these guys who have gotten too big for their britches, so there's an effort to rein them in that way, the same abroad, Senator.  </p><p>      But I did want to get your quick thoughts on this Bolton book that is out on the president, more or less saying that he got a little too cozy with China and, through Xi Jinping, was even trying to all but plead that the Chinese buy agricultural goods, that it would help him out in the 2020 election.  </p><p>      A, do you believe that? And, B, if he did something like that, Bolton seemed to be intimating that's an impeachable offense. What do you think?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COTTON</emphasis>:  Well, so, first, Neil, let me say, I haven't read the book. I have seen some of the media excerpts on it. But, no, I thought many of the claims to be simply implausible.  </p><p>      Let's take one about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Bolton claims that Mike Pompeo passed him a note during a summit with President Trump and Kim Jong-un, and that that handwritten note by Secretary Pompeo insulted the president.  </p><p>      I find that to be completely implausible, based on my personal relationship and years of history with Mike Pompeo. If it is the case, then Mr. Bolton could presumably produce that note in Mike Pompeo's handwriting, since he is, as everyone knows, a very careful and methodical notetaker and collector of information.  </p><p>      And I think that one episode reflects on many of the claims. To cite the one you gave, I'm sure that President Trump repeatedly, in his conversations with Xi Jinping, emphasized that America's farmers have not been getting a fair shake from the Chinese Communist Party for years, and that, in fact, that was one of the main objectives of the president in trying to get better trade terms with China, is to get their markets opened up to our farmers.  </p><p>      That's a completely appropriate posture for the president to take.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAVUTO</emphasis>:  All right, we will see.  </p><p>      The passing note thing, you're not buying. I think, at one of the summit events, they were sitting next to each other, Bolton and Pompeo, but it -- you don't think that any nasty notes were exchanged. We will see, like you said.  </p><p>      Senator, Senator Cotton, very good having you, my friend.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605G-DTR1-JDPT-T210-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

De waarde van hun diensten neemt toe naarmate het aantal gebruikers groeit. Social media platforms zijn hiervan een goed voorbeeld. Bij elke nieuwe gebruiker neemt het aantal potenti\u00eble verbindingen en de mogelijkheden voor het delen van content toe. Als eenmaal een kritische massa is bereikt, wordt het moeilijk voor concurrenten om gebruikers weg te lokken bij de marktleiders. Dit natuurlijke monopolie maakt beleidsmakers achterdochtig.</p><p>Maar bekeken door de ogen van anti-kartelwaakhonden, die met een traditionele blik kijken naar prijsvorming en mogelijke benadeling van de consument, is het lastig om big tech-bedrijven te beschuldigen van machtsmisbruik.</p><p>De meeste online diensten worden gratis door hen aangeboden. De gebruikers van die gratis diensten\u00a0cre\u00ebren\u00a0waarde voor de ondernemingen. Zij maken de gebruikersdata\u00a0data te gelde door ze te verkopen aan adverteerders. Consumenten beweren in onderzoeken dat hun gegevens niet zomaar voor uiteenlopende diensten mogen worden verhandeld, maar de praktijk wijst anders uit.</p><p>Onbedachtzaam kruisen gebruikers toestemmingsboxen aan en staan zij liever cookies toe in plaats van hun\u00a0browse experience\u00a0te onderbreken. Gegevensinbreuken lijken weinig tot geen invloed te hebben op hun surfgedrag. De GDPR-regelgeving staat gebruikers in theorie toe om hun data niet af te geven, maar in hoeverre is dit mogelijk als zij vervolgens worden afgesneden van gratis diensten?</p><p>Davidson ziet ook geen tekenen dat adverteerders benadeeld worden door een monopoliepositie van de techgiganten. De prijzen om te adverteren op Google worden bepaald door middel van een veiling dus prijzen op dit gebied worden niet uitgehold. De prijzen om te adverteren op Facebook worden door Facebook zelf vastgesteld maar de huidige \"kosten per duizend vertoningen\" (CPM) bedraagt nog steeds slechts rond de 2 dollar, goedkoper dan bijna alle andere media.</p><p>Het business model van Amazon is anders, maar de consument lijkt er geen schade van te ondervinden. Integendeel, door de ontwrichtende impact van Amazon hebben producenten en bedrijfssectoren hun prijzen moeten verlagen en is innovatie erdoor gestimuleerd. Vanuit\u00a0 een traditioneel perspectief lijkt het er niet op dat consumenten benadeeld zijn door de dominantie van de techgiganten.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Creatieve destructie</p><p>Een andere beschuldiging luidt dat de techbedrijven juist innovatie hinderen door veelbelovende start-ups op te kopen en talent weg te kapen. Maar volgens Davidson zijn bedrijven als Google en Amazon zeer innovatief en zorgen zij voor de opkomst van nieuwe bedrijven en helpen zij gevestigde bedrijven door te groeien. Net zoals Amazon de retailsector in de 21e eeuw heeft binnengesleept, zo heeft Google telecombedrijven gestimuleerd de uitrol van breedband te versnellen en de auto-industrie om te investeren in de ontwikkeling van zelfbesturende auto's.</p><p>Wel vindt zij dat kartelwaakhonden kritischer hadden moeten zijn bij de overname van WhatsApp en Instagram door Facebook. Ontwrichtende concurrentie kan niet ontstaan als deze techgiganten mogelijke rivalen mogen opkopen.\u00a0</p><p>Gebruikersmanipulatie</p><p>Het gebruik van gebruikersdata maakt doelgerichte benadering van gebruikers op social media mogelijk op een manier die veel effectiever is dan voor mogelijk werd gehouden met conventionele media. Kwaadwillig gebruik van gebruikersdata kan tot manipulatie van gebruikers leiden, door te manipuleren wat gebruikers lezen en zien. Daartegenover staat dat social media juist ook een platform kan zijn voor vrije meningsuiting en de maatschappelijke betrokkenheid kan verhogen.</p><p>De vraag is in hoeverre social media platforms gezien moeten worden als platforms of als uitgevers, die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de inhoud op hun platform. Dat zou, gezien de enorme hoeveelheid aan data, een enorme uitdaging vormen. Nu al wordt het equivalent van 65 jaar video dagelijks op YouTube geplaatst. Facebook, en in mindere mate YouTube, vergroten nu al proactief hun kennis van hun content, verbeteren hun kunstmatige intelligentie en huren 'echte' mensen in om vals en extremistisch materiaal te identificeren en te verwijderen.</p><p>Voordeel van de twijfel</p><p>Het is niet zo eenvoudig om uit te rekenen hoeveel sociale waarde big tech-bedrijven hebben gecre\u00eberd of vernietigd. Vooralsnog is Davidson positief en ziet zij dat deze bedrijven meer bijdragen aan de maatschappij met hun gratis diensten en innovatie, dan dat zij hun monopoliepositie misbruiken.</p><p>Maar er liggen risico's op de loer die op de lange termijn de duurzaamheid van hun businessmodel bedreigen. Als belangrijkste risico's ziet Davidson regulering en een omslag bij consumenten.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FNDNWS-66499</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FNDNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RS6-8281-DYWB-S08D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">439796</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><timeReceived>10:37 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FD Mediagroep BV.

Fed chair Jerome Powell vowed to do whatever it took to get the American economy through the current downturn, employment being of particular concern.</p><p>US first-time jobless claims rose for the second time consecutively. They came in at 1.43 million, for the week ending July 25.</p><p>Investors fled to gold amid the economic uncertainties and out of fear that the huge stimulus packages across the globe might eventually trigger inflation. On July 27, the price beat its previous record of September 2011 in early Asian trading.</p><p>Brent essentially traded sideways for the week amid volatility. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was trading down on the week. The price of both fell sharply when US GDP numbers were released but recovered equally quickly.</p><p>Eurozone Q2 GDP fell by a record 12.1 percent: Germany's decline was 10.1 percent, propelling the country officially into recession. Italy, Spain, and France came in at 12.4, 18.5, and 13.8 percent, respectively, reflecting just how much the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their economies.</p><p>Meanwhile, China proved more resilient. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 51.1 percent for manufacturing and 54.2 percent for services. China seems to have recovered steadily from the pandemic after having been hit substantially in Q1.</p><p>Highlights of the earnings season:</p><p>The highlight of this week was big tech in the US, which blew expectations away.

Earnings also reflected the state of the economy in banks' home markets.</p><p>Deutsche Bank reported a net loss of $90.3 billion and loan loss provisions of $761 million. Credit Suisse made a profit of $1.27 billion and upped loan loss provisions by a lower-than-expected 296 million Swiss francs. Contrary to its previous strategy, the bank will form an investment banking unit.</p><p>BNP Paribas reported a net income of 2.3 billion euros ($2.72 billion) and added a further 329 million euros to its loan loss provisions. These banks beat expectations.</p><p>The UK and Spanish banks reported results which were in parts much below expectations: NatWest posted a \u00a3770 million ($1.011 billion) pre-tax loss and upped loan loss provisions by \u00a32.1 billion. Santander posted a record loss of 11.1 billion euros and booked impairments worth 12.6 billion euros for the quarter.</p><p>Focus Big Tech Earnings: Big Tech</p><p>Big tech reported blockbuster earnings throughout, beating expectations across the board. There is no comparison to the outstanding performance of the US big tech.</p><p>Amazon's revenue grew to $88.91 billion, net income stood at $5.2 billion and earnings per share (EPS) was $10.3, all beating analyst expectations. Grocery orders tripled compared to a year earlier and capacity increased by 160 percent, which involved higher costs. Advertising revenue grew 41 percent.</p><p>Apple reported its largest-ever Q2 revenue with $59.7 billion, net income at $11.25 billion, and EPS at $59.7, again all beating expectations. This result came in a quarter when Apple had to close many of its retail outlets. The company announced a stock split sending the shares to record highs.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported its first revenue decline in history but still beat expectations. Revenue stood at $38.29 billion, net income at $6.95 billion, and EPS came in at $10.13. Cloud revenue grew by 43 percent and advertising revenue fell by 8.4 percent.</p><p>Facebook reported a Q2 revenue growth of 11 percent coming in at $18.7 billion. Net income stood at $5.18 billion and EPS at $1.80. The stock rose more than 6 percent in extended trading. Monthly users reached 3.14 billion. Advertising revenues were hit by a boycott of major advertisers. The company expects impacts on ad revenues to level off during Q3. Revenue growth grew despite declining advertising income, which speaks to the strength of platforms such as Instagram. The stock soared more than 6 percent in extended trading, hitting a new high.</p><p>The regulatory risks remain for big tech, especially outside of the US. However, in times of economic crisis American lawmakers will be cautious to act against companies which are big employers and helped keep the economy going during lockdown.</p><p>Where we go from here:</p><p>US macroeconomic and employment numbers proved that while the worst may be over, America, and the world, are not out of the woods yet.</p><p>Most economists agree with the Fed's Powell that the trajectory of the economy is closely linked with that of the virus and how quickly a COVID-19 vaccine and / or anti-viral drugs are discovered.</p><p>In the meantime, general consensus points to the necessity of further fiscal stimulus. Several US fiscal programs expire at the end of this month. The discrepancy between the $3.5 billion Heroes Act, passed by the democratically controlled House of Representatives, and the $1 billion package proposed by the Republicans could not be larger \u2013 not just in terms of dollar value but structure too.</p><p>Democrats ask for the support of local government, while Republicans want to keep further financial outlays to a minimum. Finding consensus before recess is pivotal, considering how much the US economy suffered during Q2.</p><p>\u2014 Cornelia Meyer is a Ph.D.-level economist with 30 years of experience in investment banking and industry.

What persuaded her to click \u2018buy\u2019, Friend said, was the short-term credit offered by Afterpay, which split the $260 payment into four interest-free instalments.    Afterpay is among a handful of alternative credit firms which offer small loans, mostly to online shoppers, and make their money by charging merchants a 4%-6% commission.    These buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firms have benefited from a shift to online shopping during the coronavirus crisis in countries including the United States, where state aid has also boosted retail sales.    \u201cI\u2019m more inclined to use them because they make it easier to afford to get the things I want all at once \u2026 and when I want to splurge on something,\u201d Friend said of the loans.    Some investors are now betting shoppers will stay away from stores as coronavirus cases rise again in several countries around the world, boosting business for BNPL firms.    But swelling subscriber numbers may also increase bad loans, mainly among first-time users who are more likely to default.    And as job losses rise and government aid ebbs, the business model will face its first real test in a recession.    \u201cMuch still hinges on any virus second waves and government wherewithal to keep boosting demand,\u201d said Andrew Mitchell of Ophir Asset Management which owns shares in Melbourne-based Afterpay, whose market value has risen to $12.55 billion from over $100 million four years ago.    While a move to online shopping was underway before the pandemic, the shift has accelerated under lockdown and Afterpay signed up more than a million new active U.S. customers between March and early May, taking its overall base there to 9 million.    Meanwhile retailers desperate to move merchandise have also become more receptive to partnerships with BNPL firms, which unlike credit cards or mortgages, make loans instantly.    Klarna, Europe\u2019s biggest fintech start-up, said that since March enquiries from retailers who may want to partner with it jumped by 20% on average globally.    With 7.9 million U.S. subscribers, Sweden\u2019s Klarna has since signed up outdoor gearmaker The North Face, Disney\u2019s streaming service and cosmetics retailer Sephora.    Most of the growth has been in higher-margin discretionary spend categories such as fashion and fitness gear, said Puneet Dikshit, a McKinsey partner in New York, who expects the sector to generate $7 billion to $8 billion in volumes this year in the United States, growing by more than 150% annually.    (For an interactive version, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2BHL5qC)    Although fears of credit losses sparked a sector-wide sell-off in March, the entry of big tech investors and rising subscriber numbers have since supported a sharp recovery, with stocks now at record highs.    \u2018TURN OFF THE TAPS\u2019    The pandemic forced most companies to tighten their risk settings, which they say may push up loan rejection rates, although Afterpay, Klarna, Zip and Sezzle declined to provide specific numbers.    \u201cBNPL operators can turn off the taps and quickly throttle down growth if repayment risks increase,\u201d Mitchell said.    While Afterpay, with bad loans totalling 1% of its loan book as of March, changed its requirements so that customers had to pay a quarter of their loan upfront, co-founder Nick Molnar said rejection rates were roughly in line with the start of the year.    Molnar said an overwhelming majority of Afterpay customers, whose average transaction value is A$150, pay back on time, while loans on new purchases are denied to those who do not.    Although some brokerages expect Afterpay to turn a profit by 2022, rising costs to finance expansion and credit losses that eat into receivables are likely to mean BNPLs, which operate on thin margins, remain unprofitable for some time.    Klarna saw credit losses more than double in the first three months of the year to about 0.7% of underlying sales as it expanded in Europe and the United States, where regulation of the sector is almost non-existent.    Only California has said BNPL firms need a license, and fined some for lending without one.    In Australia, where the industry first took off on the back of easy funding, the corporate regulator is set to release a follow-up report this year to one it issued in 2018 raising concerns about users becoming overextended and calling for BNPLs to be regulated in line with other credit services.    Companies, investors and analysts agree that young people with stimulus money in their wallets are driving sales and BNPL shoppers that Reuters spoke to were all under 35 and bought household items, as well as skin care products and clothes.    \u201cThe vast majority of our customers have income levels of under $75,000, so I would say the majority probably have a stimulus check,\u201d said Charlie Youakim, CEO of Sezzle, one of the smaller firms.    The younger demographic is harder to assess because they lack credit history, meaning most companies use algorithms to run real-time eligibility checks and assess risk of default.    \u201cOur internal engine assesses risk taking various parameters into consideration which also will include consumer payment history, what is being purchased and is combined with varying third-party data sources and authentication solutions,\u201d Klarna spokeswoman Aoife Houlihan said.    Sydney-based Zip, with bad debts of just over 2% of receivables, said it assesses shoppers\u2019 public information and credit scores.    Around one in 100 customers is late with payments each month, spokesman Matthew Abbott said, adding that Zip recently tightened eligibility rules, leading to higher rejection rates.

The...</p><p>(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The heads of four of the U.S.\u2019s biggest technology companies \u2014 Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc.Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. \u2014 appeared before Congress earlier this week to respond to criticism that they have too much market power. The hearing showed that lawmakers are beginning to understand what is and isn\u2019t important when it comes to regulating these large businesses. And it also showed an increased focus on the most important area of antitrust policy \u2014 mergers and acquisitions and whether regulators have exercised enough vigilance.   In recent years, big tech has become ever more important to the U.S. economy and U.S. financial markets. The five biggest tech companies (the four that testified, plus Microsoft Corp.) now represent more than one-fifth of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500. Their value has only risen in the coronavirus pandemic:   When a few companies get this big and dominant, it makes sense to think about how they might be using their size to unfairly control markets.   One typical defense against such allegations is that tech companies are not monopolies. Whether this is true depends on how markets are defined -- for example, Google is overwhelmingly dominant among search engines, but has only about a third of digital ad revenues. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg argued that his company faces intense competition in many markets, especially from the other top tech companies.   But focusing on whether a company is a monopoly misses the point. Oligopolies, where a few big companies dominate the market, also tend to wield some degree of market power. In theory, that can allow powerful players to jack up consumer prices, underpay workers and squeeze suppliers.   In the case of Big Tech, consumer prices are generally not the issue. Services provided to consumers by Google and Facebook tend to be free, while Apple\u2019s fat margins stem mostly from consumer willingness to pay a lot for the brand value of an iPhone. Wages are a slightly bigger concern. Big tech companies have already been caught and fined for colluding to hold down engineers\u2019 salaries, and there has been much attention paid to Amazon\u2019s warehouse low pay and unpleasant working conditions. But Big Tech ultimately doesn\u2019t employ very many people, and its proven anticompetitive activities have largely involved highly paid workers. So while Big Tech wage suppression deserves to be monitored closely, it\u2019s probably not yet a major threat to U.S. labor markets.   A bigger worry concerns suppliers. Platform companies depend on a network of third-party companies -- merchants who sell on Amazon, websites that run Google ads, app developers who sell on Apple\u2019s App Store and so on. The platforms\u2019 size potentially allows them to extract a lot of value from these smaller companies, demanding a larger share of their revenue or even creating and then favoring their own competing offerings.   In the long run, as tech publisher Tim O\u2019Reilly has argued, big tech companies would probably ossify and ultimately lose out from cannibalizing their own third-party ecosystems, but there\u2019s always the danger that short-term profits will prove too tantalizing. Thus, it\u2019s a good thing that Congress focused some of its attention on the need to maintain fair relationships between platforms and suppliers. Ultimately, this issue will probably have to be resolved with regulation because breaking up platform companies would eventually cause new platforms to emerge and become dominant.   Another concern is the prices that online service companies charge advertisers. By some estimates, more than half of digital ad spending now goes to either Google or Facebook, with the fastest-rising competitor being Amazon. Advertisers are the true paying customers for free online services for consumers.   This is a reason that legislators are worried about platforms buying out the competition. Facebook CEO Zuckerberg admitted in the hearing that he purchased social-networking company Instagram in 2012 as a way to head off a potential competitor. There have been allegations that the company has attempted or threatened to do the same with other young social networks, telling them that if they didn\u2019t accept an offer, Facebook would launch a competing product and drive them out of existence.   Ultimately, that could raise prices for advertisers, if Facebook properties are the only way for them to reach social-media users. Those sorts of buyouts and buyout threats could also have a chilling effect on startup formation and economic dynamism because even the threat of competition from a dominant company can deter new entrants. Columbia Law School professor Timothy Wu has argued that such buyouts are illegal under current antitrust law.   So if there\u2019s any case for antitrust action against Big Tech right now, it probably has to do with the acquisition of upstart competitors. Unlike most of the issues surrounding Big Tech, which are complicated and confusing because of the way online network effects change the economics of size, concern over anticompetitive mergers that jack up prices is very old and very common.   In any case, it\u2019s a very good thing that Congress is beginning to pay more attention to the problems of industrial concentration and oligopoly in the U.S. economy. Big Tech is obviously the most well-known and popular case, but with concentration rising across most industries, these hearings will hopefully be a jumping-off point for a broader re-examination of the value of mega-mergers and huge, dominant companies.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 17th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are focused on earnings this morning. Lots of big names reporting their second quarter with banks in the spotlight this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bank of America this morning out with a beat on adjusted revenue and a beat on earnings per share. Nonetheless, the stock is down two-thirds of a percent. Profits rising on loan growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bank of New York Mellon beat also on the bottom line and it is also raising its quarterly dividend by 11 percent.</p><p>And then there's PNC also with a beat on earnings but missed slightly on revenue.</p><p>The banks are coming in pretty much as expected as we saw last week as well.</p><p>Futures this morning indicating a gain at the start of trading meanwhile . Dow futures are up 14 points. S&amp;P futures up 2. And the Nasdaq up 11 points right now.</p><p>Yesterday, the record run took a bit of a pause on Wall Street. Take a look. Markets were lower fractionally across the board. DowIndustrials were down 23 points, the S&amp;P was down 10 and the Nasdaq lower by 35 at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.</p><p>European indices this morning are mixed. Take a look. FT 100 is down 10 points. The CAC 40 is down a fraction. But the Dax index in Germany is up three quarters of 1 point.</p><p>In Asia overnight -- trade fears drove markets lower there as well. As you can see it's fractional but nonetheless it's negative.</p><p>China trade turmoil continues. President Donald Trump saying that there is still a long way to go for a deal between the U.S. And China. We've got the fallout this morning.</p><p>And then crisis at the border, President Trump's new asylum restrictions also facing legal challenges. The ongoing battle coming up.</p><p>Big tech is under fire. Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency came under attack on the Hill yesterday. Investors are showing concern pushing bitcoin lower.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning. And joining me to break it all down: CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell is here. Former Home Depot CEO, former Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli. Along with former Ohio state senate minority leader and American University School of Public Affairs executive in residence, Capri Cafaro.</p><p>Great to see you this morning.</p><p>CAPRI CAFARO, EXECUTIVE IN RESIDENCE, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AFAIRS: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's been a good hour so far. We had a lot of breaking news there.</p><p>And interesting to see the different expectations for the economy. Nancy Lazar (ph), Anton Schutz (ph) seem a little more constructive on what we're seeing versus some of the conversation out there, indicating a 90 percent expectation for the Fed to cut rates in two weeks.</p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER HOME DEPOT CEO: Yes. Yes. If we're not careful we're going to talk ourselves into dampening, you know, the enthusiasm and the growth that we've had in the economy. And you know, our discussion about Capex shifting from tradition brick and mortar to more technology, you know, more AI.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That doesn't get talked about enough.</p><p>NARDELLI: No, it should. And it should.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGISTT, CFRA: Technology cap ex is by far the largest component of the Capex component in GDP, of course . But I think there is reason for some concern out there because there's a lot of uncertainties, whether it be the China trade deal, whether it be geopolitical in nature, Brexit. There are some things that you do have to consider.</p><p>But the fact is, there seems to be good, solid strength here in the U.S., and the consumer remains very strong.</p><p>CAFARO: Right. Well, consumer confidence obviously seems very, very strong. But an area that does continue to concern me, certainly and just from being where I'm from, is the manufacturing sector. And that's where tariffs and trade issues really are going to play a part in that supply chain. I certainly don't need to tell you that.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p>BELL: And on that point we get the Beige Book today from the Fed in the afternoon.</p><p>CAFARO: Right.</p><p>BELL: And there will be a lot of anecdotal evidence about how tariff and trade are an --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>CAFARO: -- are having an impact on that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We're really watching these purchasing managers' indexes which will be out interestingly the same day as the Fed meeting at the end of July. So we'll see what the manufacturing indices tell us.</p><p>But you're right, that's where the weak spots have been -- Ohio and manufacturing. We're talking about all that this morning.</p><p>And our top story this hour is \"Held in Contempt\". The House of Representatives preparing for a vote today on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt for not complying with congressional subpoenas related to their efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.</p><p>Joining me right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mr. Secretary -- it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Thank you for having me -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what is your expectation on this contempt issue?</p><p>ROSS: Oh, this is just more political theater. It doesn't really have any substantive basis. We produced to the committee over 14,000 pages of documents.</p><p>What's at issue here is about a dozen documents, roughly 15 pages, all of which the courts didn't find necessary to make their conclusion.</p><p>So this is silly. I testified myself for almost seven hours before this very committee. Three of my former senior staff people including one who is now assistant attorney general in the state of Florida, testified as well.</p><p>We answered thousands of questions. We are not stonewalling. But we are also not yielding on the very, very important matter of executive privilege. These are privileged documents. They're going to remain privilege documents. And we're not going to be frightened into changing that position just because of some action the House might take.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So how will the President deal with this then in terms of understanding fully the number of Americans in this country versus illegals? I mean is that the whole point of putting that question on the census?</p><p>ROSS: Well, the question of illegals was never going to be asked. The census was intending to ask the question are you a citizen or are you not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ROSS: It never asked about legal status. Nor can the census data be used for ICE purposes or criminal investigation of any sort. Under Title 13, those data are protected. Individual data cannot be released. There's a serious jail sentence and a serious fine for anybody who is convicted of doing so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And the left knows that -- right Wilbur? But they don't want this question on the census regardless. Why do you think that is?</p><p>ROSS: Well, I think it's just gamesmanship on their part. They know we're going to come much closer to the answer than we ever have before.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>ROSS: Because with the President's executive order, we're having much better access to federal documents than we ever had before. And believe it or not, many states are also going to be cooperating with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok.</p><p>ROSS: So we will get the kind of data that's needed and in some ways it will be even better because I believe that a lot of census money should be dedicated to administrative records, rather than just people ringing doorbells and we hope that the progress we make this time will move us toward that for the 2020 census.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. Well, we're going to be watching that obviously.</p><p>Meanwhile, look what's going on in the Congress right now -- Secretary. I mean first of all, big tech is in the hot seat, lawmakers taking aim at Silicon Valley giants yesterday. The issues here -- data and privacy concerns.</p><p>Listen to this. I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>ROSS: Well, I was at the --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO: Facebook dangerous. Now Facebook might not intend to be dangerous, but surely they don't respect the power of the technologies they're playing with. Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the House over and over and called every arson a learning experience.</p><p>SENATOR MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE: On Monday, you claimed in an op ed that Google is not politically biased, yet you acknowledge that Google took down or limited the reach of conservative content accounts and only did so mistakenly.</p><p>SENATOR JAMES RASKIN (D), MARYLAND: According to data produced by Rand Fishkin, Google controls over 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States. So congratulations on that. Although this seems to fit the classical definition of monopoly --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about that? You know, it's interesting to look on both sides of the aisle, Secretary, and both sides of the aisle want to really put in the screws on these tech companies. What's your take?</p><p>ROSS: Well, I was at the social media conference last week at the White House and quite a number of the participants in that conference came up with very specific instances of censorship.</p><p>These are not theoretical issues. These are people saying this is exactly what happened to me on this date at this time. So there is censorship. I don't think there's any question based on the evidence that those folks put forward.</p><p>And so I think the real question is how should government, how should the congress, how should the administration deal with it. Because anybody who thinks there wasn't censorship is wrong. There was a public survey taken - - 13,000 something responses came in, mostly all giving instances of this kind of censorship.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So what is this administration going to do about it? I mean I spoke with President Trump just about, I don't know, two weeks ago or so when he called into the program and I said to him, look, do you want to see regulation here? Do you want to see -- how are you going to get these guys to stop doing what they're doing if in fact this is the reality? Because if you've seen the censorship of conservatives now, wait until we get knee-deep into 2020.</p><p>Here's what the President said to me two weeks ago. Watch this -- Secretary.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. President -- you mentioned technology companies, how concerned are you that technology companies are censoring conservatives and they're going to do this right up to the 2020 election.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, they're doing it to me on Twitter. I mean what they did to me on Twitter is incredible. You know, I have millions and millions of followers but I will tell you, they make it very hard for people to join me in Twitter and they make it very much harder for me to get out the message.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he went on to say, when I said to him do you want to see new regulation, said -- I said do you prefer just seeing competition in the marketplace. He said you might need legislation in order to get the competition.</p><p>ROSS: Well, that could be. This is a whole new area for us to explore. But I think the underlying question is it's not appropriate for this kind of censorship. They've been given a get out of jail free card by the Congress, saying that if you're not the creating media, you don't have certain responsibilities.</p><p>Well, to me, censorship is creating media, it's creating content, and if they're going to start doing that, they better think about the consequences.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Let me switch gears, ask you about trade. Futures are higher this morning or mixed after the markets took a hit yesterday on President Trump's comments that a deal with China may still be out of reach.</p><p>Here's what the President said. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have a long way to go as far as tariffs with China is concerned if we want. We have another $325 billion that we can put a tariff on if we want. So we're talking to China about a deal. But I wish they didn't break the deal that we had.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So is it fair to say it's probably a long time before we actually see deals here? What do you think, Secretary? Where are we?</p><p>ROSS: Well, as you know, I've said repeatedly this is not a 10-minute process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ROSS: This is a long, involved process. The fundamental question now, though, is will they go back to the point where we were before they changed their mind and backtracked on some of the understandings that had been reached. That's the important issue right now.</p><p>And that's what's being probed in telephone conversations and the outcome of those phone conversations is what will help determine whether there is the next meeting and if so, when.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you have any optimism or encouragement that they are planning to stop the theft of IP? Isn't that one of the big ticket items? Real quick.</p><p>ROSS: Well, the big ticket items are the structural reforms. The theft of IP, the unlevel playing field in procurement, the subsidies -- all those. But there's another in some ways even bigger issue. And that is, what is the U.S. enforcement capability in the event that they violate the agreement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Sure. Yes. You were talking about that before.</p><p>ROSS: That's the real key. That's the real key.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And real quick, before you go, Secretary -- on USMCA I was speaking to a high profile senator over the last week and he said I'm not expecting Nancy Pelosi to bring it to the floor at all.</p><p>ROSS: Well, it would be a real dereliction of duty if she did not. This is the biggest and the best trade deal this country has ever made. And it's quite ridiculous that many Democrats in the Congress voted for NAFTA. NAFTA was not only a disaster, but paragraph by paragraph USMCA is demonstrably better on all scores, particularly for U.S. manufacturing, but also for the digital economy, for intellectual property, for environmental and for labor constraints.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know, but she doesn't want him to have another victory. We'll just have to wait and see.</p><p>Real quick before you go, Secretary -- there's a report that the President was considering removing you from your post following the Supreme Court defeat on adding the citizenship question to the census, according to NBC News. NBC is reporting this. What can you tell us?</p><p>ROSS: Well, I was on a trip with the President last Friday. We were in Milwaukee. We were in Cleveland. Was at the cabinet meeting of course yesterday and here I am on TV today. I think you ought to go by facts, not by rumors on some other network.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You got it. Mr. Secretary -- it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>ROSS: Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've covered a lot there. Wilbur Ross -- always a pleasure. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Coming up arrests at ICE headquarters, protesters blocking entrances and exits in a push to get rid of the agency over immigration and migrant detention. The fallout coming up.</p><p>Then celebrating the Apollo 11, Washington marks the golden anniversary with a high profile monument getting in on the act. All the beautiful pictures coming up. Back in a moment.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA. I'm Cheryl Casone with some headlines we're watching for you this morning.</p><p>It is official, European regulators are investigating Amazon. They're going to look at whether Amazon's use of other merchants' data breached E.U. rules. This investigation is going to focus on Amazon's standard agreements with marketplace sellers and whether the company uses their data unfairly.</p><p>Amazon says it will cooperate. There was a little of a hit in the stock this morning though. It is slightly lower in the premarket right now.</p><p>Taking a look at shares of Qualcomm, they are actually moving higher in the premarket, more than 5.5 percent right now. The Justice Department has asked a federal appeals court to pause the enforcement of an anti-trust ruling. The Justice department says it would be impossible to replace Qualcomm's role in 5G technology in the short term. Back in May a judge ruled that Qualcomm engaged in anti-competitive patent licensing practices and it ordered the company to license its technology to rival chip makers. We shall see where that court case goes though now.</p><p>And in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon, the Washington Monument is looking more like a rocket for the next two nights. Lok at this, it's pretty cool. The Smithsonian Institute is projecting a life size 363-foot image of a Saturn 5 rocket. That's accompanied by a 70-minute video presentation. If you're in the area, check it out.</p><p>All right. We've got a lot more coming up this morning.</p><p>Lawmakers grilling Facebook. The tech giant answering questions over its proposed digital currency. Their response coming up next.</p><p>Plus, free beer for life. Now I've got your attention, I'm assuming. Busch is offering customers the ultimate prize but they're going to have to work for it. Details coming up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID MARCUS, LIBRA CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK: We will take the time to get this right. We expect the review of Libra to be among the most extensive ever. We are fully committed to working with regulators here and around the world.</p><p>And let me be clear and unambiguous. Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulators concerned and received appropriate approvals.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was David Marcus, head of Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra. The social network under fire on Capitol Hill this week. Lawmakers pushing for regulation over Libra over worries of instability and national security.</p><p>Joining us right now EY senior vice chairman Michael Inserra. And Michael -- it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MICHAEL INSERRA, SENIOR VICE CHAIRMAN, EY: Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to what you say on Capitol Hill and the longer term outlook for whether it's block chain or coins? how do you see this developing?</p><p>INSERRA: Look, I think you have to look at this in the context of as you just said the bigger picture. Things like block chain are here to stay and they're actually moving at a much more accelerated pace. You know, 20 years ago when ERP systems came into play, people were unclear how that was going to revolutionize.</p><p>This is a whole different element. It is a secure payment system. It actually has no central authority. And we're actually big believers in things like public block chain.</p><p>And much of what you saw in the testimony is a consortium of 28 companies. It's not just a single company that I think really is recognizing things need to change. But we do need the right regulatory and oversight. I think you heard it resoundingly. You know, you don't want unintended consequences. But this isn't going away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So don't be confused by the upset over Facebook and Libra because the block chain technology is much different and that's sort of the backdrop and here to stay.</p><p>INSERRA: Yes, exactly. Go ahead.</p><p>CAFARO: I was just going to say but the issue with Facebook is not going away and you know, we just heard the gentleman, you know, basically say to Congress, look, we're not going to move forward unless we address the regulators' concerns.</p><p>And I just recently saw an article, I believe it was in the \"Washington Post\" talking about the fact that Facebook actually preemptively went and presented this information to the Treasury as well as the SEC. And they were apparently the -- the SEC was stunned that Facebook was unable to answer some basic questions about concerns surrounding money laundering and consumer protection.</p><p>And so how are they really going to address some of these concerns? I mean are they really prepared. Or, you know, are we really seeing something like Libra being, you know, pushed further out because it's going to take so much longer to address the concerns of the regulators?</p><p>INSERRA: So LOOK, let me take block chain just for a moment to a different place and what is block chain.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. We're talking about two different things.</p><p>INSERRA: Two different things here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Sure.</p><p>INSERRA: Let me talk about why I think block chain is here to stay. And it's been around for 10 years. But some of the things it does -- it is really an end to end, very secure payment type system. Ok. It's almost a distributed ledger so that any person on the block chain --</p><p>CAFARO: And the coins are the currency.</p><p>INSERRA: And the coins. Now, I also want to make a distinguishment between bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and the currencies that are talked about here which are actually backed by financial reserves. Ok.</p><p>So again, sometimes it's the headline that kind of disrupts the actual reality of it. But let me just talk about some things that we're doing in block chain that I think are fascinating.</p><p>It's tokenizing or tracking better things around the world. It could be viruses and knowing where patient zero exists today. It could be containers, billions of containers move around the world in cargo, marine block chain. Being able to actually hone in on where a source of food emanated from and a problem with that food is done in manual, very archaic ways.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it has nothing to do with Libra or Facebook.</p><p>INSERRA: And that's why I wanted, Maria -- to stay focused on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm glad you did that. That was really articulate the way that you explained and made it so accessible.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes. It's very -- as we talk here -- like very educational to a lot of us out there. We hadn't heard about block chain for a while. It kind of has gone into the background. But I know, Michael -- you and EY are very dominant in that with your innovation centers, with you know, advanced manufacturing, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>You want to talk a little about what you're -- you returned from a global trip. So you've had the benefit of globality, if you can bring it to our audience today.</p><p>INSERRA: Well, you know, we talked a lot about why is unemployment at 3.6 yet we feel like there's these mixed wins. I think innovation, again, continues to create this efficacy of the marketplace that's allowing us to continue to propel the environment.</p><p>I think one of the big things we're focused on is how do large institutions maintain a day one mentality and entrepreneurial. More and more, it's start-ups are great, they're a critical part of the U.S. capitalist system but big institutions are adapting and becoming more agile. And they're doing it through the adventures that we've been helping them more and others are helping them work with which is really setting up innovation activities.</p><p>But that those that actually can permeate their broader organizational alignment. So really, you know, kind of segmenting the business and finding ways to accelerate innovation through it. I think that may be one of the unsung catalysts of this extended economic run.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Michael -- great analysis. Thanks so much.</p><p>INSERRA: Great. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Michael Inserra from EY joining us.</p><p>President Trump just tweeted about the Democrats. Here's what he said. The Democrats in Congress are getting nothing done, not on drug pricing, not on immigration, not on infrastructure. Not on nothing. So much opportunity yet all they want to do is go fishing. The American people are tired of never-ending witch hunts. They want results now,\" writes the President.</p><p>All right. We take a break.</p><p>When we come back, the new Trump administration asylum rules aimed at stopping migrants before they even reach the border with Mexico. All that coming up.</p><p>Customs and Border Patrol acting director Mark Morgan will weigh in next in an exclusive.</p><p>Then Elon Musk's next big idea, new details about his brain to machine interface. Wait until you see this -- next up.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 17th. Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures are indicating the markets will open higher this morning even it's just fractionally. Dow Futures are up just two points. The S&amp;P struggling to hold in to positive territory and the NASDAQ up 6-1/2. It looks like we are seeing some selling right now because the markets are well off of the highs of the morning.</p><p>This on top of a pause yesterday of course. We had a record run. But yesterday markets took a breather, down 23 points on the Dow yesterday, S&amp;P was down 10, and the NASDAQ was lower by 35.</p><p>In Europe this morning, major indices are mixed to lower. FT-100 down 19, CAC Quarante down nine, and the DAX Index in Germany lower by 23.</p><p>In Asia overnight, fears drove markets lower but here too fractional moves on a summer Tuesday.</p><p>Focus on earnings this morning, lots of big names reporting earnings for the second quarter. The banks are in the spotlight once again. Bank of America with a beat on adjusted revenue and earnings. The stock is down a fraction, but profits were rising on loan growth in the quarter.</p><p>Linking the brain directly to applications. Find out more about Elon Musk's latest venture.</p><p>And then, the quest for free beer but you will have to work for it. The details coming up on that.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning. But first, our top story this half an hour, battle at the border, the Trump administration lays out new asylum rules this week making migrants who pass through other countries on their way to the United States ineligible for asylum. They have to do asylum in those countries. The new regulations facing lawsuits from civil rights and immigrations groups. The president weighed in yesterday. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We were sending hundreds of millions of dollars to Guatemala and Honduras. We're not going to send it anymore. We were giving them hundreds of millions of dollars like fools for years. And all they did is send us up a lot of people, caused a lot of problems and a lot of the people in those caravans were criminals, hardened criminals, dangerous people. And why not? Why would Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador, why would they keep their criminals when you can put them in to the caravan, lose them in a caravan, and send them up to the United States. We take everybody. Because the Democrats don't allow immigration laws that mean anything. It's horrible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is U.S. Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner, Mark Morgan. And Mark, it is great to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MARK MORGAN, ACTING COMMISSIONER, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you agree with that? What the president just said? What is it about the Democrats that they are not agreeing with some of these issues that the president has spotlighted over the last couple of years, in terms of the crisis at the border?</p><p>MORGAN: You know, Maria, that's the $60,000 question that I've been asking for a long time and so have a lot of experts. And look, I look at this as a Congress issue. Congress needs to act on a bipartisan way to pass meaningful legislation to address the very real loopholes in our asylum that is causing this crisis. So I agree that Congress needs to act and if they do, they can fix this crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, but the issue is they do not -- I mean, certainly the majority in the House does not want the president to have a victory. They just started calling it a crisis recently, they -- many are still not. They said it was a manufactured crisis by the president.</p><p>And then even when you go down to the border which I did and I actually witnessed it firsthand in El Paso, how horrible the situation is and the dangerous situation that children are being put in, you're still not getting the kind of -- you know, enthusiasm to actually make a change. When you say all you really need to do is change the asylum standards and the Flores Agreement.</p><p>MORGAN: Yes Maria, and you have been there. You saw it firsthand. Another example of that. I know that you witnessed the children being exploited.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I did.</p><p>MORGAN: And how emotional that was for you and it should be for all Americans. And in case in point, we were asking Congress for months to pass a supplemental because children, because families were being held in facilities that they shouldn't be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they're not doing it. So what's your plan B, Mark? How are you going to get your arms around this and this administration going to, you know, discourage these migrants from coming through Mexico to the border and flooding our borders and when you -- and it doesn't look like you're going to actually get a change from Congress.</p><p>MORGAN: That's right. And Maria, I think that's very important. So, we need to continue to work with Congress when we can. But we can't wait for them to do their job because they've shown they're not willing to do it.</p><p>And so, we are doing a lot. We're working with the government of Mexico and we're -- the migrant protection protocol for example that we're sending individuals back to wait in Mexico while they go through the asylum process. Today almost 20,000 individuals have now gone back to Mexico instead of clogging up our system.</p><p>And right now at the top of your show, you talked about the new regulation for asylum. That's an -- the American people need to understand, that's not new, that's an international standard. The European Union countries do this. Is that -- it's an accepted standard is that the first country that you come to, that's where you should be required to apply for asylum and that's what this new regulation is about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, let me ask about these ICE protests, Mark. Because federal authorities arrested 11 activists yesterday for blocking entrances and exits to ICE headquarters in Washington. I mean, this is really becoming such a scene. There was an armed man was killed after police -- after police -- after attacking an ICE detention center in Washington over the weekend, writing a manifesto to Antifa before carrying out the ambush.</p><p>Progressive Congresswomen and members of the squad, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez not speaking out to condemn Antifa at all. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you condemn Antifa? Will you condemn Antifa for the attack in Washington?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So there you go. They're making all this noise in the spotlight, being talked about across the news media, and yet it's -- I mean, what is this? Is this smoke and mirrors? They're asked a specific question, will you condemn Antifa. And they refuse to do it.</p><p>MORGAN: So, it's very frustrating. In that manifesto he actually mentions someone from Congress, specific language and rhetoric they have used. Now, don't get me wrong. I don't -- those are actions individuals. I'm not putting that on anybody on Congress.</p><p>But I think what's important is, the Congress should recognize stop the rhetoric, stop attacking the men and women of ICE and CBP for doing their statutory responsible mission. That they're enforcing the laws that Congress have enacted.</p><p>So, if Congress doesn't like the current laws, they need to change it. And what I would say to people that want to protest ICE or CBP, I would say your protests are being directed towards the wrong people. If you don't like the laws, then go petition Congress to change the laws and we will enforce those laws. It's very frustrating to see.</p><p>And as you said, Maria, it's -- that violence and that rhetoric, it's not helping, it's not solving the crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you also have companies like, you know, Wayfair, saying, we're not going to -- we're not going to send any more beds to the detention centers. We don't like what's going on. Well, who are you hurting? I mean, no wonder there's 900 people behind bars when they're supposed to be 385 and they're so busting out of the accommodations because there's so many people. I mean, who are you hurting not to send beds? It's just crazy.</p><p>How about this new immigration proposal, Mark. The White House adviser, Jared Kushner, also weighing in here. Presenting an updated plan to the Trump Cabinet, Congressional aides could see it this week. What are you expecting?</p><p>MORGAN: So, I'm expecting the same thing that I've been expecting Congress to do that hasn't happened, is that -- is that we actually put forth some meaningful legislation that's actually going to address the issues.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham is trying to put forth a bill too that will address the specific issues that could absolutely, positively impact this crisis. We can't sit on our hands anymore. We can't allow this crisis to continue to go. Something has to be done. So I support any legislation that's going forward that actually is meaningful legislation that will address this crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know that part of the issue is that the CBP officers are being forced to do other things and not even stay at their post because of all of these kids showing up who are sick, they're taking babies to hospitals and checking on children and cleaning babies and all this stuff when in fact they should be at their post, securing the borders.</p><p>MORGAN: That's exactly right, Maria. Now, we have two elements. We have Border Patrol agents and then officers from the office of field operation. All those resources are being pulled away from the port of entry and from the line to really do the humanitarian mission.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MORGAN: We have individuals that are feeding babies, they're changing diapers, that are ordering baby formula, water and it goes on and on. Up to -- up to 50 percent of our resources are pulled off the line to do the humanitarian mission.</p><p>So, Maria, make no mistake, our country is less safe because of this crisis going on because that enables the cartels to take advantage of those loopholes and that the wide open border, bad things, bad people are getting through every day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Mark, we will keep watching the story and it is an important one. Thank you so much.</p><p>MORGAN: You bet, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark Morgan, joining u there.</p><p>Coming up, artificial intelligence in your brain? The new technology Elon Musk says is the future of human interaction.</p><p>TheN, the hunt for beer, Busch makes an official loyal customers cannot refuse. But they'll have to work to win the ultimate prize, details after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. El Chapo will learn his fate today. Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, Maria, Mexican drug lord Joaquin Guzman is going to appear in Brooklyn federal court today where a judge is expected to sentence the convicted drug lord to life behind bars. The hearing could be his last chance to speak publicly. He was convicted in February in an epic drug trafficking case. Guzman accused of smuggling mountains of cocaine into the United States over a 25-year period. He claims he was framed by traffickers working for the government. Well, Elon Musk's updated Neuralink has been unveiled. The project focused on developing brain, machine interfaces. The new version includes flexible threads that are less likely to damage the brain than the materials currently used. Neuralink has been developing brain machine interfaces to connect humans and computers. Musk says that the system has been tested on a monkey that was able to control a computer with its brain.</p><p>And how about some free beer for life? Well, it can happen, but you're going to need some hiking boots. Busch not making this easy. They're hiding a pop-up bar in a national forest for just one day this Saturday. Clues are revealed out on Twitter. You get free merchandise. But the winner gets a lifetime supply of beer.</p><p>Here's the thing, Busch is going to plant a hundred trees in our national forest for each person who finds the pop-up shop. We should add that there's a hundred and -- what, 50 national forests across the country. But anyway, good luck to all of you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, Beyond Meat moves, the maker of the world's first plant based burger expanding its reach with some key connections. We've got the details after we -- after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Let's take a look at Futures, higher this morning but really back and forth, not a lot of commitment. Dow Futures up five points, S&amp;P up a fraction, and the NASDAQ Futures up six on top of a lower day yesterday, really the markets took a breather on the record run.</p><p>And joining us right now to talk more about markets and the economy, is the chairman and CEO of Strategas, Jason Trennert. (INAUDIBLE) Jason, it's great to see you.</p><p>JASON TRENNERT, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, STRATEGAS: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. So what's your take on the broader backdrop of the economy? We have the ECB doing a meeting on July 25th. And then the two day meeting, the Fed, the 31st where there is obviously 90 percent chance the Fed lowers interest rates.</p><p>TRENNERT: Right, I think, well, the first thing I would say is the Fed has to -- in my opinion, the Fed has to ease now, given where market expectations are. It would be too big a shock to the system if they didn't. I think it also highlights the idea that Bob and I were talking before, it's not a closed system. The Fed really can't go it alone. It can't be an island. If you have $13 trillion worth of negative yield, the sovereign debt globally, there's a -- there's a limit to how much the Fed can tighten. And it's found that out the hard way twice in the last three years. So the Fed in some ways just has to get a little bit back more towards a more of an international standard.</p><p>My opinion, it's too bad because using monetary policy alone as the single tool creates a lot of distortions in the economy and not particularly a great way to run the economy, but it's very good for financial assets. It's not as good for the economy as a result.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you -- have you ever seen anything like this whereas you know, the economy is doing really well, 51-year low in unemployment. And yet the Fed has to cut rates because every other central bank in the world is cutting rates and the currency situation puts the U.S. at a disadvantage.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Well, I think some people point to 1995 and 1998 where the Fed's trying to get ahead of a potential slowdown. But when you do think about this, if they are able to revive growth here, give us a little bit of a boost, and then also potentially ease the situation abroad, where do you put your money? What looks most attractive? Because the U.S. has run its -- the S&amp;P 500 trading at a premium multiple. You look at Europe, there's a lot wrong over there. And then Asia easing should probably actually help the emerging markets.</p><p>TRENNERT: I tend to agree with the emerging markets call. And I actually -- I have more of a bias towards cyclical as we go into 2020 for a variety of reasons. But one of the things, and the president may kind of stick the landing here in terms of I don't know if this is part of the plan or whether -- you know, whether it's luck or but it looks like you're going to get a Fed easing and a resolution of the trade tensions in the second half of this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think so?</p><p>TRENNERT: I think so. And I mainly because I think it's politically expedient to have some sort of resolution of the trade tensions.</p><p>And so, you set yourself up for a pretty strong economy going into the election next year. We wrote a piece, you know, a couple months ago saying it wasn't real -- a really a strong incentive for the president to resolve trade tensions earlier this year. Because there I think there were concerns, I don't know this for a fact within the White House, the economy was peaking too early from a political point of view.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The date and work -- the date and work.</p><p>TRENNERT: Yes, I know I could. I mean, if you -- if you have the economy you have now in October of next year, regardless of what you think of the president, it's -- he'd be tough to beat.</p><p>CAPRI CAFARO, EXECUTIVE RESIDENT, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS: Well, there's some things the president has under his control and others he doesn't in regard to trade. So say for example the China trade war is quote, unquote, resolved, yet Congress doesn't act on USMCA, what happens under a scenario like that?</p><p>TRENNERT: Well, that's a --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good question.</p><p>TRENNERT: No, it's a very good question. It certainly doesn't help. I would also say the president though generally speaking has -- I think the people tend to underestimate some of the executive powers --</p><p>CAFARO: Sure.</p><p>TRENNERT: -- that the president does have to make other deals, non -- you know, remove non-trade barriers, do other things.</p><p>There are other things that are being talked about like indexing capital gains to inflation. I don't know if you've heard that. But that's another thing that the administration has been talking about to lift equity prices.</p><p>So, it's true, the president doesn't have complete control but he probably has a little bit more control than people might give him credit for. And - -</p><p>CAFARO: Are we going to play a lot of games with chain CPI in general?</p><p>TRENNERT: Yes.</p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, CHRYSLER AND HOME DEPOT: Well, he's talking to North Korea, now he's open to talk to Iran. I mean, there are number of things to your point that I think he's got a number of levers in that cockpit of his that he'll be able to make sure that things are moving in the right direction in November. But as we were talking earlier, even if the rate comes down a quarter point, it's still the most attractive rate globally with this $13 trillion.</p><p>TRENNERT: That's right.</p><p>NARDELLI: So, we're still going to see a lot of foreign currency come in. We talked earlier about the long, short portfolio, shorts are gone, right? So, back to the question, where do we put our money?</p><p>TRENNERT: Yes, no, listen, I like -- personally, I like cyclicals in the United States. So, we're overweight financials, industrials, technology stocks, we also have REITs in there, but that's more to get some income.</p><p>But I think the most unloved part of the market is really the most cyclical part of the market. One of the problems when you have very low interest rates is that things with yield and things without yield become very expensive. So, collectible art becomes very expensive and utilities trade at 22 times earnings. You know, that are growing at two or three percent a year. And that's not particularly -- in my opinion, that's not particularly attractive.</p><p>The places that are more attractive now would be, again, places like financials but places that people really don't like, industrials would be another one because of some of the trade tensions.</p><p>So, within the U.S., I like that, I like emerging markets. Europe we were talking before. I don't -- you know, the idea that the ECB might be forced to buy equities, to me is a -- it might work. I mean, certainly stocks would go up. But to me, that's not the most compelling, it's not a great reason to buy European equities aside from a trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes I brought it up because Rick Rieder from BlackRock was here last week and said, look, the ECB is going to be buying European equities, I want to buy European equities. So, we'll see about that, but you're right, Europe's not generating any growth.</p><p>Real quick, Cap expending, has it come back? What do you -- what do you think about cap expending?</p><p>TRENNERT: The problem with CapEx, there's certainly enough cash flow to go around, but the problem is that I do think -- and to be fair, the administration has created a problem in which all the pieces were there but then if you follow up the big tax cut that's very, very stimulating for CapEx with the trade war, it's very difficult for -- you know, it's very difficult to have that confidence. We have someone here that would know, that, you know, it's easier just to issue bonds and buy back stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, a lot of uncertainty. Jason, great to see you.</p><p>TRENNERT: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Jason Trennert. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019071702cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKK-XM41-DXH2-609H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7392\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0002E5S</classCode><className>BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009UED</classCode><className>FCA US LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC6712 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And that's it for us tonight. We thank you for being with us. Judicial Watch--</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning. Happy Thursday, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is jobs day, Thursday, July 2nd. Your top stories right now, 6:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jobs in America this morning. The June jobs report is out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Economists are expecting a gain in jobs of 3 million jobs. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 12.3 percent. We have full coverage this morning of jobs report for the month of June.</p><p>Coronavirus cases, meanwhile, spiking at a record rate. More than 50,000 new cases reported in the U.S. yesterday alone. This as more states and businesses, including McDonald's and Apple, roll back those reopening. There is some promising news on the development of a vaccine this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, markets are pointing to a higher opening this morning. Take a look at Futures. They are looking higher as investors keep a close eye on jobs, the virus, and the possibility of more stimulus as this holiday shortened week nears an end.</p><p>Dow Industrials this morning up 223 points. The NASDAQ up 44, and the S&amp;P 500 up 18 points. This after the third quarter kicked off with a mixed day yesterday, the NASDAQ scoring its 22nd record close of the year, with another gain of 95 points at 4 o'clock on Wall Street yesterday.</p><p>Meanwhile, more stimulus ahead. President Trump telling Fox Business he supports additional money going directly into Americans' pockets. He's looking to add incentives to get people back to work - just a warning of a market crash if Former Vice President Joe Biden gets elected.</p><p>The House takes action over China's crackdown on Hong Kong's freedoms, meanwhile, voting to sanction bank suing business with Chinese officials who are involved in implementing that security law. It has already led to hundreds of arrests in Hong Kong overnight although that even impacts Americans in the city. All that coming up.</p><p>Officials finally taking action in Seattle, meanwhile, clearing out the autonomous zone after three weeks of occupation. And then there is Tesla driving to new heights, charging past its competition, now the largest automaker by market value, also surpassing other big names like Disney and Coca-Cola.</p><p>\"Mornings with Maria\" is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. As you see, we are looking at gains across the board. There are growing hopes for a coronavirus vaccine that is pushing markets higher in Europe this morning. Pfizer and BioNTech announced promising data from its vaccine tests. We've got more on that coming up.</p><p>FT 100 is up 50 points, the CAC quarante in Paris is up 78, and the DAX Index is up 227 points. Encouraging vaccine news also drove markets in Asia overnight. Take a look at the Asian markets, and you see we've got money moving into stocks there as well. Best performer was Hong Kong, up almost 3 percent on the Hang Seng Index.</p><p>Now, some of the top stories that we are watching this morning. President Trump says he supports coronavirus stimulus payments larger than $1,200 as long as it's done properly. Democrats have called for another round of $1,200 payments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says a potential phase four would be approved this month.</p><p>Coronavirus cases now spiking across the country with single-day numbers topping 50,000 for the first time. California, Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia, all reported their highest infection totals to-date yesterday. The surge in cases forcing some states to roll back the reopening plans. California Governor Gavin Newsom is reversing the state's plan to reopen, ending indoor operations for businesses, including restaurants, in 19 counties. He's also forcing bars to shut down completely.</p><p>New York City, meanwhile, also delaying the return of indoor dining right now. McDonald's pausing the reopening of dine-in services as well, all the dine-in services in the United States for 21 days as coronavirus cases grow. Right now, only about 1,000 of its 14,000 locations have reopened, with reduced seating capacity.</p><p>The pandemic now cutting into the NFL pre-season, the league expected to officially cut the number of games from four to two. The league reportedly considering making fans sign a liability waiver as protection against lawsuits related to coronavirus.</p><p>And police in Hong Kong moving quickly to crack down on prodemocracy protestors under this controversial new national security law. Nearly 400 people were arrested overnight on the anniversary of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China, including 10 people for violating the new law aimed at crushing dissent, potential jail time for life.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the measure, quote, \"an affront to all nations,\" adding the United States will pursue efforts to end Hong Kong's special trading status. The Senate, meanwhile, is expected to vote on a bill that would sanction banks that do business with Chinese officials who are carrying out this new legislation. The House passed its own bill yesterday.</p><p>And markets pointing to a gain ahead of the last trading day before the holiday weekend this morning. It is jobs day in America. The June jobs report due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern this morning. Estimates call for 3 million jobs additionally added to the economy in the month of June, as the economy rebounds from coronavirus shutdowns. The unemployment rate expected to fall to 12.3 percent.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Hermes' Chief Investment Officer, Stephen Auth. Also joining the conversation this morning is The King's College Business and Finance Chairman and Fox News contributor, Brian Brenberg; former Wall Street Journal Editorial Board member and \"Trumponomics\" co- author Stephen Moore; and EmployBridge Chief Workforce Analyst, Joanie Courtney. Great to see you everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, FORMER WSJ EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: Morning.</p><p>STEPHEN AUTH, FEDERATED HERMES CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER: Thank you.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Morning.</p><p>JOANIE COURTNEY, EMPLOYBRIDGE CHIEF WORKFORCE ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Steven Auth, let me kick it off with you. Of course, we have these new concerns now about the spikes - 50,000 spikes just in a day across the country. What's your take on the impact of the reopenings and the growth in stocks?</p><p>AUTH: Maria, I think what people are really looking at is deaths. And so far, as you know, that has not been nearly as dramatic as the increase in infections. So the operating theory of the markets is the people who feel safer and probably are, are the ones going on about and getting tested and maybe working through the virus. I think the country wants to do that.</p><p>Our death infection rates in the U.S. have been much lower than Europe - other than New York, which has been very tough. But that's what the market is watching, I would say, in terms of its outlook on the corona impact. But it's not going to be perfect coming through here.</p><p>I mean, we are going to see rising infection rates. Let's hope the treatment protocols, the profile of the people getting infected, et cetera, keep that tamp down in terms of real downside risk to individuals, which is what I think most people are focused on. But we're going to watch that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think this is a good--</p><p>AUTH: But that's one reason why it could be a little dicey in the second half, I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A little dicey in the second half because it's a good explainer to understand, even with these cases, you've got record valuations on Wall Street. The NASDAQ reached another record high. It's the 22nd all-time high for the year.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 also finished higher yesterday, as Tesla reached a milestone market cap of nearly $210 billion. This makes Tesla the most valuable automotive company in the world, more valuable than Coca-Cola, Disney, ExxonMobil, others. It's pretty extraordinary valuation. So what do you say about valuations out there in the face of all of this?</p><p>AUTH: Well, I've put out a piece last week, Maria. You may know that. We cut back our overweight. We are probably a little out over our skis down at the lowest with that really big overweight in stocks. We've cut it back quite a bit. We're still overweight a little bit.</p><p>But - the winners are pricey, the losers are pricey, and the survivors are dicey. And we're now looking around in the survivors and we're hanging onto our winners, but it's hard to add to them here, Maria. I mean, these are the winners of the post-corona world. They were the winners coming in. That's now accelerated.</p><p>But I think the big tech stocks - my view would be, these things have to take a little bit of a rest. I mean, they'll grow into their earnings. They're looking pretty solid in terms of growth. But it's hard for me to be screening by on those names here in the back half of the year, particularly with the political risks in front of us along with this--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AUTH: --kind of bumpy recovery out of the corona, which is not going to be perfect either. So--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I want to ask you about the political risk with the election in the second half of the year. But let me bring in Brian Brenberg here.</p><p>Go ahead, Brian.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes. Stephen, the story over the past month has been an economy that looks like a V-shaped recovery is possible. I still think that's the case. I think stocks are reflecting that. But you've got this overhang of governors and mayors now talking about rollbacks of reopening.</p><p>I don't think the American public wants to go for that, but how do you see that playing into valuations here? Are stocks going to believe what Americans are showing them or what mayors and governors are threatening right now?</p><p>AUTH: I would guess more of the former, Brian. I - the American people want to get restarted. And the governors are going to try to do the right thing to kind of slow things down and not make it (inaudible). There's no governor in this country that's going to shut down their state again. I think that's out of the question. People will be watching on the capital. But it is going to be a little bit bumpy.</p><p>I wrote - from V to U, or - we're exiting the V, entering the U. It's going to be more bumpy from here. We've got this sharp V off the lows as the industrial, the housing side really came on strong and are coming on strong. But the retail side of this economy, the bricks and mortar, the restaurants, the travel and leisure, these are going to go a little slower, and there's still pain left in those sectors. So I don't think we're going to get a V straight through the rest of the year here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, there's certainly uncertainty going into the election. That's one of the key issues for the second half.</p><p>Stephen, let me ask you this. Market has performed well, I assume, partly due on the policies of this administration - lower taxes, lower regulation, et cetera. If the - does the market believe that that's going to continue, do you think, or our investors thinking maybe Joe Biden wins and that would mean Elizabeth Warren as the key economic voice? Whether she's Treasury Secretary or in the Senate, that's going to mean probably higher taxes and perhaps more regulation. Do markets trade down on that?</p><p>AUTH: Well, it's - I don't think it's good news for markets. I mean, he - I think the President should be calling Biden tax-and-regulate-Joe as opposed to sleepy-Joe. Sleepy-Joe is actually - half the country would prefer at this point. So there are offsetting positives to Biden presidency, Maria, that - I think we've got to acknowledge is, one, the country could use less tweets and little more calm out of the Oval Office. They're going to get that with Biden.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AUTH: The Fed is going to try to offset whatever tax and regulate policies that come through. But we're talking - I think the market is only starting to look at the fairly radical progressive agenda of a Biden presidency. Capital gains, tax rates going up, ordinary tax rates on small businesses and high net worth individuals going up. Regulations going up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AUTH: That's all going to slow the growth trajectory. For us, we would have to take down our long-term growth trajectory and make stocks a little bit valuable, but there will be other offsetting pauses. I don't think the market is going to crash. And the market is already starting to assume that Biden is going to win. I think they think they're going to hold the Senate. My guess is that if--</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>AUTH: --if Biden does win, the Senate goes with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will keep watching that, obviously.</p><p>Stephen, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much, sir.</p><p>AUTH: Yes. Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have a good Independence Day weekend to you, Stephen Auth. Happy 4th of July. Thank you so much.</p><p>We are just getting started this morning. Coming up, Hard Rock International Chairman James Allen is here on Atlantic City's casinos, as they open their doors today.</p><p>And then in the 7:00 a.m. hour, we are taking a look at the \"Word on Wall Street\". Top analysts weigh in on the trading day ahead and the holiday weekend coming up, and of course, the second half.</p><p>Texas Congressman and medical doctor, Michael Burgess, is here on future stimulus and the surge in the COVID-19 cases in this home state. Union Square Hospitality CEO Danny Meyer joining us this morning on the New York City restaurant industry as it faces that pause in reopening.</p><p>And then at 8:00 a.m., we've got Georgia Senator David Perdue talking about coronavirus and its impact. Don't miss that. A lot to come. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Blockbuster fundraising in the race for the White House. Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee bringing in a record $141 million last month and $282 million for the second quarter. Biden's fundraiser topping President Trump and the RNC. The Republicans ranking in $131 million last month and $266 million for the second quarter.</p><p>Joining us right now is the pollster for the Trump 2020 Presidential Campaign and McLaughlin &amp; Associates President and Partner, Jim McLaughlin.</p><p>Great to see you, Jim. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>JIM MCLAUGHLIN, POLLSTER FOR TRUMP 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN &amp; MCLOUGHLIN AND ASSOCIATES PRESIDENT AND PARTNER: Great to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about polling and about how it's done differently. But first, let me get your reaction to those fundraising numbers, Biden versus Trump.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: The Democrats always raise lots of money. But the beautiful thing is this race isn't going to come down to money. If we all remember four years ago, Hillary Clinton significantly outraised this. She raised over a billion dollars. But there's no doubt in my mind that the Trump campaign--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow! Forgot about that.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. She raised - think about that. She raised over a billion dollars. Now, the great thing about that, though, is--</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's unbelievable.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: --Donald Trump doesn't need as much money as the Democrats do because nobody knows how to get his message out there better than Donald Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you look at all these polls. It's Fox News poll, a lot of different polls saying that the President is trailing Joe Biden. Before you comment on that, tell me how polling is done today. What is the situation in terms of polling in a COVID world? And even in the last couple of years, has polling changed in terms of how you do it? Do you do it on the internet, do you do it on phones, how do you poll?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: You do it all of the above. You do it on the internet, you do it on phones. But one of the big problems with a lot of these national polls that are out there, and I tell folks all the time, these national polls are really meaningless when it comes to the Presidential election. We saw that four years ago.</p><p>For instance, somebody like \"The New York Times\" about a week before Election Day, they were telling us there was a 92 percent chance that Hillary Clinton was going to become President.</p><p>One of the other big problems you have with the national polls is about a third of the people they're talking to in, what I call, the big eight Democratic states like Illinois, New York, California, they don't matter in the Presidential election.</p><p>What matters is those 17 battleground states right now. And if we remember back then, you had four years ago, folks were telling us there was that faint blue wall, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. There was no way that President Trump could win in those states. Well, we all know what happened on Election Day. He won all three of those states.</p><p>And a recent poll just came out in Wisconsin where President Trump was ahead, and another poll in Pennsylvania where the President is tied. So that's what you want to see. You want to see likely voters and you want to see folks - you want to see polls that are in the battleground states.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, do you think that the polls that were showing Donald Trump trailing Joe Biden are wrong then? Are they not capturing the true vote?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I don't think there's any doubt they're not capturing the true vote, Maria. And again, one of the problems is they're doing registered voters. They're not doing likely voters. And - but what's really interesting too is on the issue that's probably going to matter most come election day, rebuilding the economy, getting people back to work, you saw that even in the Fox News polls, which weren't great for President Trump--</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: --but he still had the advantage on the economy and jobs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to talk about policy. I'm going to bring in Steve Moore on this because President Trump is going after Joe Biden's tax plan, weighing in on the election in an exclusive interview with Fox Business. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: If he got elected, that's an overhang over the market because the market would crash - would absolutely crash. Market would go down by a tremendous amount. He'd raise taxes. He'd raise regulations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Joe Biden has said that. And certainly, if Elizabeth Warren is his treasury secretary, we're talking about a wealth tax. Obviously taxes are going to go up under a Biden administration, all taxes. And then there's the regulatory environment as well. What impact is that going to have on the economy? And then I want to bring Steve Moore in to talk about Trump's ideas as well. Real quick.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Yes. Real quick. Just to tell you--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead, Jim.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: --what's the first - what's the first thing that Joe Biden said he was going to do when he became President? He's going to raise taxes. And intuitively, the voters will tell you, raising taxes hurts the economy, costs us jobs. I guess it's kind of like the Larry Kudlow messaging - the Larry Kudlow, Stephen Moore messaging.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: When you raise taxes--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: --voters know it's bad for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Real quick. Steve Moore, what is the President going to do in a second term?</p><p>MOORE: Well, look, more of the same. More tax cuts, more deregulation, more pro-America free trade deals. And the problem I think, Jim, is that - look, Trump has to have a huge lead. He should be beating Biden by 20 points in terms of who can best handle the economy. And I think, ultimately, don't you, Jim, that when people go to the polls in November in these shaky economic times that that might be the most important question voters ask themselves as who do you trust more on the economy?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: No doubt about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: And the race hasn't been defined yet. And once that race is defined and the differences on the issues when it comes to taxes and regulations, Donald Trump is going to have a clear advantage.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll keep watching, Jim. Thank you so much for being here. Jim McLaughlin joining us there on polling.</p><p>Coming up, more stimulus is in the works. President Trump telling Fox Business about the possible cash coming your way. And then, place your bets, Atlantic City casinos are reopening today. How they plan to keep gamblers and workers safe? Right after this. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The next round of stimulus, President Trump indicating to Fox Business yesterday that the next wave of relief could deliver more than the additional $1,200 floated by Democrats. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Another round of direct payments for individuals. Do you support that at this time?</p><p>TRUMP: I do. I support it, but it has to be done properly. And I support actually larger numbers than the Democrats, but it's got to be done properly. We had something where they wanted, where it gave you a disincentive to work last time. And it was still money going to people and helping people. So I was all for that. But we want to create a very great incentive to work. So we're working on that, and I'm sure we'll all come together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Republicans are criticizing the unemployment expansion saying that it encourages people to stay home rather than go back to work. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowing Tuesday to abandon the boost as part of the next round of relief.</p><p>Steve Moore, what do you expect from the next round of stimulus? What should it look like? I know there's a major issue with people working from home and saying, look, I'm making more money as I stay at home, why would I want to go back?</p><p>MOORE: Yes. This is the key issue in this phase four. And I was actually so pleased to hear that interview with Blake yesterday with the President. He nailed it. Whatever we do in phase four, we cannot keep these incentives for people to stay out of the labor force.</p><p>Maria, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that over four out of five Americans would make more money not working under the Pelosi plan than working. That would be catastrophic. In fact, I have a piece in the \"Wall Street Journal\" tomorrow with Casey Mulligan, one of the best labor economists in the country.</p><p>We estimate that if you allowed people to continue to get these super-high unemployment benefits, Maria, that would reduce employment this year by 10 million people. So, if Trump were to allow that to happen, there is no way he could get reelected because we couldn't have an expansion.</p><p>Republicans have to draw the line and say we are not going to have a policy that pays people more not to work than to work. And by the way, the one policy out there that pays people more to work, obviously, is the payroll tax reduction, and I really believe - my sources on Capitol Hill and the White House are saying, that's very much on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. The President told me that as well, that that's what he would like to see happen, a payroll tax holiday. Your idea.</p><p>All right. Take a quick break and then place your bet. So Atlantic City casinos are rolling the dice this morning, reopening today. The plan is to keep gamblers and workers safe. Coming up. You are watching \"Mornings with Maria\" live on Fox Business.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: Welcome back. A good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.

Casinos taking a major hit due to COVID-19, as you know.</p><p>And joining us right now is the chairman of the Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming CEO, Jim Allen. Jim, it's good to see you, thank you so much for joining us. Good luck today.</p><p>What are your thoughts on Atlantic City's reopening and how are you protecting staff and customers?</p><p>JIM ALLEN, CHAIRMAN, HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL: Good morning, Maria. Well, certainly, we are excited here in Atlantic City at the Hard Rock, bringing over 2,200 people back to work. It's been a rather challenging time. And, certainly, it's the peak of the Jersey Shore season coming into 4th of July weekend.</p><p>So, number one, we are excited about opening, and most importantly focusing on social distancing, focusing on the safety of our guests and employees.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what are your expectations then? I mean, do you think that people will come out and start doing what they were doing a couple of months ago? How do you think -- how are you seeing things differently today?</p><p>ALLEN: You know, today is much different than it was, say, three, four days ago. Governor Murphy issued a new executive order, which eliminates indoor dining in the state of New Jersey and obviously here in the casinos. So we had to navigate through some last-minute plans.</p><p>One of the great things about the Hard Rock is we have over 4 million square feet in this particular complex. So we do have a lot of outdoor decks and dining areas so that we can obviously offer these amenities and still having some fun to our guests. But it certainly has been a challenge when we have 25 percent capacity.</p><p>Most importantly, it's about getting the employees back to work, you know, understanding this is going to be a slow ramp up but taking one step at a time, you know, making sure people are safe and sound.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So it's a slow ramp-up and, of course, the 25 percent capacity is something that will sort of limit the gains that you can have. But tell me how this pandemic has impacted your business. I mean, the loss of foot traffic over these last three months has -- had to have a hard hit. Will this have long-term effects?</p><p>ALLEN: You know, I certainly think the restaurant division, not just for Hard Rock Cafe but restaurants in general, really need to reevaluate what the long-term business plan is. We've actually spent over a hundred million dollars associated with cost regarding protection for employee's benefits, pay, et cetera, for coronavirus on a global basis.</p><p>Keep in mind, we are in 76 countries around the world, so we certainly have a lot more diversity than many companies.</p><p>We are pretty optimistic about the integrated resort, casino, hotel business on a long-term basis once the air lift and things like this starts coming somewhat back to normal. But, no doubt, restaurants, I think, are a category long-term that we're going to keep a very keen eye on focusing on what that business model is in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And it looks like we are going to see real structural change to certain industries, restaurants maybe one of them.</p><p>You said 76 countries. Can you look out to all of the businesses across world and identify where you've seen growth even during this and what was the hardest hit in terms of this pandemic with all of your locations?</p><p>ALLEN: Yes, so at 100 percent. But interesting as each location opens, can we see actually different results? We saw results in Sacramento where, frankly, the business was up over 100 percent at first. It's kind of leveled off now to be at the 40, 50 percent area, which obviously is very strong. But if we look at the property, say, in South Florida, frankly, that ramp-up has been very slow and we are actually not even hitting last year's numbers.</p><p>As we look at our hotels even going to China, we are certainly starting to see some occupancies, you know, approaching the 60 percent area but certainly nowhere near more they were prior to COVID-19. So, globally, a city like London, we are not even open yet. So it really depends upon geographic location and very candidly the public's awareness as to how important they think corona or COVID is in their particular communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I think you make a really good point about China too, because I know for a long time, Macau was pretty much subsidizing everything else. The Chinese loved gambling and it was such an important business that it was subsidizing every other location. Then when you look at place like New Jersey, where you are now, they're not allowing indoor dining, no smoking, no drinking in the casinos, what does that do to the impact of this reopening this morning?</p><p>ALLEN: Well, you know, listen, I think one thing that's important is working with Governor Murphy, with the mayor, with the CRDA to still continue to focus on the larger plan as far as the revitalization of Atlantic City.</p><p>But when we think about Macau, we had a relationship with Laurence Ho in the City of Dreams, which, frankly, now we are back looking at that particular market, even in the most challenging times, Macau is still a very profitable gaming market, no doubt. When you look at the publicly- traded companies, the business in both Macau and, say, Singapore is obviously off where it was at its peak. But I think, long-term, there are still markets and, frankly, the companies that are in those particular markets will enjoy long-term profitability.</p><p>I think when you look at a market like Las Vegas --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>ALLEN: -- a little different story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. In terms of Macau, I remember -- I went to Macau and it was just jam-packed and the business was talked about across the board within the industry that that was really where the growth was for the casino business in China, in Macau.</p><p>Any of this upset between the U.S. and China's relationship, do you think that's going to impact that growth that you're counting on in Macau?</p><p>ALLEN: You know, I definitely think it creates caution. I think as we look at the relationship between China and the United States, I think it's -- caution is the word. Certainly, the two countries have so much economic reliance on each other. But I think we have to respect that when we operate in these particular countries, we are a guest there and we need to comply with obviously the rules and regulations.</p><p>I think businesses that understand that can be proven to be very successful. And, frankly, our international operations and prior to COVID were doing extremely. Well so I think respect is the most important thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, as always. Jim, it's good to have on the program this morning. Thank you so much. We wish the best for day one and the reopening this morning. Thank you. We will be watching.</p><p>Coming up, expanding access to telemedicine, how one company is reaching underserved communities amid pandemic.

A ground breaking new technology now is looking to make sure all Americans can access the virtual services from home. Qortex connecting health professionals with underserved communities using its first and only television-based telehealth program.</p><p>Joining us founder and CEO of Qortex and -- Founder of Qortex and CEO of MedSign, Tom Conroy. Tom, it's good to have you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I just love this idea. Congratulations. Walk us through how this technology works.</p><p>TOM CONROY, CEO, MEDSIGN: Well, it's real simple. It is the first of a kind technology that enables medical professionals to talk to their patients in the comfort of their home using what -- almost everybody knows how to use in the 120 million T.V. in mobile homes, is their television set.</p><p>And so I really created this for my 92-year-old World War II veteran. I didn't want my dad traveling in his car traveling to go to the hospital, to sit there and wait for his appointment rather in today's technology and especially in the world today, I wanted him to stay home, in the safety and comfort of his home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that. And my 88-year-old parents are in the same spot but I feel like I can't really explain to them how to use an iPhone. So you're 92-year-old dad got it, understood how to work it on the T.V.?</p><p>CONROY: That's correct. It's a senior, simple design, and that was the emphasis when I first went through this. I said, you know, I've got to build something that's senior, simple, that they'll adopt and they'll embrace. And when you see the system and you use it, we have 90-year-olds using the system.</p><p>And there's a secondary role in this that's really important, not only can they talk to their medical professional, their doctor, but you can talk to your parents all through your T.V. set. Now, you're on T.V. all of the time, so they see, but for the rest of us, it's really neat. We call in to them, all they've got to do is press okay on the remote control and there I am on their television set, like a star --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it.</p><p>CONROY: -- talking and communicating (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really good idea. So you're running pilot programs with several leading hospitals right now. What's the feedback so far from the hospitals?</p><p>CONROY: Excellent. And the fact that it's -- they are reaching a demographic they can't reach right now. Just think about it, people over 65 for the most part are technology-averse, they live remote. This system, because I was telling you there's 120 million households with T.V.s, they have cable connections, they have internet.</p><p>And for those who can't -- I'm a satellite expert. I'm a retired military officer, worked in the space program. We can connect through satellite. So we are agnostic to the systems that provide the internet. We can connect to any hospital system and we can connect you through your iPhone to your mom and dad at home any time of the day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. Seniors need this so much. It's a good idea and this is where the job creation is.</p><p>Let me bring in Joanie Courtney, because, Joanie, you have been telling us for months and months is that that is where the jobs are in healthcare professionals. Tell us about this and what your reaction is to what Tom is telling us with this new technology, telehealth?</p><p>JOANIE COURTNEY, CHIEF WORKFORCE ANALYST, EMPLOYBRIDGE: Yes. Tom, it's very interesting to hear about this. We certainly see a strong demand for healthcare workers, you know, anything from physical therapists, registered nurses, physician assistants.</p><p>I'm actually curious, Tom, on how COVID has maybe accelerated your business or how you see it changing. Because we've certainly seen a tremendous amount of transformation, digital transformation accelerated with COVID. So how has COVID impacted your business?</p><p>CONROY: Well, telehealth is -- right now, it's like a tsunami. The growth in telehealth is going to be tremendous. I think it's around $10 billion, the estimate right now. And in five years, it's $200 billion.</p><p>But understand what I've done here with my team. We have a fabulous team at MedSign. What we have done is created a system to go after and reach a demographic that's not being touched right now. Seniors don't know how to use an iPhone or a tablet or a computer. We are talking 45 million seniors out there that have the potential, and not only in the United States, but let's talk about business section.</p><p>So when we have a worldwide global -- we can have a worldwide global impact by providing this service globally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I just got my parents something called the GranPad for this very reason. It's not iPhone, it's just like a video chat.</p><p>But, Tom, you're right, you're hitting on a market that is right for change and in need. We'll be watching. It's good to see you this morning, tom. Thank you.</p><p>CONROY: Thank you very much, Maria, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom Conroy joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, fiction becomes a reality. Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker out with a new show helping people find love. We will tell you about it.</p><p>You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the morning buzz.</p><p>First up, how far would you go for love? Sarah Jessica Parker says pretty far. The actress is developing a new dating show for Lifetime called Swipe, Swap, where singles swap lives with a potential match in order to find love. That includes moving to each other's city, living in their homes, spending time with one another, with close friends and family.</p><p>Joanie Courtney, would you do it?</p><p>COURTNEY: Well, I don't think I'd do it but I think it's interesting. It's an interesting concept, certainly getting back into more reality T.V. of -- it's kind a combination, right, of Wife Swap and The Bachelor or dating shows. But I'm a big fan of Sarah Jessica Parker and Sex and the City, and I think she will get a lot of attention on this one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you're not exactly going to be moving in with somebody that you don't know. By the way, this is not Sarah Jessica Parker's first business venture. SJP joined me here on Fox Business back in 2014 when she launched her shoe line. She came into the studio and showed us all of the shoes that she was designing and they were beautiful. She has been actually an entrepreneur aside from her acting skills as well, and she showed it to us in New York.</p><p>Next up, a new study reveals Americans are facing more anxiety. 55 percent say that they were more stressed in May than in January before the pandemic. Of course, attributing the pressure to the lockdown and unemployment, no surprise here, Steve Moore?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, SENIOR ECONOMICS WRITER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: This is why we cannot continue to shut down this economy or return to a shutdown. There's a report today about very large increases in drug and alcohol abuse. You're seeing increases in depression, all sorts of social pathologies that have been related to this lockdown.</p><p>And it's so crazy because the thing that's best for your health, the one thing we do know now is sunlight and fresh air are the two best disinfectants. So get out this weekend, folks, don't be afraid and go out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's very good advice, Steve, because the sunshine does -- do something to your moods, it's true.</p><p>And finally, you don't have to travel to the Milky Way to feel like you're there. Check this out. NASA is preparing to launch and outer space-scented perfume. Scent was originally developed to train and prepare astronauts for what space smelled. Now, anybody can smell like a star, Brian. Would you wear it?</p><p>BRIAN: It smells like a seared stake, raspberries and rum, I will wear that any day, Maria. It sounds great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I don't know if that's what it smells like.</p><p>All right, a quick break, and then the Union Square Hospitality CEO will join us on the future of dining in New York City. Don't miss Danny Meyer coming up next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020070201cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608G-H1G1-JB20-G2HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7095\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002PDE</classCode><className>DELTA AIR LINES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS312111 SOFT DRINK MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC2086 BOTTLED &amp;

The company, which is dropping the word \"bank\" from its lo...</p><p>MOSCOW: Sberbank, Russia's dominant lender, is planning one of the biggest reinventions in its 179-year history as it seeks to join the likes of Apple and Google in the global pantheon of Big Tech.    The company, which is dropping the word \"bank\" from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge \u2013 including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker \u2013 ahead of their official unveiling on Sept 24.    Sberbank's Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching \"SmartMarket\", an equivalent to Apple's AppStore or Google Play.    \"It's a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it's a huge investment,\" he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount.    The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country's oldest lender with assets of US$401bil (RM1.67 trillion) as of August and a market value of about US$67bil (RM279.26bil).    In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia's digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the \"largest transformation\" in its history.    \"We've always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,\" Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products.    Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Sept 24 at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms.    New gadgets: meet Salute    Among Sberbank's new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.    Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple's Siri, Hey Google or Amazon's Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank's devices and mobile apps.    What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are \"cultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,\" Sberbank said.    The company's SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money.    \"It's strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,\" said Rafalovsky.    Tech's a risky business    The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date.    Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.    Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft's LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.    However, Sberbank's costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market.    Apple, Samsung and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru, Internet group Yandex and mobile operator MTS all have smart speakers on the market.    In June, Sberbank and Yandex \u2013 known as Russia's answer to Google \u2013 said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition.    Life beyond banking    While Sberbank's diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets.    BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.

The company, which is dropping the wor...</p><p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Sberbank SBER.MM , Russia's dominant lender, is planning one of the biggest reinventions in its 179-year history as it seeks to join the likes of Apple and Google in the global pantheon of Big Tech.   The company, which is dropping the word \u201cbank\u201d from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday.   Sberbank\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching \u201cSmartMarket\u201d, an equivalent to Apple\u2019s AppStore or Google Play.   \u201cIt\u2019s a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it\u2019s a huge investment,\u201d he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount.   The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country\u2019s oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion.   In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia\u2019s digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the \u201clargest transformation\u201d in its history.   \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,\u201d Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products.   Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms.  Slideshow ( 4 images ) NEW GADGETS: MEET SALUTE  Among Sberbank\u2019s new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.   Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple\u2019s Siri, Hey Google or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank\u2019s devices and mobile apps.   What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are \u201ccultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,\u201d Sberbank said.   The company\u2019s SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money.   \u201cIt\u2019s strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,\u201d said Rafalovsky.  TECH\u2019S A RISKY BUSINESS  The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date.   Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.   Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.   However Sberbank\u2019s costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market.   Apple AAPL.O , Samsung 005930.KS and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru MAILRq.L , internet group Yandex YNDX.O and mobile operator MTS MTSS.MM all have smart speakers on the market.   In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia\u2019s answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition.  LIFE BEYOND BANKING  While Sberbank\u2019s diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets.   BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.   Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said.   \u201cHow do you earn money if you do banking business only?\u201d she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43157751498</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XD-FGR1-JCSC-J3PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters UK</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000D8PQ</classCode><className>SBERBANK ROSSII OAO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522293 INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

The company, which is dropping the wor...</p><p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Sberbank SBER.MM , Russia's dominant lender, is planning one of the biggest reinventions in its 179-year history as it seeks to join the likes of Apple and Google in the global pantheon of Big Tech.   The company, which is dropping the word \u201cbank\u201d from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday.   Sberbank\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching \u201cSmartMarket\u201d, an equivalent to Apple\u2019s AppStore or Google Play.   \u201cIt\u2019s a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it\u2019s a huge investment,\u201d he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount.   The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country\u2019s oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion.   In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia\u2019s digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the \u201clargest transformation\u201d in its history.   \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,\u201d Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products.   Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms.  NEW GADGETS: MEET SALUTE  Among Sberbank\u2019s new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.   Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple\u2019s Siri, Hey Google or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank\u2019s devices and mobile apps.   What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are \u201ccultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,\u201d Sberbank said.   The company\u2019s SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money.   \u201cIt\u2019s strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,\u201d said Rafalovsky.  TECH\u2019S A RISKY BUSINESS  The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date.   Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.   Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.   However Sberbank\u2019s costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market.   Apple AAPL.O , Samsung 005930.KS and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru MAILRq.L , internet group Yandex YNDX.O and mobile operator MTS MTSS.MM all have smart speakers on the market.   In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia\u2019s answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition.  LIFE BEYOND BANKING  While Sberbank\u2019s diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets.   BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.   Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said.   \u201cHow do you earn money if you do banking business only?\u201d she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43151158264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-V9Y1-JCSC-J30N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"900\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters UK</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000D8PQ</classCode><className>SBERBANK ROSSII OAO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522293 INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

But not for long.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Google just got a third, and possibly final, EU fine on Wednesday, regulators still have their eyes on Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc.</p><p>EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, told reporters earlier this month that an early-stage probe into Amazon's potential use of data to overtake smaller shops on its Marketplace platform is \"quite advanced\" and she'd \"like to take more decisive steps\" before she leaves office later this year. That might see the start of a full-blown investigation.</p><p>She's also promised to examine a complaint Spotify Technology SA made targeting Apple's app store and has said she \"takes an interest\" in potential anti-competitive behaviour by Facebook.</p><p>The 1.49 billion-euro ($2.2-billion) fine levied Wednesday against Alphabet Inc.'s Google for thwarting advertising rivals was the third time Vestager penalized the U.S. tech giant.</p><p>There are new cops doing the rounds too - privacy authorities in countries armed with the power to levy fines of as much as 4 per cent of a company's annual sales for breaching the EU's new data rules.</p><p>'The truth is that many regard Google and Facebook as out of control,\" Jonathan Compton, a partner at DMH Stallard in the U.K., said in an email after Wednesday's fine. \"The deeper problem is what to do about it. Even if you make the decision to regulate the big platforms, and that is an issue in itself involving freedom of expression, how can those platforms regulate their content when they have two billion or so users?\"</p><p>Ireland's data protection commissioner Helen Dixon is already looking into at least seven privacy probes targeting Facebook, with several other investigations her office opened targeting \"very big internet companies,\" she said in an interview in February.</p><p>France's data watchdog in January levied a record 50 million-euro fine against Google, which showed that watchdogs are taking the new guidelines seriously.</p><p>Amazon is also facing a probe by Germany's Federal Cartel Office, which last month made worldwide headlines by striking at Facebook's user-data policy.</p><p>Internet platforms usually raise concerns because of their \"double role\" as marketplace providers that also compete with companies offering services on the portals, Andreas Mundt, head of the regulator, told reporters in Berlin on Thursday. The German Amazon probe is likely to become another \"sample case\" just like the Facebook order is, he said.</p><p>New regulatory risks for tech companies are emerging. The EU agreed to new rules for online platforms in February that require internet firms to address some issues that have triggered antitrust cases. They will have to provide clear terms of service, more transparency about how products are ranked, and to establish a system for handling complaints. Companies are also required under the new rules to \"exhaustively disclose\" any advantage they give their own products.</p><p>A copyright reform finalized last month forces web firms to compensate publishers and creators for the content that appears on their websites.</p><p>At the same time EU regulators are demanding Twitter Inc., Facebook and Google do more to fight disinformation on the internet ahead of May elections.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019032253851808</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPG-WJN1-DY91-K511-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"548\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 10.1%[1] on average during election years since 1952 when a sitting president has run for reelection. Over the same period, the blue-chip average has fallen 1.6% during election years when there's an open field.Per John LaForge, head of retail asset strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the Dow Jones has had an average return of 7.6% during presidential election years since 1900, and positive returns 70% of the time during those 30 occurrences. Bonds and stocks historically struggled in the first half of election years and rose later in the year (read: 9 High-Flying ETFs of 2019[2]).The two key Democratic presidential candidates are Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who will battle it out with Donald Trump. </p><p>Wall Street experts forecast major losses for the U.S. stock market if Democrat Elizabeth Warren wins the 2020 presidential election.As such, Morgan Stanley outlined four outcomes of the 2020 election and its strategies[3] for investors on how to make the most of them.Democrats Win White House, Split CongressUnder this scenario, alternative energy stocks would gain, and oil and gas stocks along with big banks will lose. This is because Elizabeth Warren has hyped an ambitious climate change plan, calling for $3 trillion in spending to move the United States to 100% clean energy under a 10-year plan and safeguard poorer communities that are dependent on the production of fossil fuels.As such, investors could invest in alternative energy ETFs like iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ICLN[4], Invesco Cleantech ETF PZD[5], Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF PBW[6] and First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund QCLN[7] (read: Clean Energy ETFs Riding Higher[8]).Republicans Win White House, Split CongressIn this scenario, where if President Trump is reelected and Congress remains divided between a Republican Senate and a Democratic House, bank and oil stocks will be the biggest winners. The status quo will fuel the gradual rollback of banking, and oil and gas regulations.Given this, bank funds \u2014 SPDR S...ank ETF KBE[9], Invesco KBW Bank ETF KBWB[10], SPDR S...egional Banking ETF KRE[11] and iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF IAT[12] \u2014 and oil ETFs like SPDR S...il ...s Exploration ...oduction ETF XOP[13], Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE[14], and VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF OIH[15] could see continued upside (read: Trump May See Easy \"Win in 2020:\" ETFs to Bet On[16]).Democrats Sweep White House, CongressIn this outcome, where if Democrats take the White House as well as both chambers of Congress, the unified government will likely expand spending on health care, transportation and infrastructure, thereby providing a boost to these sectors. As a result, investors could invest in some of the popular healthcare ETFs like Health Care Select Sector SPDR FundXLV[17], Vanguard Healthcare ETF VHT[18], iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB[19] and SPDR S...iotech ETF XBI[20] (read: Healthcare ETFs Win in October: Here's Why[21]).Transportation funds iShares Transportation Average ETF IYT[22], SPDR S...ransportation ETF XTN[23] and First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF FTXR[24] will also see smooth trading under this scenario. However, the Democratic coalition would call for heightened scrutiny and pressure on big financial firms, big tech and big pharma.Republicans Sweep White House, CongressThe last outcome could be Republicans taking back the House and Trump staying back in the White House. This could propel the current pace of deregulation.

She also said additional antitrust scrutiny of the tech giant was still to come.</p><p>The new penalty adds to Google's costly headaches in Europe, where Vestager has fined the tech giant more than $9 billion, citing antitrust violations. </p><p>Reacting to Wednesday's fine, Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president of global affairs, stressed in a statement that the company already has made \"a wide range of changes to our products to address the [European] Commission's concerns.\" Google did not say whether it would appeal the E.U. decision.</p><p>In 2018, Vestager took aim at the company's Android smartphone operating system, saying that Google pressured mobile device-makers to pre-install the tech giant's apps. </p><p>A year before that, Vestager punished Google for giving its shopping-comparison service a better placement in search results over rivals' offerings. In both cases, Google has started tweaking its business practices in Europe to comply with the law while appealing E.U. decisions in court.</p><p>The company's changes include a new effort, detailed Tuesday, to help owners of Android smartphones find and use competing search and Web-browsing services. The update applies only to Europe, Google said in a blog post, without indicating whether it would alter any of its mobile practices in the United States. It still earned some early praise from Vestager, who said Wednesday that the company has the \"potential to give users a real choice.\"</p><p>Vestager's latest punishment targets Google's relationships with third-party websites, from large retailers to small gossip blogs. Sites that participated in Google's \"AdSense for Search\" program could take advantage of Google's search tools on their Web pages, and users who searched those sites would see results alongside ads served up by Google.</p><p>But Google for a time prohibited those third-party sites from using rival ad services, then required prominent placement of its own ads - two of the many restrictions on AdSense customers that led the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, to conclude in an initial complaint filed in 2016 that Google had acted in an anti-competitive way.</p><p>E.U. officials acknowledged in 2016 that Google had changed its AdSense contracts to allow for \"more freedom to display competing search ads.\" </p><p>But the decision announced Wednesday prohibits the company from introducing any such ad restrictions in the future while opening the door for Google to face lawsuits from \"any person or business affected by its anti-competitive\" tactics, the European Union said.</p><p>\"There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in their contracts except to keep rivals out of the market,\" Vestager said.</p><p>The Google fine is the European Union's latest broadside against the tech industry. Vestager previously has acknowledged an ongoing antitrust investigation against Amazon, and earlier this month, she said the inquiry is in a \"quite advanced\" stage. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)         </p><p>Music-streaming site Spotify, meanwhile, has urged European regulators to take similar aim at Apple, alleging last week that the iPhone giant has an \"unfair advantage\" because of the subscription-related fees it charges certain app makers. Individual European countries - emboldened with tough online privacy laws that took effect last year - also have set their sights on Silicon Valley. A key regulatory agency in Ireland recently confirmed it has opened 10 investigations into Facebook and its data-collection practices.</p><p>Google could face additional penalties in the European Union, where Vestager - who has emerged as one of Silicon Valley's toughest regulators - is set to finish her term as competition commissioner at the end of October. Regulators recently have started scrutinizing Google's handling of local search results, following a complaint brought by Yelp last year.</p><p>\"We're still looking into the search market for jobs and the search market for locals,\" Vestager said Wednesday. \"We keep getting complaints from people who are concerned about how these markets work.\" </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-67fd7694-4b45-11e9-b79a-961983b7e0cd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP8-F5D1-DXXY-3130-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She also said additional antitrust scrutiny of the tech giant was still to come.</p><p>The new penalty adds to Google's costly headaches in Europe, where Vestager has fined the tech giant more than $9 billion, citing antitrust violations. </p><p>Reacting to Wednesday's fine, Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president of global affairs, stressed in a statement that the company already has made \"a wide range of changes to our products to address the [European] Commission's concerns.\" Google did not say whether it would appeal the E.U. decision.</p><p>In 2018, Vestager took aim at the company's Android smartphone operating system, saying that Google pressured mobile device-makers to pre-install the tech giant's apps. </p><p>A year before that, Vestager punished Google for giving its shopping-comparison service a better placement in search results over rivals' offerings. In both cases, Google has started tweaking its business practices in Europe to comply with the law while appealing E.U. decisions in court.</p><p>The company's changes include a new effort, detailed Tuesday, to help owners of Android smartphones find and use competing search and Web-browsing services. The update applies only to Europe, Google said in a blog post, without indicating whether it would alter any of its mobile practices in the United States. It still earned some early praise from Vestager, who said Wednesday that the company has the \"potential to give users a real choice.\"</p><p>Vestager's latest punishment targets Google's relationships with third-party websites, from large retailers to small gossip blogs. Sites that participated in Google's \"AdSense for Search\" program could take advantage of Google's search tools on their Web pages, and users who searched those sites would see results alongside ads served up by Google.</p><p>But Google for a time prohibited those third-party sites from using rival ad services, then required prominent placement of its own ads - two of the many restrictions on AdSense customers that led the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, to conclude in an initial complaint filed in 2016 that Google had acted in an anti-competitive way.</p><p>E.U. officials acknowledged in 2016 that Google had changed its AdSense contracts to allow for \"more freedom to display competing search ads.\" </p><p>But the decision announced Wednesday prohibits the company from introducing any such ad restrictions in the future while opening the door for Google to face lawsuits from \"any person or business affected by its anti-competitive\" tactics, the European Union said.</p><p>\"There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in their contracts except to keep rivals out of the market,\" Vestager said.</p><p>The Google fine is the European Union's latest broadside against the tech industry. Vestager previously has acknowledged an ongoing antitrust investigation against Amazon, and earlier this month, she said the inquiry is in a \"quite advanced\" stage. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)         </p><p>Music-streaming site Spotify, meanwhile, has urged European regulators to take similar aim at Apple, alleging last week that the iPhone giant has an \"unfair advantage\" because of the subscription-related fees it charges certain app makers. Individual European countries - emboldened with tough online privacy laws that took effect last year - also have set their sights on Silicon Valley. A key regulatory agency in Ireland recently confirmed it has opened 10 investigations into Facebook and its data-collection practices.</p><p>Google could face additional penalties in the European Union, where Vestager - who has emerged as one of Silicon Valley's toughest regulators - is set to finish her term as competition commissioner at the end of October. Regulators recently have started scrutinizing Google's handling of local search results, following a complaint brought by Yelp last year.</p><p>\"We're still looking into the search market for jobs and the search market for locals,\" Vestager said Wednesday. \"We keep getting complaints from people who are concerned about how these markets work.\" </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-67fd76944b4511e9b79a961983b7e0cd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP8-96Y1-JCDY-T4X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><timeReceived>11:39 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But for years, John Deere has been selling tractors that practically drive themselves for use on farms in America's heartland, where there are few pesky pedestrians or federal rules to get in the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a glimpse at the future, meet Jason Poole, a 34-year-old crop consultant from Kansas. After a long day of meetings this month and driving five hours across the state to watch his little girl's softball game, he was still able to run his John Deere tractor until 2 a.m., thanks to technology that left most of the driving to a computer.</p><p>The land is hilly on Poole's family farm, so he drives the first curved row manually and handles the turns himself to teach the layout to his tractor's guidance system. But after that, he takes his hands off the steering wheel and allows the tractor to finish.</p><p>\"We kind of laugh when we see news stories about self-driving cars, because we've had that for years,\" Poole said.</p><p>The advancements being rolled out on the farm could soon show up next door: Your neighbor can already replace his lawn mower with the John Deere equivalent of a Roomba robotic vacuum for his yard.</p><p>The self-driving technology being sold by John Deere and some of its competitors is less technically complex than the fully driverless cars that big tech companies and car manufacturers are working on. For now, the tractors are still supposed to have a driver behind the wheel - even if they never touch it.</p><p>They've already started to transform farming in America and abroad: John Deere is selling auto-steering and other self-guidance tech in more than 100 countries, said Cory Reed, vice president of the company's Intelligent Solutions Group.</p><p>\"John Deere is the largest operator of autonomous vehicles,\" said Catherine Sandoval, a California public utilities commissioner, at a recent event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Some farmers aren't shy about their enthusiasm for the technology - even uploading videos showing it off online. One appears to show a tractor hauling a planter making a tightly choreographed turn without a driver in the cab. In another, the driver takes pictures, throws paper airplanes and balances a water bottle on his nose before appearing to nod off while the tractor keeps working his field.</p><p>The systems come with their own risks, including concerns that they could be hacked. But because farm-equipment makers operate almost exclusively on private land, they've been able to bring products to market much more quickly than consumer automakers - and without the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>There are no federal rules specifically addressing self-driving tech for tractors, largely because farm equipment is designed for use in fields where it doesn't pose the same level of risk to other vehicles or people as a self-driving vehicle on a public road. The closest thing to national regulations are safety standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but the agency does not have any rules directly aimed at self-driving technology.</p><p>That lack of regulations is one reason that the future reached the farm first. But another is pure necessity: There's a labor crunch in rural America.</p><p>John Deere isn't the only company selling this kind of technology; its main competitor, Case IH, markets similar systems, as do lesser-known companies. Some are going even further than modifying existing tractor designs: The aptly named Autonomous Tractor Corp. designed a fully autonomous tractor prototype that looks like a golden, boxy tank, but without a seat for a driver.</p><p>The systems are pricey: Outfitting a new tractor with top-of-the-line auto-steering, navigation and guidance tech could cost upward of $20,000, Reed said. There are also activation and subscription fees if farmers want to use the company's satellite or radio signals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Jeff Barger | Visual Services-East Moline | John Deere This John Deere harvester and grain cart in Illinois has an operator at the wheel, as required, but it's being driven by satellite guidance to improve precision.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAPILT-1031937175</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAPILT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GBB-RYT1-DYR7-R36W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144571</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"661\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Virginian-Pilot Companies LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.)</publicationName><edition> The Virginian-Pilot Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 28, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000292K</classCode><className>DEERE &amp;

Devices are powered by electricity - often produced in coal-fired plants - and are manufactured from materials such as metals, glass and plastics. These materials also have to be mined, made or recycled.So, while digital technologies can facilitate environmental benefits, we shouldn't assume they always do. My research published this year shows much more needs to be done to debunk such myths. </p><p>Measuring digital eco-footprintsIt's difficult to measure the environmental impacts of our digital lives, partly because the digital ecosystems that facilitate the internet are complex. Read more: Sustainable Shopping: the eco-friendly guide to online Christmas shopping The United Nations Environment Assembly defines a digital ecosystem as 'a complex distributed network or interconnected socio-technological system'. Simply, digital ecosystems are the result of humans, digital infrastructure and devices interacting with one another. They rely on energy consumption at multiple scales. The term 'digital ecosystem' relates to ecological thinking, specifically in terms of how human-technological systems work. However, there's nothing inherently environmentally sustainable about digital ecosystems. It's worthwhile considering digital ecosystems' environmental impacts as they grow.In 2017, it was reported in Nature that internet traffic (to and from data centres) was increasing at an exponential rate. At that stage, it had reached 1.1 zettabytes (a zettabyte equals one trillion gigabytes). As our digital use continues, so do our carbon emissions. Dangers of data centresData centres majorly contribute to the carbon emissions of digital ecosystems. They are basically factories that store, backup and recover our data. In April last year, it was estimated data centres around the world used more than 2% of the world's electricity, and generated the same amount of carbon emissions as the global airline industry (in terms of fuel use). Read more: Sustainable shopping: is it possible to fly sustainably? While there is debate about the impact of flying on climate change, we're less likely to evaluate our digital lives the same way. According to British Open University Professor John Naughton , data centres make up about 50% of all energy consumed by digital ecosystems. Personal devices use another 34%, and the industries responsible for manufacturing them use 16%.Tech giants such as Apple and Google have committed to 100% renewable targets, but they're just one part of our giant digital ecosystem. Also, on many occasions, they rely on carbon offsets to achieve this. Offsets involve people and organisations investing in environmental projects to balance their carbon emissions from other activities. For instance, people can buy carbon offsets when booking flights. Offsets have been critiqued for not effectively reducing the carbon footprints of wealthy people, while absolving guilt from continued consumption. A carbon-filled road aheadWith more digital technologies emerging, the environmental impacts of digital ecosystems are probably going to increase. Apart from the obvious social and economic impacts , artificial intelligence's (AI) environmental implications should be seriously considered. A paper published in June by University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers revealed training a large AI machine could produce five times as much carbon as what one car (including fuel) emits over a person's lifetime, on average. Also, this figure only relates to training a large AI machine. There are various other ways these machines suck energy.Similarly, bitcoin mining (an application of blockchain) continues to consume large amounts of energy, and is increasing on a global scale. According to the International Energy Agency , bitcoin mining uses more energy than some countries, including Austria and Colombia.Putting the 'eco' back in digital ecosystemThe digital ecosystem that supports our devices includes storage systems and networks that aren't in our homes or workplaces, such as 'the cloud'. But we should still take responsibility for the impact of such systems.Satellites are in space. Wires run beneath footpaths, roads and oceans. All the while, the Internet of Things is creeping into old technologies and transforming how we use them. These underground and distant aspects of digital ecosystems may partly explain why the growing environmental impacts of digital are sidelined. There are some ways people can find out more about responsible tech options. A 2017 guide by Greenpeace rated digital tech companies on their green credentials. It assessed a range of corporations, including some managing digital platforms, and others hosting data centres. But while the guide is useful, it's also limited by a lack of transparency, because corporations aren't obliged to share information on how much energy is needed or supplied for their data centres. Read more: High-tech consumerism, a global catastrophe happening on our watch Holding big tech accountableThe responsibility to make our digital lives more sustainable shouldn't lie solely with individuals. Governments should provide a regulatory environment that demands greater transparency on how digital corporations use energy. And holding these corporations accountable should include reporting on whether they are improving the sustainability of their practices.One immediate step could be for corporations that produce digital devices to move away from planned obsolescence. One example of this is when companies including Apple and Samsung manufacture smartphones that are not designed to last. Digital sustainability is a useful way to frame how digital technologies affect our environmental world. We need to acknowledge that technology isn't just a source of environmental solutions, but also has the potential for negative environmental impact. Only then can we start to effectively transition to a more sustainable future that also includes digital technologies.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Digital economy</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Carbon emissions</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Carbon footprint</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>electricity usage</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Sustainable Energy</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Digital Future</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>green power</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Sustainable living</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Digital era</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Digital devices</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>MENAFN1612201901990000ID1099431888</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1099431888</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS2-5041-JCNX-309G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1101\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The cashier-less shops, which first opened in Seattle in 2018, allow app-wielding customers to pick up items and simply walk out with them. The system uses many sensors, but the bulk of the magic is performed by cameras connected to an AI system that tracks items as they are taken from shelves. Once the shoppers leave with their goods, the bill is calculated and they are automatically charged. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Doing that in a crowded shop is not easy. The system must handle crowded stores, in which people disappear from view behind other customers. It must recognise individual customers as well as friends or family groups (if a child puts an item into a family basket, the system must realise that it should charge the parents). And it must do all that in real-time, and to a high degree of accuracy. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Teaching the machines required showing them a lot of \"training data\" in the form of videos of customers browsing shelves, picking up items, putting them back and the like. For standardised tasks like image recognition, AI developers can use public training datasets, each containing thousands of pictures. But there was no such training set featuring people browsing in shops. </p><p>Some data could be generated by Amazon's own staff, who were allowed into test versions of the shops. But that approach took the firm only so far. There are many ways in which a human might take a product from a shelf and then decide to choose it, put it back immediately or return it later. To work in the real world, the system would have to cover as many of those as possible.</p><p> In theory, the world is awash with data, the lifeblood of modern AI. IDC, a market-research firm, reckons the world generated 33 zettabytes of data in 2018, enough to fill seven trillion DVDs. But Kathleen Walch of Cognilytica, an AI-focused consultancy, says that, nevertheless, data issues are one of the most common sticking-points in any AI project. As in Amazon's case, the required data may not exist at all. Or they might be locked up in the vaults of a competitor. Even when relevant data can be dug up, they might not be suitable for feeding to computers. </p><p> Data-wrangling of various sorts takes up about 80% of the time consumed in a typical AI project, says Cognilytica. Training a machine-learning system requires large numbers of carefully labelled examples, and those labels usually have to be applied by humans. Big tech firms often do the work internally. Companies that lack the required resources or expertise can take advantage of a growing outsourcing industry to do it for them. A Chinese firm called MBH, for instance, employees more than 300,000 people to label endless pictures of faces, street scenes or medical scans so that they can be processed by machines. Mechanical Turk, another subdivision of Amazon, connects firms with an army of casual human workers who are paid a piece rate to perform repetitive tasks. </p><p>Cognilytica reckons that the third-party \"data preparation\" market was worth more than $1.5bn in 2019 and could grow to $3.5bn by 2024. The data-labelling business is similar, with firms spending at least $1.7bn in 2019, a number that could reach $4.1bn by 2024.  Mastery of a topic is not necessary, says Ron Schmelzer, also of Cognilytica. In medical diagnostics, for instance, amateur data-labellers can be trained to become almost as good as doctors at recognising things like fractures and tumours. But some amount of what AI researchers call \"domain expertise\" is vital.</p><p>The data themselves can contain traps. Machine-learning systems correlate inputs with outputs, but they do it blindly, with no understanding of broader context. In 1968 Donald Knuth, a programming guru, warned that computers \"do exactly what they are told, no more and no less\". Machine learning is full of examples of Mr Knuth's dictum, in which machines have followed the letter of the law precisely, while being oblivious to its spirit. </p><p>In 2018 researchers at Mount Sinai, a hospital network in New York, found that an AI system trained to spot pneumonia on chest x-rays became markedly less competent when used in hospitals other than those it had been trained in. The researchers discovered that the machine had been able to work out which hospital a scan had come from. (One way was to analyse small metal tokens placed in the corner of scans, which differ between hospitals.) </p><p>Since one hospital in its training set had a baseline rate of pneumonia far higher than the others, that information by itself was enough to boost the system's accuracy substantially. The researchers dubbed that clever wheeze \"cheating\", on the grounds that it failed when the system was presented with data from hospitals it did not know. </p><p>Bias is another source of problems. Last year America's National Institute of Standards and Technology tested nearly 200 facialrecognition algorithms and found that many were significantly less accurate at identifying black faces than white ones. The problem may reflect a preponderance of white faces in their training data. A study from IBM, published last year, found that over 80% of faces in three widely used training sets had light skin. </p><p>Such deficiencies are, at least in theory, straightforward to fix (IBM offered a more representative dataset for anyone to use). Other sources of bias can be trickier to remove. In 2017 Amazon abandoned a recruitment project designed to hunt through CVs to identify suitable candidates when the system was found to be favouring male applicants. The post mortem revealed a circular, self-reinforcing problem. The system had been trained on the CVs of previous successful applicants to the firm. But since the tech workforce is already mostly male, a system trained on historical data will latch onto maleness as a strong predictor of suitability.</p><p>Humans can try to forbid such inferences, says Fabrice Ciais, who runs PwC's machine-learning team in Britain (and Amazon tried to do exactly that). In many cases they are required to: in most rich countries employers cannot hire on the basis of factors such as sex, age or race. But algorithms can outsmart their human masters by using proxy variables to reconstruct the forbidden information, says Mr Ciais. Everything from hobbies to previous jobs to area codes in telephone numbers could contain hints that an applicant is likely to be female, or young, or from an ethnic minority.</p><p>If the difficulties of real-world data are too daunting, one option is to make up some data of your own. That is what Amazon did to fine-tune its Go shops. The company used graphics software to create virtual shoppers. Those ersatz humans were used to train the machines on many hard or unusual situations that had not arisen in the real training data, but might when the system was deployed in the real world. </p><p>Amazon is not alone. Self-driving car firms do a lot of training in high-fidelity simulations of reality, where no real damage can be done when something goes wrong. A paper in 2018 from Nvidia, a chipmaker, described a method for quickly creating synthetic training data for self-driving cars, and concluded that the resulting algorithms worked better than those trained on real data alone. </p><p>Privacy is another attraction of synthetic data. Firms hoping to use AI in medicine or finance must contend with laws such as America's Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. Properly anonymising data can be difficult, a problem that systems trained on made-up people do not need to bother about. </p><p>The trick, says Euan Cameron, one of Mr Ciais's colleagues, is ensuring simulations are close enough to reality that their lessons carry over. For some well-bounded problems such as fraud detection or credit scoring, that is straightforward. Synthetic data can be created by adding statistical noise to the real kind. Although individual transactions are therefore fictitious, it is possible to guarantee that they will have, collectively, the same statistical characteristics as the real data from which they were derived. But the more complicated a problem becomes, the harder it is to ensure that lessons from virtual data will translate smoothly to the real world.</p><p>The hope is that all this data-related faff will be a one-off, and that, once trained, a machine-learning model will repay the effort over millions of automated decisions. Amazon has opened 26 Go stores, and has offered to license the technology to other retailers. But even here there are reasons for caution. Many AI models are subject to \"drift\", in which changes in how the world works mean their decisions become less accurate over time, says Svetlana Sicular of Gartner, a research firm. Customer behaviour changes, language evolves, regulators change what companies can do. </p><p>Sometimes, drift happens overnight. \"Buying one-way airline tickets was a good predictor of fraud [in automated detection models],\" says Ms Sicular. \"And then with the covid-19 lockdowns, suddenly lots of innocent people were doing it.\" Some facial-recognition systems, used to seeing uncovered human faces, are struggling now that masks have become the norm. Automated logistics systems have needed help from humans to deal with the sudden demand for toilet roll, flour and other staples. The world's changeability means more training, which means providing the machines with yet more data, in a never-ending cycle of re-training. \"AI is not an install-and-forget system,\" warns Mr Cameron. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-PN8ETD6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603W-P8X1-JBKN-B01Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1595\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Whether it's his wealth, ownership of the dogged Washington Post, or sincere antitrust concerns that irk him, Trump hasn't hid his antipathy for the world's richest person, whether by tweet or in conversation.</p><p>According to TheStreet, Trump tweeted 26 broadsides against Amazon and Bezos (or, most recently, \"Jeff Bozo\") between December 2015 and January 2019, variously disparaging both for evading taxes and treating the U.S. Postal Service as its \"Delivery Boy.\"</p><p>In a March 2018 piece, Axios cited five sources who discussed Amazon with the president. \"He's obsessed with Amazon,\" one source told the news site, \"obsessed.\" Said another: \"He's wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law\" - sparked, the sources said, by conversations with wealthy real estate friends who claim Amazon is snuffing out shopping malls and physical retail.</p><p>The subject came up again the following month during a press gaggle aboard Air Force One:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporter:</emphasis> \"Are you going to actually take some action to change the law that would affect Amazon?\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump:</emphasis> \"Well, Amazon is just not on an even playing field. ... But we're going to see what happens. The playing field has to be level for everybody. That's very important.\"</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"p161\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporter:</emphasis> \"Would you like to make changes to make that level playing field?\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump:</emphasis> \"Well, I'm going to study it and we're going to take a look. We're going to take a very serious look at that. But I want, as long - hey, it's very important for me. It's got to be an even playing field for everybody.\"</p><p>Days later, Makan Delrahim, an assistant attorney general who heads the Justice Department's antitrust division, addressed a University of Chicago conference on the subject of antitrust enforcement in the digital era. \"As enforcers,\" he said, \"we should be open and receptive to empirical evidence that companies in digital markets may be engaging in predatory pricing or other exclusionary conduct to drive out competition and cause long-run harm to consumers.\"</p><p>Delrahim also cited a now renowned Yale Law Journal treatise, \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" written three years ago by then law student Lina Khan. In it, Khan argues that the traditional criteria for determining antitrust activity - price gouging - is antiquated in the era of technology platforms like Amazon, which is willing to sell goods at a loss while building infrastructure that can dominate wide swaths of the economy, including distribution and logistics.</p><p>Comparing Amazon's fulfillment network to the powerful railroad industry of the Gilded Age, Khan wrote that \"the thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon's rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor.\"</p><p>Currently an academic fellow at Columbia Law School, and before that the director of legal policy at the Open Markets Institute, Khan has since become a champion for tighter reins on the e-commerce giant. Last summer she joined the office of Federal Trade Commissioner Rohit Chopra as a legal fellow as the agency ramped up its oversight of tech companies, and in February the FTC went on to create a Technology Task Force under its Bureau of Competition.</p><p>\"Technology markets, which are rapidly evolving and touch so many other sectors of the economy, raise distinct challenges for antitrust enforcement,\" said Bureau director Bruce Hoffman. \"By centralizing our expertise and attention, the new task force will be able to focus on these markets exclusively.\"</p><p>As Trump told \"Axios on HBO\" in November, \"I leave it to others, but I do have a lot of people talking about monopoly when they mention those three [Google, Facebook and Amazon] in particular. ... We are looking at [antitrust] very seriously.\"</p><p>And though it's still early, an unbridled Amazon could also be a talking point, if not a legislative outcome, of the 2020 presidential race. As Massachusetts senator and Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren wrote last month on Medium, \"Amazon crushes small companies by copying the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own branded version.\" (See p. 30.)</p><p>Whether we see a slimmer, trimmer Amazon Light in the next decade, devoid of its reseller marketplace, grocery division or Cloud computing business, remains to be seen. But despite increased scrutiny from the left, the right and points in between, Bezos &amp; Co. have been in hot water before, and turned it into consomm\u00e9.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"p162\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TWICE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TWICE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSN-9YY1-JBPF-9187-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TWICE</publicationName><volume>Vol. XXXIV</volume><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The day before the summit, an opposition leader made a speech calling upon Asean to change its way and to drop what he believes are some principles that Asean has held, such as non-interference in the internal affairs of others and wanting Asean to place greater emphasis on human rights and democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The next day, there was quite a swift and strong reaction from the Foreign Ministry. The foreign minister himself, no less, said that the opposition leader did not understand what Asean was about, and that his ideas were dangerous because they could split and divide Asean and undo all the progress and achievements Asean had made over many decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> For me, this is a very important and valid debate and Asean really needs to think about how we operate in order to be able to meet the challenges that we face. Trying to review or even revise the way we do things is not to take away the achievements that Asean has made over half a century.</p><p> But we must recognise how the global and regional environments have evolved. Sometimes we forget that when Asean was founded, it was all about security, and the threat to security then was communism.</p><p> The founding members of Asean decided to get together to ensure that communism did not spread and that member states could then get on with their own development process. Asean succeeded and proceeded to integrate the rest of the countries within the region into the organisation.</p><p> As economic challenges came to the fore, Asean embarked upon the free trade area project, subsequently expanded to become an Asean Economic Community, as one of three pillars of the Asean Community. Again, we could argue that Asean has been successful and continues to be one of the fastest-growing regions in the world economically, a region that has been able to weather economic and financial crises well.</p><p> So it would be hard to deny Asean's achievements were not made possible by the way Asean had operated in a manner consistent with the culture in the region where we try to move things by consensus, and by not publicly shaming or condemning each other. Yet the two sides in the argument mentioned earlier are both partly right and partly wrong.</p><p> It is not true that there is a \"strict\" non-interference in internal affairs, because everybody knows that in a globalised setting it is impossible to ignore the impact beyond borders of any development within each member state. It's just that we don't do it the Western way or the European way.</p><p> There are always consultations. At the time when Myanmar was struggling with its roadmap to democracy, every Asean meeting had a discussion on the matter.</p><p> At the same time, though, it is timely to begin to ask whether this mode of operation will continue to serve us well to meet the major challenges of today. My own view is that the challenges of today demand so much more from all countries and from all regional groupings, Asean included.</p><p> Today's challenges are all intertwined and very complex. They require much more than technical knowledge to deal with them.</p><p> They require much more than having business-as-usual meetings of leaders and bureaucrats to affect changes that we want to see. The challenges of today demand strong political leadership and political will at both the national and Asean levels.</p><p> For instance, the issue of the South China Sea was the first that led to an Asean summit ending without an agreed joint statement. The issue will continue to be one of the major challenges the region faces with member states being claimants and non-claimants, but all having a stake in making sure that there is safe passage in the area.</p><p> We face the issue of economic competitiveness, but not in the same way that we did in the days where we pushed for free trade agreements. Competitiveness no longer revolves around tariffs and market access for goods.</p><p> It's more about creating internal and fundamental competitiveness through the quality of human resources, through the right set of rules and regulations, through the creation of an effective network or supply chain in order to be able to compete in the current economic environment. And while a few decades ago, Asean could probably boast that even within Asia we were one of the fastest-growing and biggest economies, now, with the rise of China and India, we see how the economic agenda is being dictated by these superpowers.</p><p> Ten years ago, Thailand began the Asean Connectivity Initiative, but within one or two years, it was all overshadowed by the One Belt One Road Initiative of China. Since then, we rarely see Asean approach this issue of connectivity as a group or as a block, but we see member states negotiating or trying to benefit from the One Belt One Road Initiative from China individually.</p><p> As for inequality, there continues to be a big economic gap between the member states. Fundamental structural reforms are needed to address this.</p><p> And the problem has an external dimension, often exacerbated by the way countries race to the bottom in terms of social protection and tax regimes to attract investment while the multinationals and big-tech corporations operating in the region often take advantage using their size and networks to entrench their dominance at the expense of the small traders, farmers and workers who feel disruption and hardship. The issue of climate change itself requires very strong political will and cooperation and no single country can solve this problem.</p><p> One key to success in meeting these challenges is to note that social enterprises, NGOs, local authorities and third sectors have in many places been far more effective than central governments. Asean must therefore engage these players in order to attain a sustainable community.</p><p> The political structure must be able to accommodate the participation and inclusiveness within the system, something Asean clearly does not have at present.  Ten years ago, we wanted to establish an Asean human rights commission.</p><p> We were partly successful because we did set up a commission. But can anyone recall the work of this commission over the last decade when we have had global criticism on a number of issues, from the Rohingya crisis to extrajudicial killings? Secondly, we initiated the practice that at Asean Summit meetings, civil society leaders, representatives from Asean youth and parliamentarians can meet with Asean leaders.</p><p> This was subsequently dropped. So basically, there is clearly a democracy deficit within Asean.</p><p> This means that we have to address this deficit at two levels. At the regional level, the organisation needs to allow more participation from representatives of the people in each country.</p><p> At the national level, questions will continue to be asked whether it is possible to reflect the will of the people of a member state at the Asean level if there is no good system of representation within that country. While not advocating for interference in internal politics, Asean needs to recognise that this is a problem and some standards would have to be set in terms of representation, engagement and participation in member states if it has the ambition to establish a true community.</p><p> The Asean way needs to adapt to allow for this increased participation and engagement. Economic and social inclusiveness will not happen if you do not have political inclusiveness.</p><p> This is Asean's biggest challenge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG16082019038284</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVW-W4H1-F00C-63NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1251\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 16, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928120MM</classCode><className>STATE DEPARTMENTS &amp; FOREIGN SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001739</classCode><className>TRADE TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode><className>Trade Agreements</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000873</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYzQjQyOTBDNzNDNEI2QUIyOTE2MEYyMTdBQTlDMzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQ</classCode><className>Human Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000951</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GX323</classCode><className>BANGKOK, THAILAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC313</classCode><className>THAILAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR138</classCode><className>SOUTH-EASTERN ASIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

But also relief after six years of covering Wall Street, an industry that had moved from one crisis to another after the financial crash of 2008, drawing the unending wrath of the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In California I was joining a growing team of reporters covering Silicon Valley, which had quickly become the new engine of the economy. Just like Wall Street before it lost its luster, the tech industry had become the destination of choice for the top college graduates. I would be writing about a place where everyone was focused more on the future than on the past.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, just two years after getting here, and a decade after the start of the financial crisis, I have a creeping sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I go about my job.</p><p>Admiration of the tech world has, in the wake of a growing list of scandals, quickly soured into an intense suspicion that manages to cross partisan lines, similar to what Wall Street faced after 2008.</p><p>As I have watched the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/technology/jack-dorsey-sheryl-sandberg-congress-hearings.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">recent parade of tech executives</url> being grilled by Washington lawmakers from across the political spectrum, it has been eerily reminiscent of the combative hearings the big banks faced back in 2009 and 2010.</p><p>As was true after the financial crisis, the backlash against tech rises out of a public awakening to the integral role that these huge companies occupy in our society \u2014 with Facebook, Uber and Twitter playing the part that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chasedid a decade ago.</p><p>\u201cPeople talk about bankers being amoral,\u201d said Charlie Beckett, the director of the Truth, Trust and Technology Commission at the London School of Economics. \u201cThey are starting to talk about tech people in similar language. Where before they were kind of heroes \u2014 they were people who brought us these wonderful products \u2014 they are now starting to be blamed for the ills of the world.\u201d</p><p>It often feels as though these companies took on their pivotal positions so quickly that no one \u2014 not even their employees \u2014 had a chance to understand how they really worked or how much influence they had.</p><p>Ana Bot\u00edn, a longtime executive at the giant Spanish bank Santander, recently wrote on LinkedIn that the tech companies were losing the same basic thing that banks lost in 2008: the public\u2019s trust.</p><p>\u201cSome in big tech are beginning to accept what we in banking learned some years ago: We don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d Ms. Bot\u00edn told me last week.</p><p>The storm that Ms. Bot\u00edn and other bank executives faced after 2008 and the one we are witnessing now are obviously different.</p><p>The crisis precipitated by the banks was a financial one that caused markets to crash, and threatened to bring down the global economy.</p><p>The crisis involving the internet giants is not hitting our pocketbooks \u2014 it is straining our confidence in what we know about the world. If Russian hackers can create and amplify fake news stories across the many sites we have come to rely on, where can we go for reliable information?</p><p>In public surveys, like the Harris Poll Reputation Quotient, the tech giants are still polling well ahead of Goldman and Wells Fargo, and some, like Amazon and Apple, seem to be mostly flying above the fray.</p><p>But the <url normalizedValue=\"https://cms.edelman.com/sites/default/files/2018-01/2018%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20Global%20Report.pdf\">Edelman Trust Barometer</url> found that the public\u2019s confidence in search engines and social media platforms fell 11 percentage points from 2017 and 2018. They face more skepticism than even we, the perennially unpopular journalists.</p><p>I can see this change in the companies themselves, which are on the defensive with the public and press, and in at least some young employees and recruits, who are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/silicon-valley-tech-companies-recruiting-protests-ethical\">beginning to wonder</url> if taking a job at Google or Facebook might come with just as many problems as working at Goldman Sachs.</p><p>The exact ills that people assign to the industry tend to differ based on their politics. While people on the right, including President Trump, have expressed the most concern about political bias and censorship, the left has worried more about the way the companies opened the door to election interference and have exacerbated income inequality. But nearly everyone is voicing unease about the way our children have been turned into digital addicts.</p><p>The broad shift in perception is inevitably piling more blame onto the shoulders of one industry than it should bear. Like the mortgage meltdown, our current crisis of confidence is the result of factors that go beyond any one player in the drama \u2014 from the polarization of the media landscape to the growing economic inequality that has led to distrust of elites of all sorts.</p><p>Whatever the reality, political momentum is building behind some sort of broader regulatory response, similar to what came together in the Dodd-Frank financial regulations. The current push has begun with talk of legislation that would protect our privacy \u2014 but much bolder steps are being considered.</p><p>What I wonder now is whether any regulatory response will follow a similar path to what came after the financial crisis.</p><p>A long list of new laws in the United States and Europe did seem to make the banks safer and another crisis less likely.</p><p>But the regulations also appear to have cemented the status of the biggest banks in our economy. The largest financial institutions now control a bigger proportion of the industry\u2019s assets than they did before the crisis. These big banks are regulated as if they were more like utilities, but the high regulatory costs provide a kind of barrier against most competitors.</p><p>It is easy to imagine something similar happening in the technology industry, and European authorities have already taken some steps in that direction.</p><p>If tech companies are forced to be more responsible for the content on their platforms, they will most likely need to build a significant apparatus for compliance. That would cut into profitability. It would also make it very hard for upstarts to challenge them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an increasingly loud call for the platforms to get involved in content moderation,\u201d said Cory Doctorow, a special adviser with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s well intentioned, but the outcome of that is very likely to be pretty disastrous.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Doctorow has been part of a growing chorus of people calling for antitrust actions to break up the biggest companies, rather than tweaking their operations.</p><p>Whatever steps the government takes, they are unlikely to help recover the trust that has already been lost. As I know from those years of covering the banks, confidence, once gone, is not easily regained.</p><p>As for me, the familiar problems have not allowed for the change of pace I was expecting. And in truth, the subways out here are no better. But the weather is still very nice.</p><p>Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper. </p><p>PHOTO: A display at Facebook\u2019s developer conference this year. &amp;amp;ldquo;Some in big tech are beginning to accept what we in banking learned some years ago: We don\u2019t have all the answers,&amp;amp;rdquo; said Ana Bot&amp;amp;iacute;n, an executive at the Spanish bank Santander.

But also relief after six years of covering Wall Street, an industry that had moved from one crisis to another after the financial crash of 2008, drawing the unending wrath of the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In California I was joining a growing team of reporters covering Silicon Valley, which had quickly become the new engine of the economy. Just like Wall Street before it lost its luster, the tech industry had become the destination of choice for the top college graduates. I would be writing about a place where everyone was focused more on the future than on the past.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, just two years after getting here, and a decade after the start of the financial crisis, I have a creeping sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I go about my job.</p><p>Admiration of the tech world has, in the wake of a growing list of scandals, quickly soured into an intense suspicion that manages to cross partisan lines, similar to what Wall Street faced after 2008.</p><p>As I have watched the recent parade of tech executives being grilled by Washington lawmakers from across the political spectrum, it has been eerily reminiscent of the combative hearings the big banks faced back in 2009 and 2010.</p><p>As was true after the financial crisis, the backlash against tech rises out of a public awakening to the integral role that these huge companies occupy in our society - with Facebook, Uber and Twitter playing the part that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase did a decade ago.</p><p>\"People talk about bankers being amoral,\" said Charlie Beckett, the director of the Truth, Trust and Technology Commission at the London School of Economics. \"They are starting to talk about tech people in similar language. Where before they were kind of heroes - they were people who brought us these wonderful products - they are now starting to be blamed for the ills of the world.\"</p><p>It often feels as though these companies took on their pivotal positions so quickly that no one - not even their employees - had a chance to understand how they really worked or how much influence they had.</p><p>Ana Bot\u00edn, a longtime executive at the giant Spanish bank Santander, recently wrote on LinkedIn that the tech companies were losing the same basic thing that banks lost in 2008: the public's trust.</p><p>\"Some in big tech are beginning to accept what we in banking learned some years ago: We don't have all the answers,\" Ms. Bot\u00edn told me last week.</p><p>The storm that Ms. Bot\u00edn and other bank executives faced after 2008 and the one we are witnessing now are obviously different.</p><p>The crisis precipitated by the banks was a financial one that caused markets to crash, and threatened to bring down the global economy.</p><p>The crisis involving the internet giants is not hitting our pocketbooks - it is straining our confidence in what we know about the world. If Russian hackers can create and amplify fake news stories across the many sites we have come to rely on, where can we go for reliable information?</p><p>In public surveys, like the Harris Poll Reputation Quotient, the tech giants are still polling well ahead of Goldman and Wells Fargo, and some, like Amazon and Apple, seem to be mostly flying above the fray.</p><p>But the Edelman Trust Barometer found that the public's confidence in search engines and social media platforms fell 11 percentage points from 2017 and 2018. They face more skepticism than even we, the perennially unpopular journalists.</p><p>I can see this change in the companies themselves, which are on the defensive with the public and press, and in at least some young employees and recruits, who are beginning to wonder if taking a job at Google or Facebook might come with just as many problems as working at Goldman Sachs.</p><p>The exact ills that people assign to the industry tend to differ based on their politics. While people on the right, including President Trump, have expressed the most concern about political bias and censorship, the left has worried more about the way the companies opened the door to election interference and have exacerbated income inequality. But nearly everyone is voicing unease about the way our children have been turned into digital addicts.</p><p>The broad shift in perception is inevitably piling more blame onto the shoulders of one industry than it should bear. Like the mortgage meltdown, our current crisis of confidence is the result of factors that go beyond any one player in the drama - from the polarization of the media landscape to the growing economic inequality that has led to distrust of elites of all sorts.</p><p>Whatever the reality, political momentum is building behind some sort of broader regulatory response, similar to what came together in the Dodd-Frank financial regulations. The current push has begun with talk of legislation that would protect our privacy - but much bolder steps are being considered.</p><p>What I wonder now is whether any regulatory response will follow a similar path to what came after the financial crisis.</p><p>A long list of new laws in the United States and Europe did seem to make the banks safer and another crisis less likely.</p><p>But the regulations also appear to have cemented the status of the biggest banks in our economy. The largest financial institutions now control a bigger proportion of the industry's assets than they did before the crisis. These big banks are regulated as if they were more like utilities, but the high regulatory costs provide a kind of barrier against most competitors.</p><p>It is easy to imagine something similar happening in the technology industry, and European authorities have already taken some steps in that direction.</p><p>If tech companies are forced to be more responsible for the content on their platforms, they will most likely need to build a significant apparatus for compliance. That would cut into profitability. It would also make it very hard for upstarts to challenge them.</p><p>\"There's an increasingly loud call for the platforms to get involved in content moderation,\" said Cory Doctorow, a special adviser with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"It's well intentioned, but the outcome of that is very likely to be pretty disastrous.\"</p><p>Mr. Doctorow has been part of a growing chorus of people calling for antitrust actions to break up the biggest companies, rather than tweaking their operations.</p><p>Whatever steps the government takes, they are unlikely to help recover the trust that has already been lost. As I know from those years of covering the banks, confidence, once gone, is not easily regained.</p><p>As for me, the familiar problems have not allowed for the change of pace I was expecting. And in truth, the subways out here are no better. But the weather is still very nice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Interested in All Things Tech? </emphasis> Get the Bits newsletter delivered to your inbox weekly for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006080817</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7D-8D11-JC85-N46K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1181\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd. is said to be offering to sell a stake of about $20 billion in its retail business to Amazon. com Inc., Bloomberg News reported this week. If Ambani succeeds in pulling off such a deal, it would mark another victory for the billionaire, who in recent months has secured $20 billion of investment in his digital unit from marquee names including Facebook Inc. and Google Inc.    The mere possibility of an Amazon investment reveals not only Ambani\u2019s market clout, but also how India\u2019s business climate is changing as Prime Minister Narendra Modi cranks up nationalist rhetoric while the nation hurtles toward the first annual economic contraction in 40 years. Having seen multiple regulatory roadblocks thrown in their way, a tie-up with a powerful Indian ally has never looked more crucial for the world\u2019s biggest internet companies. And no business person carries more heft in India \u2014 known for its complicated bureaucracy and red tape \u2014 than Ambani.     Better to Cooperate    \u201cI suspect the government somewhere is signalling that it\u2019s better for multinational companies to come in with some Indian partner,\u201d said Arun Kumar, an economist and the Malcolm Adiseshiah Chair at the Institute of Social Sciences. \u201cSo Amazon might decide it\u2019s better to cooperate with Reliance than compete against it.\u201d    The 63-year-old Indian tycoon has identified technology and retail as future growth areas in a pivot away from the energy businesses he inherited from his father who died in 2002. Retail is the next frontier for Ambani, whose ambitions include creating a home-grown e-commerce giant like China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.    ALSO READ: Mukesh Ambani's $2 chutzpah unlocks another fortune for Reliance Industries    Silicon Valley\u2019s ambitions in the country represent a threat to Ambani\u2019s ability to achieve such dominance in his home market, but winning their cooperation, with all the know-how and global reach it brings, could help him achieve it faster. That aligns with the emphasis Modi has been placing on developing India\u2019s local economy.     \u2018Life\u2019s Mantra\u2019    In one 33-minute address to the nation recently, Modi used the word \u2018self-reliance\u2019 17 times. \u201cThe corona crisis has taught us the value of local manufacturing, local markets and local supply chains,\u201d Modi went on to say. \u201cLocal is not only our need it is also our responsibility. Time has taught us that we will simply have to make \u2018local\u2019 our life\u2019s mantra.\u201d    Even so, India is increasingly important to Silicon Valley because it\u2019s a one billion-plus person market that\u2019s still largely untapped. China is dominated by homegrown e-commerce players and largely shuts out global tech companies, while established markets in the West offer limited growth opportunities.    Though Amazon is already India\u2019s largest e-commerce player, it\u2019s ability to compete with domestic firms was hamstrung by an abrupt rule change in 2018 that limited foreign players to operating as e-Bay style marketplaces, rather than selling their own stock.         ALSO READ: Can Reliance Industries' stock hit Rs 3,000 mark? Here's what charts say     Entering E-Commerce    Not long after, Ambani announced that his own sprawling conglomerate, Reliance Industries, would make an entry into e-commerce, leveraging its control of both India\u2019s largest mobile carrier and biggest network of brick-and-mortar stores.    In response, Amazon tried to bolster its presence on the ground with an investment in India\u2019s second biggest physical retailer, cash-strapped Future Group. But the rules restricting foreign ownership in that sector meant its investment was too little to halt Future Group\u2019s slide into financial distress.    Last month, it was Ambani who was waiting to snap up the majority of the company\u2019s operations for $3.4 billion. Faced with a regulatory disadvantage and a competitor only seeming to grow stronger, it\u2019s not hard to see why Amazon might be tempted to make a peace offering now.    \u201cReliance has brick and mortar, logistics, warehousing, and now online build out with its recent deals,\u201d said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management in Mumbai. \u201cIt will take years of operational infrastructure for Amazon or other multinational companies to recreate that, and hence Reliance Industries is the preferred partner choice for their entry into India.\u201d     Regulatory Limbo     Facebook may have made a similar calculation. Its plans to turn its wildly popular WhatsApp messaging platform into a nationwide payments system have been stuck in Indian regulatory limbo for more than two years now.    Meanwhile, Reliance is pushing ahead with its own payment system, with its almost 400 million mobile subscribers as a built-in user base. But since their deal, Facebook and Reliance have announced that WhatsApp will at least be the main platform for Ambani\u2019s online grocery store, his flagship e-commerce offering, ensuring the social networking giant has a toehold in the Indian e-commerce market it covets.    Google, meanwhile, has announced plans to roll out a low-cost phone with Ambani which will run on its Android operating system. Previously Ambani had been selling his own low cost phones, which ran on a different operating system. Google, like Facebook, may have decided it was better to work with Ambani than against him. Amazon may wind up doing the same.    \u201cBusiness in India is taking the monopolistic approach,\u201d said Mathew Antony, managing partner of Aditya Consulting, a boutique legal advisory firm in Mumbai. \u201dIt is increasingly becoming evident with the Facebook and similar investment deals that the large foreign business investments into the country is by default having a first right of refusal at the Reliance doors.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

For each, there's some clear strategic value in owning a company estimated to control about 20% of the global NAND market. But there are potential pitfalls as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/k/aap/_tscnav/index.html\">Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio</url></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

Soon afterwards, fellow Japanese publication       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/economy/20170331-OYT1T50043.html\">Yomiuri Shimbun reported</url> that Apple is also interested in the business, albeit without stating an offer had been made.</p><p>Apple had already been mentioned in passing in a prior Toshibareport. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Western Digital  </emphasis>, whose SanDisk unit runs a large flash-manufacturing JV with Toshiba, has also been mentioned in rumors over the last two months. Other names thrown around include DRAM/NAND makers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Micron  </emphasis>and SK Hynix, P-E firm Bain Capital and contract manufacturer Foxconn and foundry giant <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Taiwan Semiconductor  </emphasis>.</p><p>One note of caution here: In high-profile asset sales, sellers and/or the bankers working for them might exaggerate a party's interest in the asset via media \"leaks\", in hopes of getting other suitors to up their bids. Whether or not there's exaggeration in this case, it's worth keeping in mind that both of the latest sale reports come from Toshiba's home country.</p><p>At the same time, it does look as if national security fears give U.S. bidders an edge over the likes of Hynix, Foxconn and TSMC. In line with a prior <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-accounting-exclusive-idUSKBN16H1C1\">Reuters report</url> , the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nikkei</emphasis> says Japanese regulators would \"apparently\" prefer that Toshibasell its flash unit to an American buyer, assuming it's sold to a foreign party.</p><p>For Apple, a purchase would allow it to source chips that it spends many billions of dollars on each year for use within iPhones, iPads and Macs at cost, and also guarantee stable supplies for them. Apple's voracious NAND appetite in the months just before and after a new iPhone launch has often led to NAND shortages. Last year,  -- and Apple's memory spending sharply rose -- thanks to the fact iPhone storage capacities were doubled across price tiers.</p><p>With the current contract price for a 16GB (128Gb) flash chip around $4.75, Apple might be paying close to $35 for the flash that goes into a 128GB iPhone or iPad even if one assumes it gets a discount relative to standard contract prices. The company sold 215 million iPhones and 43 million iPads last year. Lowering flash expenses by, say, $8 to $10 per device would clearly go a long way.</p><p>Moreover, Apple could finance a Toshiba deal with a small fraction of the $230 billion in offshore cash it had at the end of December. The past six months have already seen Qualcomm and Intel announce $10 billion-plus deals financed in large part via offshore cash.</p><p>In Broadcom's case, acquiring Toshiba's flash unit would further extend the company's efforts to become an indispensable supplier of chips and hardware to server/storage OEMs and cloud giants. Among other things, Broadcom's data center lineup includes Ethernet transceivers and switching chips, optical components, and networking and storage adapter cards and controllers. And thanks to its pending $5.9 billion acquisition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brocade Communications  </emphasis>, it will soon be a major storage switch provider.</p><p>A Toshiba deal would position Broadcom to add solid-state drives (SSDs) to its lineup at a time when SSDs are rapidly taking data center share from hard drives, and also steadily making headway in the PC market. And in the smartphone/tablet space, where Broadcom is a major supplier of RF and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity chips, it could cross-sell NAND flash to major OEMs while offering discounts to those that buy multiple Broadcom products.</p><p>Moreover, considering the success it has had at managing several large acquisitions, including the massive Avago-Broadcom deal, it's hard to doubt Broadcom's ability to reap cost synergies from a purchase and improve Toshiba's margin profile in a competitive NAND market.</p><p>On the other hand, even with Silver Lake footing part of the bill, a purchase would add to a Broadcom net debt balance that stood at $10.5 billion as of January, and is about to get larger due to the Brocade deal. It would also significantly increase the capital spending needs of a company that spent only $723 million on capex during its last fiscal year.</p><p>Apple, meanwhile, would have to deal with the thorny question of what would happen to Toshiba's flash sales to companies not named Apple. Many of these firms are Apple rivals and could be wary of buying from the company, and even if they aren't, Apple hasn't historically been keen on selling components to third parties. The company's massive flash usage could ultimately make this moot, but to make a Toshiba deal pay off, it would certainly face some pressure to offset lost third-party flash demand with its own.</p><p>And for both Apple and Broadcom, a pending surge in global NAND production capacity, stemming from large investments in fabs that can produce cheap/dense 3D NAND flash, is a pricing/margin risk. And though NAND is seen as a commodity, there's also a measure of technology risk for both companies, given the investments Samsung, Intel and Micron have made to develop flash chips differentiated in terms of performance and/or price.</p><p>Overall, a Toshiba deal would be much easier for Apple to digest than Broadcom, and would likely please investors who have been waiting for the company to put some of its offshore cash to good use rather than just wait for a tax holiday.

Memory rivals stand side-by-side with tech giants, private equity firms and chipmakers operating in complementary fields.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple  \u00a0</emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broadcom  </emphasis>, two companies mentioned in the most recent Toshiba rumors, certainly fit into the \"eyebrow-raising\" category. For each, there's some clear strategic value in owning a company estimated to control about 20% of the global NAND market. But there are potential pitfalls as well.</p><p>On Thursday, <url normalizedValue=\"http://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Toshiba-in-Turmoil/Tricky-path-ahead-for-Toshiba-on-chip-sale\">Japan's Nikkei reported</url> acquisition-hungry Broadcom had teamed with private equity firm Silver Lake to offer $17.9 billion for Toshiba's flash unit, a figure moderately higher than the ones thrown around in many sale estimates. Soon afterwards, fellow Japanese publication       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/economy/20170331-OYT1T50043.html\">Yomiuri Shimbun reported</url> that Apple is also interested in the business, albeit without stating an offer had been made.</p><p>Apple had already been mentioned in passing in a prior Toshiba report. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Western Digital  </emphasis>, whose SanDisk unit runs a large flash-manufacturing JV with Toshiba, has also been mentioned in rumors over the last two months. Other names thrown around include DRAM/NAND makers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Micron  \u00a0</emphasis>and SK Hynix, P-E firm Bain Capital and contract manufacturer Foxconn and foundry giant <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Taiwan Semiconductor  </emphasis>.</p><p>One note of caution here: In high-profile asset sales, sellers and/or the bankers working for them might exaggerate a party's interest in the asset via media \"leaks\", in hopes of getting other suitors to up their bids. Whether or not there's exaggeration in this case, it's worth keeping in mind that both of the latest sale reports come from Toshiba's home country.</p><p>At the same time, it does look as if national security fears give U.S. bidders an edge over the likes of Hynix, Foxconn and TSMC. In line with a prior <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-accounting-exclusive-idUSKBN16H1C1\">Reuters report</url> , the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nikkei</emphasis> says Japanese regulators would \"apparently\" prefer that Toshiba sell its flash unit to an American buyer, assuming it's sold to a foreign party.</p><p>For Apple, a purchase would allow it to source chips that it spends many billions of dollars on each year for use within iPhones, iPads and Macs at cost, and also guarantee stable supplies for them. Apple's voracious NAND appetite in the months just before and after a new iPhone launch has often led to NAND shortages. Last year,  -- and Apple's memory spending sharply rose -- thanks to the fact iPhone storage capacities were doubled across price tiers.</p><p>With the current contract price for a 16GB (128Gb) flash chip around $4.75, Apple might be paying close to $35 for the flash that goes into a 128GB iPhone or iPad even if one assumes it gets a discount relative to standard contract prices. The company sold 215 million iPhones and 43 million iPads last year. Lowering flash expenses by, say, $8 to $10 per device would clearly go a long way.</p><p>Moreover, Apple could finance a Toshiba deal with a small fraction of the $230 billion in offshore cash it had at the end of December. The past six months have already seen Qualcomm and Intel announce $10 billion-plus deals financed in large part via offshore cash.</p><p>In Broadcom's case, acquiring Toshiba's flash unit would further extend the company's efforts to become an indispensable supplier of chips and hardware to server/storage OEMs and cloud giants. Among other things, Broadcom's data center lineup includes Ethernet transceivers and switching chips, optical components, and networking and storage adapter cards and controllers. And thanks to its pending $5.9 billion acquisition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brocade Communications  </emphasis>, it will soon be a major storage switch provider.</p><p>A Toshiba deal would position Broadcom to add solid-state drives (SSDs) to its lineup at a time when SSDs are rapidly taking data center share from hard drives, and also steadily making headway in the PC market. And in the smartphone/tablet space, where Broadcom is a major supplier of RF and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity chips, it could cross-sell NAND flash to major OEMs while offering discounts to those that buy multiple Broadcom products.</p><p>Moreover, considering the success it has had at managing several large acquisitions, including the massive Avago-Broadcom deal, it's hard to doubt Broadcom's ability to reap cost synergies from a purchase and improve Toshiba's margin profile in a competitive NAND market.</p><p>On the other hand, even with Silver Lake footing part of the bill, a purchase would add to a Broadcom net debt balance that stood at $10.5 billion as of January, and is about to get larger due to the Brocade deal. It would also significantly increase the capital spending needs of a company that spent only $723 million on capex during its last fiscal year.</p><p>Apple, meanwhile, would have to deal with the thorny question of what would happen to Toshiba's flash sales to companies not named Apple. Many of these firms are Apple rivals and could be wary of buying from the company, and even if they aren't, Apple hasn't historically been keen on selling components to third parties. The company's massive flash usage could ultimately make this moot, but to make a Toshiba deal pay off, it would certainly face some pressure to offset lost third-party flash demand with its own.</p><p>And for both Apple and Broadcom, a pending surge in global NAND production capacity, stemming from large investments in fabs that can produce cheap/dense 3D NAND flash, is a pricing/margin risk. And though NAND is seen as a commodity, there's also a measure of technology risk for both companies, given the investments Samsung, Intel and Micron have made to develop flash chips differentiated in terms of performance and/or price.</p><p>Overall, a Toshiba deal would be much easier for Apple to digest than Broadcom, and would likely please investors who have been waiting for the company to put some of its offshore cash to good use rather than just wait for a tax holiday. At the same time, a deal would be more in line with Broadcom's M&amp;A history than Apple's.</p><p>Toshiba reportedly hopes to decide on a winning bidder prior to a late-June shareholder meeting. Given their incentives for bidding, odds are good that Apple and Broadcom's will appear again in the rumor mill before then.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCSRM-14068444</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCSRM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N74-GFB1-JCHV-V3RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1063\"/><timeReceived>8:43 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc.
