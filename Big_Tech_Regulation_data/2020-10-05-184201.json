Get down!  Get down! (UNINTELLIGIBLE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARRAF: Now that was just an indication that it still feels a lot like war here. We're here at a U.S. Army base in Najaf, sandbags behind us. And what those sandbags are for, it's a bunker.  And you're supposed to dive in it when there's rocket-propelled grenade or mortar attacks, as there are almost every night and almost every morning here.</p><p>Now this place is full of U.S. troops who believed that they would be home by now. They all have vacation plans, they all had sweethearts, or wives or husbands waiting for them. Instead, they have been redeployed from Baghdad and they are here.  And they're here to show a presence and diffuse a threat from a radical Shia leader -- a young radical Shia leader, who has seized control of the holy city. His militia is in charge of Najaf and Kufa.</p><p>The soldiers are here, frustrated. There's not a lot they can do when they go out and get shot at, because this is a very sensitive place and they're very aware of that.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Jane, please tell us what it's like there. I know it must be an extraordinary experience, but we know from the month of April that this has been really the bloodiest month since the very beginning. More than 130 Americans killed in Iraq, but 10 times the number of Iraqis who have killed in that past month.</p><p>What are you seeing?</p><p>ARRAF: Well, certainly this all changed dramatically about three weeks ago. Now up until then, things seemed to be getting steadily better, steadily improving, for Iraqis, for the U.S. troops.</p><p>And now it's like a different Iraq, in places like Fallujah and in places -- here in Najaf, they are suddenly facing something that really does look very much like war all over again.</p><p>The trigger for this in this part of the country, in the Shia south, was the Shia leader seizing control of these holy cities as well as part of Baghdad. And that was triggered by the arrest of one of his deputies.</p><p>It's an immensely complicated situation here, which is by the U.S. is treading so carefully.</p><p>WALLACE: And Jane, talk to us a little bit about the frustration you're encountering from some of the U.S. Soldiers. They are in a standoff, as you say, there in Najaf and also in Fallujah. How frustrating for them to sort of be in this situation right now.</p><p>ARRAF: Intensely and particularly frustrating for the soldiers here. They're from the 1st Armored Division, most of them. And they had done their year of service, some of them more than a year. Some of them were actually on their way back to the states or Germany when they were told they had to stay.</p><p>Now they seem to all realize why they have to stay, they have a clear enemy they're fighting. But doesn't make it a whole lot easier. In some cases they went from places they knew in Baghdad, staying in palaces, to here basically in the middle of the desert.</p><p>And I don't know if you can hear the salsa music behind me. This used to be a Spanish camp. The Spanish pulled out, left some of their music. But U.S. troops are filling in the gaps here left by the Spanish and other coalition members. It is a whole different ball game.</p><p>HAYS: Jane, this week on \"THE FLIP SIDE\" CNNfn, I interviewed a man, Michael Percio (ph), who traveled\u2026</p><p>ARRAF: I'm afraid that whishing noise means that we may have lost audio on the satellite link.</p><p>HAYS: Well shall we -- let's see if -- we'll give Jane a second to see if she regains her audio or not. We hope she does, because we always love hearing from Jane Arraf. I think maybe we have lost audio, so we will -- OK. Yes.</p><p>You know, I was going to actually ask Jane Arraf about a poll that was out this week, mirrored in this interview we did this man who said he found in Iraq when he was there in December visiting his son in Fallujah, how the Iraqis were so frustrated -- a poll this week showing that the Iraqis themselves are very frustrated.</p><p>I think we've got Jane back.</p><p>ARRAF: ...go into Najaf, for it -- to take care of security that. That would mean that the militia would have to disband, a tall order there. Unclear whether that will happen, but everyone is working towards a political solution and working at getting people back to work, one of the reasons why Muqtada al-Sadr is believed to have such a following of unemployed young men.</p><p>HAYS: Jane, can I repeat this question? The poll out from Iraqis this week, a poll done where Iraqis are showing their mistrust of the United States, considering the troops occupiers. Glad that the U.S. ousted Saddam Hussein, but showing in this survey that they really want to see the power handed over and the United States going home as soon as possible, it seems.</p><p>And of course, we're showing the results of that poll on our screen, the opinion of Iraqis of U.S. Troops in their countries.</p><p>So, Suzanne, what do you -- what do you think in terms of the polls in the United States? Because it does seem that that's one big place where the president has lost ground, people less approving of his handling of the war in Iraq.</p><p>MALVEAUX: And the one thing that's certain is that they want, as soon as possible, to transfer power. You talk about this plan, June 30. Well, Brahimi's plan, the U.N. special envoy -- his plan is even calling for escalating, even sooner than that. He's talking about by the end of May, let's have these members, whoever is going govern Iraq at the time, let's get them together and let's make sure they know and understand the relationship with U.S. military because that, of course, really is the big question here: what is going to happen afterwards?</p><p>We know there's going to be a very strong U.S. military presence, but what is going to be to be their relationship with the Iraqi people?</p><p>HAYS: That's a very important question. And, of course, thank Jane Arraf. We apologize for the technical difficulties. It's just like that when someone is in a war zone, I guess.</p><p>We're going to continue talking about the war when ON THE STORY continues after this break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Suzanne Malveaux is a CNN White House correspondent. Earlier, she reported for NBC for six years, covering the Pentagon and the Clinton administration.  She has degrees from Harvard and Columbia.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A year ago, I did give the speech from the carrier, saying that we had achieved an important objective, that we accomplished a mission, which was the removal of Saddam Hussein. And as a result, there are no longer torture chambers or rape rooms or mass graves in Iraq.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) MALVEAUX: President Bush, of course, taking a different approach than he did one year ago today, when standing on the air aircraft carrier under the \"Mission Accomplished\" banner saying major combat had ended.</p><p>Welcome back, we are on that story.</p><p>HAYS: Boy, is the White House wishing that banner had never been up?  \"Mission Accomplished,\" when now April, the worst month\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALVEAUX: It is something the White House regrets. And we have heard from the president's top political adviser, Karl Rove, who has said publicly in an interview that they do regret that that \"Mission Accomplished\" banner was up in the background because, of course, when you look at the images that were created one year ago today, it was really extraordinary. It took a lot of planning, it was really kind of an extraordinary photo op for the president, for the administration. But they -- but they say, Look, you know, this is something that has been -- it's come as a symbol and it has been blown out of proportion because what the president did say is that Yes, it was this mission that was accomplished, Saddam Hussein had been removed.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAYS: Do we really think they did think the mission was accomplished though?  Is that it too?  Do we think they really believed it?</p><p>MALVEAUX: It was specifically regarding that unit that had come home. They felt that Saddam Hussein -- you know, the regime, essentially, had been destroyed. And they felt that that was the mission that had been accomplished.</p><p>The president also says, however, in that speech -- and this was something that they debated about before he actually made that speech -- is that yes, there are still going to be tough times ahead. And that is something that in some ways has gotten lost in the debate and the discussion.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ARENA: and images, though, Suzanne.  I mean, I want to move over to the pictures of soldiers allegedly abusing Iraqi prisoners.</p><p>I mean, that is a real punch in the eye to this Bush administration.</p><p>MALVEAUX: And this administration, the White House, there are advisers, there are people who truly believe that they are losing the public relations war.</p><p>We are seeing these pictures, \"60 Minutes II\", extraordinary pictures of -- allegedly the U.S. soldiers abusing these Iraqi prisoners. And this is something that the whole world is seeing now, including those in the Arab region. And it is unbelievable, because you have the president, the Pentagon, the coalition, all of these people saying, Look, we're disgusted. This is not acceptable.  It does not represent Americans.</p><p>But on the other hand, they all know that the job they have now is extraordinarily difficult and no matter what they say, it is going to take a lot of campaigning and information network to get out the message that this is not what America is about. This is not what the Americans are doing as a whole.</p><p>WALLACE: Pick up on that, Suzanne, what is the strategy? Because as you said, the administration already had a huge task when it came -- comes to winning over the hearts and minds.  Is there any talk behind the scenes of sort a new strategy, a more aggressive approach, more aggressive outrage in light of these photographs? Anything you're picking up?</p><p>MALVEAUX: Well, there certainly is this idea about outreach. And they want -- you know, they've got a media campaign. They've got -- they already have in place various outlets throughout the region, in the country to try to convey the American message, the coalition message.</p><p>The other thing that quite frankly they're doing, is while that is happening, their PR campaign, there is a huge push, essentially, to get out of the country. I mean, as you had mentioned before, the polls show the Iraqis do not want the Americans there. They're tired of the Americans being there.</p><p>And this is creating a huge problem. The American soldiers don't want to be there either. And so they are sticking with that June 30 deadline; there is no way that they're going to change that. If anything, they're escalating that process in the hopes that with outreach, through the leaders and through people on the ground, they can convince the Iraqis that it is worth it to work with the Americans, that it is worth it\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ARENA: Suzanne -- I'm sorry, I'm cutting you off, but I want to -- I want to also get into -- because I know we have limited time -- to get into the issue of the 9/11 commission. You had the president, the vice president in a closed session.</p><p>What did you hear?</p><p>MALVEAUX: We didn't hear a lot of new information, actually. I mean, it was an extraordinary situation to have the two of them together, behind closed doors.</p><p>What we do know is that overall it was a very good meeting. Everybody explained that things went very well. We know that the president was critical of Richard Clarke, his former counterterrorism chief. We know that he answered questions about what did the administration do, you now, hour by hour on September 11, reacting to the attacks. We also know that he defended himself when it came to that presidential daily brief, whether or not there was any information that he got six weeks prior to the September 11 attacks that might have predicted something like this was going to happen. He said there was no new information in that brief. Those are just some of the highlights.</p><p>We expect that you are going to see quotes and some things that are lifted out of that session in the report that is released over the summer.</p><p>WALLACE: Suzanne, I want to quickly go back to the \"Mission Accomplished\" for a second. You talked about the advisers expressing regret. Behind the scenes, privately, Suzanne, how concerned, how worried are they that this could be what some Kerry advisers believe, what they call the -- quote -- \"greatest political failure of all time.\"</p><p>Again, that's coming from Kerry's advisers.  But how worried do the Bush teams believe this could be worrisome for the president in the campaign.</p><p>MALVEAUX: You know what's really interesting is the fact that this one moment and this one image, it was something that they thought essentially that the Republicans were going to use, that the president was going to use for his own campaign, with the \"Mission Accomplished\" in the background.  He was in the flight suit, the whole bit. And what's ironic here, is that -- Kelly, as you know, is that Kerry is using the ad now to his advantage. But he didn't actually mention -- his Westminster speech, he didn't directly go after the president.</p><p>I'm just wondering if that's something where he's kind of holding back a little bit because it is so controversial.</p><p>HAYS: Right.  So before we -- but, I just have to -- speaking of image, though, so much ridicule -- political cartoons across the country of President Bush and Vice President Cheney testifying together.  One of the funniest ones -- I think even if you're a Republican, you have to chuckle with Dr. -- president -- Vice President Cheney as Dr. Evil and President Bush as Mini Me.</p><p>How do they respond to that?  I mean\u2026</p><p>MALVEAUX: And there was another that was one going around too. They say, you know, Cheney is drinking water, how does Bush speak?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALVEAUX: One of the things they realize is that in some ways, some of these Republican strategists, say, Hey, look, they created more problems than they had to here.</p><p>Ultimately, the administration cooperated on all counts.  But before they did, there was a lot of fodder here for ridicule and questions because of some of the resistance in the beginning and then some of the conditions at the end: the fact that the two of them were testifying -- were answering questions together.</p><p>Ultimately, the commissioners said, the White House said that it was useful that the two of them were sitting side by side in telling their story.</p><p>HAYS: So they got the pat on the back of the commission, so maybe it's all well and good for now.</p><p>Well, from the White House to the big sports story, Kentucky Derby day.  What to watch, who to watch and Josie Burke is back ON THE STORY in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KRISTEN MULHALL, TRAINER: I'm just going to take it like it's another race right now and try not to let it get to me. But everyone goes on and on and I guess it is pretty amazing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: Twenty-one-year-old trainer Kristen Mulhall has a difficult task ahead of her today, as she tries to keep her nerves in check.  She's trying to become the first female trainer and the youngest trainer period to win the Kentucky Derby.</p><p>Welcome back.  I'm Josie Burke in Louisville at Churchill Downs, and we're ON THE STORY.</p><p>ARENA: Josie, how does a 21-year-old end up training a horse at the Kentucky Derby? That's amazing.</p><p>BURKE: Yes, she used that word, too, amazing. I mean, she's been the story for the past couple of weeks.</p><p>Well, number one, she was born to it. Her father was a trainer for a number of decades. He then moved into the thoroughbred management. So she had it in her blood. And it's interesting, a lot of people who talk about her now, who have known her for a long time, use the same phrase.  They say she's part horse. She just really has always had an affinity for these animals. And that's why, even she's only 21, somebody said, you know, in horse training year, she's closer to her mid 30s and that's about where you should be if you want to have a Kentucky Derby winner.</p><p>WALLACE: I don't know, Josie.  I was kind of surprised that a woman trainer had not won before.</p><p>How close -- have women come close in the past and are -- is she the only woman out there? Are there other women also competing?</p><p>BURKE: Well, the number of women entrants now in the history of the Kentucky Derby -- and this is the 130th run for the roses -- is now at 12 because she's not the only one this year. There's Kristen Mulhall, but there's another woman, Jennifer Pederson.  She trained Song of the Sword. I think the reason that Mulhall is getting so much more attention is because she's got that added factor that she is so young, and just the fact that she would be the youngest trainer ever. If there was a 21-year-old guy out there, too, he would certainly be getting a lot of attention.</p><p>And the fact that her horse has a little bit better odds. Imperialism started out at 15 to 1. Song of the Sword 30 to 1.</p><p>HAYS: And there was a horse she really got in a claims race. It's such an amazing story around her the horse.</p><p>But there's another amazing story for some people who are almost unsung heroes, certainly unpaid heroes in the Derby, and that's the jockeys. And just a landmark accomplishment for the jockeys this week potentially.</p><p>BURKE: Yes, they have to go to court. They wanted -- the jockeys, a number of them,. sued because they wanted to be able to wear advertisements during the race, little patches, things like that. And there was a state law that prohibited them from doing that. They went to court and a judge this week blocked that state regulation. And then Churchill Downs went ahead and they said, OK, not just the jockeys who sued, but any jockey who wants to can wear an advertising patch.  But the catch is the advertisement can't compete with any of the official sponsors of the Kentucky Derby.</p><p>MALVEAUX: So Josie, tell us who's the favorite, and also explain to us a little bit about what it's like to be there.  I understand they have some renovations going on, and perhaps the ones wearing the fancy hats and the drinks are now mixing with the locals.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKE: I'll start with the favorite.</p><p>The interesting thing about this Kentucky Derby is that there is no clear-cut favorite.  Obviously, one horse, when they go off, is eventually going to be the one who has the best odds. It started out as The Cliff's Edge, and that's a horse that's trained by a trainer who has won the Kentucky Derby before.</p><p>A couple of other horse names to look out for -- Smarty Jones. This is an undefeated horse who has a little bit of Seabiscuit story, because he doesn't have the greatest pedigree and he was actually hurt last year.</p><p>And then there's another horse, Tap It, that's getting a lot of attention and a lot of money put down on him.</p><p>As far as the social scene, it's always an important part of the Kentucky Derby.  But it is a little bit different this year because they're doing a huge $100 million renovation -- I don't know if you can see it behind me a little bit. But part of the grandstand where the seats normally are is being renovated, and they call that Millionaire's Row.  And they actually had to move part of Millionaire's Row to the infield. And the infield is normally where, you know, the younger crowd, the crowd that's not as well-heeled, the crowd that's not wearing hats and fancy suits, hangs out.</p><p>But there's actually a big fence that they put up -- they've tried to make the infield portion that's also Millionaire's Row seem a lot more refined and separate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAYS: So you're in Louisville, Kentucky, running for the roses. Mint juleps in the afternoon, we know that.</p><p>But I know your mind also has to be a little bit keeping tabs on events in Colorado because there's some latest on Kobe Bryant.</p><p>BURKE: Yes, this week again, Kobe Bryant was back in Eagle for three days of hearing.  He was also back on the basketball court helping the Los Angeles Lakers advance to the second round of the NBA playoffs.</p><p>But there was some news that came out this week from Eagle.  The judge saying that the next time that Kobe Bryant is back for a hearing starting May 10 -- there are a couple of days of hearings -- that he will be arraigned, and at that point he will have to enter a plea. That's important because then the clock starts ticking. It will be six months from that point they have to get the trial started.</p><p>Just one last thing.  Kobe Bryant, through a statement released by his agent, told USA Basketball, he's probably not -- because of this new schedule -- going to be able to participate in the Olympics this summer.</p><p>HAYS: Oh, that's really a loss for the Olympic basketball team.</p><p>But Josie, after you get the mint juleps and, you know, collect your bets after the race tonight, what's ON THE STORY for you in coming days?</p><p>BURKE: Well, in the coming days, I'll obviously be keeping track of the NBA playoffs, getting some Olympic stories in order, because before you know it, that will be there.</p><p>And today will just be a really fun day, because there isn't just the Kentucky Derby, there's a whole day of racing.  So we have that to look forward to here in Louisville.</p><p>HAYS: Well, next year I want to come along and be your production assistant. I've never been to the Derby and I'm dying to go. And Kelli Arena will come with..</p><p>BURKE: You're more than welcome.  I can't wait.</p><p>HAYS: OK, good.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAYS: Kelli will come with her hat.</p><p>From sports and hats to what the president's economic team sees as winning numbers this week. I'm back on that story after this, and a check on what's making headlines at this hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LINDA STOUFFER, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning, I'm Linda Stouffer. In the headlines at this hour:</p><p>A compound where Westerners work came under attack today in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The U.S. embassy in Riyadh confirms at least two Americans were among the dead. Gunmen had opened fire there.  An Australian was confirmed killed. British authorities are checking reports that a Briton died in the attack as well. Saudi officials suspect an al Qaeda link.</p><p>In Iraq, a U.S. soldier was killed, two were wounded today by a roadside bomb near Mosul. Also near Mosul, a large fuel convoy came under attack.  Two private security guards were killed, five wounded.</p><p>And on the anniversary of saying that major combat had ended in Iraq, President Bush defended that declaration.  In today's weekly radio address, he said life continues to get better for many Iraqis while conceding that difficulties do remain.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BUSH: At the most basic level of justice, people are no longer disappearing into political prisons, torture chambers and mass graves because the former dictator is in prison himself.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>STOUFFER: The Iraqi insurgency has killed hundreds of U.S. troops since the president's declaration of \"Mission Accomplished\" a year ago.</p><p>The first leg of the Triple Crown is -- well, let's see -- than eight hours away. Right now, 18 horses are set to run on a very muddy track at the 130th Kentucky Derby. Post time, 6:04 p.m. Eastern tonight.</p><p>Well, those are the top stories at this hour. I'm Linda Stouffer. Now back to ON THE STORY.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN SNOW, TREASURY SECRETARY: I'm delighted to report -- delighted to report that we've had the best nine months in America's economic performance in the last 20 years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYS: Treasury Secretary John Snow loving the applause, smiling over those latest numbers showing the U.S. economy grew at more than a 4 percent annual rate for the first three months of this year.</p><p>But Wall Street, like always, wanted more and consumers seeing price hikes for gas and milk still aren't convinced.</p><p>Welcome back. We're ON THE STORY.</p><p>WALLACE: Kathleen, we always come to you with these questions, the political questions about the economy. But can you give us a sense of how things are going in some of these key battleground state, some 17 battleground states that could decide the election? Are things getting better there, too? Or still not keeping up really with the national economic growth?</p><p>HAYS: Well, you know, Kelly, let's take a look at manufacturing, because we know that's one area where the Bush team feels vulnerable because they didn't win Ohio (sic). Pennsylvania is an important state.</p><p>So you remember the road trip last summer when they were out trying to drum things up. Well, one of the good things we got at the end of the week, a little-watched report from Chicago about business activity -- that's picking up. There are more signs that manufacturing has turned around.</p><p>In that GDP report that we got this week, we saw that business investment was still pretty strong, including in software. So at the margin, yes, the ship is turning.  Is it turning fast enough? Because I think another theme here is that we see the price is rising and we see wages not growing very fast, and that's something that I think for some families, kind of creates uneasiness, it makes them insecure. And how does that sort out?  Because that's not just one key region. I think that's kind of dispersed across the country.</p><p>MALVEAUX: But Kathleen, what about interest rates? Are we going to see the Federal Reserve drop those interest rates? What does that look like?</p><p>HAYS: Oh, well, dropping them? I'm afraid not.  The whole question now, of course, is will we hike them? And I'm sure the administration wouldn't mind to see them being cut.</p><p>The Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday, and that's one of the reasons why everybody kept puzzling all week -- why isn't the stock market doing better?  Earnings are beating expectation. We got the good GDP.  Home sales for -- new home sales at a new record. Existing home sales near the record.</p><p>But they're saying, Hey, the fed's meeting next week.  They're not going to raise rates yet, but they're going to signal that we're not so patient now.  And it's not that we want to slow the economy down, but the language -- the idea will be, we have the key short-term rate at a 45-year low and economy is picking up.  So we're not really tightening if we move that rate up, we're just taking our foot off the gas. That's the story.</p><p>But the stock market doesn't know, you know?  If the growth is good, but rates are rising, you got to balance out which one adds, and which one takes away?</p><p>ARENA: Well, what I want to know is, from all this stuff we've covered, how do I get Google stock?</p><p>HAYS: Well, you know, you have shot this time. Unlike the tech boom of the late 90's and the whole bubble economy and dot-com bubble, this time these genius guys -- you know, the former Stanford computer science professors, young men, 30 and 31, who six year ago started a company that's now worth -- what? -- something like, they figure, 20 to 30 billion dollars.  When this IPO, initial public offering is sold, these guys are set for life, because they're probably both going to walk away with at least $4 billion. That's the guessing right now.</p><p>But here's the deal. They are doing a Dutch auction. And what it means is any of us can bid.  We sign up at the brokerage, either Morgan Stanley or Credit Suisse First Boston, I believe.  You make -- do the appropriate -- you know, give them the information, you send in your order.  And how a Dutch auction works is you have to bid high enough to be at the bid that sells all the shares. In other words, if we all bid -- if somebody people bid $100 and only a few people bid $50, then the $100 is going to clear it. The $50 bid probably doesn't -- doesn't get in.</p><p>ARENA: So it still sort of keeps out your smaller investors in a way.</p><p>HAYS: Well, but -- no, no, a smaller investor can get in.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ARENA: Well, but you could just bid for a few shares. It's the price, it's not the number of shares you bid for.</p><p>But the problem is, if we all want it and you say to yourself, Well, if I want this, I shouldn't bid $10 a share, I better bid $20 a share. And everyone else keeps doing that, we could inadvertently bid it up so high that when it comes to market, it's going to be overbid and the price is going to fall.</p><p>WALLACE: Kathleen, does this say anything about sort of the state of the economy?  Because we heard about IPOs -- not at the level of this one, but, you know, in years past, when we had the big tech boom.  Is this a sign of things to come or is this a sort of one-time only deal here?</p><p>HAYS: I think somewhere in the middle. That I think people figure this is good for Silicon Valley, things are coming back.</p><p>But remember, number one, this is a company that is making money. In 1999, they had sales of $220,000. Last year, their sales were nearly $1 billion. They are the leader right now in this whole search- engine area which is one of the most important areas, one of the most lucrative of the Internet.</p><p>However, having said that, there aren't a lot more Googles out there right now. And plus, I think the other thing is, remember, when the IPOs were bubbling, we were in a bubble. And I think now things are much more subdued and I think people are maybe hoping on Wall Street we're in a bubble.  But I think a lot of people figure probably not just yet.</p><p>ARENA: Too bad.</p><p>HAYS: Well, get those shares (UNINTELLIGIBLE)</p><p>ARENA: I'm calling.  I'm calling now that I know how.</p><p>Well, from the marketplace to the courthouse, in arguments this week about how terror suspects can have a different kind of justice than other criminal suspects.</p><p>I'm back ON THE STORY after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENNY MARTINEZ, JOSE PADILLA'S ATTORNEY: I think the important thing that whatever Mr. Padilla did, this is till America.  He's entitled to be charged with a crime and to have his day in court.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARENA: That was Jenny Martinez, attorney for terror suspect Jose Padilla, standing outside the U.S. Supreme Court this week.  This followed the legal arguments over whether a terrorism suspect, however dangerous, should get his day in court.</p><p>Welcome back.  We're ON THE STORY.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Now explain to me how it is that a U.S. citizen -- right? -- who is arrested on American soil at O'Hare becomes an enemy combatant.</p><p>ARENA: Because the president says so, and that's the government's argument.</p><p>The government's argument is that he was allegedly involved -- you remember, Jose Padilla, the alleged dirty bomber, who was going to come to the United States, but, you know, get materials and blow us all up with a radioactive dirty bomb, according to the government -- was a fighter in the war on terror, had trained overseas, came at the behest of the enemy to do harm here in the United States.  And the government has always contended, Look, we didn't make the United States a battlefield. Al Qaeda made the United States a battlefield when they blew up 3,000 people on September 11th.</p><p>And so that is the government's argument. And they said we can hold him without a lawyer for as long as we want, for as long as the war goes on. Of course, his counsel says, No way.  He's a U.S. citizen. He deserves to be represented. He has rights. I mean, you can't just pluck people off the street and throw them in jail forever. So -- or in a military brig.</p><p>WALLACE: Kelli, you're been reporting, the stakes are so huge on this case, of course.  But you're also talking to outside experts. When you talk to the outside experts, who do they think has a stronger case, the government or the defense lawyers for these so-called enemy combatants?</p><p>ARENA: Well, Kel, the interesting thing is that there were -- you know, there were two cases that were argued this week, the case of Yasser Hamdi and Jose Padilla.</p><p>Yasser Hamdi was caught on the battlefield.  And most legal experts seem to think that that's a clearer win for the government, in their estimation, because this was somebody engaged in battle, even though there were some squeakings about how he says he wasn't exactly fighting the U.S. That seems to be more clear-cut.</p><p>The Jose Padilla issue is very interesting, and when this ruling will be the most significant ruling on the president's war powers since World War II.  And there was a lot of discussion about this congressional resolution that was signed on September 18, right after the September 11 attacks, basically, what the government argued gave the president broad powers to fight war on terror. The critics say, Wait a minute.  It doesn't say anything about detaining U.S. citizens.</p><p>HAYS: Right.</p><p>ARENA: So they're really way across -- interestingly, Kelly, way across the board in their representation.</p><p>But I can tell you that both of those lawyers, Jenny Martinez and Paul Clement, for the government, deputy solicitor general, were brilliant before the justices. They were brilliant.</p><p>HAYS: Paint -- paint the rest of the picture in the courtroom. Because, you know, we hear at, you know, celebrity trials, Martha Stewart, the day that Rosie O'Donnell came.  You know, all the stars that came.</p><p>What about this courtroom? Who is there? What's it like?</p><p>ARENA: This is -- first of all, there were students. This case is already being studied in law schools. So you had law students that had come the night before to wait on line to try to get a seat in public sitting. I mean, it was really jam-packed.  I mean, you had people in the seats like this. You had the senator, Ted Kennedy came, Justice O'Connor's husband was there, in the Justice guest seats.</p><p>Everybody was really wanting to come.  I mean, this was a landmark case.  It was sort of very celebrity-like.</p><p>But it was -- really, it was just awe-inspiring to sit there and watch it.  It was really brilliant.</p><p>MALVEAUX: And tell us about the spam case. They're really cracking down on spam.</p><p>ARENA: Federal government, first criminal charges ever against spammers.  We all love them.</p><p>HAYS: Oh, yes.</p><p>WALLACE: Get rid of the e-mail.</p><p>ARENA: Yes.  And, you know, lots and lots of charges that they had misrepresented who they were, that they used different names to try to sell products, misrepresent what the products did and they also didn't allow consumers an opportunity to say Look, I don't want to receive this, and to report the spam, because you're supposed to have a technical gizmo there to say, Hey, you know, don't want this anymore.</p><p>So -- and very difficult. Internet crime, very difficult to prosecute.  But they went for it, for the first time ever. WALLACE: I have a tough segue there.  From the crackdown on spam -- I'm trying to think of something clever -- too early in the morning. Not coming up with anything.</p><p>To presidential politics and some challenges for John Kerry as he tries to get his message out. I'm on that story when we return. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KERRY (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: America is safer and stronger when it is respected around the world, not just feared.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: That was Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry, who was yesterday trying to flesh out his idea for what he would do in Iraq, what he would do differently from President Bush. But this was a week where, when John Kerry was talking about Iraq, homeland security, economy, jobs, his message seemed to be getting drowned out a little bit by another war, and that is Vietnam.</p><p>Welcome back.  We are ON THE STORY.</p><p>HAYS: So many moving parts for John Kerry right now. But when I step back, what strikes me is with president bush's handling of the war in Iraq going down, that John Kerry doesn't seem to be rising; he doesn't seem to be gaining some big jump or traction.</p><p>Are they getting kind of frustrated?</p><p>WALLACE: Kathleen, I'm having a little difficulty hearing you. I'm hearing our director as well. I think you were talking about the economy, is that right?</p><p>HAYS: Actually, we could talk about the economy.</p><p>WALLACE: No, no.  Now I can hear you, Kathleen. Go ahead.</p><p>HAYS: OK. Good.</p><p>What I was just saying is this: President Bush handing of the war in Iraq, he's dropped in the polls.  Why isn't John Kerry getting a big lift on this, and are his people frustrated?</p><p>WALLACE: That is a key and very good question. He is not. If you look at the poll, as you said, Americans are having more and more concerns about President Bush's handling of the war, but it's not necessarily translating to John Kerry.</p><p>What they will say, Kathleen, is they feel very good. They say that this is a neck and neck race, and that is not very good for the incumbent. But privately, Democrats are expression concern. They just don't believe that John Kerry has really broken out. He should be gaining more ground on issues like Iraq, the war on terrorism, the economy. They want to see him do more, take control of the message. So there's some frustration you're hearing within the Democratic Party about that.</p><p>ARENA: Kel, maybe he'll get re-energized when they finally decide upon a vice president. What are you hearing on that front?</p><p>WALLACE: That is the story everyone loves to talk about.</p><p>We did hear this week that -- confirmed with some sources -- that the so-called vetting process -- that is the very long and exhaustive checking of backgrounds of possible candidates -- is under way and has been under way for some time, for a couple of people, including North Carolina Senator John Edwards, Missouri Congressman Richard Gephardt. We know both former presidential candidates.  Also we understand it's happening now or will happen at some point for Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack.</p><p>We should say, though, the sense is that other people will be checked out. Lots of other names out there. It's still unclear, Kelli, when a decision will be made.  Not clear if we can get one in May or if they'll let the mystery build until closer to the Democratic convention.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Kelly, I want to go back to the story about the war record for both candidates, because it's so interesting and it's so controversial.</p><p>The Bush administration has done something that is really very clever.  Because on the one hand his top adviser, Karen Hughes, came out and criticized Kerry about whether or not he threw away the medals, the ribbons or pretended to, that kind of thing, whereas the president and his spokesperson refused to get into that kind of debate, to kind of sling that -- sling that mud. But they do -- because they say his service is honorable.</p><p>But they do talk about how they don't believe she strong enough in national security. Do you think that the administration's position here has had an impact on how people see Kerry or how he's handling this debate?</p><p>WALLACE: Well, it's interesting, Suzanne, because many people believe, Democrats, maybe even Republicans believe John Kerry was actually put on the defensive over an issue that should be really one of his strongest issues, and that is his Vietnam war record. He is a war hero, a decorated war hero and it is something that he can sort of hold out there.</p><p>And he spent the beginning of the week answering questions whether he threw medals, threw ribbons, and finding himself on the defensive.  And then he was turning the tables a bit, raising questions about President Bush, what he says are still unanswered questions about his National Guard service during Vietnam, questions about draft deferrals for Vice President Cheney.  So you saw him kind of turn the tables, get a little frustrated.</p><p>The end of the day, Suzanne, Democrats believe they win any time there is a discussion about this, because more and more people this week who might not have learned much about John Kerry learned that he did serve in Vietnam. So they think that's a win.  But again, many people think he was a bit on the defensive and that he needs to take a charge a bit more and not get in that situation in the first place.</p><p>HAYS: I'm assuming there's no chance of this. The convention is really just a couple of months away no.  If John Kerry isn't seeming stronger, if he isn't making more progress, is there any chance the Democrats might decide, you know, we picked the wrong guy, we picked too early, he's not making (UNINTELLIGIBLE).  I mean, could -- or is it just so locked up that they are stuck now with John Kerry regardless?</p><p>WALLACE: Well, you know, I think you hear sort of privately some opinion pieces are being written saying, Do we have the wrong guy? Is this the best we can do? You have some talk of a third-party alternative, of John McCain, the Republican senator of Arizona and Wesley Clark. But no one expects really that to take on any weight.</p><p>But what does it does point out again -- you're hearing more talk about it -- is that Democrats want to see John Kerry do more.  And I think, we look at the comedy channels and we look at the late-night comedians, and they're often on to something.</p><p>I want you to listen to something from Jay Leno from just this week. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY LENO, TONIGHT SHOW HOST: Today is my birthday. I got a lovely gift. Did I mention this?</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>LENO:. Somebody gave me the new John Kerry answering machine. The only problem: doesn't have a message. Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Oops. Well, that is what you are hearing some Democrats say.</p><p>But to that, I must say Kerry's advisers are defining him and that ads, biographical ads about his life, where he comes from, his Vietnam experience, are coming in days, not weeks, maybe as early as this coming week.</p><p>ARENA: Kelly, there was also some big tiff over his hair, his hair, where he got his hair cut?</p><p>WALLACE: I don't even want to touch this.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: Questions of the, you know, the cost of the haircut. You remember that name Kristoff (ph), someone that was legendary for cutting former President Bill Clinton's hair. And you know what? Aides were sort of not wanting to touch this one with a 10-foot pole. They're saying, Look, you know, onward, upward.  We're moving.  We're focusing on issues.</p><p>But it does show you how some of these other things can get a lot of attention. Obviously, he's a presidential candidate.  Everything he does is going to be scrutinized very closely.  But again, aides are saying -- we're trying to be more disciplined and focus on the issues.</p><p>MALVEAUX: And Kelli, we always hear comments about our hair anyway, you know?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: Right.  Exactly.  Good to talk about their hair.  I agree.</p><p>ARENA: I'm all for it.</p><p>MALVEAUX: Do you think -- I have a quick question.  Do you think -- I mean, the Bush camp is spending millions of dollars trying to define Kerry.  Do you think it's really had an impact?</p><p>WALLACE: It -- very quickly, Suzanne, it seems to. Look at the polls. A majority of Americans believe that John Kerry is someone who says what he thinks people want to hear, says what he think is the political answer.  So it appears it's having a little bit of an impact right now.</p><p>ARENA: All right. Thanks, Kel.</p><p>We are back ON THE STORY right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HAYS: Thanks to my colleagues and thank you for watching ON THE STORY.

A new French taxenacted in Julywill impose a 3 percent levy on the profits of multinational tech companies, targeting revenue from user data and advertising. The French digital-services tax would hit about 30 companies, largely Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google, according to a report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The tax has sparked a rare moment of unity between the Trump administration and big tech, and it has led to an investigation by the U.S. Trade Representative that could prompt retaliatory tariffs. The USTR heard from tax-policy analysts and tech-company representatives at a Monday hearing about the new tax. </p><p>But the digital-services tax has also led the Senate Finance Committee, where both the Republican and Democratic leaders oppose the French provision, to suggest the administration consider a never-used part of the tax code that would allow the U.S. government to levy a massive, 100 percent increase in U.S. tax rates for citizens or corporations of a country imposing discriminatory taxes.  In a June letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Ron Wyden suggested implementing Section 891 of the tax code, which would impose the double tax rate. Tax experts say the provision could hit a broad swath of French companies, depending on how its implemented.  Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, said Section 891 was a blunderbuss statute in that its current language could apply to a vast array of French companies operating in the United States.  To apply the double tax to all French companies doing business in the U.S. would be a heavily disproportionate blow, Hufbauer said. Section 891 has never been used, and theres little accompanying rulemaking surrounding the provision compared to other potential remedies, such as retaliatory tariffs. Generally, a foreign company needs a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction for it to be subject to taxes on domestic corporate profits. But digital companies like Google and Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants can reap profit from users without a physical presence in a country. French officials see the digital tax as a remedy. Some companies and U.S. officials, however, see it as discriminatory toward U.S. tech firms. But understanding why the Finance Committee would suggest Section 891 means looking back to why Congress originally created the provision. Once again, the issue revolves around a trade dispute between the U.S. and France. In 1926, France attempted to apply a 19th-century law on American companies that required any firm operating in the country to pay French income taxes on its worldwide profits. Like today, the motivation was to combat profit shifting and tax avoidance by multinational companies. American businesses cried double taxation, wrote Joseph Thorndike in 2016 for a Tax Analysts Tax History Project. The debate raged for years. Ultimately, the two countries signed a tax treaty in 1932 that would strike the tax. The U.S. ratified the agreement, but France dragged its feet. So Congress inserted language into its 1934 revenue act allowing the president to impose a double U.S. income-tax rate on citizens or companies from a country with discriminatory taxes.  There needed to be an extra leverage point for the U.S. to say, Seriously, lets get this done, said Daniel Bunn, director of global projects at the Tax Foundation, who spoke at the USTR hearing Monday. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the bill into law but never used the provision. He didnt have to. The threat of a huge retaliatory tax increase was sufficient, and France ratified the agreement a few months after the provision became U.S. law. Section 891 has largely laid dormant since, cropping up infrequently in tax and trade disputes over the decades. Its the provisions lack of regulatory history that makes it unwieldy.  The way its written, its written basically without those kinds of guardrails that you would see in Section 301 retaliation opportunities, Bunn said. Section 301 of the Trade of Act of 1974 allows for retaliatory tariffs to force a foreign government to remove a policy or law that violates an international trade agreement or, in this case, is discriminatory. The administration can initiate a Section 301 investigation, after which the U.S. Trade Representative issues a report and recommendations on further action.  Its unclear, however, what the process would be for a Section 891 tax. The president could simply issue a proclamation, but it may be challenged under the Administrative Procedure Act, with opponents arguing that the administration needs to follow the notice and public-comment process. And there are other questions Treasury would need to answer. The current U.S. tax treaty with France has a tax rate of zero percent on many types of profits, such as royalties and some dividends. Doubling zero still gets you zero, Bunn said. So it would be unclear what sort of mechanism would turn this back into a real kind of threat. If the U.S. disallowed U.S.-French tax-treaty benefits, that would immediately put the tax rate up to 30 percent on many streams of income, and the administration could then double those rates to 60 percent, Bunn said. The U.S. does have more moderate responses available aside from invoking Section 891. Washington could make it a condition that any U.S.-E.U. trade agreement involve Paris dropping the tax. The U.S. could also bring a case in the World Trade Organization, though that may take over a year, and the dispute-settlement body is barely functioning as the U.S. has blocked the appointment of new judges to replace retiring members.  But the most likely option is for the U.S. to bring up retaliatory tariffs on key French goods using Section 301. President Trump said as much when he suggested on Twitter that he may target imports of French wine. Section 301 would be a far better way to go in terms of selective, proportionate applications to some iconic French product, Hufbauer said.  But the trade relationship isnt just imports of Dom Perignon and Louis Vuitton. The U.S. and France traded $139 billion in goods and services in 2017, with U.S. imports of transportation material, manufactured goods, and chemicals as well, according to the French Treasury. In a report for PIIE, Hufbauer writes that the stakes are higher than just the estimated $400 million annual tax on tech firms. If the U.S. doesnt mount a vigorous defense against the tax, other countries could pile on, issuing copycat statutes of their own. According to Hufbauer, Australia, Austria, Italy, and the United Kingdom are considering similar taxes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development adopted a road map for resolving the digital-taxation issue in May, but a solution could take years. In the meantime, how the U.S. reacts to the French statute could inform similar disputes. Whatever happens here with a 301 investigation or with 891 or whatever other option pops up, that may become the U.S. playbook for the U.K., or for Spain or Italy or any of these other countries, Bunn said. And that is all a recipe for much more international tax and trade uncertainty, all at the time that the OECD is trying to work in the opposite direction.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-681042</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WW5-P641-DY4X-T18T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1262\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

In response to the proposed measure, the Trump administration threatened to levy tariffs by up to 100 percent on $2.4 billion worth of French goods, including Champagne, sparkling wine and cheese.</p><p>Taxing Big Tech in EU is a Good Idea</p><p>Roland Benedikter, a research professor of multidisciplinary political analysis at the Willy Brandt Center of the University of Wroclaw-Breslau,\u00a0the idea to tax American tech giants operating in Europe\u00a0is a step in the right direction.</p><p>\"We speak in theory now about five internets, not about one\", Benedikter observes. \"There was the idea that there is one internet globally and it has same rules [for everyone]. But that time was over. Now we have at least five internets: the European internet, that protects privacy and sanctions about behaviour, we have the Chinese internet that puts everything on surveillance, we have the Russian [internet] which is a national independent internet that can be taken off from the global network and we have Washington's internet that favours business and national profit\u2026 And the fifth dimension of the internet is of course Silicon Valley internet\".</p><p>According to the professor, the French president's initiative resonates with other European leaders: \"Europe wants to tax foreign firm, making profit on its own surveillance\", he notes. \"Macron's goal is, of course, to increase long-term or medium-term tax revenues\".</p><p>Citing preliminary estimates, Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire noted last year that the new 3 percent digital tax could raise \u20ac500 million ($570 million).</p><p>The academic does not think that the tariff row between France and the US will further escalate when the truce is over.</p><p>Benedikter suggests that the US apparently realises that \"there must be some kind of taxation for firms that have for decades long now taken over proportional profit out of the Internet and tax free roaming throughout the world\".</p><p>Besides, the professor doubts that the Trump administration \"can afford to put up to 100 percent of tariffs on French cheese or wine or whatever or champagne\", highlighting that these goods are too popular.</p><p>\"It's in the interests of Trump to avoid any tariffs on such popular goods as French consumer goods in the United States, at least until the next election is history\", he presumes.</p><p>'Trump Worships Tariffs, Macron Worships Regulation'</p><p>Kevin Dowd, a professor of finance and economics at Durham University Business School, UK, echoes Benedikter by saying that the issue of tax on digital revenues is \"a sensitive one for Western Europeans\".</p><p>\"There is a sense, in my opinion a justified one, that US digital firms are paying far too little tax\", Dowd remarks.</p><p>However, the other side of the coin is that Emmanuel Macron is weaponising the issue to ensure his \"grandstanding\", according to the British academic.</p><p>\"[Macron] imagines himself to be Europe's up and coming leader, as [German Chancellor] Merkel goes into her lame duck period, and he is staking his claim to that leadership. His stance on the digital tax is thus part of a broader pattern. In reality, Macron's position is weak and his vision of more taxes and more regulation is on the wrong side of history\", Dowd believes.</p><p>The professor deems that France would not be able to endure US retaliation tariffs as its economy is already in a bad shape. \"In any case, tariffs are set by the EU not by France,\" he highlights, \"so, really, Macron should stay out of EU tariff issues and attend to his own domestic problems, of which he has many\".</p><p>\"Agreeing truce for a year allows the issue to go onto the backburner, one hopes for good\", he notes.</p><p>According to Dowd, there's no bigger winner in the recent deal: \"The real issue is that both countries would lose badly if there were an escalation in this trade dispute, which also has to be seen in the broader context of Trump's escalation of trade barriers with the EU as whole, not to mention those with China too\", he says.</p><p>Giving their prognoses for the future of the US-French relations, the academics shared opposite stances. While Benedikter deems that the US-French relationship is \"on a good track\" and that the heads of the two countries managed to overcome personal disagreements, Dowd foresees that French-American economic relations will be tense.</p><p>\"Both countries are led by presidents who do not understand the benefits of free trade\", he underscores. \"Trump worships tariffs, Macron worships regulation. This is not a good mix for either country or the world economy\".</p><p>Sputnik</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/84/157977130492.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/84/157977130492.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-165305841</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y20-PVV1-JDJN-6219-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Yerepouni Daily News.

View original post here[2].Having panciked briefly on Friday night on news of a Turkish coup, which has since not only failed but been cast away as speculation rises that it was staged and designed to give Erdogan even more authoritarian power, markets have moved on and are now focusing on the main overnight event which was the surprising $32 billion bid [3]by Japan's SoftBank for U.K.'s semiconductor giant ARM Holdings Plcwhich has soared 45%, crushing the recently rising short base, sending comparable semis higher in European trading and pushing the Stoxx Europe 600 Index up by 0.6%, after surging 3.2% last week. Safe haven assets, including the yen, gold and U.S. Treasuries fell as geopolitical concerns faded away. That said, there are still some aftershocks in Turkey as markets digest the fallout from the failed coup and the inevitable concentration of even more power in Erdogan's hands who has unleashed a historic purge to eliminate his key enemies. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/07/03/turkish%20lira%20rebound.png\">http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/07/03/turkish%20lira%20rebound.png</url> Turkish officials over the weekend sought to limit the impact on financial markets by promising unlimited liquidity to lenders and measures to support the currency. Turkey's lira recovered more than half of its loss from Friday, while the Borsa Istanbul 100 Index sank 2.7% after a 6.2% jump last week that marked its best performance since October. Turkish Airlines tumbled as much as 6.5% . President <person><nameText>Recep Tayyip Erdogan </nameText></person>ordered reprisals after the attempted takeover by the military led to the deaths of more than 190 civilians and so far more than 6,000 people, including members of the judiciary, have been detained. The failed putsch in Turkey came less than a week after global equities had recovered from the selloff that followed the U.K.'s June 23 vote to leave the European Union, an event that wiped almost $4 trillion off the value of the securities over two trading days, and which has since seen US stocks surge to all time highs. As Bloomberg notes, Hermes Asset Management is among investors seeing potential for a relief rally in Turkish assets even amid longer-term concern about the country's political and economic situation. Rabobank and CrossBorder are predicting outflows from Turkey. Turkey's deputy prime minister posted on Twitter that there's 'no need to worry.' 'Geopolitical risk has reared its head again,' said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages more than $110 billion. 'But it's at least the fourth coup in Turkey since 1960 and I suspect no lasting impact on global markets.' Elsewhere, the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index rose 0.4%, after surging 4.5 percent last week. Benchmarks gained in Australia, Hong Kong and India, while the Shanghai Composite Index declined after data showed new home-price gains moderated last month in China. Markets were shut in Japan and Thailand for holidays. Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd., owner of Istanbul's second-biggest airport, tumbled more than 5 percent on concern fewer people will visit Turkey following the attempted coup. Lenovo Group Ltd., the world's biggest personal-computer maker, rallied to a two-month high in Hong Kong after a filing last week showed its chief executive boosted his stake. Futures on the S...00 index rose 0.5 percent ahead of earnings from companies including Bank of America Corp., Charles Schwab Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. Turkey's 10-year bonds tumbled 2.5 percent, pushing their yield up by 41 basis points to this month's high of 9.30 percent. The rate on German notes due in a decade declined by two basis points to minus 0.01 percent. The yield on similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries rose three basis points to 1.58 percent. 'There seems to be a reasonable resolution to the events' in Turkey, said Bill Bovingdon, the chief investment officer at Altius Asset Management in Sydney.

ASX 200 (+0.5%) traded with modest gains, with the energy sector outperfoming as the rally in natural gas extended overnight, while significant JPY weakness coincided with the initial outperformance in US futures. Elsewhere, Chinese markets traded in a subdued manner with the Hang Seng (+0.7%) narrowly in positive territory, while continued lacklustre liquidity injections from the PBoC saw sentiment in the Shanghai Comp (-0.3%). As a reminder, Nikkei 225 was closed for Ocean Day. Japanese Chief Cabinet Security Suga stated the BoJ has options for additional easing and has no intentions to issue deficit bonds.

On a sector specific breakdown, chip names significantly outperform today, benefitting from Softbank's takeover of ARM holdings (+42%). Financials also trade higher today, with Italian banks benefitting from reports that the Italian government is working on plans to set up a EUR 50bIn bad bank which would aim to clean up the banks, while the latest BoE comments from Weale strike a less dovish tone then some of the other MPC members of late, in particular Vlieghe who noted over the weekend that a rate cut should be accommodated with additional stimulus. Fixed income markets have remained elevated this morning on light newsflow, up around 40 ticks this morning, while looking ahead the most notable highlight from an auction perspective would be the UER 2.8-3.5bIn Belgian auction.

The South African rand climbed 1.9 percent, having dropped 2.4 percent in the last session as news of Turkey's coup attempt hit emerging-market assets. Mexico's peso rose 0.8 percent. The yen fell 0.9 percent to 105.78 per dollar. It tumbled 4.1 percent last week as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe outlined plans for a 'bold' stimulus package in the wake of an election victory. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index gained 0.1 percent. It climbed 0.4 percent in the last session as U.S. reports showed retail sales rose in June by more than economists predicted and manufacturing expanded by the most since January. The odds of the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates by December more than doubled last week to 44 percent in the futures market. China's yuan fell as much as 0.17 percent to its weakest level since 2010, having lost ground in all but one of the last 11 weeks. 'We're seeing Asian currencies weaker because of the dollar,' said Irene Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Australia ...w Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. 'I'm not sure whether the Turkey situation has really stabilized and, if there's any concern, it should be good for the dollar.' In commodities, crude oil was little changed at $45.94 a barrel in New York. It gained 0.6 percent in the last session as news broke of the coup attempt in Turkey, a vital conduit for oil passing from Russia and Iraq to the Mediterranean Sea. Gold declined 0.9 percent to about $1,326 an ounce, trimming this year's advance to 25 percent. The metal is in a major bull market and may surge to more than $1,500 as low interest rates buoy demand and the U.S. presidential election looms, according to DBS Group Holdings Ltd. Copper fell 0.8 percent in London, extending Friday's retreat from the highest level since April. Tin dropped 1.4 percent, slipping from a four-month high. Nickel rallied 0.7 percent amid a clampdown on polluting mines in the Philippines, the world's largest producer of nickel ore. Corn climbed as much as 1.4 percent in Chicago, where it's posted declines in each of the last four weeks. Heat in the U.S. Midwest intensified over the weekend and this may damage crops, said Michael Pitts, commodity sales director at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. It's a particularly quiet start to the week today with no data due out in Europe and just the July NAHB housing market index due in the US this afternoon. In the US 112 companies are set to report, or 26% of the S...00 market cap. This will include the remaining banks in BofA, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, as well as the big tech names Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and IBM. In Europe we'll also get quarterly reports from 73 Stoxx 600 companies including Roche, SAP and Daimler.

Friday's failed plot to topple President <person><nameText>Recep Tayyip Erdogan </nameText></person>risks shattering what's left of Turkey's image as a stable country that can attract enough investment to finance one of the highest current-account deficits among G-20 economies; Turkey's lira rebounded from its biggest retreat in eight years and bonds tumbled as the cost of insuring the country's debt soared, while shares in Turkish Airlines and banks led a slump in stocks Economists in a Bloomberg survey predict the ECB will keep policy unchanged on Thursday but announce fresh measures before the end of the year Bank of England policy maker Martin Weale said he needs to see firmer evidence of the impact of the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union before supporting additional stimulus at the central bank's August meeting No other country is feeling the fallout from the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union more than Ireland, with its prime minister under pressure, economists slashing growth forecasts and companies warning of Brexit's dire consequences London's seven-year housing boom may be about to end and its residential properties could experience a severe downturn, according to Societe Generale analysts Japan's top government spokesman ruled out the issuance of deficit bonds to fund an economic stimulus package planned for the autumn, hinting at the use of construction bonds for longer-term investments This year's Republican National Convention will be defined by Donald Trump, who responded to the killing of three police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with a dire warning about the direction the nation was headed. 'It will only get worse!' he tweeted US Event Calendar 8am: NAHB Housing Market Index, July, est. 60 (prior 60) 4pm: Total Net TIC Flows, May (prior $80.4b) DB's Jim reid concludes the overnight wrap Markets over the last 36 working hours have been diverted by the tragic events in Nice and Turkey. Whilst both disturbing, events in Turkey had the most potential to be a major macro event but the quick resolution of the attempted coup on Friday night will probably limit its impact. In very late trading on Friday as the story broke, the Turkish Lira was down as much as -6% against the USD, before finishing -4.78% weaker by the close - the biggest decline since 2008. This morning it's back to only -2.09% lower since just before the coup emerged, with the crackdown on those involved and responsible well underway. Our EM strategists noted that local media outlets have reported that followers of Fethullah Gulen, a preacher in self-exile in the US, were behind the plot. At least 6000 people have been detained in relation to the failed coup including President Erdogan's top military aide Col Ali Yazici. Meanwhile the AKP government has embarked on a massive purge in the army and judiciary following the attempt. Accordingly, the Turkish Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) ordered the detention of nearly 2750 judges. Arrest warrants have been issued for 140 Supreme Court members and 48 members of the Council of State on the basis of being part of the Gulen movement. Our colleagues also note that the Turkish Parliament is still the legislative power in the country and held an extraordinary session on Saturday displaying a united stance against the failed coup. As we refresh our screens this morning, the Hang Seng (+0.05%) and ASX (+0.53%) are currently up, while the Shanghai Comp (-0.39%) and Kospi (-0.02%) have retreated. Credit markets in Asia and Australia are little changed and so all things considered there's not really been too much of a reaction. It's worth noting that markets in Japan are shut today for a public holiday, so this could be keeping things quiet also. Meanwhile, Oil markets are a touch higher (Brent +0.46%) and Gold (-0.61%) has eased off slightly. Government bond markets are a touch weaker also. Sticking with bond markets, it's worth quickly recapping the impressive move higher for yields across most government bond markets last week, which coincided with a pretty strong five day gain for risk assets. Indeed 10y Bunds in particular stood out after closing in positive territory on Friday (at 0.006%) for the first time in the post-Brexit era (they last closed in positive territory on June 23rd). Bund yields rose 19.5bps last week or a more eye opening +103%, with that absolute weekly move higher in yield the most since December last year. 10y government bonds in France were 12.8bps higher last week which was also the biggest move up this year, while similar maturity bonds in Spain and Italy were 8.0bps and 6.1bps higher respectively. 10y Treasuries were also an impressive 19.3bps higher and back to the highest since June 24th. Although last week saw yields rise, the past week did see the first non-financial corporate (albeit a 100% state owned one) issue a EUR bond with a negative yield as Deutsche Bahn priced a 5 year zero coupon bond at a yield of -0.006%. We highlighted in a Credit Bites on Friday how much of the Euro corporate bond universe now trades with a negative yield after the push lower in rates since the UK referendum. We find it's actually been as much due to spreads tightening as falling yields though. Moving on, as we noted earlier, last week was another relatively strong one for risk assets despite markets running out of steam slightly on Friday. Indeed despite a backdrop of relatively solid data and better than expected results out of Citi - which like JP Morgan benefited from decent fixed income trading revenues - the S...00 (-0.09%) edged slightly lower to pare its five day gain to +1.49%. The Dow (+0.05%) did however manage to eke out a small gain to take its weekly performance to +2.04%. Prior to this there was a similar level of week-end fatigue across European equities with the Stoxx 600 (-0.17%) also dipping a touch lower, although still finishing with a strong +3.23% gain for the week. The FTSE MIB (-0.29% on Friday) and European Banks (-0.22% on Friday) closed up +4.25% and +8.38% over the five days respectively. Much of the focus on Friday and certainly prior to the Turkey headlines was the bumper set of data released out of the US. Retail sales arguably stole the show after coming in much stronger than expected. Indeed the headline printed at +0.6% mom in June (vs. +0.1% expected), although we did see the May reading revised down three-tenths to +0.2% mom. Both the ex auto and ex auto and gas readings came in at +0.7% mom (both also exceeding expectations) while the control group component (+0.5% mom vs. +0.3% expected) also beat the consensus forecast. That means the annualized quarterly reading for the control group component is +7.4% and the best showing since a similar increase in Q2 2014. Also coming in better than expected on Friday was the June industrial production print (+0.6% mom vs. +0.3% expected), while manufacturing production (+0.4% mom vs. +0.3% expected) was also a smidgen ahead. The Empire manufacturing reading for July did however decline 5.5pts to +0.55 (vs. 5.00 expected). On the inflation front June CPI (+0.2% mom vs. +0.3% expected) actually rose a little less than expected, keeping the YoY rate unchanged at +1.0%. The core did however rise to +2.3% yoy following a +0.2% mom monthly increase. The more disappointing data on Friday came in the form of the initial July flash reading for the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey. The headline sentiment reading tumbled 4pts from June to 89.5 after the expectation was for no change, with both the current conditions (-2.1pts to 108.1) and expectations (-5.3pts to 77.1) components falling. The text in the accompanying statement highlighted the Brexit vote as playing a large part in the dip lower and so it'll be interesting to see just how much of a hit the global July PMI's take when they get released on Friday. Meanwhile and just back on the Michigan survey, 1y inflation expectations actually nudged up two-tenths to 2.8%, while 5-10y expectations stayed put at 2.6%. The end result of all that data was for the Atlanta Fed to revise up its Q2 GDP forecast by one-tenth to 2.4%. The NY Fed also pushed their forecast up to 2.2% from 2.1%. Away from the data there was some focus over at the BoE where Chief Economist Andy Haldane said that 'a package of mutually-comprehensive monetary policy measures is likely to be necessary' next month when the 'precise size and extent of the necessary stimulatory measures can be determined as part of the August inflation report round'. Meanwhile over at the Fed, St Louis Fed President Bullard highlighted that there are 'upside' risks to his view for just one rate hike this year and none next year. Taking a look at the week ahead now. It's a particularly quiet start to the week today with no data due out in Europe and just the July NAHB housing market index due in the US this afternoon. Away from the data it's a quiet week for central bank speak with the BoE's Weale the only notable speaker when he is set to speak this morning (9.15am BST) on the impact of Brexit on monetary policy. Earnings will be a focus however. In the US we've got 112 companies set to report, or 26% of the S...00 market cap. This will include the remaining banks in BofA, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, as well as the big tech names Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and IBM. In Europe we'll also get quarterly reports from 73 Stoxx 600 companies including Roche, SAP and Daimler.

Nearly every state attorney genera...</p><p>(Bloomberg) -- About a dozen states, mostly led by Republicans, are expected to join the Justice Department\u2019s upcoming antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to people familiar with the investigation.   Nearly every state attorney general is investigating the company in a parallel probe focused on the company\u2019s online advertising business and led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxton could join the Justice Department case while readying his own complaint, which is likely to remain separate, one of the people said.   The states have not yet viewed a full complaint from the Justice Department, which is likely to affect how many sign on, said two of the people. More states could also decide to join the case after it\u2019s filed.   Different states have focused on other parts of Google\u2019s sprawling business lines, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing confidential matters. Even after the case is filed in the coming weeks, some Democratic-led states could continue to investigate other aspects of Google\u2019s business and could bring an additional case in the coming months, the people said.   A bipartisan group of attorneys general is investigating potentially anticompetitive conduct involving Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system, one of the people said. Some states oppose including Android in a complaint because it would be too broad, another person said.   The Justice Department has investigated both Google\u2019s flagship internet search business and its position in the online ad market, Bloomberg has reported.   Representatives from Google and Texas didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.   The lawsuit is expected to be the most significant antitrust action in the U.S. in the roughly two decades since the government sued Microsoft Corp. in 1998.   The divisions among the states over the investigation come as critics, including some congressional Democrats, have accused President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department, under Attorney General William Barr, of politicizing antitrust enforcement. As Trump fights for re-election in November, he has claimed Google is trying to manipulate information online to benefit the left.   Some Democrats are pushing for enforcers to move faster. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Barr critic who has proposed breaking up online platforms including Google, wrote in a series of tweets on Thursday that \u201cthe case against Google is clear\u201d and big tech companies should not be able to use concerns about Barr as a way to avoid antitrust action.   \u201cFor the good of our country, we must demand our regulators do their jobs &amp; take swift, aggressive action -- not kick the can down the road one more time,\u201d she wrote.   In a letter dated Friday, a number of progressive groups also wrote to the nonpartisan National Association of Attorneys General about Google, saying \u201cthat the time for this enforcement action to proceed is now.\u201d   State and federal enforcers frequently team up in antitrust probes. During the investigation phase, it\u2019s common for splits between the U.S. and the states to occur and for some states to decline to join the lawsuit in the end. Some 18 states and the District of Columbia joined the Justice Department in its 1998 lawsuit against Microsoft.   \u00a92020 Bloomberg

Google declined to comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Some Democrats seeking the presidency in 2020, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have explicitly threatened more oversight of the tech industry if they win the White House.</p><p>Google and other big tech companies \"have too much power and they're using that power to hurt small businesses, stifle innovation, and tilt the playing field against everyone else,\" Ms Warren said in a statement late on Friday. \"It's time to fight back.\"</p><p>The Trump administration has also studied Silicon Valley \u2013 the Justice Department convened state attorneys general last year to explore the competition concerns posed by Google and other big tech companies.</p><p>Some of those state attorneys general expressed their own interest in banding together and opening an antitrust investigation of Google at the time.</p><p>In Google's previous tangle with antitrust regulators, FTC officials sought to determine whether the company's search algorithms \u2013 and its practice of devoting better screen real estate to its services over those of rivals \u2013 threatened competitors.</p><p>The FTC also investigated Google's advertising practices, as well as the means by which the company licensed to its rivals some of the critical patents involving mobile phones.</p><p>But the FTC opted in 2013 against forcing Google to alter broad aspects of its business, including the way it displays search results.</p><p>The agency also decided not to pursue a breakup of Google.</p><p>The decision by the agency, at the time under President Barack Obama, drew the ire of critics who felt the agency should have challenged Google in a way similar to when the government sued Microsoft in the 1990s in one of the last major US antitrust cases.</p><p>The government at the time alleged that Microsoft broke federal antitrust laws to protect its dominant operating system, Windows, and crush competitors.</p><p>In contrast, Google has faced greater antitrust scrutiny abroad.</p><p>The European Union has been a leading force in actions against the tech giant, and regulators there have imposed roughly $9bn (\u00a37.12bn) in fines against the company in the past three years.</p><p>Those rulings include findings of violations of competition rules in the way Google presents search results.</p><p>EU rulings also faulted the company for how it licenses its Android smartphone operating system to device makers. EU officials also have threatened additional investigations and potential penalties, spurred on by allegations from some of Google's competitors, such as the reviews site Yelp.</p><p>At the Justice Department, a full-fledged antitrust probe of Google could present another major test for an agency that has most recently been scrutinising the tech and telecom industries.</p><p>Last year, the department unsuccessfully challenged AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner, and in recent weeks, antitrust lawyers there have raised concerns about the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile.</p><p>Makan Delrahim, who currently leads Justice's antitrust division, is on his second tour of duty at the agency.</p><p>Mr Delrahim previously represented corporate clients including Google during its purchase of the ad giant DoubleClick in 2007.</p><p>The post US Government Preparing Potential Investigation Into Google Over Its Monopoly On Competition appeared first on Independent Newspapers Nigeria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDNIG-145850402</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDNIG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7V-37K1-F11P-X48V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428125</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Independent.

nitf:lede=\"true\"> Representatives on Wednesday contested the testimony of executives from social media giant Facebook regarding plans to launch a digital currency called Libra, with one Congresswoman telling the Silicon Valley software company that managing currency is a core government function, not a commercial one.The stock market in the United States fell on Wednesday, with the SandP 500 down by 19.62 points, or 0.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">65 percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 115.78 points, or 0.42 percent, as uncertainty over the technology industry dominated traders' thinking.</p><p>Experts believe the U.S.</p><p> government scrutiny is sure to intensify as digital currencies remain popular with some speculators, but not with regulators or financial institutions around the globe.\"Washington policymakers are not only wading in on Libra, but are largely bringing extreme skepticism and criticism,\" John Meyer, managing partner of Starship Capital based in New York City, told Xinhua.</p><p>\"This can come down to two reasons: the insurmountable potential impact on the U.S.</p><p> and global financial system by Libra, and second: Facebook's poor track record of maintaining user trust on their platform,\" he said. style=\"margin: 0px padding: 0px font-family: Georgiafont color=\"navy\" style=\"margin: 0px padding: 0pxINTENSE SCRUTINY</p><p>fontRepresentative Carolyn Maloney said during the House Financial Services Committee hearing, \"I don't think you should launch Libra at all.</p><p>\"She said managing currency is a government function, in response to remarks from David Marcus, the French-born founder of PayPal, and now vice president for messaging products at Facebook, who testified on Tuesday at the Senate and Wednesday at the House.During the hearing in the House of Representatives, Marcus said, \"We will not launch Libra until we have fully addressed regulator's concerns.</p><p>\"Moreover, Representative Brad Sherman expressed concerns that the firm's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, did not appear at the hearing, as the controversy over the currency is the weightiest financial issue the committee has dealt with since the stock market crash and Wall Street bank failures in 2008-2009.This is \"one of the biggest things this committee will deal with this decade,\" said Sherman, who elliptically compared the currency's pending launch to a terrorist attack.\"We have been told by some that innovation is always good,\" said Sherman.</p><p> \"The most innovative thing that happened this century is when Osama Bin Laden came up with the innovative idea of flying two airplanes into towers.\"Meanwhile, skepticism was also shown at the Facebook strategy of characterizing the companies investing in the global project as a non-profit Libra Association.</p><p> But these are hardly struggling non-profit firms, with members including MasterCard, PayPal, Uber, and Lyft.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Libra is in reality \"a currency controlled by an undemocratically selected coalition of large, massive corporations.</p><p>\"Representative Ann Wagner, a former member of the Republican National Committee, pointed out a huge downside risk, suggesting that Facebook would undermine the power of the U.S.</p><p> dollar, and even destabilize the global economy.\"I'm concerned that a 2020 launch date demonstrates deep insensitivities around how Libra could impact our national security, the global financial system, the privacy of people across the globe, criminal activity, and international human rights,\" said Wagner.</p><p> style=\"margin: 0px padding: 0px font-family: Georgiafont color=\"navy\" style=\"margin: 0px padding: 0pxDOLLAR THREAT?</p><p>fontAnalysts reckon the moves by Facebook could potentially revolutionize the financial industry, and that has deeply concerned the Congress.\"Libra is no small endeavor,\" Marwan Forzley, CEO of e-commerce financial firm, Veem, based in San Francisco, told Xinhua.</p><p> \"With the launch of a cryptocurrency-based payments system on the back of its social network, Facebook could revolutionize the banking and payments ecosystem completely.\"Forzley explained that, by building an infrastructure around Libra, Facebook would create a \"currency\" that can in fact compete with the U.</p><p>S. dollar.</p><p>\"Facebook will give users more options when it comes to transferring funds, leading the way to mainstreaming multi-rail payments methods. Libra will need to consider regulatory and government responses to address issues of money laundering,\" said Forzley.</p><p>Christopher Robling, an international business consultant and founder of Clearspan Strategic, LLC, based in Chicago, told Xinhua that Facebook wants to coin its own money. \"Congress is barely catching up, and probably has no clear idea of what to do, and won't after the hearings, because it is paralyzed.</p><p> But, the pressures of digital communications on traditional regulatory schemes could not be more apparent.\"According to media reports, the House Financial Services Committee is considering legislation called \"Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance,\" which prohibits tech companies with at least 25 billion dollars in revenue -- like Facebook -- from issuing private digital currencies that compete with the greenback.</p><p>In fact, the hearings at the House and the Senate followed the news that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the government anti-corporate fraud watchdog, lambasted Facebook with the largest penalty ever against Silicon Valley, commanding the company to pay 5 billion dollars for consumer privacy violations in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.FTC initiated the investigation after a scandal involving former British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of illegally accessing data of more than 87 million Facebook users without their prior knowledge.</p><p> FTC investigated whether Facebook's data sharing with the British firm violated a 2011 consent agreement signed between Facebook and the regulator.The matter has been moved to the U.</p><p>S. Justice Department for a review.</p><p> The fine, if finalized, might be the largest one the FTC has ever levied on a tech company. Facebook, however, can afford it: the company brought in almost 56 billion dollars in revenue last year.</p><p>Facebook said in April that it expected to pay up to 5 billion dollars to settle the probe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">XINFIN-XINFINAGY19072019020970</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">XINFIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKX-MNT1-JCH9-G190-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433732</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1039\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Xinhua Finance Agency (AP) Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Xinhua Financial News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It would also seek to require the companies to be upfront about their content moderation decisions and prevent the big online platforms from invoking Section 230 in antitrust cases.</p><p>Facebook policy chief Nick Clegg told reporters that Section 230 enables the company to remove hate speech and that big changes would, \"in the end, mean less speech of all kinds appearing online.\"</p><p>The White House, for its part, welcomed news of the Justice Department proposal. \"The president expressly called on DOJ to develop such model legislation in the Executive Order signed recently, and yes, President Trump is pleased to see the department following through,\" said White House spokesman Judd Deere.</p><p>Trump has attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.</p><p>Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Carl Szabo, general counsel of NetChoice which counts Google and Facebook among its members, said the proposal would create so many obstacles to removing content that the U.S. House of Representatives would not even consider it.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, Senator Josh Hawley joined with three other Republicans to introduce a bill that would allow people to sue tech companies if they feel that their speech has been censored.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNCAEN-3256130</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNCAEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6059-G911-DY3K-T2X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">432763</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"514\"/><timeReceived>12:10 PM GMT +4</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Trend News Agency All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trend News Agency - Central Asia (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26477\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

'The president expressly called on DOJ to develop such model legislation in the Executive Order signed recently, and yes, President Trump is pleased to see the department following through,' said White House spokesman Judd Deere.Trump has attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Carl Szabo, general counsel of NetChoice which counts Google and Facebook among its members, said the proposal would create so many obstacles to removing content that the U.S. House of Representatives would not even consider it.Also on Wednesday, Senator Josh Hawley joined with three other Republicans to introduce a bill that would allow people to sue tech companies if they feel that their speech has been censored.MENAFN1706202001870000ID1100342896</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1100342896</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6058-MDF1-F04Y-T0CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Partly because we've got used to it all being free, partly because it's where the debates of the day are now publicly thrashed out. Social media is now part of our political and cultural furniture - exciting, raucous and noisy. Subsequently, we imagine it's neutral and apolitical. Empty \"platforms\" to be filled with our clamourings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is nonsense, of course.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Social media platforms are public in the same way that a shopping centre is. It looks and feels it until a security guard chucks you out for leaning over the railing, at which point you realize you're on someone else's private property. Take Facebook, with its 1.35 billion monthly users. The company pays for and owns the hundreds of thousands of servers that host all of our inane content, not to mention the army of engineers and programmers required to keep the thing running. That's why Facebook allows companies to target adverts at us based on the things we post - it means we don't have to pay for it.</p><p>Then there's all the social and legal responsibilities. All social networks have terms and conditions which forbid illegal, violent, threatening or abusive stuff. These reasonable requests are frequently ignored and so Googleet al need to hire hundreds of \"content managers\" whose job it is to watch humanity's bile (according to a recent article in Wired, there are 100,000 of them, dotted around the world) and remove it. Inevitably, this drags these usually American companies into uncomfortable decisions: should YouTube remove all Isil-related content? Should Twitter close down misogynistic accounts? Should Facebook proactively search out extremist material and pass it to the authorities, as the Intelligence and Security Committee has recently suggested? Important social questions, which are inevitably dealt with in the legal or policy department of a company headquartered far away.</p><p>Because of the way the Internet works, these companies also get to subtly influence what we encounter online: what we find, who we meet, and what we buy. Google's search algorithm is increasingly personalized to your own search history, which means you end up finding stuff online it thinks you want. According to one recent study, if you tell your friends on Facebook you've voted, they are 0.39 per cent more likely to vote too. Given that Facebook could decide through its newsfeed algorithm who gets to see your declaration of civic duty - that power could affect the result of an election.</p><p>This is not the fault of these companies, who I think err on the side of free expression, and generally want to create a free, public service. But thanks to market forces and expediency the result is a public space that isn't really controlled by the citizens. It's curated, controlled, monetized, and censored, often from behind closed doors.</p><p>A growing number of people are bothered by this. According to a new survey of 3,000 Europeans released this week, just three per cent of respondents said they trust social networks with their data. The European Commission has woken up, and started taking an interest in the power of the big tech companies by threatening to break up Google, imposing the ridiculous \"right to be forgotten,\" and is making noises about tougher data protection for citizens.</p><p>But technology is more typically changed by innovation than regulation. And among the hacker community an alternative way of running the Internet is being built already: an Internet where no one is in control, where no one can shut you down, where no one can manipulate your content. A decentralized Internet.</p><p>It's not a new idea. In the early 2000s there was a burst of activity in \"peer-to-peer\" software designed so people could communicate online directly without going via some Internet company. But the web became centralized, Joss Wright, a researcher from the Oxford Internet Institute explains, partly because it's easier to build centralized systems, and partly because it was such a good place to advertise. As a result the personal data revenue model took off, which permitted large companies to pay for the infrastructure and server space to create attractive and functional services, which we all joined. And social media platforms rely on the network effect - everyone is on Facebook because everyone else is - so the result was a centralization of people, data, then power. A natural monopoly forms.</p><p>But this latest wave could be different, because of a neat but little known new technology. Back in 2009, in an obscure cryptography chat forum, a mysterious man called Satoshi Nakamoto invented the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. You've probably heard of this digital cash because it was, and still is, the currency of choice on the illegal online drugs markets which are growing in popularity. It turns out the real genius of Bitcoin was not the currency at all, but the way it decentralizes everything. Bitcoin works because it creates an immutable, unchangeable public copy of every transaction ever made by its users, which is hosted and verified by every computer that downloads the software. This is called the \"block chain.\" Pretty soon, enthusiasts figured out that this block chain could be used for anything.</p><p>This is the plan of a crack team of computer geeks currently trying to re-engineer the entire damn Internet using the block chain. Armed with 30,000 Bitcoin (around $12 million dollars) of crowd funded support, the \"Ethereum\" project is 40 of the smartest people you'll ever meet, based mainly in Amsterdam, Berlin and London. They are currently hard at work building a new programming language and platform that uses the block chain and applies it to anything on the Internet (and should be released early next year). Vinay Gupta, a member of this team, explains that the current Internet is layered</p><p>with several piecemeal systems which have accreted over the years: the fact so much Internet traffic goes via the U.S. is because it was invented there; the certificate system which allows secure sites to be accessed is driven by the interests of a few large commercial browser companies, and so on. The end result, he says, is a hacked together network that is inefficient, insecure, and subject to invisible political expediency and control. Ethereum is a system that its developers hope will change all that, heralding a revolution in the way we use the net - allowing us to do everything online directly with each other, not through the big companies that currently mediate our online interaction and whom we have little choice but to trust with our data.</p><p>Already others have applied this principle to all sorts of areas. One clever chap built a domain name system that cannot be removed called Namecoin; another an untraceable email system call Bitmessage. Later this month Eris Industries, a company that specializes in this type of thing, is being launched in London along with lots of smart tech. Perhaps the most interesting of all is a social media platform called Twister, which is a bit like Twitter but because it uses block chain technology, everything can be done anonymously, and censorship is close to impossible. No one can shut it down, because no one owns it. Miguel Freitas, the Brazilian who spent three months building this tells me he was sparked into action when he read British Prime Minister David Cameron say he'd considered shutting down Twitter after the 2011 riots: \"The Internet alone won't help information flow if all the power is in the hands of a few people.\"</p><p>Because of its ubiquity, it's easy to forget the Internet has already changed shape several times. It started in the late '60s as a military project, morphed into an academic network through the '80s, was co-opted into a vehicle for commerce and business in the '90s, before being invaded by social media and user-generated content which became dominated by a few large companies in the noughties. It's about to change again. If and when it does, that change will be gradual but significant: chipping away at the dominance of the big companies that currently rule the roost, and making it far harder, if not impossible, to censor and control what's online. Doubtless Isil propagandists will be rubbing their hands with this, but so will democratic revolutionaries in Russia. And for the rest of us, it will mean more control over our own data and digital footprints, a peer-to-peer network where no one is in charge - because everyone is.</p><p>Jamie Bartlett is director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at the think-tank Demos.

Good morning, everyone, happy Tuesday to you, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, August 6th, big day today after that selloff yesterday, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are poised for bit of a turnaround this morning. We've got a triple-digit rally underway this morning after yesterday's broad selloff which was sparked by the Yuan, falling to an 11-year low, against the dollar. The Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P seeing their worst day of the year yesterday, the numbers tell the story, 767 lower on the Dow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets this morning are a bit better on the session this morning, although, we see that it is fractional, FT-100 up about 2 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris up 45, and the DAX Index higher by 75. In Germany, factory orders rebounded, rising 2-1/2 percent that was higher than economists were expecting.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the red was across the board, it was off of the session lows, but nonetheless, the Shanghai Composite down 1-1/2 percent as was the KOSPI Index in Korea, Nikkei, also down two-thirds of a percent.</p><p>U.S.-China trade turmoil turning to currency, the U.S. has designated China, a currency manipulator, after letting the Yuan depreciate, an accusation Beijing denies, what it all means for the economy and trade negotiations, coming up.</p><p>Big tech, hit hard by China trade, the sector seeing the heaviest selling yesterday, with names like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google's parent, Alphabet, chip maker, Nvidia, among the big losers on the session, where are they headed from here, all that right here, right now, MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And, of course, a big -- and a busy show this morning, joining the conversation this morning to talk all about the damage yesterday, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton and Forbes Media chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes, also on deck this morning, FOX News senior strategic analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane, is here to talk Hong Kong protests which are accelerating this morning.</p><p>Former Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, Bob Hormats is stopping by today, with the latest on China. The Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian, talk markets and investing after that selloff and A&amp;W CEO, Kevin Bazner, on the minimum wage and the state of consumer today.</p><p>Plus, Alpha One Capital Partners founding partner, Dan Niles, is here, to talk techs, market tumbled. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big three hours coming up.</p><p>And this morning, we do have a bit of a rebound, Futures indicating a triple-digit gain at the start of trading, obviously not coming back all the way from that almost 7 -- almost 800-point selloff yesterday, rough session, all three major indices seeing their worse day of the year, yesterday, the U.S. throwing a counterpunch in the trade dispute with China, labelling Beijing, a currency manipulator.</p><p>That was in response to the decline of the Yuan, yesterday. China has since stabilized that currency. We see a market that is trying to come back a bit today.</p><p>Steve Forbes, let me get your take right away, Beijing, being a currency manipulator. What does that mean?</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: It's really symbolic. It just means that we now have the right, in our own minds, to impose tariffs, for what they've done, take it to IMF, but in the real world, we're already doing the things that we would've gotten normally permission for from somebody -- of a foreign body.</p><p>But it's a war of words, and when do have a currency, let's say a war on each country trying to make its currency less valuable to get a trade advantage. That smacks to the 1930s, bigger than neighbor policies. Hopefully, that'll stop because everyone loses in that kind of a war.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hasn't China been devaluating, regardless? I mean, yes, I know the U.S. is now calling it the currency manipulator, but this has been going on for some time?</p><p>FORBES: Well, until a few years ago, China pegged the Yuan to the dollar, and we got mad at them because they -- we said, oh, the Yuan should be even more valuable. Currencies are not stocks. They're simply a measure of value.</p><p>And so, the confusion on our part, and by the way, just for the record, one of the biggest currency manipulators in that sense, has been the United States, starting the early 2000s which helped give us the crisis of 2008, deliberately weakening the dollar.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point. They say they just want a strong dollar, but it's really the action that --</p><p>FORBES: Well, the way they phrase it, the markets know, wink, wink, weaken the dollar.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And then the PBOC governor, right, he said, oh, we would never use the Yuan as a tool in a trade war which, I think, yesterday, a lot of people just took to be P.R., right? But then, overnight, they actually did set the Yuan at a more official reference point than, I think, a lot of people had expected it.</p><p>And when I was watching European trade, it seems like that was a little bit of a game-changer for those markets coming back too.</p><p>FORBES: And the danger in this currency, changes, is a lot of entities in China have taken on dollar-denominated debt and so you make the dollar, dearer, those companies affected debts have gone up at a time when the economy is not in such good shape.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Important point. Dagen, how do you see it? This morning, we are seeing a bit of a rebound, obviously, not to the extent that we saw the selloff yesterday.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: To Steve's point about dollar-denominated debt in China, the big risk now is that we win this trade war. What if the U.S. \"wins\" and we send China into a recession, what are the dominoes that will fall?</p><p>Again, what will this look like, globally? Tesla has spent, what, a couple of billion dollars setting up a factory, a giga factory, in China, that falls apart, what does that do to Tesla's debt here in the United States, what about the stability of the entire globe when we are the -- we're growing and we might be one of the strongest economies, but the rest of the world looks lousy.</p><p>So, if we push China into a recession, what are the knock-on effects going to be, globally, but even here in the United States? Again, this could turn into a debt crisis if we're not careful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that was the reaction yesterday for this market. When you see this market take such a hit that it did yesterday, Deirdre, sometimes you almost want to see the same thing happen on the upside, or do you feel, like, maybe everything wasn't out yesterday, you know --</p><p>BOLTON: Right. That's always the question --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have we seen capitulation?</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, and we weren't too many points away from a 10 percent drop, right? We weren't so many, so far, from correction territory in that way. I mean, listen, the bidding up that we're seeing, at least, in Europe, I do think is an attempt to stabilization.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people saying that this U.S.-China trade war may tip the Fed's hand and I think that's part of the positivity that we are seeing, I mean, Fed funds futures are now placing in three cuts for this year, which I was kind of surprised.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, one in September and one in December.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the Fed's not going to rescue the U.S. of the world from this, quite frankly. We have weak factory growth four months in a row. We had a drop in business investment in the second quarter, which you have pointed out. We have slowing job growth in this country.</p><p>This is not a tit-for-tat where the Fed cuts a quarter point and it offsets any weakness from this trade war that's been started.</p><p>FORBES: And that's the thing to look at it, as business investment, if you don't have investment, you're not going to get future growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FORBES: And that's what we have to revive and that's not going to revive if this is uncertainty by trade is out there, and we have another front over in Europe, in a couple of months, that six-month moratorium we've put on those (INAUDIBLE) tariffs. If we put tariffs on cars from Europe, parts from Europe, forget it, we're going to have a global crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the decline in business investment was sparked by the uncertainty of a trade and yesterday, we saw big technology, consumers stocks really hit particularly hard by this U.S.-China trade fight falling, at least, three percent.</p><p>Apple was the worst performer over the -- over five percent lower on the session. Now, you know, China obviously makes the iPhone, I mean, Apple makes the iPhone in China, so that's --</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, so much of their manufacturing is there and I think this just reminds everybody to, what extent, we are interconnected, you know, to Dagen's point, as well, even if the U.S. is, let's say, stable, listen, you know, their factories are over there, actually Apple get still more than 20 percent of its revenue from China, so there's a direct play on a lot of these technology names.</p><p>And then there's also the question of the manufacturing and the assembly for which, you know, something like 35 percent of our companies are trying to refuel their supply chains, trying to find other places in Asia that they can do business with, whether it's Vietnam, whether it's more in South Korea, but, yes, it just highlights our vulnerability even if we are strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes, the stock was down five and a quarter percent, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The issue with this -- the fight that we pick with China and how it's escalated, if you look at just the raw numbers of this, and I think Steve will agree with this, if you look at the raw numbers just the pure dollar amount of tariffs impacting, say, U.S. corporations, it pales in comparison to the size of the corporate tax cut.</p><p>Nevertheless, panics in the past, the Russian debt default, even the Asian contagion, it's usually triggered by something small. But, again, there are dominoes that fall in a knock on effect usually related to credit, whether it's the credit of a nation or the credit -- or lack of credit worthiness of companies that are deeply in debt.</p><p>So, it doesn't take much, and you will never really know what that -- where that first domino is and where it might fall. But, again --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know if it's fair to say, though, that the U.S., you know, picked this fight with China, I mean, China has been stealing from the United States for decades. China has been the bad actor here. It just so happens that now the U.S. is pushing back and saying, we're not going to take this anymore. But, it's not like the U.S. just decided to go pick a fight with China.</p><p>FORBES: Well --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Trade wars -- trade wars are easy to win, it's what the president said. And that's just simply not true.</p><p>FORBES: But that gets the basic question, what do you do about China when it wasn't obey the rules? And I've always said go after specific sectors, go after specific companies --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like Huawei, go after Huawei.</p><p>FORBES: Like Huawei, ZTE, we could've put them out of business, go after the bad actors.</p><p>BOLTON: Or stealth, right? She, kind of, tighten the screws in other ways, there are a lot of people who criticize, maybe, the methods, right --</p><p>FORBES: Also make it clear --</p><p>BOLTON: -- the tariffs.</p><p>FORBES: And also make it clear that China, you're not going to have the South China Sea as your lake. And we should be putting our own bases there. It's -- the whole marines and navy are considering that choke points for Chinese oil.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the issue now is that, in the story in the Journal yesterday, that President Trump, that all of his advisers were against this additional tariff that kind of came out of the blue, except for Peter Navarro. And that it seems you have someone acting in a mercurial, unpredictable way, when your businesses that create jobs in this country, need predictability.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That is what -- that it was the tipping point last week and yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I still go back to the question, though, what is the U.S. to do? I mean, now, it's common, you know, it's common knowledge that China is a national security risk, that it's not just an economic fight, that they are putting military bases across the world, that they are bullying other countries that come into that waterway, the South China Sea.</p><p>So, what is the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We shouldn't pick a fight with our allies to begin with, which we did with the steel and aluminum tariffs. We should've locked arms with them and gone, and basically, linked up to take on China, and we could do that even with, in terms of trade negotiations, and in terms of currency manipulation.</p><p>We are much stronger together when you look at all of the developed nations in China's trading partners. We didn't do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which was partly the idea behind TPP that the president --</p><p>BOLTON: And to your point, all that we were doing in the past -- over the past few decades, limiting certain kinds of investments and more working behind the scenes, right, no headline-moving tariffs, it wasn't working, arguably.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BOLTON: So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Final word, real quick, before we go to break.</p><p>FORBES: If they resolve it, market goes up 5,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, 5,000.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're serious about that?</p><p>FORBES: The uncertainty, the investment side, you remove that with Europe and with China --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I agree with you.</p><p>FORBES: -- takes off like a rocket.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stephen Moore said yesterday, he thinks that something gets done by the end of the year, not big, but at least -- if there's some semblance of peace --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- by December --</p><p>BOLTON: Or framework.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- we should be OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: To get out of this, elegantly, with China, not making that promise to stop intellectual property.</p><p>FORBES: And this is also going to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know.</p><p>FORBES: This is also going to be, perhaps, overtaken by events in Hong Kong that's becoming more --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which are rising this morning.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got more protesters on the streets in Hong Kong. We'll take a short break. When we come back, challenging Beijing, Hong Kong protests ramp up as the government clamps down hard, their latest tactics, coming up.</p><p>You heard that Chinese dissident, Jimmy Lai, say Hong Kong is over if Beijing goes through with that extradition bill. Plus, returning to service, Boeing's attempts to restore trust, testing its 737 Max jets, the company's outlook when we come right back, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump is planning to visit El Paso and Dayton tomorrow, following the two mass shootings over the weekend, Cheryl Casone now with headlines, good morning to you, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria, well, the president's visit is coming as the death toll in El Paso now stands at 22, 2 more people died overnight at the hospital. The shooting happening, of course, at a Wal-Mart store, investigators now zeroing in on an online post before the shooting, they're trying to link it to the suspect there.</p><p>And then to Ohio, Republican Governor Mike DeWine says he's going to run through a set of proposals to deal with gun violence and mental health, nine people died in the Dayton, Ohio shooting, both shootings happening over the weekend.</p><p>Boeing CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, says his company has conducted now 500 test flights with a new software update to the 737 Max. A fault in the software is believed to be responsible for both deadly crashes that killed nearly 350 people last year and this year.</p><p>The 737 Max has been grounded since March, Muilenburg added, though, that Boeing plans to send a certification package to the FAA next month, and hopefully, get that jet back in service later this year. The stock is slightly higher in the premarket, Maria.</p><p>We should add that the CEO of American Airlines, Maria, so he said that we believe that this aircraft is safe, I would take my family on this aircraft.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: Now, we see to get to the final hurdle and hopefully that will help Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see if those orders resume from those major airlines. Cheryl, thank you. Coming up, market turmoil, all three indices seeing the worst day of 2019 yesterday, as the trade fight between the U.S. and China intensifies, we have more on that. Plus, a warning from all living former Fed chairman, an op-ed this morning, we're going to bring it to you.</p><p>Then, this, McDonald's green efforts, the fast food chain's new paper straws may actually be hurting the environment, wait until you hear this one, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are looking to rebound this morning. We've got a pretty good triple-digit bounce this morning after a massive meltdown yesterday. U.S.-China trade tensions are flaring up. The U.S. is accusing China of currency manipulation and the president did that late yesterday. The S&amp;P, the Dow and the NASDAQ all took a traumatic tumble yesterday.</p><p>Joining us right now is Potomac Wealth Advisors president and founder, Mark Avallone, Mark, it's good to see you on the day that markets are struggling to come back from that huge selloff yesterday, what would you do today, coming in, after that 800-point selloff yesterday, what are you advising clients?</p><p>MARK AVALLONE, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS: Well, I think it's a wait and see, first of all, if you're in the markets, I don't think you panic and sell out because we have some rough headlines, and if you're not in the market, I think you're going to continue to see volatility, so there's no reason to dive right in.</p><p>Look, we've had an ongoing spat with China, it's going to continue that way, it may continue for a decade. I think this is just a continuation of China, flexing its muscles and showing the U.S. it doesn't want public beat down neither with tariffs or tweets or messages and I think we, as investors, have to understand this is going to be a slow process that is going online and volatility is the new norm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, do you want to sell the things that are going to get particularly hard hit from the -- from the tariffs, because I know that this latest tariff threat is impacting the consumer sector pretty hard.</p><p>You've got things like cell phones, laptops, flat screen T.V.s, set top boxes, routers, apparel, footwear, toys, all in the category of getting hit by that 10 percent tariff on the 300 billion of goods coming from China.</p><p>AVALLONE: Well, if the U.S. consumer stops purchasing to some extent, that's going to happen, keep in mind, the weaker Chinese currency's going to also minimize the impact with those tariffs, somewhat, and I think retails are already feeling the pinch. They're trying to absorb some of this.</p><p>The good news is that the U.S. consumer's flashed with cast, still buying, still spending. I don't think it's going to be a one for one. If tariffs do take effect, we're going to see a massive impact. I think there are several mitigants that the economy will be allowed to be absorbed into it and hence, into some stock prices.</p><p>BOLTON: There is -- Deirdre here, there is some headlines saying that China is trying to keep the Yuan from devaluing further, if that is, in fact, true, so we have that they might sell about 30 billion Yuan in Hong Kong, mid-August, will that matter to our markets?</p><p>AVALLONE: Well, I think stability is what we are looking at and ratcheting down of tensions, so if they do take steps like that, that'll be a big reassurance. I think the unknown is what drove yesterday, if they're going to devalue their currency one step, well, they go two steps, three steps.</p><p>So, if they pull that back and look playing ball with the U.S. and the global economic community, that's a net positive, so, yes, any step by them, in that direction would be welcome to reduce these fears and jitters.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mark --</p><p>FORBES: Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, you go ahead.</p><p>FORBES: What's going to be the impact on investing, are businesses going to overcome the reluctance even though they don't know the rules of the game and how is that going to affect the economy in 2020 and 2021?</p><p>AVALLONE: Well, you all have been talking about that on the panel for some time now, and it's this lack of foresight, the lack of ability to plan, the lack -- the lack of being able to make meaningful capital expenditures. And it's really a shame because in light of these tax cuts, were a terrific boost for business. The hesitancy remains because of the lack of clarity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AVALLONE: If we can get -- and this is why I heard earlier, I think, Maria said, if we can get an elegant deal, even if it's on the smaller side, it creates more certainty for the business community just to take the heat off, get something in place, so businesses can continue, that would be a huge boost, Steve.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, what was it down, six or eight-tenths of a percent in the last reading on business CapEx?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it was eight-tenths of a percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Eight-tenths of a percent, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, seasonally adjusted in the second quarter. But Mark, one thing I want to ask is that, in this environment -- because companies flashed with cash could actually benefit from these tariffs in a sense of, say, Apple. Apple could take market share in this environment if goods made in China, say, other phones that are important to the U.S., Samsung, phones made in China, they could be --</p><p>Apple could take market share in this kind of -- with this backdrop. And all the other companies that are flashed with cash, they could eat these tariffs in the short run. Those are the stocks you want to look at.</p><p>AVALLONE: Well, they could do that. What concerns me about Apple is the by China rhetoric that we're starting to hear, and that could be an offset to any benefit that you're outlining. Sure, Apple, you know, a world-class leader, super strong balance sheet, they can choose to absorb some of this.</p><p>I am more concerned, though, that they could lose access to one of the world's biggest markets and that -- that's a bigger concern for me in the trade fight with Apple, more of a threat than an opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about this op-ed on the Fed, defending the Federal Reserve, former Fed chairman, Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen, all got together, they wrote an op-ed in the Journal this morning, advocating for the independent Central Bank, for the independence of the Central Bank, titled, America Needs an Independent Fed.</p><p>They write, even the perception that monetary-policy decisions are politically motivated, or influenced by threats that policy makers won't be able to serve out their terms of office, can undermine public confidence. That the Central Bank is acting in the best interest of the economy.</p><p>That can lead to unstable financial markets and worse economic outcomes, interesting that they all got together with this op-ed this morning.</p><p>AVALLONE: Right, but I don't think there's any indication that Jay Powell is reacting to President Trump just yet. You know, we do wish the president would tone it down. I think it does create the perception. And I think that's the issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AVALLONE: I don't think -- I don't think the Fed chair has been reacting and I don't think they're going to, and in fact, there could be the counter effect that they want to dig in their heels and fight for and show their independence. Interesting that they all came out and wrote that, I don't think it's happening just yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will -- we will leave it there, Mark, it's great to have you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>AVALLONE: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark Avallone, joining us. Coming up, pressuring Beijing, Hong Kong protests are ramping up this morning, the Chinese government is threatening punishment. We've got the very latest there, on the ground. And then, more lights in Las Vegas, the Raiders find a sponsor for their new stadium, the big money behind the naming rights, coming up, all right here, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. Good morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, August 6th. Your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>We're taking a look at a bit of a bounce this morning on Wall Street. Take a look, Dow Futures up 213 points. S&amp;P Futures up 25, and the Nasdaq Futures up 75. Pretty good relief after yesterday's broad sell-off which was sparked by the Chinese yuan, falling to an 11-year low against the dollar.</p><p>The Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P experiencing their worst day of the year with the Dow down 767 points, almost three percent. The Nasdaq down 278. That was almost 3-1/2 percent.</p><p>Global markets this morning are off of the lows, and actually trading up. FT-100 up four points. CAC Quarante in Paris up 48, and the DAX Index in Germany up 71.</p><p>In Germany, factory orders were out, they rebounded up 2-1/2 percent. That was higher than economists were expecting. That was a bit of good news on the economy in Germany.</p><p>In Asia overnight, it was red across the board, but here two the major indices ended off of the session lows. Shanghai Composite down 1-1/2 percent as you can see there.</p><p>U.S.-China trade turmoil turning to currency yesterday. The U.S. designated China as a currency manipulator, after letting the Chinese yuan depreciate. An accusation that Beijing is denying. What it all means for the economy and trade negotiations? Coming up.</p><p>Protests are ramping up meanwhile in Hong Kong. China issued a strong warning not to take restraint for weakness. Saying people should not underestimate China's firm resolve and strength. A warning coming from the government there.</p><p>And then, Las Vegas football nearing the end zone. The future home of the Raiders gets a name. Find out the company that's sponsoring the new stadium and the big money behind the naming rights. Coming up this morning.</p><p>Paper straws. McDonald's is dumping plastic for paper. However, it might not be the most environmentally friendly move. What you hear the problems around paper straws? All those stories coming up.</p><p>But our top story this half-an-hour. U.S.-China trade tensions. Chinese officials are speaking out. Saying that the country is ready to take countermeasures if the U.S. puts intermediate-range missiles in Asia.</p><p>This after the U.S. defense secretary Mark Esper expressed his openness to the idea. The U.S. had pulled out of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty last week, which banned ground-launched ballistic missiles.</p><p>Joining me right now is retired four-star general, Fox News senior strategic analyst, General Jack Keane. General, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes, good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This decision about missiles. First, talk to us about what's happening between the U.S. and China. So far, the public has talked about this fight as an economic one. But now, we're actually opening this up to show the real story which is about the military in China.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, I mean, we're in a major geopolitical struggle with China where economics is part of it -- military is part of it. And that's the reality that we're facing here. And what the United States is trying to do is trying to bring the military situation in the Pacific back in the balance.</p><p>The fact is China has been developing intermediate conventional and nuclear missiles for years. And they have not been a part of the INF treaty that Gorbachev and Reagan signed in 1987. And obviously, recently, the Russians have been violating that treaty that's why the United States has pulled out of it.</p><p>But the United States so much respected the treaty that even though China was building those kinds of missiles in there between five and 5,000 kilometers, we respected it and did not put ours in place.</p><p>Now, we're balancing what China is doing. And that's called deterrence. We're trying to prevent a conflict. China is upping their militarization of the western Pacific, and they are the rapid -- most rapid growing military in the world. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do they see it though as we're trying to quiet things down? Or do they see this as the opposite?</p><p>KEANE: No, China believes United States is trying to contain them is what they believe our strategy is. We're trying to avoid their domination of the Western Pacific and the Indo-Pacific region itself.</p><p>And as he stated, he clearly wants to replace the United States as a preeminent global power in the world sometime in the -- in the 2030. So, they are strategically very ambitious and they definitely want the United States influence, minimized in the Pacific region for certain.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, I mean, I've said this before, and I don't think this is a controversial thing to say. I almost feel like -- General, the U.S. has a duty to stop China from becoming the dominant player, the dominant superpower of the world, because it's a communist country, because of their human rights behavior, because of all of the things that they do as bad actors. The U.S. should not want -- and the world should not want this communist country being the most dominant superpower militarily.</p><p>KEANE: I couldn't agree with you more. I mean, it is absolutely a clash of values. Much as it was with the United States and the Soviet Union. This ideology that China has in repressing its own society. It's got 3 million Muslims in concentration camps. Let's call it what they really are. They call it a reeducation camps.</p><p>They take pictures of everybody in every major city in China, constantly all day long. And they are a repressive regime. The struggle in Hong Kong is symptomatic of what that struggle is all about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KEANE: And yes, we should stand up for our values and promote them wherever we can.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, funny, you mentioned -- you mentioned the Muslims being rounded up. And I'm told that -- you know, these Uyghurs that they have rounded up, they put in these so-called education centers, which look like concentration camps, given the fact that they are guarded by -- you know, men with guns and machine weapons.</p><p>But apparently, some officials went there during Ramadan, and forced them to eat pork, forced them to do everything that Chinese do as opposed to what they wanted to do for their own religion. I mean, it was just horrible stories.</p><p>But I got to get your take on Hong Kong. Because you've got the Chinese government speaking out this morning on those ongoing protests there. Saying that they are prepared to punish protesters.</p><p>Look at these pictures general. Demonstrations against the mainland government have been going on for weeks and we know that this started because of the extradition bill where the Chinese government said, look, if you're arrested in Hong Kong, you will come back to China for punishment.</p><p>We had Jimmy Lai on and activists from China, who you know very well. Who said look, if this goes through, this extradition bill, Hong Kong is over. It will completely undermine the value system because Hong Kong has been raised -- had grown up on Western values.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, there is no doubt about that. And clearly, this is -- this is what we're talking about. We see this on the frontlines, a clash of a repressive regime in mainland China. And when we think about China, obviously, we're going to think about the people in China, many of us visited. We find it a very interesting cultural heritage.</p><p>But it's a Communist Chinese party that is really the opposition here. Not the people in China. And Hong Kong represents to them in an anathema because this is a flourishing democracy with a thriving capitalistic system.</p><p>And they do -- they have been slowly over 10 years as Jimmy Lai pointed out to us, slowly walking back the freedoms and the liberties that the Hong Kong people have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KEANE: Most of the people now on the frontlines of this demonstration and young people. And many of them believe that this is it for them. They're going to -- they're going to stay here and fight because they believe their freedom is on the line, their liberties on the line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even if it means loss of life. And I do think it appears that we may be heading to some kind of actual military confrontation. What the Chinese are monitoring is, what is the impact of this protest on mainland China? On the people of mainland China.</p><p>And now, they're showing the violence that's taking place in a protest to the mainland Chinese. They've been denying them having access to it when it was 2 million people and there was a civil protest.</p><p>And I think it's a mistake to that on the part of the demonstrators, to turn this into a violent protest in my view.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean when activist Jimmy Lai came on, on my Sunday morning program on Fox News. He basically made an appeal to the U.S. government. Stand with Hong Kong. Make sure the world knows that you're with Hong Kong. Do you think the U.S. should be getting involved in this?</p><p>You said that there's going to be a military conflict. What do you saying? Do you think that could be with the U.S.?</p><p>KEANE: No, no. I think at some point, if this protest movement starts to have adverse impact inside of mainland China, which there -- if there really concern about, then likely, they'll deploy army troops to put the protest down and clear the streets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I say.</p><p>KEANE: That will -- that will cause violence to be sure. I do think that the president of the United States should support the protesters in Hong Kong. And I also believe as opposed to that, getting in the way of the deal with China over trade, and maybe interfering with the potential for negotiations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KEANE: I think the more pressure on mainland China, the better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. We'll be watching these stories that are flaring up this morning certainly. General, it's good to see you.</p><p>KEANE: Good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for your wonderful insights as always. General Jack Keane, joining us there.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. expanding sanctions on Venezuela. Now, freezing all government assets there. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines on that. Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria, busy morning. President Trump has issued an executive order that immediately bans American companies and individuals from doing business with the government of Nicolas Maduro and any tough supporters.</p><p>The National Security Advisor John Bolton has warned China and Russia not to double down its support of Maduro. Saying, Venezuela might not repay its debt after Maduro falls.</p><p>Now, the United States recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader that was back in January, we should add.</p><p>Well, two major newspaper companies are merging Gannett, the owner of USA Today has been acquired by New Media Investment Group. That is the parent of GateHouse Media. This is a $1.4 billion cash and stock deal. The combined company going to keep the Gannett name, and will publish more than 260 newspapers throughout the country more than 2,100 newspapers have closed since 2004. That's according to a University of North Carolina study.</p><p>Well, you know that saying about good intentions. Well, McDonald's in the U.K. and Ireland switched to paper straws. As part of a global effort to help protect the environment. But despite the effort, they're not being recycled. The McDonald's is telling Fox that the technology needed to process the paper straws isn't available.</p><p>But, they say they're working on a solution and they gave no timeline. It turns out those plastic straws Maria that they used to use could have been recycled. But I have to say for McDonald's, A, for effort. And I think it's great that they're trying to do something for the environment and get rid of some of the plastic in our oceans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're trying.</p><p>CASONE: They are making a good effort. We got to hand it to them able to come up with the technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, medical marijuana headed to the south. Louisiana becomes the first state in the region to see it on shelves. That's next. And then, nearing the end zone. The future home of the Las VegasRaiders gets a name. The big money behind the naming rights, coming up, right here, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The South Florida Sun Sentinel writes: \"Plastic straw ban headed to Florida legislature again.\" The fate of the plastic straw in Florida hangs in balance and could end up back in state legislature even though Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed a bill earlier this year that would have blocked banning the sipping staple. The new measure would prohibit plastic straws and plastic carry-out bags statewide, only allowing straws made from paper, pasta, sugar cane, wood or bamboo.</p><p>The Advocate reports when and how can I get it? Answering your questions as medical marijuana hits shelves in Louisiana. The first round of marijuana released to pharmacies today. About 80 doctors now licensed to \"recommend the drug to patients.\" Louisiana is the first deep south state to dispense marijuana.</p><p>And the San Francisco Chronicle this morning reports: \"Why opening a chain store in San Francisco can take forever?\" It takes a long time for chain stores with 11 or more locations to set up shop beyond downtown. They need a special OK or even expand and that could take up to eight months which is far longer than other major cities like New York. You could also explain why San Francisco has many vacant store fronts, direct impact from regulation.</p><p>You know, this plastic straw story; Cheryl just reported a second ago that plastic straws can be recycled and paper straws are the ones that can't be -- and that's why McDonald's.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, that's what they're fighting now, right? That people are just tossing them in the trash, the paper ones. They are supposed to be recycling -- and then there is that crazy story of this lady who actually fell on metal straw and impaired her eye.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my gosh!</p><p>BOLTON: And you know that's extreme, but I'm just saying this doesn't seem like our biggest problem. I'm not a recycling expert, but this is --</p><p>FORBES: The whole straw thing is fake virtue of the real problem with plastic coming from Vietnam and from China in the Pacific Ocean. Straws -- the numbers are exaggerated but people feel they're doing something; they are not, they're making it worse.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. I agree because I think the majority of the plastic in the ocean, or at least 50 percent is from fishing nets.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's fishing nets and you're talking --</p><p>BOLTON: And plastic bottles. I mean, there's other products, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly. Of course. Yes, absolutely. All right, we will take a break, when we come back, more lights in Las Vegas to tell you about the home of the Raiders, now with the new name. Who won the rights? We've got it next up, and then, but guy on a little bike. See what happened when J.J. Watts took a ride in a Wisconsin tradition. All that coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. While they are still the Oakland Raiders but their new home stadium in Las Vegas and now it has a new name, Jared Max with the story. Good morning, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Hey, good morning, Maria. The Raiders are scheduled to move to Las Vegas next season. They are going to share this beautiful $1.9 billion, 65,000 seat new indoor stadium with UNLV. And the name of the place will be Allegiant Stadium. Named for Allegiant Travel, Allegiant Air. The Raiders say the hometown airline, Allegiant, is the perfect partner to show case the incredible support that they continue to get from the Southern Nevada community.</p><p>Miami Marlins rookie, Isan Diaz, got the call yesterday. His first Major League game, his parents happened to be in the crowd in New York getting interviewed as he batted against Mets (INAUDIBLE) winner, Jacob deGram.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And this is an emotional day for you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Very, very emotional --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He just (INAUDIBLE) deGram.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE). He just (INAUDIBLE) against deGram in his Major League debut. It is unreal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: Unreal. The Mets have a winning record, congratulations there. Houston Texans, J.J. Watt got to do something yesterday he's always wanted to do. The Wisconsin native got to take part in Green Bay Packers tradition before Texans and Packers held joint practice. Players borrowed bicycles from local kids who get to meet their heroes and hold their helmets. And well, watch J.J. Watt bust the seat of a children's bicycle. All good, though, because the kid would get another one. J.J. bought a whole new one for the kid whose bike he broke.</p><p>J.J. Watt. Look at that, riding the bike and gets to do the tradition. (INAUDIBLE) in Madison. And Dagen, I know you asked this yesterday, 30 days from today, the season kicks off, the Packers against the Bears. The 100th NFL season.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank god. I hate this time of year when it's just baseball.</p><p>MAX: Yes, college football be here right around the corner too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm just kidding.</p><p>BOLTON: I like this. I meet my hero and he broke my bike, right? That's not a phrase that everybody gets to say every day.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I bet it was made in China, that bike.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Steve was always thinking, you get the autograph and put it on the wall? Sculpture?</p><p>FORBES: Yes, you got something for life. Yes, that would be pretty cool.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's just so funny to see how big he is on that bike.</p><p>BOLTON: It's pretty funny.</p><p>MAX: What movie was that? \"Revenge of the Nerds,\" remember that? Any fans of that? Come on. Right? Remember they got all the football players riding on the little bikes at the end. That's what I'm thinking of when I see that J.J. Watt on that bicycle.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That movie is so of its time, you have to watch it in private. It has really offensive parts of it. Anyway, I digress.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good stuff, Jared.</p><p>MAX: We weren't so offended then.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Jared Max. Catch Jared's sports report Fox News Headlines 24/7 or on radio, SiriusXM 115. Quick break and then markets. Futures pointing to a bit of a rally this morning after a dismal day yesterday. Dow Industrials up 200 points. S&amp;P up 23 and the NASDAQ up almost 70. Then this, Barney's fight. The luxury retailer taking drastic measures to stay afloat. We're going to tell you all about it next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks, so much for joining us.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee's chairman, said at the start of the hearing. The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws \"are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.\"</p><p>Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created \"an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.\" At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online \"have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>As a partial solution, Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. He called it \"a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health\" of the news business.</p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously.</p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,\" Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\"</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\"</p><p>\"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>In a Capitol steeped in partisanship, inflamed by special counsel Robert Mueller's report and Democrats' intensifying probes of President Donald Trump, Congress' new investigation of tech market power stands out. Not only is it bipartisan, but it's also the first such review by Congress of a sector that for more than a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment \u2014 with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies.</p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,\" but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations.</p><p>Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up \"a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back, \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it \"will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\"</p><p>In hearings and closed-door work over coming months, lawmakers in the House aim to unpeel the complex onion of the tech industry's dominance. They are expected to summon the chief executives of the major companies to appear before the panel. Not showing up, as some CEOs have done in the past, is unlikely to be tolerated.</p><p>\"There could be something really useful\" to emerge as legislation, said Allen Grunes, who led merger investigations at the Justice Department as an antitrust attorney.</p><p>Lawmakers could address, for example, the galloping acquisition of small companies by the tech giants or craft an update of antitrust laws to apply better to complex tech behemoths, suggested Grunes, a co-founder and attorney at the Konkurrenz Group in Washington.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not illegal to be a monopoly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s wrong for someone at the top of the hill to kick the people off who are trying to climb it.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-httpswwwsltribcomnewsnationworld20190611ushousemullsantitrust</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-MD21-JCB3-X180-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1036\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00031BS</classCode><className>COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We have reached out to the office of Antitrust Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline for comment.</p><p>This effort is a part of the wider antitrust investigation launched by the Judiciary Committee last year in response to growing competition concerns around companies like Amazon and Google, which have little competition standing in their way in their core services. \"After four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases, it is critical that Congress step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or whether we need new legislation to respond to this challenge,\" Cicilline had said when the investigation was launched.</p><p>Congressional testimonies from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg have been politically charged sessions with a gigantic media spotlight. As the EU and US' antitrust glare on Big Tech heats up, testimonies from the companies' heads are something that could be key in shaping public perception of the need to regulate the industry.

That judgment is premature</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IN 2018 A new word entered Silicon Valley's lexicon: the \"techlash\", or the risk of a consumer and regulatory revolt against big tech. Today that threat seems empty. Even as regulators discuss new rules and activists fret about the right to privacy, the shares of the five biggest American tech firms have been on a jaw-dropping bull run over the past 12 months, rising by 52%. The increase in the firms' combined value, of almost $2trn, is hard to get your head round: it is roughly equivalent to Germany's entire stockmarket. Four of the five--Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft--are each now worth over $1trn. (Facebook is worth a mere $620bn.) For all the talk of a techlash, fund managers in Boston, London and Singapore have shrugged and moved on. Their calculus is that nothing can stop these firms, which are destined to earn untold riches.</p><p>This surge in tech giants' share prices raises two worries. One is whether investors have stoked a speculative bubble. The five firms, worth $5.6trn, make up almost a fifth of the value of the S&amp;P 500 index of American shares. The last time the market was so concentrated was 20 years ago, before a crash that triggered a widespread downturn. The other, opposite concern is that investors may be right. The big tech firms' supersized valuations suggest their profits will double or so in the next decade, causing far greater economic tremors in rich countries and an alarming concentration of economic and political power.</p><p>The question of a bubble is a reasonable one. Tech cycles are an integral part of the modern economy. The 1980s saw a semiconductor boom. Then, in the 1990s, came PCs and the internet. Each cycle fades or ends in a bust.</p><p>Today's upswing got going in 2007 with the launch of the iPhone. By 2018 it, too, seemed to be showing its age. Sales of smartphones were stagnating. Data scandals at Facebook crystallised anger about the tech giants' flippant approach to privacy. Global antitrust regulators were on the alert. And the loss-making antics of flaky tech \"unicorns\", such as Uber and WeWork, evoked the kind of speculative froth often seen at the tail end of a long boom.</p><p>In fact, at least for the biggest tech giants, today's valuations are built on more solid foundations. Together, the five biggest firms have cranked out $178bn of cashflow after investment in the past 12 months (see Buttonwood). Their size has yet to slow their expansion: their median sales growth, of 17% in the latest quarter, is still as impressive as it was five years ago.</p><p>Consumers say they care about privacy but act as if they care much more about getting stuff, and preferably without having to pay for it in cash. Since the end of 2018 the number of people using Facebook's services (including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp) has risen by 11%, to 2.3bn. Regulators have punished tech firms for tax, privacy and competition misconduct, but so far their efforts have been like bringing a pea-shooter to a gun fight: the fines and penalties they have imposed amount to less than 1% of the big five's market value, a tolerable cost of doing business. And the agonies of some of the unicorns, and their biggest backer, SoftBank, have only demonstrated how hard it is to replicate the scale and network effects of the big five.</p><p>Meanwhile, the size of the opportunity is vast. As our special report in this issue explains, many parts of the economy have yet to digitise. In the West only a tenth of retail sales are online, and perhaps a fifth of computing workloads sit in the cloud with the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. Big tech operates globally, giving it more space to expand, especially in emerging economies where spending on digital technology is still relatively low.</p><p>The trouble is that if you think that tech firms will get much bigger and diversify into more industries, from health care to agriculture, it is logical to assume that the backlash against them will not fade away but, eventually, get bigger.</p><p>As big tech's scope expands, more non-tech firms will find their profits dented and more workers will see their livelihoods disrupted, creating angry constituencies. One crude measure of scale is to look at global profits relative to American GDP. By this yardstick, Apple, which is expanding into services, is already roughly as big as Standard Oil and US Steel were in 1910, at the height of their powers. Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are set to reach the threshold within the next ten years.</p><p>When recession strikes it will fuel new resentments. Big tech could face a storm that few have yet paid much attention to (see Business section). The big five firms employ 1.2m people and are now by far the biggest investors in corporate America, spending almost $200bn a year. Their decisions about whether to squeeze suppliers, slash investment or attack weaker rivals will prove as controversial as those of carmakers when Detroit still ruled in the 1970s, or even of Wall Street in 2007-08. Big tech's role in politics is already toxic; social media and videos influence elections from Minnesota to Myanmar.</p><p>All this means that, far from having peaked, anger may be in the foothills. Executives hope that slick lobbying will protect them. But even today, the picture outside America is not of inaction but a tumult of regulatory experiments. China keeps its internet giants under tacit state control and wants to rely less on Silicon Valley, including Apple, which is already dealing with the covid-19 virus and other headwinds there. At least 27 countries have or are considering digital taxes. India has cracked down on e-commerce and online speech. The European Union (EU) wants individuals to own and control their own data, an approach this newspaper favours, although it may take years of innovation to create a system that is easy for consumers to use and profit from. This week the EU proposed curbs on artificial intelligence. Even in America, trustbusters may limit big tech's ability to gobble up startups, a strategy which has been instrumental to the success of Alphabet and Facebook in particular.</p><h>Just when you thought platforms were back in fashion</h><p>The $5.6trn market value of tech's formidable five is a testament to some of the most commercially successful companies ever created. But it also assumes that they will get a lot bigger even as the world stands by and watches placidly. Until today, big tech has been largely unscathed. The bigger it becomes, the more reason there is to doubt this can continue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20200222t1620000015xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8W-CYV1-DYWT-T4K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1099\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2020 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

March 17th will mark a year since the New York Times and the Observer published expos\u00e9s about how Facebook enabled the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook-users to leak to an outside political firm, Cambridge Analytica. The resulting scandal has plagued the social-networking firm and provoked scepticism among politicians and consumers that big tech firms can be trusted to police themselves. Many Republicans and Democrats, who share little in common ideologically, agree that the tech giants need to be reined in. Software may be eating the world, as the technology investor Marc Andreessen famously said, \"but the world is starting to bite back,\" says Bruce Mehlman, a lobbyist in Washington.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, a senator vying to become the Democratic nominee for president, recently suggested breaking up big tech companies, including Facebook, Google and Amazon, and unwinding some of their previously allowed mergers, such as Facebook's purchases of the apps Instagram and WhatsApp. She has declared that big tech firms have \"too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy.\" As if to underscore her concern, Facebook temporarily blocked some of Ms Warren's anti-tech advertisements from appearing on the social network, reportedly because of trademark issues with Facebook's logo, before they were restored. Nor is this animus confined to Democrats. Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, says Ms Warren is right that big tech has too much power to silence free speech and is \"a serious threat to our democracy.\" Mr Cruz added that this was the first time he had agreed with Ms Warren about anything.</p><p>Much as Wall Street animated the 2008 presidential election, antitrust will feature prominently in the 2020 campaign. Amy Klobuchar, another senator and presidential hopeful, has sponsored bills that would toughen America's antitrust laws, for example by requiring merging firms to prove their deals would not harm competition. Ms Warren's views on tech will oblige other Democratic candidates to clarify where they stand and may drag other candidates towards more extreme positions, as her stance on wealth taxes did.</p><p>It does not require a sophisticated algorithm to detect a growing unease with big tech firms. This month at South by Southwest, a conference in Austin that attracts many techies, Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition who has led the way on punishing tech firms for anti-competitive behaviour, asked whether there should be more government intervention against them. Most of the several hundred people in the room raised their hands.</p><p>How best to take on tech is a conundrum facing many governments. A new report by a panel of experts led by the Harvard economist Jason Furman, which was published on March 13th, looks at how Britain can encourage digital competition. It recommends a series of things, including developing a code of conduct for tech firms, tweaking merger rules, making it easier for customers to move their data to rival firms and creating a new competition unit with technology expertise. But Britain's ability to tame tech firms is limited. Far more responsibility falls on America, the homeland of big tech.</p><p>Democrats and Republicans may both poke at tech, but they often have different worries. Democrats are more interested in issues of market power and privacy. Republicans share their concerns about privacy, but focus less on antitrust and more on the supposed political bias of firms like Google and Facebook, which they believe suppress conservative views. However, in the year since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, neither party can claim much has been done yet to constrain big tech firms. Could that be changing?</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a consumer watchdog, is believed to be nearing completion of its investigation into whether the Cambridge Analytica fiasco is evidence that Facebook violated a 2011 agreement not to share data without consumers' express consent. Some think a massive fine, perhaps as high as $5bn, could be forthcoming. The \"effectiveness\" of the FTC is \"is going to be weighed to a large degree by their actions on Facebook,\" says Barry Lynn of the Open Markets Institute, a think-tank that argues for more forceful use of antitrust laws.</p><p>The FTC has also launched a task-force focused specifically on tech firms, which could play a role in unwinding past tech mergers. Separately, federal prosecutors are reported to be considering a criminal investigation into Facebook's sharing of data with other firms.</p><p>Another place to watch for signs of tech firms falling under tighter control is federal privacy legislation, which is currently being drafted in Washington, DC. Senators are weighing how best to write a national bill, which would give consumers greater control over how their data are collected and used online. California forced the federal government's hand by drafting and passing its own privacy law, which goes into effect in January 2020.</p><p>Most businesses \"don't want a patchwork of state laws that are hard to implement and make no sense,\" says Jon Leibowitz, former chairman of the FTC, who is now a lawyer at Davis Polk. A new federal privacy bill seems unlikely in the short term, but never before has there been so much consensus about the need for privacy legislation, says Mr Leibowitz.</p><p>The other principal worry is that big tech firms suppress competition. That can be addressed by enforcing antitrust law. America has not brought a big antitrust case against a tech giant for 20 years, since it went after Microsoft for anti-competitive behaviour. Those in favour of the \"big case\" tradition of antitrust, as Ms Warren is, believe that break-up attempts, even if they are not ultimately successful, put tech firms on guard and can allow innovative upstarts to thrive while the giant is distracted by court cases. Proponents of this school of thought point out that new firms arose after government actions against AT&amp;T, IBM and Microsoft. But not everyone agrees that it is a good idea to try to break up tech firms. It is better to prevent mergers happening in the first place than attempt to untangle them after the fact.</p><p>A big move against a tech giant seems unlikely until after 2020. But even if the elected president does not have Ms Warren's enthusiasm for breaking up these companies, there could be pressure to do so. State attorneys-general are increasingly agitating to take action against big tech firms over privacy infringements and anti-competitive behaviour. There are rumours that some have singled out Facebook. If they band together, attorneys-general could hurt tech firms and provoke action by the federal government--just as they did, launching investigations and going on to pressure the government, in the cases against big tobacco and Microsoft that started in the 1990s.</p><p>In the coming year antitrust policy and tech regulation will be debated fiercely. But 2020 will not be the first election in which antitrust policy will play a role. The issue famously featured in 1912, when the contenders talked about the powerful companies of their day, called \"trusts\", and whether they should be dismembered. Woodrow Wilson, who believed there needed to be new legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement, beat the more cautious Theodore Roosevelt to the presidency. Today's contenders may want to take note.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20190316t1620000013xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN3-BP51-JCDS-3353-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1265\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

They said activist antitrust proponents' calls for either restraining big tech firms or mandating more smaller firms goes against decades' worth of experience and learning.

Well-thumbed physical election registers. Paper ballots. Stubby pencils. Interminable counts surveyed by gimlet-eyed tallymen and women. That's our fabulously antiquated voting system and it stands up well. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, by contrast, Americans learned that the electronic voting systems of 21 states were targeted by Russian hackers in 2016 and some had been \"actually successfully penetrated\", in the words of the US head of cybersecurity. The targeting may have been exploratory probes for system vulnerabilities to be exploited later, say experts, pointing to the crumbling US digital voting apparatus. </p><p>In other words, the 2016 hackers could look like plankton compared with the shark attacks expected around the forthcoming midterm elections, with their potential to rebalance power in America.</p><p>Or not. Have the magpie media once again fallen headlong for the shiny clickbait - a hacking conspiracy thriller - and, as some suggest, taken their eye off the more significant story of the 2016 election campaign? That is, the triumph of propaganda by social media advertisements, trolls and bots. </p><p>We know now that online giants such as Facebook and Twitter enabled Russian operatives to inflame the polarisation of American society. Twitter has provided a list to a US Senate committee with the user names of nearly 37,000 Russian-linked bots that tweeted a total of 1.4 million times. If that sounds tame, consider this : those 1.4 million tweets were viewed 288 million times. </p><p>Facebook has admitted that 11.4 million Americans definitely saw Russian troll-farm advertisements like this: \"Hillary is Satan, and her crimes and lies have proved just how evil she is. And even though Donald Trump is not a saint by any means, at least he is an honest man and he cares deeply for this country.\" Sweet. Between clicking and sharing, it's likely that half the US population saw this post. </p><p>In the final weeks, the top five fake news items were all negatives for the Clinton campaign. \"In other words, the Facebook algorithm picked a side - it's not neutral,\" writes lecturer and author Rachel Botsman in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Observer</emphasis>. Facebook is \"a media company with enormous influence in shaping someone's worldview about whom to trust. And it is profit-driven.\" </p><h>Russian-linked accounts </h><p>Closer to home, she cites a study on the period leading up to the Brexit referendum, in which one-third of Twitter traffic appears to have come from scripted bots mainly spreading pro-Leave content. Another study of the 48 hours around the vote shows that Russian-linked accounts posted more than 45,000 pro-Brexit tweets - and for every original bot tweet, seven retweets were made by humans. Think about that in the context of the margin between Leave and Remain. And think about motivation and funding sources.  </p><p>We can argue the toss on whether the focus should be on hacked voting machinery or Big Tech's global distortion of trust. Either way, Putin's work is done. A new NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll suggests that four out of five Americans are somewhat or very concerned that the country's voting system might be vulnerable to computer hackers.</p><p>The 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer reports that 63 per cent of its 33,000 respondents across 28 countries say they no longer know how to tell good journalism from rumour or falsehoods. Who are that confident 37 per cent? The canny, well-informed? Think of the fake tweets innocently repeated by credible news and current affairs presenters.</p><p>Mission accomplished then for Trump and brethren whose best hope for gaining or retaining power is to sow political chaos by undermining confidence in the voting system, the media, regulators and democracy itself. </p><p>There are glimmers of hope. Online platforms that once looked invincible have had to explain themselves before powerful government committees and face a gathering threat to their vital advertising revenue. Unilever - the world's second-biggest marketing spender, at about EUR 8 billion a year, one-third of it spent online - has just threatened to pull its online advertising from giant platforms that are \"little better than a swamp in terms of transparency\". </p><h>Trust </h><p>Another glimmer appears in the Edelman study, which reports a striking 13-point rise in support for traditional media, while only one-quarter now trust the likes of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for news and information.  </p><p>Which brings us back to the stubby pencils and lessons learned. In the early 2000s, the then taoiseach Bertie Ahern said we were a \"laughing stock\" with our use of the \"peann luaidhe\", and so the Fianna F\u00e1il lads fluttered EUR 51 million on electronic voting machines with no paper trail or independent verification. Trust the lads, was the message. Without the combined firepower of media, experts like Margaret McGaley and thinking politicians, we too might be living in terror of hack attacks on our voting system.</p><p>That EUR 51 million pile of scrap metal remains a scandal, but a cheap lesson in the end for democracy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3391586</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RMY-PPW1-JC8Y-819F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 14, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But time[1] and time[2] again, studies have shown[3] how this really is cold comfort; given it takes only a little effort to pretty quickly identify a person based on access to other data sets[4]. Yet most companies, policy folk, and government officials still act as if \"anonymizing\" your data means something. It's simply not true. While that point hasn't yet resonated with the public and press fully, it should now. </p><p>The second in an amazing 7 series saga by the New York Times[5] was released this week, taking a closer look at a data trove of 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans given to the Times by an anonymous insider at one of countless location data brokers. The first[6] in the Times' series took a look at how easy it was to identify \"anonymized\" normal citizens and track their everyday lives. This second piece[7] ups the ante by... easily tracking the President of the United States via the location data of one of his secret service agents:\"The meticulous movements \u2014 down to a few feet \u2014 of the president's entourage were recorded by a smartphone we believe belonged to a Secret Service agent, whose home was also clearly identifiable in the data. Connecting the home to public deeds revealed the person's name, along with the name of the person's spouse, exposing even more details about both families. We could also see other stops this person made, apparently more connected with his private life than his public duties. The Secret Service declined to comment on our findings or describe its policies regarding location data.\"I'm not sure I've ever seen a story that more perfectly encapsulates both the stupidity of the \"anonymized data is a panacea\" claim, as well as the government's feckless refusal to seriously address one of the biggest scandals in privacy history. Granted it wasn't just the daily movement habits of the President's security detail that the data revealed, but that of Congressional staffers and lawmakers, many of whom have similarly been utterly apathetic to the problem:\"We were able to track smartphones in nearly every major government building and facility in Washington. We could follow them back to homes and, ultimately, their owners' true identities. Even a prominent senator's national security adviser \u2014 someone for whom privacy and security are core to their every working day \u2014 was identified and tracked in the data.\"DC lawmakers could use this as a learning opportunity to finally understand why location data--whether it comes from an app or your cellular provider--shouldn't be treated cavalierly and sold to every nitwit with a nickel. Granted, it's just as likely the end lesson government learns is a focus on better location data security for government officials, and nobody else. As we've noted for a while, \"feckless\" is the best term to describe the government's response to a steady[8] parade of scandals[9] showing this data is routinely abused from everybody from rogue law enforcement officers[10] to crazed stalkers[11]. The Congressional response to the Times' latest report was bipartisan in nature, even though a desire to actually do something about it hasn't been. Recall Congress voted along strict party lines to kill FCC broadband privacy rules in 2017[12] that could have at least partially addressed the problem. The GOP also supported the erosion of FCC authority in the net neutrality repeal[13], which also opened the door to greater abuse. Still, when the check comes due for those policy moves, notice how the outrage is suddenly bipartisan:\"This is terrifying,' said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who has called for the federal government take a tougher stance with tech companies. 'It is terrifying not just because of the major national security implications, what Beijing could get ahold of. But it also raises personal privacy concerns for individuals and families. These companies are tracking our kids.\" 'Tech companies are profiting by spying on Americans \u2014 trampling on the right to privacy and risking our national security,' Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running for president, told us. 'They are throwing around their power to undermine our democracy with zero consequences. This report is another alarming case for why we need to break up big tech, adopt serious privacy regulations and hold top executives of these companies personally responsible.'The FCC's supposed investigation into carrier location data sales appears to be stuck in neutral, with growing concerns[14] the agency is running out the clock[15] to avoid having to hold industry accountable. There's no real effort to craft rules that prohibit the widespread collection and sale of such data, and most policy conversations remain fixated exclusively on big tech, despite the problem also being rampant in big telecom. Meanwhile, our quest for an actual US privacy law in the internet are remains stuck in neutral, in large part because industry doesn't want to lose billions to consumers opting out of having their every waking moment monetized. Still, the Times report (which many gearing up for the holidays won't read) may help finally dislodge some of this apathy and drive some actual, fact-based awareness of the real scope of the problem, maybe someday resulting in actual, serious proposals to fix it.Permalink[16] | Comments[17] | Email This Story[18] [ 1]: <url

The Committee noted at the time that \"a small number of dominant, unregulated platforms have extraordinary power over commerce, communication, and information online.\"The investigation aims to document any problems with competition in digital markets; establish whether the aforementioned Internet giants are engaging in anti-competitive behaviour; and assess whether existing legislation is sufficient to address any issues.Given Google's record of infringing EU antitrust laws due certain practices relating to online search, its comparison shopping service, and its Android operating system, there could be at least one Internet player feeling slightly hot under the collar.One prominent politician will certainly pay closer attention than most to the investigation.Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly called for Amazon, Google and Facebook to be broken in order to address antitrust concerns.\"Today's big tech companies have too much power ?</p><p> too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.

Moreover, in the view of these organizations, the Spanish economy would be with this tax<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"less productive, less innovative,</emphasis>less entrepreneurial and, consequently, less competitive globally\".<br/>For now, the U.S. investigation is in a first phase, dedicated to gathering comments and suggestions from the parties involved, but this same procedure is the one that the Trump Administration used to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">paralyze France's digital rate.</emphasis> American Trade decided to impose 100% tariffs on French imports as iconic as cheese or wine.

S&amp;P now saying, there's a 50 percent chance they'll drop the U.S. from his AAA status as the impact over the death ceiling continues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, it appears some progress is actually being made in the ongoing talks between the White House and congressional leaders. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>will talk about it. News conference today from president, 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, which of course will carry live here on Fox Business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, there's word out of the pentagon that it suffered one of the largest cyber attacks ever; 24,000 files, some of them are extremely sensitive were stolen. U.S. officials believe it was a work of foreign government.</p><p>And, Casey Anthony scheduled to be released from prison on Sunday after being acquitted of murdering her daughter, but there are some real concerns over her safety, so we'll talk about that. So, all of those stories coming up. Good morning, everybody. Along with Dagen McDowell, I am Connell McShane. Welcome to IMUS IN THE MORNING on this Friday morning and --</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Are you feeling all right?</p><p>MCSHANE: I'm all right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Your voice --</p><p>MCSHANE: A little bit weird, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it sounds weird.</p><p>MCSHANE: Thank you for bringing it up --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But in a good way.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right on top of the show.</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was just saying -- I'm just keeping it real. I worry about you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Deeply. All the time.</p><p>MCSHANE: Is that what you do in the evenings and stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. That's all I do pretty much.</p><p>MCSHANE: How's --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what? We watch the show and just admire you. That's what I do.</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>MCSHANE: You have a lot of problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, do the markets have problems? That's what we cover here at the Fox Business Network. You can take a look at how the stock market futures are. They are all in the green this morning. The Dow Futures up 25 and I think it is safe to say if you want to take a look at oil as well. There you go -- Oil is down to $0.15 a barrel.</p><p>They get safe to say that there has been perforate little reaction to these warnings from the credit rating agencies, Moody's and then S&amp;P and then the fighting. The increasingly -- emotional fighting down in DC. You have seen no reaction in the bond markets and the treasury markets.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, nothing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The tenure treasury is still below 3 percent.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, it is safe to say that. No doubt about it. Now, Pres. Obama giving congressional leaderships a break from the debt talks today, but he'll be giving an update on the negotiations later this morning and from Fox News Doug Luzader is in DC for us. What's the latest, Doug?</p><p>DOUGLAS LUZADER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. Well, big press conference today from the president. Second one, I think this week on this. So, kind of unusual, but he's trying to get his side out there, neither side in the overall debate has budged. And, with his August 2nd deadline rapidly approaching, it is getting personal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUZADER (voice-over): They met yet again at the White House and again came up short, just for good measure, the administration sent Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner to congress with a stark warning.</p><p>TIMOTHY GEITHNER, TREASURY SECRETARY: We have no way to give congress more time to solve this problem.</p><p>LUZADER: The problem is clear. We're just about to run out of borrowed money, but the solution isn't. And, it may not help but the negotiations could be spinning out of control and just look at how crowded this room is.</p><p>PRES. <person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: There's just too many people in there poring cold water and virtually every idea -- another table.</p><p>LUZADER: Raise taxes or make deeper budget cuts. That is the dividing line. Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell is still trying to sell his back-up plan, which allows the president to barrow more but take a political hit in the process. Other republicans like Congressman Eric Cantor will not give in to new taxes though and he carries a great deal of sway in these talks.</p><p>PRES. OBAMA: I am willing to work with everybody including Eric Cantor to solve problems, and my relationship with all the leaders has been cordial. It has been professional, but I think at a certain point, the American people have run out of patience.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUZADER: And, hey congress is set to run out patience too. There was an idea floated yesterday. They have everyone travel to Camp David for more talks. Both democrats and republicans immediately shut it down, and it went no where -- Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, now working on the weekend, I guess. Doug, thank you. Doug Luzader there from Fox News live in Washington.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Your worst nightmare being stuck up at Camp David with people who you were not getting along with. It's like a bad family reunion.</p><p>MCSHANE: It looks like this McConnell plan for all it's worth is gaining a lot of attraction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He comes together with Harry Reid and it could be the end of the president. He said he'd be willing to do it. You know, willing to be the point man.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, they have nothing else at this point and that's the only thing that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sadly enough. Sadly enough.</p><p>MCSHANE: Had anything -- any kind of support, so we'll see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Diane, give us some good news. Diane Macedo is all over your business headlines today.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: I don't if I can help you out with good news right now, but I can give you news.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do that.</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>MACEDO: Rebecca Brooks has resigned as chief executive of news international. Now, that's the unit of news corporation that has been at the center of an investigation over phone hacking. Tom Mockridge, head of Sky Italia, was named as a replacement.</p><p>Brooks said in a note to the staff that she was quitting to concentrate in the investigations in the hacking and, quote, \"correcting the distortions about her record.\" News corp. is apparent to the Fox Business Network. Now, lets check on the Asian markets and for that we'll go to Fox Business Contributor Katy Sargent, who joins us by phone. Good morning, Katy.</p><p>KATY SARGENT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, good morning, Diane. We have some mixed result in Asia today going into the weekend, starting in Japan, the Nikei adding 0.4 percent. Shares are at 0.7 percent helped by gains among tech giants like LG electronics and SK telecom.</p><p>The property stocks really put pressure on China's market after Beijing after Beijing announced some further new home purchase limits. The Hang Seng finished down 0.4 percent. The Shanghai composite started out lower, but it recovered its early losses. It finished with the gain of about 0.4 percent.</p><p>Some of the big exporters doing well in Tokyo today with Cannon and Sony, both up about 1 percent. But, that retailing which owns the clothing chain dropped 0.7 percent after posting yet another drop in quarterly profit. Sales has been sagging down in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami.</p><p>The trading very cautious in the region. Investors taking in factors like the standards, of course, warning on U.S. debt and stress test for European banks. But, it is a three-day weekend for Japan and regular weekend for the rest of us already underway. So, we'll see what next week brings -- Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Thank's, Katy. And, later today, results from the European bank stress tests will be released. Sky News Alex Rossi had the latest from London. Alex, what's going on with this stress tests?</p><p>ALEX ROSSI, SKY NEWS RUSSIA CORRESPONDENT: Well, the aim of these stress tests is to try to allay market anxiety, but will they do any good? That's the big question here in Europe.</p><p>Certainly, many people feel the sovereign debt crisis is now spinning out of control. These tests will focus on 91 banks. But, many people are already questioning their credibility. Will they be thorough enough? Will they expose the sovereign debt that many is lurking under the surface?</p><p>In terms of credibility, they have taken a bit of a knock. Last year when they were brought out, two Irish banks were given a clean bill of health. Only a few months later, they have to be bailed out, needing extra cash. So, I think, the panic about the sovereign debt crisis here in Europe is unlikely to go away because of the bank tests.</p><p>MACEDO: Thanks, Alex. And, Dagen, because you asked for it, it's Friday, so there's some good news for you.</p><p>MCSHANE: I guess that's all we have. Thank you, Diane.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It has been called one of the largest thefts of sensitive defense department data resulting from a cyber attack. Pentagon officials explaining that the cyber heist as they outline their new strategy to of protect government information. Fox News National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the details from the Pentagon.</p><p>JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FBN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Cyber thieves get away with the amount of files from the defense department. The hack attack apparently happened in March. But, the deputy secretary of defense just revealing the details on Thursday.</p><p>WILLIAM LYNN DEPUTY DEFENSE SECRETARY: This was significant and it was a defense contractor and data related to systems that are being developed for the department of defense. It was large, 24,000 files. It was done by a foreign intelligence service and that a nation state behind it.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Lynn would not elaborate on which nation they thought was behind the theft, although previous cyber attacks are believed to have originated from Russia or China, but Lynn says terrorist groups initiating web warfare post a greater threat, because they would be less fearful of repercussions.</p><p>LYNN: If the terrorist group gains disruptive cyber tools, we have to assume they will strike with little hesitation.</p><p>GRIFFIN: The Pentagon has already been working with folks in the tech industry to build new set of safeguard to try and make it systems more agile and responsive.</p><p>LYNN: An important element of our strategy is there for focused on denying or at least minimizing the benefit of the attack.</p><p>GEN. JAMES CARTWRIGHT, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF VICE CHAIRMAN: So, we have to have a system that recognizes an attack, registers it and then allows us to react in a way that is appropriate, proportional, et cetera.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFIN: The U.S. military cyber command estimates the pentagon computer systems are probed by would be assailants; 250,000 times each hour. In Washington, Jennifer Griffin, Fox News.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Minnesota government shutdown is coming to an end. Governor Mark Dayton reaching a deal with republican lawmakers to end a budget impact that lead to the longest shutdown in recent history in the state. The two side are agreeing on a proposal to raise nearly $1.5 billion in new revenue. Half of that coming from delaying state aid checks to schools and republicans agreeing to drop the plan to cut the state work force like 15 percent.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, two planes colliding on the Tarmac at the Boston's Logan airport. Look at this, now the wing of a Delta jet clipped the tail of one of the other aircrafts. Now, the planes have been removed from service for inspections. One person is complaining of neck pain.</p><p>Otherwise, no injuries were actually reported as a result of this. Investigators are still working to kind of figure out exactly what the circumstances were surrounding this crash, if you want to call it that.</p><p>Astronaut on the space shuttle lantos have had to deal with the second computer failure in the past week. The astronauts switched to another one of the shuttle's five computers during the failure yesterday. NASA said there was no concern for the crew safety and other computer in the shuttle failed on Sunday, but it was fixed after the crew's installed some new software. NASA says it will trouble shoot the latest computer problem today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Casey Anthony getting out of jail on Sunday. Some experts say she should have been concerned about her safety. There has been widespread outrage after she was acquitted on charges related to the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caley. The police department has a plan of his release, but when she is free, Anthony will not get any special protection unless there is a verified threat.</p><p>Of course, the man accused of kidnapping and killing an 8-year-old boy after the child asked for directions. Will have to take a psychiatric evaluation? Levy Aaron's lawyers told the judge his client might be mentally ill.</p><p>Aoron is charged with luring Leibby KLetzky to his home on Monday, smothering him and then chopping the child's body up. Investigator saying Kletzky may have been tied up and tried to fight back before being killed. Aaron pleaded not guilty on his arraignment yesterday afternoon.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, I know. A judge has declared a mistrial in the perjury case to the former major league baseball star Roger Clemens. Judge made the decision yesterday after prosecutor showed the jury evidence that he had ruled out of bounds in the case, originally. Judge said it would be very difficult if not impossible for Clemens to have a fair trial now.</p><p>Clemens is accused of lying in court about using performance enhancing drugs. A September 2nd hearing will determine whether there will be a new trial. Judge apologized for taking up jurors' time and spending taxpayer money.</p><p>Real quick here to that breaking news at the bottom of your scream from Carl Icahn. He has offered 7650 a share for the remaining shares in Clorox that he does not already own. So, it's going to let him be out on July 14 to acquire all of these shares of Clorox that Icahn does not already owns. So, that's the breaking piece of business news this morning and may Clorox is a stock to watch and we'll talk more about it, coming up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, you know what is -- what everybody has to watch one of the most popular segments on IMUS IN THE MORNING.\" The blondes -- \"Blonde on Blonde.\" This week, the ladies take on Derek Jeter and watch out, Michelle Obama's eating habits and you know Deirdre Imus has a lot to say about that and how one woman dismembered her husband member -- well --</p><p>(BEGIN REPEAT PACKAGE)</p><p>IMUS: All right, time now for \"Blonde on Blonde.\" Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, Lis Wiehl and Deirdre Imus. Good morning, Ms. Wiehl. Good morning, Ms. Imus.</p><p>LIS WIEHL, FOX NEW POLITAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS, IMUS'S WIFE: Good morning.</p><p>WIEHL: Hi Deirdre!</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Hi Lis.</p><p>IMUS: So let's start with Derek Jeter. After reaching his 3000 career hit over the week, he said he was too emotionally and physically exhausted to attend the All-Star Game. Start with you, Deidre.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, I mean he's completely disappointing. He's a loser. First of all give the baseball --</p><p>IMUS: We're not talking about the baseball now --</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I know but that bothers me. It's on my mind, how can I avoid it.</p><p>IMUS: We'll get to that --</p><p>WIEHL: You are jumping ahead</p><p>IMUS: We'll get to that in a minute.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I'm not jumping ahead.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, you are.</p><p>WIEHL: Yes, you are.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Can I jump in here.</p><p>WIEHL: What? What a second.</p><p>DEIRDRE: Wait! Can I jump in here?</p><p>IMUS: Who is more exhausted multimillionaire baseball players like Derek Jeter or the guy with three jobs trying to pay a mortgage and take care of his sick fat kids.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, the thing is he's so into himself and self indulgent that I think -- that calls for him to go help somebody. I mean come on! Try helping these kids all summer. Let's see how exhausted you really get Derek Jeter, because that is exhausting.</p><p>IMUS: Let's find it with Lisa --</p><p>WIEHL: Yes -- No, I mean I think ridiculous. It's crazy that he does it. The thing is he was on the disabled list, so I think 17 days of season, but he still managed, you know, do the 3,000 thing whatever, so look at least go to the game. You don't even have to play, just take a standing ovation.</p><p>IMUS: Wait a minute. What is the matter? He was on the disabled list? What is he on the disabled list for?</p><p>WIEHL: He had a sore calf.</p><p>IMUS: He had a boo-boo.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No. No.</p><p>IMUS: First of all, he has been playing baseball forever. He's 50 years old. Anybody, can get 3000 hits if they play baseball for 50 years.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Exactly!</p><p>WIEHL: Don, I really wouldn't want to talk about age, if I were you, right?</p><p>IMUS: Well, we're talking about Derek Jeter.</p><p>WIEHL: Right. OK, but look -- look, I'm not disagreeing with you. I am saying he should have call but he do not have to play.</p><p>IMUS: The fan who returned Jeter's 3000 baseball. What is his name, Bernie?</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Christian Lopez.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Christian Lopez, yes.</p><p>IMUS: He seemed to be nice kid.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I guess.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, like a dope, he gave him the ball. So, the Yankees gave him a bunch of stuff out, you know some season tickets through -- Couple of bats and stuff. Stuff could be worth around 50 grand. Now, IRS could tax him for this, which would mean he would have to pay 14,000. My suggestion is, Jeter signed a baseball and gave it back to the kid and let him sell it.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Warner, thanks -- anyway from a half million to $1 million. So, freshly start with you Lis. What did you do?</p><p>WIEHL: And, absolutely, sign it as a gift, because it is not taxable. All right? And, so he doesn't have to do that and make you know especially Jeter. Good PR here, sign a baseball back over to the kid. You have more money than you could ever handle, so give it to him. I think it is crazy.</p><p>IMUS: You?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I agree, yes, he does, besides that. It is the obvious point that he has plenty of money, but it's besides that. It's the type of character that Derek Jeter is. It goes deeper than the money. It's the character, because regardless if you have money o not, it's the right thing to do.</p><p>WIEHL: Deirdre, I only make the obvious points. I only make the obvious point.</p><p>IMUS: He is a greedy creep.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: He is greedy. But, that's what we're seeing a lot in the world now. Everyone is so greedy. You know, it's all about me, me, me rather than who can help him? What I can do?</p><p>WIEHL: What about me? What you think about me?</p><p>IMUS: By the way, when Lis Wiehl was here at the ranch for his lovely daughter.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: What any difference she and Deirdre argued all about now?</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Yes, we did.</p><p>WIEHL: Talking about being emotionally exhausted after that with Deirdre.</p><p>IMUS: The first lady has been waging his fight against childhood obesity, encouraging kids to exercise with her \"Let's move\" campaign and eat healthy food, and she was photographed yet again. At this time, at the Shake Shack consuming 1600 calories of a big old greasy cheeseburger, French fries, and chocolate malt and then for some inexplicable reason, a diet coke. Let's start with you, Deirdre. What's wrong with that?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Everything is wrong with that. She's here in the fight her lots smooth campaign with obesity and she has been eating all of the foods that we really need to have people stop eating.</p><p>And, every time -- again, this is calculated with the Obamas. Every photo op -- there opportunities, she's always eating French fries, cheeseburger and a coke or diet coke. And, by the way, there's a study that just came out by the American diabetes association that diet coke is related to diabetes as well. In fact, people that drink diet -- sodas versus other sodas because we already know sodas cause diabetes and obesity. also diet sodas do and they found that people waistlines were five times larger.</p><p>WIEHL: You're also forgetting the photo op that she has taken and her vegetable garden and all of the things that she is trying to do for childhood obesity. Look. I think that method she is sending is, look, you know -- Even, even I can have a cheeseburger once in a while. Everything in moderation --</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: You are so lame, Lis.</p><p>WIEHL: No. She looks fabulous. She pretty much walks the walk and talks the talk.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No, she doesn't.</p><p>WIEHL: Come on!</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Oh my God, Lis! She does not walk to walk.</p><p>WIEHL: That's ridiculous.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Lis! Lis! You are so full of it. She does not walk to walk.</p><p>LIS WIEHL: I am not! She does, too.</p><p>DEIRDRE: No, Lis!</p><p>WIEHL: Take a look at her.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I represent -- I talk about healthy eating -- I advocate it here.</p><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: It would be the same thing because I do similar things that she does, but if I were out there speaking to people and teaching them about food and yet I wasn't practicing and preaching at home --</p><p>WIEHL: What she is doing --</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: He is a complete phony and a hypocrite. He is a completely hypocritically.</p><p>WIEHL: OK, Deirde! Hold on a second! What she is doing with that is she is sending message saying: \"Look, you can be perfect and you can be not obese and thin and healthy and all that even if he had a cheeseburger once in a while.</p><p>DEIRDRE: No. If you are phony, hypocrite --</p><p>WIEHL: People can stay on that --</p><p>IMUS: All right let me --</p><p>DEIRDRE: Lisa message she heading to children right now is very confusing.</p><p>IMUS: Here is the problem. Here is the problem and I going to have to offer a reasonable voice in this. the problem kids see her doing that. It's much better. You two are screaming at each other.</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>IMUS: Here is the problem.</p><p>WIEHL: What?</p><p>IMUS: The problem is kids see her do that.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: That's what I just said that.</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>IMUS: I am going to hut your mike off.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Making the obvious point. The kids see her doing this and they get passed that part of the story. So, they think that she is doing it all of the time. Or, had used that -- Lis I'm talking, so it doesn't help if you talk when I am talking.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Go on, make your point.</p><p>IMUS: I'm going to make my pointer. I'm going to shut your mic off and leave it off. My point is that they then think -- they say well, if she eats like that, why can't I?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So, it isn't once a while.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No. It's not because that's --</p><p>IMUS: Do if she can have a blue moon treat once a while -- I know you don't but I do. The problem is that's not the message you get sent, I think that is the point.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Right, all of the holidays and on the whole food spread. The super bowl and thanksgiving and everything else and every time there is a photo op. I know you don't but I do. That's also what the husband is eating.</p><p>WIEHL: It's not true. You are total distorting that. That's not every photo op. And, the thing is --</p><p>IMUS: Of course it is.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Of course it is, Lee.</p><p>WIEHL: If you try so hard and be so good and never have that cheeseburger, then you're going to literally figure to explode and have 10 cheeseburgers.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No, you're not. You're going to have obesity and diabetes.</p><p>WIEHL: You could have one and eat in a while and have that photo op saying you are a normal person. You can handle this and then you go back and work out and you eat eh veggies.</p><p>IMUS: Now, you know what you're going to have?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No. No.</p><p>IMUS: We're going to have a big old gut hanging over your dress just like Laura Ingram was talking about.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: But, she doesn't it.</p><p>IMUS: Walking around with a muffin top.</p><p>WIEHL: But, she doesn't. But, she doesn't. She looks fabulous. Well, we're not going to track her personally, that's not the issue here. The issue is, is hypocritically she is a complete phony. You cannot me eating those foods when you are a major campaign under your husband's presidency is obesity and you're going out and eating over 1600 calories.</p><p>IMUS: A woman in California.</p><p>(END REPEAT PACKAGE)</p><p>MCSHANE: There we go. Another edition of \"Blonde on Blonde.\"</p><p>MCSHANE: Some of the IMUS IN THE MORNING funnier moments are coming up here in just a moment. We're also going to talk to radio host and I- fave Michael Graham, he'll be live with is. Later on, New York Congressman, Charles Rangel. The real Charles Rangel. IMUS IN THE MORNING on Fox Business.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning everybody, Carl Icahn wants to own all of Clorox. The billionaire investor has sent a letter to the Clorox CEO proposing the acquire the rest of the company's shares that he doesn't already own. According to a regulatory filing, he's offering $76.50 a share. And, you can see shares are jumping on that news.</p><p>In other deal news, BHP-Billiton announces its plan to acquire Petro hawk energy for more than $12 billion in cash. It's second acquisition in U.S. shell gases this year. The deal will provide BHP with access to large sale asset in Texas and Louisiana. BHP will pay 38.75 per share for a total enterprise value of $15.1 billion.</p><p>Google, second quarterly results, blew out \"Wall Street\" Blew out \"Wall Street\" estimates, the company is posting a profit of $2.5 billion. Adjusted earnings came in $8.74 per share. And, revenue jump about more than 30 percent from year ago to nearly $7 billion. Shares are soaring this morning in the pre-market.</p><p>We also earning news from the world's biggest toymaker. Metal is reporting of earnings at $0.23 a share. That beats the estimate of $0.16 a sales. Revenue came in at 1.16 billion that also tops the estimates. Dagen, Connell back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Diane.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much. Joining us now with more on these markets is David Kou from the Motley Fool U.K., David thank you so much for being here.</p><p>I want to know if you think that this is an accurate statement. You look at the squabbling in your nation's capitol about raising the debt ceiling and cutting our deficit spending. You look at Moody's warning. S&amp;P just warning that there's a 50 percent chance that could downgrade our credit rating in the next three months. There has been virtually no market reaction to that, why?</p><p>DAVID KOU: Well, I think because people expect the debt ceiling to be raised. I presume you are talking about the American debt ceiling rather than the European one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, because it's all about us.</p><p>(LAUGHING)</p><p>KOU: Well, it is debt, debt, debt everywhere, and I think you know most people expect the debt ceiling in America to be raised. I heard one commentator say, it's a bit like -- what do I do after a suicide? That is talking about myself.</p><p>And, I think, you know, that's the situation that you have in America. Everyone knows that the debt ceiling has to be raised, because there is no alternative. So, therefore, there is a question when you do it.</p><p>When people come to their senses and say lets raise that ceiling from $14 trillion to something a bit realistic like $18 trillion because you need the money after all. So, I think that's the market is kind of mood as far as it is concerned and the rating's agency are concerned. And, as far as the ratings agencies are also concerned people are beginning to -- you know, whether or not, they just of sort of crying wolf something. And, the fact that they seen a wolf and they are crying -- I have just seen a wolf try --</p><p>MCCSHANE: It is funny now. The contrast between -- what Dagen is bringing, the way the market reaction what's happening here in the United States versus what's happening in Europe, where there is a reaction to just about everything. I mean Italy became a big story this week for example. David, what's going to happen there?</p><p>KOU: Well, you see what is happening in Europe is that people are very concerned. Because you see somebody out there juggling with fire, you're going to think you know have will say do you have enough hands?</p><p>And currently in Europe, people are saying \"I don't think we have enough hands.\" One of the problems in Europe is that we've been robbing peters to pay Paul. We're running out of peters as the moment. So, they are having a look at Piel over in France. They are also looking Pedro over in Spain .</p><p>And, this people are saying, look we haven't got money to give you. So, that is the problem we have. And, we also have to remember that Europe is a conglomeration of many country, unlike America where you have one president, we don't really have. Everybody is in for it themselves in Europe.</p><p>So, until Sunday comes along, a school monster or school mistress going into the class and say look everybody calm down, these is were going calm down. This where going to do. But, ---</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, what is the chances that that actually happen in the next hundred years?</p><p>KOU: Almost impossible, ad I think. And I thinking one thing that will bring everything to my head is today. Later on today, from what they call the European banking agency and they'll be having a look at whether or not banks are going to be able to withstand a shrinkage in Europe, half a percent. But, it doesn't seem that bad. But, the one thing that they are not really addressing whether or need the banks will be able to withstand a entire country defaulting on its debt.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>KOU: I mean they are talking about the possibility of Greece defaulting on its debt and that would be a nightmare scenario.</p><p>MCSHANE: And it is a lot about -- the last thing I guess David. But, it is a lot about timing. It seems to be timing, it seems to be at least when talking about you know, whether or not, Greece's is going to default. A lot of people will tell you well. And, I think we talked about this in the past.</p><p>It's only a matter of time until that happens, but when will it happen at the time when the bank can stand it happening. In other words, are they even close to a point where if Greece were to default or another county would have get that type of of trouble, these banks could work they're way through it.</p><p>KOU: This is a big issue and this is what they're planning to look at the moment. I think in the case of Greece, if the Greece was to default, it wouldn't be the end of the world, because Greece is a relatively small country. The one you start looking is like Vagabonds like Italy, which is the top topic at the moment. I mean this is a country that will require something in the region of one trillion euros in order to sustain itself.</p><p>Now this is where Europe says we don't really have that kind of money. It is paying off your small bill. You know, when somebody knocks on your door and you're in financial problems, you can pay the milk man.</p><p>You can pay the newspaper guy, but if the bank turns up and said you are actually late with paying your mortgage. That's when it becomes a huge problem and that is the issue that we have to address right now.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE: David Kuo, Motley for U.K. Thanks again.</p><p>KUO: Thank you very much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL: Coming up shortly, radio talk show host, Michael Graham is live with us and then New York Congressman Charles Rangel. The real Charles Rangel talks to the Imus.</p><p>MCDOWELL: AAA not a OK. For the second time in two days, the U.S. government's AAA credit rating is being threatened with a downgrade. Standard &amp; Poor's now saying there is a 50 percent chance that it will cut that rating in the next three months because of the impasse over the debt ceiling.</p><p>As that continues, maybe some progress is being made in the ongoing talks between the White House and congressional leaders. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>will talk all about at a news conference at 11:00 a.m. Eastern today, which, of course, you can watch it here on Fox Business live.</p><p>Word out of the Pentagon that it has suffered one of the largest cyber attacks ever, 24,000 files, some of them extremely sensitive, they were stolen and U.S. officials believe it was the work of a foreign government.</p><p>Casey Anthony scheduled to be released from prison on Sunday after being acquitted of murdering her daughter, but there are real concerns over her safety.</p><p>Good morning, everybody. I'm Dagen McDowell. That is my man, Connell McShane pulling himself together this morning.</p><p>MCSHANE: What is that suppose to mean?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is exactly what I said.</p><p>MCSHANE: We got Michael Graham. He's going to join us live in a moment.</p><p>As you bring up the markets, you know what is interesting is that, and we talked about this, there is an assumption being made Dow futures are up 36. That this debt ceiling thing is going to get solved.</p><p>Everybody on Wall Street, investors are just assuming. You just wonder if their assumption is a faulty one, then what happens? But so far that's what the markets are pricing in. Up 30 on the Dow futures right now.</p><p>Let's go to oil here real quick just to see where it is at. Oil price $95.65, not much movement there at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I am obsessed with the Spelling mansion getting sold for $85 million, cut from a $150 million asking price.</p><p>MCSHANE: Tough market.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But speaking of cuts, we are in a danger of a cut in our credit rating, Diane, right? Standard &amp; Poors went a little bit further than Moody's in saying what might make it do that.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO: That's right. Not everybody is assuming this debt limit thing is going to get fixed any time soon. Standard &amp; Poor's is threatening to downgrade the U.S. AAA credit rating because of the debt ceiling impasse.</p><p>But S&amp;P is concerned about the big debt future. So we could actually cut the rating even if a deal is made to raise the debt limit. The ratings firm says there is a 50-50 chance that it will cut the rating in the next three months.</p><p>And this comes just a day after Moody's put the country's debt on watched for a possible downgrade as well. The president will be holding a news conference at 11:00 a.m. as you mentioned, Dagen, to give an update on the status of those talks.</p><p>He is giving congressional leaders a break from negotiations today. The leaders involved in the talks will instead meet with their members and report back to the president by Saturday morning about a possible deal.</p><p>Meantime, Senator Mitch McConnell's Plan B is starting to gain some support. McConnell is in talks with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the plan. It would allow the president to raise the debt ceiling in three installments.</p><p>Now let's check in on the Asian markets with Fox Business contributor, Katie Sargent who joins us by phone from Singapore. Hi, Katie.</p><p>KATIE SARGENT, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone): Hi, Diane. We have a kind of mixed day for Asia as the last day of the week and going into the weekend. In Japan, we say the Nikkei adding about 0.4 percent. Solo shares were up 0.7 percent some of the big tech firms like LG Electronics and SK Telecom helping bring things up there.</p><p>But it was the property stocks that were putting a pressure on China's market. Beijing yesterday announced the new home purchase limits and that weighed on the market. The Hang Seng finishing down 0.7 percent. The Shanghai composite started the day lower, but it did manage to recover. It finished up about 0.4 percent.</p><p>In Japan, some of the big exporters were doing well with Cannon and Sony both up about 1 percent, but one of the drags on the market today, Fast Retailing. That is a company that owns the unicorn train.</p><p>It drops 0.7 percent after posting another drop in quarterly profits. That is the fifth in a row. It's been hurt recently by sales that have been sagging in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Thanks, Katie. Dagen and Connell, back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, the Pentagon said that 24,000 files were stolen in a cyber attack this spring. Now the files were taken from a defense contractor. The Pentagon believes that the attacker was a foreign government.</p><p>It did not however, say which government. The admission coming as the Defense Department announced a new cyber warfare strategy. The department now will focus on bolstering network security and improving cooperation with other agencies, contractors and allies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Astronaut on the Space Shuttle \"Atlantis\" has had to deal with a second computer failure in the past week. The Astronauts switched to another of the shuttles five main computers during the failure yesterday. And NASA said there was no concern for the crew's safety. Another computer in the shuttle failed on Sunday, but was fixed after crews installed new software. NASA says it will trouble shoot the latest computer problem.</p><p>MCSHANE: Let's bring our next guest on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program, Michael Graham. Our good friend out of Boston, radio talk show host is with us live this morning. It's always good to talk to you, Michael. Good morning.</p><p>MICHAEL GRAHAM, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Good morning. How are you doing?</p><p>MCSHANE: And we are hanging in there. I guess, we'll start with the debt talks in D.C. Everybody has an impression of this back and forth. As I said earlier, markets kind of assuming it's going to get solved, but it hasn't yet. What is your particular impression of it?</p><p>GRAHAM: Four hours a day talking to folks on the radio about what's really going on and how the way they see things. And there is a lot of -- what happened to the cold, cold pragmatic solving problems Obama.</p><p>Remember when George Bush was president, it was right wing ideologue puts philosophy ahead of solutions and of course, George Bush gave us TARP, which he admitted completely against his principles.</p><p>But he said, it's emergency and it had to be done. Here we are debt ceiling, emergency crisis and yesterday, Jake Taper asked Jay Carney, the White House spokesman. What would be worse, a total collapse of the debt ceiling talks and defaulting America or Obama not getting his way?</p><p>And there it was a deer in the headlights. Either solution was equally bad. Are you kidding me? How about some compromising? The first thing that comes out of the president's mouth, two things, number one, everyone has going to have to put everything on the table. We're going to have compromise.</p><p>Number two, I will not yield. OK, I guess that kind of make sense and I don't know if you guys have any connections through the media, but the president is going to have a presser today at 11. I have a message to the White House. Could you deliver for me.</p><p>Please, God, shut up. Please stop talking. This president, the first 30 months of his presidency was mostly in Dick Cheney's undisclosed location. He rarely had pressers. Now he will not shut up. Every other day, he comes out and if you notice, he says the exact same thing every single time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By the way, I am sorry I missed you filling in as host of \"Freedom Watch\" last night. I hope you brought your wild hand gestures.</p><p>GRAHAM: You know me, absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But \"The Wall Street Journal\" --</p><p>GRAHAM: In honor of the judge who did the shirtless.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Awesome. I am not going to ask you to remove your shirt now because you actually might do it.</p><p>But \"The Wall Street Journal\" speaking of the president coming out and having a press conference Monday and today so he's booked into the week with press conferences. \"The Wall Street Journal\" came out an editorial earlier in the week and did seem to suggest that the president now that he's speaking out so much had seemed to have backed the Republicans in a corner.</p><p>Because either if you go with them and raise taxes, you're going against what you promised to your constituents. Now, or if you don't do anything, the Republicans wind up blamed for the lousy economy and any hike in interest rates that you might see?</p><p>GRAHAM: The \"Wall Street Journal\" folks are smart. They may absolutely be right, but here's what I don't get. First of all two things, the President keeps talking. He's never said what I'll cut ever.</p><p>Tell me something you will cut. He said what he won't cut, for example, high speed rail. It is far too important to keep the choo-choo train program going than solve the debt ceiling crisis. I used to run Republican campaigns for a living. It's been six years in the biz, if you will.</p><p>Why don't the Republicans in the House put together a $100 billion debt ceiling extension that comes with $100 billion in cuts, pass it in the House and then they are done. Then it's up to the president and Senate Democrats.</p><p>Are you serious, as the president said that Social Security is in danger? Are you serious that granny may be eating Alpo helper for dinner on Friday? Are you serious? If it's really that bad then you'll take the deal and pass it and go on.</p><p>But the president to say we must pass the debt ceiling at all cost, but I will veto a short term. Put it on the president. Are you serious? That's why I like the McConnell program even though it's incredibly complicated.</p><p>No one - it's like the rules on one of these reality - I mean, one of these role playing games. Am I Griffindor or am I Dumbo? I like the premise that it goes right to the White House and says, here you go, you make cuts and you can have more debt. To me that is a simple solution for the Republicans.</p><p>MCSHANE: And that seems to be the one that is gathering some sort of momentum, Mitch McConnell's plan. Michael Graham is with us from Boston today talking about the debt ceiling negotiations.</p><p>This is all happening in the backdrop of a presidential campaign that's starting to heat up. You said you ran Republican campaigns for some time. What do you think of this one? Is Sarah Palin going to get in? What do you make of the current field?</p><p>GRAHAM: Sarah Palin is not going to run, but she's going to act likes she going to run because the more she acts like she's going to run, the more money she makes and the more influence she has.</p><p>Sarah Palin is the Oprah Winfrey of the right. Why would she go to the White House and take a paycut and have less influence. So she's right where she's at.</p><p>I have a web site that I launched a few months ago called anyonebutmitt.com. And I say that as a Republican in Massachusetts who had to actually watch be governor and who gave us Romney care and it's an absolute disaster.</p><p>Romney is the H. W. Bush, Bob Dole and John McCain of 2012. Every year since 1992, the GOP establishment has said we have a weak nominee, but you have to take him. Every single year since 1992, the Republican nominee has lost the popular vote.</p><p>W-one, the presidency, but he lost the popular vote. We need a long extended primary. We need Michele Bachmann to wrestle with this issue about her husband in the clinic whether or not they were trying to, you know, convert people from - or not.</p><p>We need a long primary. We need to have Tim Pawlenty figure out, are you a fighter?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Michael, we got to go right now. We'll see you soon. Get fired up and send me pictures of you with no shirt on. Just kidding. Michael Graham, thank you.</p><p>GRAHAM: Last time I did that, I couldn't get Anthony Weiner to stop following me on Twitter.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, we all have bigger problems than that. Thank you so much.</p><p>So the real Charles Rangel is coming up. He talked to the I-man and then Imus also sat down with fabulous Martha Macallum from Fox News plus Bret Baeir and Stuart Varney are here live.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. Carl Ichan wants to own all of Clorox. The billionaire investor has sent a letter to the Clorox CEO proposing to acquire the rest of the company's shares that he doesn't already own. According to a regulatory filing, he's offering $76.50 a share and you can see shares are jumping on the news.</p><p>Google's second quarter results blew out Wall Street estimates. The company is posting a profit of $2.5 billion, adjusted earnings came in at $8.74 per share.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: What have you been up to? How is your child?</p><p>JAY MOHR: My child is amazing. He's a good boy. Boys are easy. I am glad I didn't have a girl because -- boys you can trick.</p><p>IMUS: How old is your son?</p><p>MOHR: He is 8 years old. Can I watch TV? We don't have a TV? And he goes, OK, and they go back up upstairs. A little girl would have the receipt when you bought the TV in her little file of facts in her office, in her room and she'd say I know you have a TV and you didn't get the warranty because the salesman was Africa-American and you were intimidated and she would be right. I am killing.</p><p>IMUS: We want you to be in Mohigan Sun.</p><p>MOHR: You want me to be there?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MOHR: Make some calls. You want me to call people in the boiler room. Jay Mohr calling, how about a show? I understand there is a seventh lead.</p><p>IMUS: I was going to ask you. If back in the green room, if Rob Bartlet and Tony Powell, how long it took Rob to tell you he was on Broadway and how to succeed in business.</p><p>MOHN: I actually brought it up because my wife said. Make sure you tell Rob Bartlett I saw him in Chicago and it's probably the best version of \"Cellophane Man\" I'd ever seen. He was incredible.</p><p>I told him that and he said. Why don't you come to the show I am doing now, which is Tyler Perry's family reunion. I play the white guy. I said you are better than that, Rob. You should be on a morning show with dignity.</p><p>IMUS: Were you hoping to get a call on the \"Two and a Half Men\" thing or what?</p><p>MOHR: Yes, I would like to think I could do that. Is it a win-win or is it lose-lose? Do you get the gig and they cancel it after the year and it made a run. Every since Jay Mohr in there and he just ruined the franchise.</p><p>Because the general public isn't going to know - well, that was their eight-year run. They hit the magic number. There was only a year left anyway. It is a lose, lose, but financially it's win-win. Les, call me. Call me and this is for real. We'll get everybody pregnant.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know Charlie Sheen?</p><p>MOHR: I don't know Charlie Sheen. I do take umbrage with AA stats. They really bother me when he goes AA is five percent success rate for losers.</p><p>I would like to know how he got a success rate from the organization where the second A stands of freaking anonymous. It's not like AA is rolling quarterly spreadsheets. Charlie sheen and all of the viewers knows someone and listeners knows someone whose life was saved by the program.</p><p>IMUS: I am one of them.</p><p>MOHR: Great. So Charlie Sheen's father, Martin Sheen is sober by the grace of God and by an organization called \"AA.\" Charlie sheen is mayor of crack down because he quit AA. That is 50 percent Charlie in your own house. How did you win to a freaking five?</p><p>IMUS: I think he meant rehab. The success rate of people that go to rehab is remarkably low.</p><p>MOHR: That's because most people hop the fence when they have to be honest. You know how it works.</p><p>IMUS: I went to rehab.</p><p>MOHR: You go there and bear your soul and on day three, you say I am not talking to him. You talk to him. I don't talk to you then talk to him. I got a problem with him over there.</p><p>Everyone in rehab is talking about each other instead of you and the fact you are in rehab and you call someone from the outside to bring you shoes and a money clip. The second it comes from the outside you are not getting sober. It is down to a science.</p><p>IMUS: Here is the problem. I do this all the time. I don't have all of the facts on the situation, and I blow up, like Senator Joe Lieberman was a friend of mine on the show 25 years and he announced he was not going to run again.</p><p>So I called them and said come and talk about it. It I am not doing anything. I will make it quick. I can see you are already bored eyes starting to wander.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am always up for a good Lieberman story.</p><p>IMUS: So anyway. Julie said to me. We can get Lieberman for Thursday. No, we have got people and don't worry about it and then I find out on the morning smack on MSNBC and I just went ballistic.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, if you are friends that long.</p><p>IMUS: I had already said to Julie. Tell him we'll book him next week and we don't have time for him on Thursday. I had already so he could go on whatever he wanted to, I took on a pass on it, but I forgot I had done that. I had to apologize. He came on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It went well.</p><p>IMUS: It went OK. You know my kid still has that \"Cars\" movie. It is a number of years ago.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The first cars came out in 2006. It has been five years and now \"Cars 2\" comes out June 24th.</p><p>IMUS: Larry sent Wyatt a bunch of those to tow truck deals and he still has them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I sent him a whole collection.</p><p>IMUS: He doesn't now because he is 41 years old.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Back then he was 37. He enjoyed it.</p><p>IMUS: What do you have it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Back in the day. You buy them stuff and they play with them two hours and then they are my little girl, Regan. Her name is Regan.</p><p>IMUS: Cool name.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Her first was Mr. Larry turn down the script. Little boy is four going on Ritalin. These damn kids. I have had and I am looking for a day care with dorm rooms if somebody has them.</p><p>You think you want to have kids, hang out at chucky cheese for three hours. They will put a vasectomy by the video games and ski bumps. Take my testicles. I say this to say this. My kids, if you don't have kids, you don't know what you are talking about.</p><p>They are the most wonderful thing and I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world before I had kids. You could never figure it out. Look at my little boy. I don't want to look at your stupid water head kids, pretty cute. I wish he would move his head out of the way. That's what I do now. I show everybody pictures of my kids. I have become that guy. I don't show my wife's best friend because she can't have kids and so it's kind of awkward.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCSHANE: There you go. Cable guy, get her done. He is a funny guy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Don't make reference to my family.</p><p>MCSHANE: I didn't.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I could see it in your eyes.</p><p>MCSHANE: The real Charles Rangel is coming up. He's chatting with the I- Man in the next hour. Plus, we're going to have Bret Baer and Stuart Varney both live with us. IMUS IN THE MORNING on Fox Business.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: This country's pristine credit rating now tarnished. For the second time in two days the U.S. government's AAA credit rating is being threatened with a downgrade. Standard and Poor's now says there is a 50 percent chance it will cut debt rating as the impasse over the debt ceiling continues.</p><p>However, it does appear that some progress is being made in the ongoing talks between the White House, the Democrats and Republicans. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>will talk all about it in a news conference at 11:00 Eastern Time which of course you can watch right here live on Fox Business.</p><p>The Pentagon is suffering one of the largest cyber attacks ever; 24,000 files compromised, some of them extremely sensitive. They were stolen and U.S. officials believe it was the work of foreign government.</p><p>And Casey Anthony scheduled to be released from prison on Sunday after being acquitted of murdering her daughter. But there are major concerns over her safety.</p><p>Welcome everybody. That's Connell McShane, I'm Dagen McDowell so much to cover all day long. And we are here all day long.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: We are here all -- well, we'll be on at 11:00 and with the President with his news conference at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. So I'm assuming it will be kind of you know almost a replay of the other day where it comes out and says here -- here's what we've been doing and then, takes a -- a bunch of questions.</p><p>And what's changed since the other day. I mean, maybe the Mitch McConnell plan is getting some momentum.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that -- and the \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that Obama told McConnell yesterday, I think it was yesterday in the debt discussions. He said he'd be willing to wear that shirt I think is the phrase that they use.</p><p>MCSHANE: Wear that shirt. Well it looks like -- I mean, that -- for -- for lack of having anything else it looks like that's the plan that's gaining some momentum.</p><p>Anyway, let's check in on the markets this morning. And the Dow futures are up by 20 points, S&amp;P and the NASDAQ futures are also a little bit higher. The oil price has been at $95 and change this morning. And let's take a look at where we are right now; $95.73. So just up a few cents from where we closed yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it looks like congressional leaders won't have a camp out at Camp David over the weekend. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>giving them a bit of a break from debt talks today. But he will be giving the American people an update as we were talking about on the negotiations.</p><p>Fox News' Doug Luzader is in Washington. Doug, what is really changed is -- is it the McConnell plan, is it the kind of favoritism of that plan. Is that really the latest here?</p><p>DOUG LUZADER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know there are a lot of people that see some signs of life in this debate because of the McConnell plan but you still have a lot of Republicans who are not pleased about this. So there is a discontinuing issue kind of brewing within the caucus.</p><p>But beyond that as you mentioned there will be no talks today. But there will be a lot of posture.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUZADER (voice-over): They met yet again at the White House and again came up short. Just for good measure the administration sent Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner to Congress with a stark warning.</p><p>TIMOTHY GEITHNER, TREASURY SECRETARY: We have no way to give Congress more time to solve this problem.</p><p>LUZADER: The problem is clear. We're just about to run out of borrowed money but the solution isn't. And it may not help but the negotiations could be spinning out of control. By just look at how crowded this room is.</p><p>REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), HOUSE SPEAKER: There's just too many people in there, pouring cold water on virtually every idea that gets thrown on the table.</p><p>LUZADER: Raise taxes or make deeper budget cuts. That is the dividing line. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was still trying to sell his backup plan which allows the President to borrow more but take a political hit in the process.</p><p>Other Republicans like Congressman Eric Cantor will not give in to new taxes though and he carries a great deal of sway in these talks.</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am willing to work with everybody, including Eric Cantor to solve problems. And you know my relationship with all of the leaders has been cordial, it has been professional, but I think at a certain point, the American people run out of patience.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUZADER: Well, and then, you know, you add to this -- the -- the all of the pressure coming from these ratings agencies including Standard and Poor's yesterday on the heels of Moody's and listen, even if they come to an agreement on raising the nation's debt ceiling this could be an issue that follows us because a lot of this has to do with just the size of the debt beyond the debt ceiling debate -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Troubles Doug, zero pressure from the markets and investors because they're still lending us money.</p><p>LUZADER: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: At less than three percent over ten years. Thank you for that report. Doug, take care. Doug Luzader, from Fox News.</p><p>LUZADER: You bet.</p><p>MCSHANE: Now, the one place that the markets are focused on would be Europe. And at this point investors cautiously waiting the results of stress test on European banks and as we take a look at what's happening in at least the equity markets over in Europe this morning. We have declines across the board. However, not very big declines; from Sky News, Alex Rossi join us now from London with more on the stress test, hey, Alex?</p><p>ALEX ROSSI, SKY NEWS: Hi, the Euro has fallen once again. There's a great deal of market anxiety. Not just swirling around the bank test but also about the sovereign debt crisis which just refuses to go away.</p><p>Now, in terms of the bank tests, we are looking at 91 banks, the search through their accounts is supposed to be pretty deep. But the credit ratings agencies aren't that assured by what's likely to be found there. Many people think there might be quite a lot of bad stuff lurking under the surface.</p><p>Particularly sovereign debts, Greek sovereign debt and that hasn't been included in these test. So certainly there is a bit of a credibility short fall when it comes to these tests. Not least of all because last year when they were done, two Irish banks passed only needing to be bailed out a few months later.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right Alex.</p><p>Alex Rossi there, Sky News joining us from London and we'll see what the results of those stress tests are.</p><p>MCDOWELL: May I just say, I wish Connell I could deliver the news that way. Instead I sound like I'm about ready to offer to check your oil.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, you might be.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Yes and he sounds certainly a lot more eloquent than I do. Diane what's the business news that you got for us?</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: I wish I had a British accent too. You know the Stuart Varneys of the world have it good. Anyway, we'll have to settle for our American ones.</p><p>Rebekah Brooks has resigned as chief executive of News International, guys. That's the unit of News Corporation that's been up in the center of an investigation over phone hacking. Tom Markridge (ph) of Sky Italia was named as the replacement.</p><p>Now, Brooks said in the note to the staff that she was quitting to concentrate on the investigations into the hacking incidents and quote, \"Correcting the distortions about her record\". Now, keep in mind NewsCorp is the parent of the Fox Business Networkof course.</p><p>And Citigroup is set to report earnings later this morning. The bank is expected to post a profit of 96 cents per share. While analysts are looking for revenue to come in at $19.89 billion, investors will be looking for signs the bank is on a sustainable path of growth. And the stakes are even higher now that J.P. Morgan raised the bar after reporting strong results yesterday.</p><p>Now, let's check on the Asian markets and for that, we'll go to Fox News business contributor, Katie Sargent who joins us by phone. Hi Katie.</p><p>KATIE SERGEANT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone): Hi Diane.</p><p>We had a -- a kind of a mixed day today in Asia not a lot of convictions for the market. In Japan we saw the Nikkei adding 0.4 percent to finish the week with a gain. In Seoul the KOSPI was up 0.7 percent, LG Electronics and SK Telecoms helping with the gains there.</p><p>Property stocks were the big decliners in Hong Kong and that put pressure on the overall markets, though with the Hang Seng finished down 0.3 percent. But the Shanghai composite was up about four-tenths of a percent today.</p><p>We saw big exporters doing ok today in Tokyo, Canon and Sony both up about one percent but Stock Retailing which owns the Uni Clothe Train (ph) was down .7 percent after posting a drop in quarterly profits. Trading was definitely cautious around the region, investors weighing factors like the Standards and Poor's warning on U.S. debt, the stress test for European banks and the like.</p><p>But in Japan they are heading into a three day weekend and it's a regular weekend for the rest of us so we'll see what Monday has to bring -- Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Thanks Katie, you enjoy that weekend. Dagen and Connell back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. Diane, thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now for a check on more of today's top stories, the Pentagon says that 24,000 files were stolen in a cyber attack this past -- this spring. The files were taken from a defense contractor and the Pentagon believes the attacker was a foreign government but would not say which government it was.</p><p>The admission comes as the Defense Department announced a new cyber warfare strategy. The department will now focus on bolstering network security and improving cooperation with other agencies, contractors and allies.</p><p>The Minnesota government shut down coming to an end. Governor Mark Dayton reaching a deal with Republican lawmakers to end the budget impasse that led to the longest shut down in the state's recent history. The two sides agreeing on a proposal to raise nearly $1.5 million in new revenue and half of that coming from just delaying state aid, checks to schools, Republicans did agree to drop a plan to cut the state's workforce by 15 percent.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, two planes colliding in the tarmac at Boston's Logan Airport; the wing of a Delta jet clipping the tail of another aircraft. The planes have been removed from service for inspections. One person complaining of neck pain; but otherwise really no injuries reported as a result of this. Investigators still working to figure out exactly what the circumstances were surrounding the incident.</p><p>And astronauts on space shuttle \"Atlantis\" had to deal with a second computer failure in the past week. The astronauts switched to another one of the shuttles five main computers during the failure yesterday. And NASA says that there was no concern for the crew's safety at any time.</p><p>Another computer in the shuttle failed on Sunday but it was fixed after the crews installed some new software. NASA says it will trouble shoot these latest computer problem later today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Casey Anthony getting out of jail on Sunday. Experts say that she should be concerned about her safety. There has been, of course, widespread outrage of her -- on her acquittal on charges related to the death of her two-year-old daughter Caylee.</p><p>But the police department has a plan for her release. But once she is free Anthony will not get any special protection unless there is a verified threat.</p><p>And we're spoiled to have our very own Charles Rangel on IMUS IN THE MORNING every week to shoot every day. But this week, the real thing, the real Congressman Charles Rangel will chat with the I-Man and he broke down what is making the biggest buzz in DC right now and of course the debt talk.</p><p>Here's part of that interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(REPEAT PACKAGE: INTERVIEW WITH REP. CHARLES RANGEL - JULY 13, 2011)</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCSHANE: That was a pretty good interview. We didn't know what to expect since Tony Powell is always doing his imitation of Congressman Rangel.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm a bad man.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, bad man -- now coming up a little bit later on this morning, looks like the GOP leadership and Speaker of the house John Boehner and the Majority Leader Eric Cantor, they're going to hold a news conference. So we've been talking about the President, 11:00 a.m. news conference. They are going to hold a 9:00 a.m. news conference; getting out ahead of the President.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not surprising.</p><p>MCSHANE: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And also Fox Business's Ray Hennessey is going to be up shortly to talk about the debt ceiling talks. And Bret Baier is here live from the Fox News Channel. More straight ahead.</p><p>MCSHANE: Back here at 25 minutes past the hour on IMUS IN THE MORNING. And as we said, the Republican leadership in Congress are going to hold a news conference at 9 a.m. Eastern time; we'll cover some of that. And then at 11 a.m. we're going to cover <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>holding his own news conference from the White House as these debt talks continue in D.C.</p><p>And from our newsroom this morning, Ray Hennessey director of business news here at Fox Business, is with us this morning. You know, what Dagen and I keep pointing out, Ray is that, you know, no matter what happens, no matter how much of the rhetoric heats up or no matter how much it looks like these talks are going to break down or whatever S&amp;P says, whatever Moody's says, the reaction in the financial markets so far to these debt talks has just not been there.</p><p>The assumption still being made that they're going to get this thing figured out, which I think is interesting.</p><p>RAY HENNESSEY, FBN BUSINESS NEWS DIRECTOR: It's the typical reaction where you see something that is so catastrophic and so horrible, that you figure it can't possibly happen. And I mean that's the way-- I think the financial markets understand better than the people in Washington what the implications are and so they figure, well, no one's really going to go down that road.</p><p>I would only caution that there may be some naivete in that, I don't think a lot of people in the financial market thought we'd go this far down the road. That S&amp;P credit watch move last night which was disconcerting or should be more disconcerting to the markets than anything else because it's not just tied to the debt limit, it's also tied to $4 trillion in cuts or revenue raising. I mean they put a number on that. They said that $4 trillion, 90 days, if we don't get it it's probably getting cut.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it says something, does it not, that investors don't really maybe care what the credit rating agencies have to say that they've been discredited so in the last decade.</p><p>HENNESSEY: Right but again, you've got to separate the equity investors from the bond market. If you have--</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm talking about the bond market. I'm talking about a 10- year below 3 percent at the end of yesterday.</p><p>HENNESSEY: Right, except if you go, if one of these cuts them and comes out. Then all of these people are saying, you know, we don't take this seriously. You have to take them seriously because the rates are going to rise no matter what. The borrowing rates are going to rise and the Moody's, you know, rating action the other day also included 7,000 municipal bonds on top of that, too.</p><p>So, you know, I hear you when you guys say, well, the market is not really reacting the way, what -- and some people are taking comfort in that, saying that you'll definitely get done, we'll get there, don't worry about it.</p><p>But you have to think about the eventuality that it doesn't or the possibility that it doesn't and there's a strong possibility that no deal is reached or not a credible deal. Even if you get a short-term fix in the debt ceiling, what S&amp;P was saying last night is forget that. That's a small thing, you should be able to get over that easily.</p><p>There are bigger cuts to make and judging by the way this process went, I don't know if 90 days is enough time to get their House in order. And I also don't think that the public understands -- you know, you talk in terms of the abstract about AAA rating and they think it's like a thing of national pride.</p><p>It's not. It's what's going to tie your mortgage rates. It's going tie your credit card rates. It's going to tie borrowing costs, You know, cities that are having fiscal problems now are going to have even more fiscal problems down the line if they're tied to a debt rating for the federal government because the borrowing costs are going to go up, so their deficits are going to go.</p><p>So it just gets worse and worse and worse and it's one thing to kind of warn about the doom and gloom, but the doom and gloom people have been dismissed. They shouldn't be dismissed, this is real and it can be scary.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, let's just talk for just a minute, Ray, about what would really happen. And one of the best guests we've had in the last few weeks, this guy Jay Powell from the bipartisan policy center was on with us in our 11:00 a.m. show. And he went through it.</p><p>What would happen after August 2nd, and his point -- he's a Republican by the way -- his point was that's a real deadline and real consequences after August 2nd in terms of bills that won't be paid.</p><p>HENNESSEY: Right, and it's Social Security is the biggest one, I think, that's one on August 3rd. And then you got the big one on August 15th, which is the interest payment that's due, $29 billion. And you just don't have the money. By the time we get to August 15th, you've got a running deficit of $54 billion that has to be made up and that's from the Bipartisan Policy Center's analysis.</p><p>So every day there's more bills to pay and you know what -- you're looking at the chart that we have and that's just with the big ones. Every day there's $500 million in federal salary and benefits.</p><p>So you can -- you know everyone keeps talking, well, we can make cuts here and there, we won't run out of money. That's not true. You can make all the cuts in the world if you're starting from a deficit you still need the revenue to come in.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: $135 billion for the month according to Bipartisan Policy Center, something like that.</p><p>HENNESSEY: Right, you need the money to come in. You don't have enough money coming in from revenue, you're going to get less. You know I heard somebody on the air saying we can just sell -- the government can sell its property and make up the other thing. Who's ever been involved in a property transaction that takes a week?</p><p>MCDOWELL: We've got gold though, largest gold reserves in the world.</p><p>HENNESSEY: And you dump that gold on the market and see what happens to the price.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly what we have been talking about right.</p><p>HENNESSEY: Right. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We have to go. Thank you Ray Hennessey, director of business news right here on Fox Business.</p><p>HENNESSEY: Thanks.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE: Much more to come as we continue, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>Bret Baier is going to be with us, he'll get through all this, he knows what's going on in D.C., he'll be with us live and then Stuart Varney later this hour.</p><p>IMUS IN THE MORNING on Fox Business, don't go away.</p><p>MCSHANE: For the second time in two days the U.S. Government's credit rating threatened with a downgrade, this time it's S&amp;P saying there's a 50 percent chance they'll drop the U.S. from the triple-A status as the talk over the debt ceiling continues. We will talk more with Bret Baier in a minute.</p><p>Meanwhile it appears progress is being made between the White House and Congressional Leaders, as <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>will have a news conference at 11 a.m. eastern. Republicans at 9 a.m. eastern and we will bring you at least part or of both of those news conferences on Fox Business.</p><p>There's word out of the Pentagon it's suffered one of the largest cyber attacks ever, 24,000 files, some of them extremely sensitive were stolen and U.S. Officials believe it's the work of a foreign Government.</p><p>Casey Anthony set to be released on Sunday after being acquitted of murdering her daughter, and there are concerns for her safety.</p><p>Along with Dagen McDowell, I'm Connell McShane. This is IMUS IN THE MORNING and we'll take you to VARNEY AND COMPANY at 9:20 and Varney himself will be joining us later on in the hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I won't blather on because we have Bret Baier from Fox News. But quickly, take a look at how the markets are holding up this morning, again, not much reaction to the debt curfuffle, tussle going on in D.C. and we have green across the screen there. And we have oil earlier in the session, it was slightly lower, it was down about 15 cents a barrel. If you want to take a look at that.</p><p>MCSHANE: Here you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And now 17 cents a barrel before we go to business news.</p><p>MCSHANE: Diane Macedo standing in our Newsroom with that and everybody is talking about the ratings after the S&amp;P comments.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, guys, Standard &amp; Poor's is threatening to downgrade the U.S.'s triple-A rating because of the debt ceiling impasse. S&amp;P are concerned about the debt picture and could cut the rating even if a deal to raise the debt limit is reached. The ratings firm says there's a 50-50 chance they'll cut the rating in the next three months and this comes a day after Moody's put the country's debt on watch for a possible downgrade as well.</p><p>And the President will be holding a news conference as you mentioned at 11 a.m. eastern to give an update on the status of those debt talks and giving Congressional Leaders a break from negotiations today. Leaders involved with the talks will instead meet with their members and report back to the President by Saturday morning about a possible deal.</p><p>And meantime, Senator Mitch McConnell's plan B is starting to gain some support. McConnell is in talks with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the plan, it would allow the President to raise the debt ceiling in three instalments.</p><p>Let's check in on the Asian markets now with Fox Business Contributor, Katie Sargent who joins us by phone.</p><p>Hi again, Katie.</p><p>KATIE SARGENT, FBN BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR (by telephone): Hi, Diane.</p><p>Asian stocks ending mixed and cautious on low volume trading today ahead of the weekend. In Japan the Nikkei was up about four tenths of a percent. In Seoul, Kospi was up seven tenths of a percent but property stocks putting pressure on Chinese markets after Beijing announced the new home purchase limits, the Hang Seng finished down about point four percent with the property developers leading the declines there. The Shanghai Composite recovered early losses and ended the day up point four percent.</p><p>And with the dollar holding above the 79 Yen level some of the big exporters doing well in Tokyo today and we saw Cannon and Sony gaining about one percent. But Fast Retailing, owner of a clothing chain dropped seven tenths of a percent after posting a drop in quarterly profit.</p><p>Trading was cautious and investors weighing other factors like the Standard &amp; Poor's warning on U.S. debt, the stress test for European banks and it's a three day weekend in Japan so that kept a lot of people on the sidelines for the day as well, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Thanks, Katie.</p><p>And Connell, back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE: Diane now, if you take a look at the other top stories that we have here for you today. The Pentagon says 24,000 files were stolen in a cyber attack this morning. The files were taken from a Defense Contractor and the Pentagon believes the attacker was a foreign Government. It did not, however, say which Government was suspected. Now the admission coming as the Defense Department announcing the new cyber warfare strategy and the department will focus on bolstering network security and improving co- operation with other agencies, contractors and allies.</p><p>Astronauts on Space Shuttle Atlantis had to deal with a second computer failure in the the past week and switched over to another one of the Shuttle's five main computer systems during the failure yesterday. And NASA said there was no concern at anytime during this for the crew's safety. Another computer in Shuttle failed on Sunday, but fixed after the crews installed new software and NASA says it will trouble shoot this latest computer problem later on today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Five people are dead after a man hiding explosives in his turban blew himself up during a Memorial Service at an Afghan Mosque yesterday. Afghan officials were inside the mosque at the time of the explosion. They were attending a Memorial Service for President -- the President's assassinated half-brother Waleed Karzai. One high ranking official did die in the attack. Waleed Karzai who was considered one of the region's most powerful men was assassinated on Tuesday.</p><p>In California, students will have a new lesson on their agenda soon. The state has become the first in the United States to require public schools to include lessons about gay history in social study classes. California Governor Jerry Brown signed the landmark bill into law yesterday. The supporters of the controversial bill say it will help encourage acceptance, but critics say it could open up to sexual and identity issues at a young age.</p><p>MCSHANE: We're continuing on IMUS IN THE MORNING and we'll continue to talk about the big story of the day and week of the last few weeks, that would be the debt talks going on in Washington D.C. and duelling news conferences, 9 a.m. the Republican Leadership and 11 a.m. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>and joining us to talk more about it is Bret Baier, the host of SPECIAL REPORT, on the Fox News Channel and he is joining us on the phone right now.</p><p>Is the Mitch McConnell plan, Senator Mitch McConnell's plan, Bret, really, as the reports suggest, starting to gain serious momentum?</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX, HOST OF SPECIAL REPORT: Good morning guys.</p><p>I think it is. Everything we're getting from Capitol Hill is that there are intense efforts by Senator McConnell and Senator Reid to kind of beef up the original frame work of this deal, which was originally seen as a last ditch effort and a backup plan, an escape hatch, whatever you want to call it. And apparently in the talks as they're going, it's not appearing to anybody at the table that it's really going to happen on a big framework so while there are some still talking about a big deal I think the most promising action so far is McConnell's escape hatch.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bret, describe this sense of urgency that you feel and sense in the nation's Capital? Connell and I talked about it for days, if not weeks. The bond market in particular, those people willing to loan money to the U.S. Government have continued to do so in exceptionally low interest rates. They have sent no signs of panic, no signs of urgency, and do -- basically are these Lawmakers, getting a free pass, if you will. Because there's not that pressure on them right now?</p><p>BAIER: I think it's starting to change. Like, the last couple of days has had a different feel to it in the intensity. You saw the President described by Republicans as getting up abruptly at the end of the meeting, described by Democrats as getting frustrated and leaving, you know, at the end of a long meeting and demanding that there be a resolution within 24 to 36 hours of yesterday.</p><p>So, I think it's a different feel, but I agree with you, Dagen, that the pressure is not as great coming from the outside. I will say that the Moody's warning, and now the S&amp;P warning, and also, I think the S&amp;P situation is interesting as well in that it could be downgraded even if the debt ceiling is not-- is raised, rather, because of the concern over the mounting debt.</p><p>And you know, that's the underlying issue that these lawmakers, sometimes we forget in the context of, okay, you can raise the debt ceiling, but remember, you also have this massive monster problem.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's the one I'm surprised we don't see a little bit more market reaction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do lawmakers talk to investors because we interviewed Eric Palichiro from Black Rock, and he essentially said that, he didn't talk about the credit rating.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He says the one thing he cares about that you can get past the debt ceiling increase, but you've got to worry about how much they cut and how, how contentious it is and are we going to revisit this in a year and a half.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's the thing about the McConnell plan, we'll continually revisit it in some ways because of the way it's structured, right?</p><p>BAIER: It is, it comes in three tranches and basically Congress' role is a disapproval role and gives the President authority to raise it and come back to Congress to disapprove and by the way it's written, it's supposed to be a dollar for dollar spending cuts with the amount that they're raising at the time on the debt ceiling.</p><p>Now, the issue here is that it takes the big ticket tax reform, which is largely seen as the biggest deficit reducer, because Republicans could sign onto it, if you're restructuring the way that taxes are and closing tax loopholes, but bringing down the corporate tax rate, you get everybody on. But the problem is it's not in the McConnell plan and either is dealing with Medicare and Social Security in any long-term way.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bret, in terms of the lawmakers, who has gotten more bruised at this point in terms of their reputation? The focus lately on the Democrats, when you listen to what Harry Reid had to say about Congressman Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader, who right now is on the ropes more than others?</p><p>BAIER: Well, it seems that Republicans are -- have really taken a couple of days of tough media. Now, whether, you know, the media overall is just buying the Administration line, we'll see, but I think there is a little bit more to the split. You know, you have the McConnell plan that's kind of split off of the House Republicans and really if it works perfectly for McConnell, he would isolate the House Republicans because they wouldn't be able to pass anything like that in the House.</p><p>And you have the split between Boehner and Cantor, so, I think the Republican side has taken a PR hit. The question is as you get closer to this date, the President has a lot on the line here and the pressure will build on him.</p><p>MCSHANE: Does the fact that the Republicans have taken a hit in the near term make them more likely to give in or less likely that a deal gets done? Because if they really are so fractured they can't come together to get the votes?</p><p>BAIER: Yes, an interesting thing that Speaker Boehner said the other day, after our interview on SPECIAL REPORT, is that when the President mentions Social Security, the checks possibly not going out August 3rd, by the way, really quickly, you know, he's accurate in that, in that the cash flow on August 3rd, it would require another day or so, according to the experts, for the cash flow to be there for the checks to go out. So he could have easily said, those checks will go out, but they might be delayed by a day or two or three, but he didn't. He said they're not going to go out August 3rd.</p><p>Anyway, the lights on phones all over the Capitol lit up and lawmakers were getting calls from everywhere. Speaker Boehner said after our interview that actually, that statement helped him get to some of the lawmakers that weren't fully comprehending the extent of the issue and some who still don't believe it, but House Republicans, many of them after that, started taking another look at we have to get something through.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, that the money just will not be there essentially.</p><p>BAIER: It will there be eventually.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Eventually.</p><p>BAIER: You're going to have the revenue coming in, but it's a cash flow issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bret, it was great to talk to you.</p><p>Quickly, the Wall Street Journal has a story today, headline is about Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats gaining leverage here when you talk about all the votes on the Republican side that will not be there for a debt ceiling increase and now, how she's kind of holding some cards again, shocking.</p><p>BAIER: She is. And she's-- it's amazing. She has positioned herself well to wedge into this entire negotiation and to be a big player and I really think that she, she thinks that because of all of this and because of the entitlement reform issue, that she's going to take the Speakership back.</p><p>MCSHANE: What a story that would be. Bret, thanks.</p><p>BAIER: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you for calling, Bret. Terrific as always. So good to see you, so early in the morning and of course, because Bret works late. Catch him every week night at 6 p.m. eastern time on the Fox News Channel.</p><p>Meantime, Stuart Varney will be here when we come back and next hour, radio talk show host and my fave Laura Ingraham is talking about her new book and Lou Dobbs and Dr. Keith Ablow, all superstars and all live right here.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>Google's second quarter results blew out Wall Street estimates. The company's posting a profit of two and a half billion dollars. Adjusted earnings came in at $8.74 per share and revenue jumped more than 30 percent from a year ago to nearly 7 billion dollars. Shares are soaring this morning in the pre-market.</p><p>And billionaire investor Carl Icahn is offering to buy Clorox for a little more than 10 billion dollars. According to a regulatory filing Icahn sent a letter to the CEO proposing to buy the rest of the company shares they don't own. He is offering $76.50 a share and that represents a 11 percent premium to yesterday's closing price. Clorox is saying it will review the proposals and you can see shares are jumping on the news.</p><p>Dagen and Connell, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Diane.</p><p>MCSHANE: Continuing here on IMUS IN THE MORNING none other than Stuart Varney ahead of his own program 9:20 eastern.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Almost did it, almost did it.</p><p>MCSHANE: What did I almost do?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stuart Varney!</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN, HOST OF VARNEY AND COMPANY: Could I make an opening comment.</p><p>MCSHANE: Do whatever you want.</p><p>VARNEY: You two make the best on air couple at eleven o'clock in the morning. You're an inspiration to the rest of us.</p><p>MCSHANE: What do you want.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's very hard to make me uncomfortable, but I'm uncomfortable now.</p><p>VARNEY: But you look so natural sitting next to this much younger man.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh!</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm leaving, I really--</p><p>MCSHANE: That was good.</p><p>VARNEY: Look, I--</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's quite a bit younger than I am. Younger than my husband even.</p><p>VARNEY: And he's young enough to be my son, grandson.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That hurts. Need to be on more with Imus more often with that.</p><p>MCSHANE: I don't know where to go from there. Speaking of Standard &amp; Poor's, Stuart. You brought the a-game this morning.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes. What do you want to know?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, this, this move from S&amp;P and now it's saying basically the ratings firm S&amp;P is saying even if you get the debt ceiling thing figured out. You're still in trouble.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, I think this raises the threat level, the danger level, even more. Over and above what they did yesterday and the day before. Because, as you point out, they're saying, look, even if you pass the debt ceiling increase, it doesn't matter. Maybe we won't like it and maybe we'll still downgrade you.</p><p>Which means, if they don't come up with a deal and a deal that they like, you get downgraded, which means <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>could be the first sitting President, I think since 1917, to preside over a downgrade. And lets he' be clear what a downgrade is. A downgrade is lowering your financial reputation, your stature in the world. America is the gold standard of reputations, financially, and now that's about to be taken down a notch or whatever? Under <person><nameText>President Obama? </nameText></person>He has to get some of the blame for this regardless of what he says about the Republicans. It's on his watch. He must be aware of this, I'm sure he is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here is the thing, we were talking about it in the break, that Eric PaliChiro of Black Rock was on and he said essentially that very thing. He said even if the debt ceiling is increased what kind of deal gets done, what size what was he put on it --</p><p>VARNEY: Four trillion.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, this guy, was it two trillion Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: It was 2 trillion in his view.</p><p>VARNEY: I put four.</p><p>MCDOWELL: For the market.</p><p>VARNEY: The under over for the downgrade. If the deal doesn't come up with four trillion dollars of cuts--</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's talking about the market reaction, what would bother him and also, not only what gets done, what cuts are made, how much is the deficit reduced, but how does it get done in terms of political interaction. However, these bond investors say that, but then you watch the market and I struggle to make sense of it, that the fact that the ten- year deal is still below three percent and people are willing to loan us money at less than three percent, annually over ten years.</p><p>VARNEY: I can explain it, I can explain it. You would think that in times of debt crisis like this in America, people would not buy our debt.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>VARNEY: You'd think interest rates were going up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Or demand four percent or more or five.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, but you've got chaos in Europe.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>VARNEY: Where is all the hot money going, into the Euro? I don't think so. No, it comes here. But this moment in time, the dollar is a safe haven. So they buy treasuries, the price goes up, interest rates go down. That's how you explain this counter intuitive, what's going on at the moment. There is an explanation for it, but given a little time, if we do get a downgrade, you cannot rely on those low interest rates.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And some have clearly gone into gold, which was at a record the other day.</p><p>VARNEY: It was 1580 this morning on gold.</p><p>MCSHANE: It even makes the discussions in Washington going on there, the back and forth and duelling news conferences we will get today, makes it more silly. No matter what you think, everybody agrees we need to cut spending and a matter of how much and all that, whatever you think of that, we could essentially create our crisis here, I mean, Europe has to pay these rates and deal with this because, I mean, they're just going through what they're going through, but from our point of view, we already have low interest rates and now we're going to create a crisis. What are we doing?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And our debt situation isn't as bad as Europe.</p><p>VARNEY: It's not as bad as Europe, but it's getting there. It is getting there.</p><p>MCSHANE: If we don't raise the debt ceiling, we're essentially bringing on something sooner than we have to bring it on, doing it to ourselves.</p><p>VARNEY: That's the short-term crisis and I think the crisis hits this weekend. If we don't come up with a deal of some sort, a really good big time cutting deal by this weekend or first thing Monday morning, I think you've got a real problem on your hands.</p><p>The longer term problem is I think we are going in the direction of Europe. Our debt situation, long-term, is not that far removed from some of the weaker European countries.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Editorial in the Journal today about the percentage of spending that is of the GDP that's Government spending.</p><p>VARNEY: Twenty five percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the Obama Administration has taken it.</p><p>VARNEY: Twenty five percent, the historical norm in America is 20, 21.</p><p>MCSHANE: Stuart, we've got to run. You're looking great for a man of your age.</p><p>VARNEY: Nicely done, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Thank you for coming on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm going to take my Geritol.</p><p>MCSHANE: A quick nap before the 9:20 show.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And as Connell said you can catch VARNEY AND COMPANY at 9:20 eastern time on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>MCSHANE: And top stories are coming up next.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, For the second time in two days, the U.S. government's credit rating is really being threatened with a possible downgrade. This time S&amp;P says there's a 50 percent chance they could drop the U.S. from its AAA status as the impasse over the debt ceiling continues. We'll talk more about that as it appears at least some progress is being made in the ongoing talks between the White House and congressional leaders. The president, <person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>will hold a news conference at 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time this morning. We'll carry that live. Republican leadership with their own news conference in about an hour.</p><p>There's word out of the Pentagon today that it has suffered one of the largest cyber attacks ever. Twenty-four thousand files, some of them extremely sensitive, were stolen. U.S. officials believe it was the work of a foreign government.</p><p>And Casey Anthony's scheduled to be released from prison on Sunday after being acquitted of murdering her daughter, but there are some real concerns over her safety, which we will talk about coming up here.</p><p>Along with Dagen McDowell, I'm Connell McShane. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues up till \"Varney &amp; Company\" at 9:20.</p><p>Want to go to breaking earnings here real quick.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Citigroup.</p><p>MCSHANE: Citigroup's out. It looks better than expected on first glance. And JP Morgan was quite strong yesterday. The first number we see for Citi is $1.09 a share for its last quarter. It was expected to have earnings of 96 cents. So that's a better than expected figure. Stocks up in the pre- market. Also, $20 billion plus in revenue, 20.6 versus an estimate below 20. So Citigroup looks pretty good. Pretty good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Net credit losses also an important figure the street watches (INAUDIBLE) down 35 percent from the prior year to $5.1 billion.</p><p>MCSHANE: I almost forget about corporate earnings with everything that's been going on in Washington, but that could drive markets. We'll see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Particularly the banks. And you're seeing a reaction there in the markets. The Dow futures are now up 43. S&amp;P and Nasdaq also gaining. They're up about 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq, though, up nearly 0.5 percent also in terms of great earnings news.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Google really blew it out of the water. Google's back. Everybody was talking about Google as it being kind of under fire from FaceBook and all these other, Groupon, you name it.</p><p>MCSHANE: Look at that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And take a look at that stock in pre-market trading.</p><p>MCSHANE: Almost $600.</p><p>All right. Well, we talked about what's going on in Washington. There's still no deal to raise the debt ceiling. Congressional leaders getting a day off from negotiations. And they're going to have plenty of news conferences. I guess that's how they'll spend their time. Peter Barnes is at the White House this morning. Peter joins us now from the North Lawn.</p><p>Good morning. What's the latest there?</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Connell, everybody has to keep staking out their positions here before any kind of final deal. And we will hear the president doing that at his news conference at 11:00. He will brief the nation on the status of the budget negotiations that have been going on here five days in a row. But no meetings today to allow leaders of Congress to go back to their respective caucuses today to brief them on these latest talks. Take the members' temperatures on what's been done so far. Find out what is possible. What can get 218 votes in the House, 60 votes in the Senate. Explore what is possible, according to one Democratic official.</p><p>All sides say, however, that all parties have agreed on $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion or so in spending cuts over 10 years. Democrats say that's the most that they can agree to in a package that does not include tax increases. Republicans want more, but they won't turn that down. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We are now in a situation where our side, the White House, has made clear, in a presentation yesterday, that, you know, are significant cuts, $1.5 trillion in cuts, that everybody can agree on. Real and significant. An additional $200 billion in cuts that essentially we believe everybody can agree on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: Now, there seems to be a lot of buzz about trying to combine those spending cuts with the McConnell plan from Senator Mitch McConnell, the lead of Senate Republicans. His plan would raise the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion through the next election, as <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>wants, in three different installments. And basically complicated mechanics, but basically it would require a two-thirds vote to prevent in either chamber. House Speaker Boehner says that this is an idea that he's looking at and could be something that House Republicans could consider. But also Democratic Leader Pelosi is not shooting this idea down either. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: I think everyone who's concerned about lifting the debt ceiling is saying bravo for Senator McConnell to say this must be done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: But House Republicans do not like the standalone McConnell plan which would just require proposed spending cuts from the president. They are going to continue to pound the table for real spending cuts as part of any final deal. We'll hear from House Republicans at 9:00 this morning.</p><p>Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Let me ask you about the Republicans in particular, Peter, because there's kind of an interesting development in their conference meeting today. They've got Jay Powell, who worked for President Bush. We've had him on our show at 11:00. We had him on a few weeks ago. He was a very interesting guest from the Bipartisan Policy Center. His numbers or his group's numbers are really being picked up by everybody in terms of what would actually happen after August 2nd. He thinks it's a real deadline. He thinks after that you're $130 billion plus short in terms of the money coming in -- or versus coming out. And just in the month of --</p><p>BARNES: $160 billion short. $160 billion short (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, OK, fine, it's even a little bit bigger than that in the month of August.</p><p>BARNES: I know, I talk to Jay frequently.</p><p>MCSHANE: But I -- right, I was going to -- yes, he was great when he was on with us. But I was -- this is what I was going to ask you about with regard to that. I think it's interesting that he's going to be briefing the Republicans today because I wonder whether or not they need to be convinced, some in that caucus, that that date, August 2nd, is for real and it's not just some sort of fear mongering.</p><p>BARNES: Well, Jay Powell is a credible person to come in and brief House Republicans. He was the man in charge of domestic finance of the deficit for George H.W. Bush, the first President Bush. He worked in the Treasury Department for three years. He knows this stuff intimately.</p><p>Jay has been out talking to a lot of people. But he is a Republican. A former Republican Treasury official with credibility in town. So, Speaker Boehner and the rest of the leadership wants him to just go in -- this is an informational briefing, but his numbers are very tough on all of this and he says the government will run out of money on August 2nd and that they -- that the administration is not bluffing about that.</p><p>Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: And I think, just to read between the lines, that the Republican leadership, they're trying to convince some of the rank and file of that --</p><p>BARNES: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: That you've been speaking of.</p><p>BARNES: Yes.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's what's going on today.</p><p>BARNES: A lot of those guys were elected on shrinking government --</p><p>MCSHANE: Exactly.</p><p>BARNES: Shrinking deficits, shrinking government spending and that is going to have to be part of any deal -- final deal for this to get through Congress.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. All right, Peter Barnes live at the White House.</p><p>Thank you, Peter.</p><p>BARNES: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Even though the markets, bond investors don't seem to be worried about the warnings of ratings cuts, a downgrade could still have a big trickledown effect. Adam Shapiro is in Newark, New Jersey.</p><p>Adam, it's not just the country's debt rating at risk, it goes far and wide.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. There's about 7,000 plus different bond issues that municipalities like Newark, New Jersey, several cities, several towns across the country have issued that have backing through the U.S. government so that if the debt rating is lowered, if the credit rating, rather, is lowered, the credit rating for these municipalities on those bond issues is also lowered and a number of things happen. The most obvious is that for a place like Newark to borrow money in the future would become more expensive because interest rates would be higher. But in some cases, depending on the negotiations or the deal that was put forth in the bond offering, they may have to come up with money almost immediately to satisfy some kind of penalty for the drop in the credit rating.</p><p>So that would be very difficult for a municipality like Newark. This is a city, like others across the country, which has laid off police officers, laid off firefighters because of their tight budget problems. So if you add that situation with the credit rating dropping to their budget woes, it is just a recipe for even more difficulty.</p><p>Here in Newark, four of the bond issues have to do with public housing. One has to do with the hospital and health care assistance. So you can see how this would hit not only in Newark, but in hits municipalities just like it.</p><p>Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Adam, thank you for that. Adam Shapiro in Newark, New Jersey.</p><p>And, Diane, you have more business news for us this morning.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Billionaire Carl Icahn is offering to buy Clorox for a little more than $10 billion, Dagen. According to a regulatory filing, Icahn sent a letter to the Clorox CEO proposing to acquire the rest of the company's shares that he doesn't already own. Now, he's offering $76.50 a share. That's an 11 percent premium to yesterday's closing price. Clorox says this morning it will review the proposal.</p><p>Another story out of Europe. Rebekah Brooks has resigned as chief executive of News International. That's the unit of News Corporation that's been at the center of an investigation over phone hacking. Tom Mockridge, head of Sky Italia, was named as her replacement. Brooks said in a staff note that she was quitting to concentrate on the investigations into the hacking incidents and, quote, correcting the distortions about her record. News Corp. is the parent of the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Connell, back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Diane.</p><p>Now the Pentagon says 24,000 files were stolen in a cyber attack that happened this spring. Now the files were taken from a defense contractor and the Pentagon believes the attacker was a foreign government but it wouldn't say which foreign government. The admission coming as the Defense Department announced a new cyber warfare strategy. The department now will focus on bolstering network security and improving cooperation with other agencies, contractors and allies.</p><p>The Minnesota government shutdown coming to an end as Governor Mark Dayton reached a deal with Republican lawmakers to end a budget impasse that led to the longest shutdown in recent history. The two sides agreed on a proposal to raise nearly $1.5 billion in new revenue. Half that coming from delaying state aid checks to schools. Republicans agreed to drop a plan to cut the state work force by 15 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Two planes colliding on the tarmac at Boston's Logan Airport. The wing of a Delta jet clipping the tail of a -- one of another aircraft. The planes have been removed from service for inspections. One person complaining of neck pain. Otherwise, no injuries were reported. Investigators are still working to figure out the circumstances surrounding that fender bender. Even though it wasn't fenders.</p><p>Also, astronauts on the space shuttle Atlantis have had to deal with a second computer failure in the past week. The astronauts switched to another one of the shuttle's five main computers during the failure yesterday. And NASA said there was no concern for the crew's safety. Another computer in the shuttle failed on Sunday, but was fixed after crews installed new software. NASA says it will troubleshoot the latest computer glitch today.</p><p>MCSHANE: And Casey Anthony getting out of jail on Sunday. Some experts say she should be a little concerned about her safety. There's been widespread outrage after she was acquitted on charges related to the death of her two- year-old daughter Caylee. Now, the police department has a plan for her release. But once she's free, then she will not get any special protection unless there is some sort of a verified threat. But, again, getting out of jail on Sunday.</p><p>All right, IMUS IN THE MORNING continues here, 12 minutes past the hour. And one of the I-man's favorites, the radio talk show host Laura Ingraham. She stopped by to talk about her new book. It's called \"Of Thee I Zing.\" And Laura takes on, well, muffin tops, spoiled children, other cultural observations that she makes and shares with Imus. Here's a little bit of that interview.</p><p>(LAURA INGRAHAM REPEAT PACKAGE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Laura Ingraham, fantastic. And also fantastic, John Stossel of Fox News. He's coming up. And then later this hour, Mr. Lou Dobbs will join us.</p><p>MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.</p><p>Let's kick things off with a look at the markets. Taking a look at futures right now. They're in green territory. Dow futures are up 48 points. The S&amp;P's up 5. And the Nasdaq's up almost 11. Markets aren't affected that much by the warning from S&amp;P. I mean, as you can see, futures are up. And coming up in just a few minutes, we'll get the latest look at the consumer index price.</p><p>Now, Citigroup, meanwhile, is reporting better than expected earnings. Net income is $3.3 billion. That works out to $1.09 per share. The estimate was 96 cents a share. And revenue came in at $20.62 billion, also beating the estimates. The company says credit losses declined 35 percent from the same time a year ago. And shares, as you can imagine, are rising in the pre- market.</p><p>Connell, back to you.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Diane.</p><p>Now, dueling news conferences coming up. We're going to have the GOP leadership at the top of the next hour, 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. And then <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>at 11:00. So, Mike Emanuel -- let's go back to the White House, where Mike Emanuel, the White House correspondent for Fox News, is there for us this morning.</p><p>What do we expect to hear -- it's almost like deja vu all over again here, Mike -- from the president this time around?</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Connell, it's interesting because after five consecutive days of meetings here at the White House, behind closed doors with congressional leaders, it became pretty apparent that a grand bargain that the president was hoping for was not going to happen. So he sent them back to Capitol Hill and said, I'm giving you 24 to 36 hours to see what you guys can come up with. We may do some meetings over the course of the weekend.</p><p>But, for now, essentially what they're doing is dueling press conferences. House Republicans within the hour taking their case directly to the American people. Then the president of the United States at 11:00 Eastern Time will make his case about essentially what he wants to do. And he's tried to frame himself as the adult in the room during these negotiations. So you can expect more of that, Connell.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, it's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>So do you think that the rhetoric will get increasingly, for lack of a better word, nasty? Because you have president -- the president book-ending the week with press conferences, which, correct me if I'm wrong, we haven't seen during his presidency. And I just wonder, because you have leaks coming out about what is said behind the scenes, and this is a way for certainly the Republicans to get out in front of it.</p><p>EMANUEL: You know, Dagen, it's been quite a study. You're correct, the president can go months without doing a full-blown news conference. This will be his third in two weeks. So clearly feeling like taking his case directly to the American people puts pressure on lawmakers to get something done.</p><p>But it hasn't worked so far. And so will today be different? We know that time is running out. The August 2nd deadline is coming in a hurry. But the politics of this are difficult because there are some House Republicans who are not going to vote for raising the debt ceiling no matter what. There are some Democrats who are not going to want to touch entitlement reform at all. And there are a lot of Republicans who are not going to want to raise taxes. And so everybody's in their respective corners, if you will. Willing to compromise a bit, but not enough to get the votes necessary to pass a bipartisan, major deal through Congress at this point.</p><p>So they're looking for smaller compromises. The Mitch McConnell plus plan is something that may be taking shape on Capitol Hill. So it's something we're watching to see what happens.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Mike, good to see you, as always. Good stuff. Mike Emanuel from the White House from Fox News.</p><p>EMANUEL: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And we are joined now on the phone by John Stossel of the Fox Business Network.</p><p>John, thanks so much for calling in this morning. I want to get your reaction to what you see going on down in Washington. And it's really erupted into what looks like to be a nasty little fight or a nasty big fight between the Republicans and the Democrats.</p><p>JOHN STOSSEL, FOX NEWS (via telephone): Well, it's a big issue. So we ought to have a nasty, big fight. I just think, isn't $2.5 trillion enough? It's about a trillion more than they spent just a couple of years ago. They ought to be able to find enough money in there to pay the debt we owe.</p><p>MCSHANE: So you figure that then both sides should give and we should -- or maybe already had a deal done or that this grand bargain, the $4 trillion number that they were talking about, is just a little bit too -- a little bit too much?</p><p>STOSSEL: Well, no, I disagree with both those points. I don't know that both should give in. I think if one side is saying we need higher taxes so we can keep spending more --</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>STOSSEL: Then that's a bad argument. And $4 trillion doesn't sound like all that much to me when it's over 10 years when we're spending, what, $46 trillion projected in those 10 years? Companies cut 10 percent every five years. I remember when Cap Cities took over ABC. They just cut 10 percent and we (ph) -- oh, it's terrible. We can't deal with that. We made the adjustment. Happened again when somebody else bought Cap Cities. Disney bought Cap Cities. And they had a -- GE used to call that the creative destruction that keeps your company going.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>STOSSEL: That was when GE was a growth company rather than just sucking from the government.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well said, John Stossel.</p><p>John, and that really leads us to what you did on your show last night, because we're talking about -- because you're equating what's going on in Washington with what happens in business very often. And you looked at Herman Cain last night and asked the question of, is it now time for this country to elect a businessman. But did you find that Americans -- the American people knew who Herman was?</p><p>STOSSEL: No. I walked around Times Square with a big picture of him and maybe one in 15 knew who he was. Though some people said, oh, yes, he's that guy who owns the pizza shop, right?</p><p>I argued last night that -- I don't know that Herman Cain is the one who would be a good president, but he's mocked by some in the political class for not having had political experience, but why does that qualify you to be president, because you're experienced at smiling at people when you don't mean it and asking people for money and sucking up to people that would make you a good president? At least a businessman has -- a business person, sorry, has had experience in managing things and knows that you can't spend more money than you have or you'd go out of business.</p><p>MCSHANE: What about that challenge, though, of being taken or being considered to be a quote/unquote serious candidate? Is that something somebody like Herman Cain can overcome? And, if so, how does he go about doing it?</p><p>STOSSEL: Beats me. Not my area, politics. But, you know, what -- I'm just trying to think. Was Arnold Schwarzenegger not considered a serious candidate? And he got overwhelmingly elected despite having come straight from the movie world. Ronald Reagan wasn't considered a serious candidate by the in crowd.</p><p>MCSHANE: True.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John, that is a very good point. We're going to need to wrap it up here with you. We're going to have some breaking news coming out.</p><p>John, it was terrific to see you and it's always great to see you on the air, whether it's on the phone or in person. John Stossel of the Fox Business Network. Take care.</p><p>And we wanted to just keep a lookout on this news that's going to be coming across. Consumer prices. We're going to get the reading from the past month on that. And also we're going to be looking at the Empire State Manufacturing index. Again, manufacturing has been erratic and fairly weak in recently weeks and recent months.</p><p>MCSHANE: It was a market mover last time around. So the CPI Index is out, and it's down .2 of one percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Two-tenths.</p><p>MCSHANE: A little bit more than expected.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A little bit more than expected.</p><p>If you look at core inflation, core inflation increased .3 of a percent. This is excluding food and energy prices, which -- feel free to scoff at that, but it went up more than expected. The expectation was for an increase of .2 of a percent.</p><p>And Empire Manufacturing was down over 3 percent. So, again, the Empire Manufacturing Index coming in below expectations. Was it not? We're watching manufacturing just to get a read on whether this is going to be significant weakness in the coming months, in the coming quarters, or whether this is something fleeting.</p><p>Again, many economists -- you've heard this from Ben Bernanke as well -- that they thought that the recent weakness we've seen in the U.S. economy was related to the weather here, the tsunami, and the earthquake and tsunami over in Japan, that there was a interruption in business and activity, an interruption in manufacturing activity in the wake of that horrible disaster, and because of the weather here at home. And then the spike in gas prices on top of that.</p><p>But again, we're watching consumer prices, and not a worrisome increase in core prices, but still up more than expected.</p><p>MCSHANE: A little bit, but there's not really much in terms of signs of inflation. And the headline figure, if anything, we're seeing consumer prices go down, and that's interesting because it's the first time it's happened in quite a while. A little over a year since the last time we saw a drop in consumer prices.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Energy.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A decrease in energy prices.</p><p>Well, speaking of energy, a man who always gets Connell and me fired up, Lou Dobbs, of the Fox Business Network, is coming up.</p><p>Then later on, we're going to talk with Dr. Keith Ablow, about the release of Casey Anthony.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This country's pristine credit rating now tarnished. For the second time in two days, the U.S. government's AAA rating is being threatened with a downgrade. Standard &amp; Poor's now saying there's a 50 percent chance it will cut that AAA as the impasse over the debt ceiling continues.</p><p>However, maybe some progress is being made in the talks between the White House and congressional leaders. At 9:00 a.m. Eastern, the Republicans will come out and give a press conference. Two hours later, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>will talk to the media, 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, which of course you can watch both here on Fox Business.</p><p>And the Pentagon suffering one of the largest cyberattacks ever -- 24,000 files, some extremely sensitive, stolen. And U.S. officials believe it was the work of a foreign government.</p><p>And Casey Anthony scheduled to be released from prison on Sunday after being acquitted of murdering her daughter, but there are major concerns about her safety once she is out of jail.</p><p>Good morning, everybody. I'm Dagen McDowell.</p><p>That is Connell McShane.</p><p>So we're going to have a busy day, and we've got some incredible guests coming up as well. Lou Dobbs will be here in just a few minutes, and then Dr. Keith Ablow on the release of Casey Anthony.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. And we'll talk to Lou about the debt ceiling. And, of course, the Republicans are going to talk about it themselves at the top of the hour with their news conference, then the president at 11:00.</p><p>Let's look at the markets. We had the consumer price numbers, and the first decline in consumer prices in over a year that we just reported a moment ago.</p><p>Dow futures are up a little bit this morning. Get a quick check on the -- Dagen mentioned the importance of energy in these inflation figures. The oil price this morning is $96 and change, so we're up by almost 40 cents from where we closed it out yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Diane is about ready to give you more on those inflation numbers.</p><p>Hey, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Hi, guys.</p><p>Well, as you touched on, we just got the latest on retail inflation. And consumer prices in June came down .2 of a percent.</p><p>Now, that was a bigger-than-expected decline. The estimate was for a decline of .1 of a percent. If you factor out the volatile food and energy component, the so-called core number rose .3 of a percent. And the estimate there was for an increase of .2 of a percent.</p><p>We also got the latest reading on Empire Manufacturing. That index came in with a reading of negative 3.76. The estimate was for a positive reading of 4.50. That, last month, it came in at negative 7.8, a number that rocked the markets.</p><p>Standard &amp; Poor's is threatening to downgrade the U.S.' AAA credit rating because of the debt ceiling impasse. But S&amp;P is concerned about the big debt picture, so it could even still cut the rating if a deal to raise the debt limit is reached.</p><p>The ratings firm says there's a 50-50 chance it will cut the rating in the next three months. And this comes just a day after Moody's put the country's debt on watch for a possible downgrade as well.</p><p>Google's earnings, meanwhile, blew out the estimates. Shares are up about 70 bucks in the pre-market trading. The company is posting a profit of $2.5 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $8.74 a share, and revenue jumped nearly $7 billion.</p><p>Now for a check on the day's top stories.</p><p>Connell, let's throw it back to you.</p><p>(NEWSBREAK)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues here on Fox Business, leading up to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" at 9:20 Eastern Time.</p><p>But our next guest here to talk a little bit more about these debt negotiations in Washington. Lou Dobbs, the host of \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\" on the Fox Business Networkis joining us now on the telephone.</p><p>Good morning, Lou. Good to talk to you again.</p><p>LOU DOBBS, HOST, \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\": Good morning, Connell. Great to be with you guys.</p><p>MCSHANE: Always good to talk to you, come to think of it.</p><p>You know, here is what I want to ask you about these debt negotiations. We talked about -- earlier this hour we were pointing out that this guy Jay Powell from the Bipartisan Policy Center is going to come in and brief the Republicans today. He worked for President Bush, and he believes August 2nd -- and he's a Republican, remember -- is a real deadline.</p><p>And there's been some debate over that. He says you're $130 billion short in terms of paying the bills in the month of August if we don't get a deal done. So he's going to try to convince, it seems to me, some of the rank and file and the Republicans that have doubts, that this is a real deadline.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I think that's terrific. And I think that the Bipartisan Center has done some terrific work in their analysis of what is truncated month in August, and projecting those -- what will be $134 billion shortfall in total received versus disbursement.</p><p>But again, remember, the issue here is over specifically Social Security, with a $2.6 trillion trust fund made up of the tax payments of literally millions of Americans and millions of employers over the course of the time. So, the question would be, why would that -- why would the Treasury Department not sell treasury instruments to pay and to keep current with Social Security recipients?</p><p>I mean, it's absolutely, to me, unforgivable that the president has threatened older Americans who depend on Social Security. And this is the focus that should -- you know, I think really is appropriate. That is, why in the world are we permitting fear mongering from the nation's commander- in-chief?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was very obviously, Lou, a scare tactic. But I've heard people in trying to explain -- I've heard people trying to explain away this deadline, this August 2nd deadline. Not explain it away, but people saying -- you cited the $134 billion number.</p><p>People came out and said, well, hey, we have X amount of revenue coming in the door. We have $172 billion coming in the door in flows. We can cover the interest on the debt. We can cover all the Social Security payments. We can Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>But they're not addressing the other side of it, and that is we have a shortfall of $134 billion just in the month of August.</p><p>DOBBS: Correct. And by the way, that's not the entire month of August.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. It's a truncated month based on the business day starting on August the 2nd.</p><p>DOBBS: Right. And even at that, people still want to avoid two issues here.</p><p>One is, why have we waited until this particular moment in time, with a couple of weeks ago to that deadline? One is, it is the preference of this administration to create urgency and a crisis, if you will, so that they can just press through whatever they want.</p><p>Senator Mitch McConnell, accommodating him with his proposal, which I think is shameful again, because this is a serious matter. We're looking at $2.6 trillion in the trust fund that the Treasury Department can't find, nor have they been willing to, nor has any national news organization succeeded in finding out where that $2.6 trillion is. I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, the fund loaned it to the federal government, but didn't get treasuries in return. They're like non-marketable securities.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: Exactly. And to the degree to which that is -- you know, if you were a small business doing what the United States government is doing with those receipts, you'd be in big trouble for (INAUDIBLE) funds. And this is very serious business because it just tells you how -- the madness that is gripping this nation of fiscal policy.</p><p>MCSHANE: Let's talk a little bit -- I also want to revisit something you just said on the Mitch McConnell plan from the report.</p><p>DOBBS: Sure.</p><p>MCSHANE: Because Bret Baier was on with us earlier today from Washington, and he says that's gaining momentum, all his sources on Capitol Hill.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>MCSHANE: And it seems like --</p><p>DOBBS: That's what we reported last night as well.</p><p>MCSHANE: -- that's the only game in town right now. But you say he's accommodating the administration.</p><p>DOBBS: No question about it.</p><p>MCSHANE: And it's shameful.</p><p>DOBBS: I think it's shameful that we are sitting here talking about, with all of these issues, a way in which to disentangle this confrontation so that no one is accountable to the American people for the results. You know, this is -- I talked with Karl Rove last night about it, Connell, and Karl has great regard, as do I, for Senator McConnell's political acumen and capacity, but the issue here is a nation teetering on the verge of becoming a debtor nation in perpetuity.</p><p>We are sucking the lifeblood out of our economic system. What sense does it make that we have our Federal Reserve system injecting $2.5 trillion into our financial system to stimulate it, while at the same time we are sucking $4 trillion out of the economy for the purpose of a government that is both ineffective, unproductive, and not contributing in any way whatsoever to innovation and to the bigger (ph) and vitality of this great, free enterprise capitalist economy?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lou, really quickly though, do you think maybe the whole attitude around the country changes even more? I've had a lot of conversations with people mentioning these deficit figures just for the month of August, and when they say, well, how much are we short here? I'm like, $134 billion.</p><p>And the reaction has been, $134 billion in a month? And maybe they're waking up to the fact that we're in a deep hole that it's going to be hard to get out of.</p><p>DOBBS: Dagen, I think you're talking about the unintended consequence that is extraordinarily positive for all of us. I think by putting these things into terms that people understand -- that is, their Social Security check in particular, paychecks for our troops -- this is coming home now to a lot of -- to millions of Americans who have not paid attention to what has been a scam in Washington, D.C., for decades. Namely, public financing of programs that are unsustainable.</p><p>And unfortunately, many of those entitlement programs now, upon which literally tens of millions of Americans depend. And that we need real leadership at this moment, and what we're getting are political maneuvers.</p><p>MCSHANE: And maybe this wakes people up to that.</p><p>Lou, thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you.</p><p>MCSHANE: And we always appreciate it.</p><p>We'll watch Lou tonight on the Fox Business Network, 7:00 p.m. Eastern, is \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT.\".</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Dr. Keith Ablow is up next. We'll talk about the release of Casey Anthony this weekend.</p><p>And next week, Mr. Imus is back live from the ranch with Tom Friedman, Sean Hannity, \"Blonde on Blonde.\" And the battle of the bands will continue with our stage manager's band, the Clatty Lads.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They'll be a blast.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have a few news items I would like to bring to your attention this morning, Mr. McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, the floor is always yours.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not that you don't do a lot of reading and work on your own, but Mila Kunis, the very, very beautiful actress --</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes?</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- will be attending the Marine Corps ball --</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh, that's great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- in the fall with Sergeant Scott Moore, who got a date by making that YouTube video.</p><p>MCSHANE: Bernard brought that story up yesterday on IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There was a report out -- a couple of media outlets reported that she was not going to go because she was busy. She was shooting two movies simultaneously. But she is going. Her representative saying it's a date.</p><p>MCSHANE: Nice.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So that's just one of the items that makes me feel good.</p><p>MCSHANE: I feel terrific after that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Warm inside.</p><p>It's a case, by the way, that has captivated the world. And now Casey Anthony is getting out of prison this weekend.</p><p>Fox News contributor and author Dr. Keith Ablow is working on a book about the case, and we're lucky to have him join us on the phone this morning.</p><p>Dr. Keith, good to talk to you.</p><p>DR. KEITH ABLOW, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hey. Good to talk to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dr. Keith, we keep talking about her safety and how she might disguise herself, where she might live. But, really, she needs to work on herself as a person, does she not? Is it an insurmountable task that she faces in terms of trying to become a normal person?</p><p>ABLOW: Well, these things are extraordinarily difficult. When you are as disordered as Casey Anthony is, in the particular ways that she suffers with, it's going to take an extraordinarily gifted therapist and a new willingness on her part to explore the darkest parts of her life experience and the way she thinks in order for her to have that chance.</p><p>Is there that chance? Yes, there really is. There always is, but it's like cancer. Right?</p><p>Is there a chance for a cure in every case? Yes, there is. Are there some cases that are beyond help? Yes, there are.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. Now, Dagen mentioned a moment ago, Dr. Keith, that you're working on a book about this whole situation.</p><p>What will you look into specifically in the book? What's it going to be about?</p><p>ABLOW: Well, it's inside the mind of Casey Anthony. And so, this book is going to use a lens -- you know, the lens of forensic psychiatry that is part and parcel of the work I've done in the past 20 years -- to really illuminate, why is Caylee Anthony no longer on the planet? What happened? What's the psychological reason that this story unfolded, so that people can actually understand.</p><p>It's one thing to have headlines. It's another to say, oh, well, that now makes sense to me, that it occurred in this way or might well have occurred in this way.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dr. Keith, how much work has she had done, psychiatric work on her, since she is 's been in prison for the last three years or so?</p><p>ABLOW: Well, she's no doubt had multiple psychiatric evaluations. We know that she was evaluated as to her competency to stand trial, but that probably wasn't the first time, the most recent.</p><p>She clearly established a relationship with a minister in prison that seemingly became tremendously important to her. And, you know, the isolation of being jailed, simply that, removing herself from all intoxicants -- well, those that can't seep through the bars of your cell or, you know, the elevated kind of communication that you might have with somebody else imprisoned there -- that's another kind of drug -- but literally that isolation works its own kind of magic, if you will, on a person's mind.</p><p>She deprived of multiple intoxicants: sex, alcohol, shopping. And so those things can clarify a person's thinking, too, that quiet isolation.</p><p>MCSHANE: Does it make it more likely then if you're in that situation that you engage in those activities, or whatever you want to call them, when you get out, because you haven't had them in so long?</p><p>ABLOW: Well, listen, I have a blog that's going up in about 30 minutes on FoxNews.com in the opinion section, six things that Casey Anthony is likely to do, five things she should do.</p><p>Among the six, number one, find a sexual partner. That's the most likely thing she will do. It's not the most important thing for her to do, but that is the drug that has been so important to her in her life to date, and she's going to go searching for that drug right away.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dr. Keith, can she have any kind of life to speak of the rest of her life?</p><p>ABLOW: You know, I've been amazed in my practice -- and, you know, some of the people I work with aren't incarcerated. First of all, some of them are just regular folks who are suffering with depression and the rest of things.</p><p>But of the people I've worked with who were involved with violent acts, not all of them come to me because they're incarcerated. Some committed violent acts in the past and are looking to resurrect themselves.</p><p>So, can she? The notoriety is not in her favor. The availability of intoxicants is not in her favor, including fame.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>ABLOW: But it's possible, remotely possible, and only through insight- oriented psychotherapy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I'm Richard Quest and I mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.</p><p>April the 1st, and the start of a new quarter, and of course, April Fool's Day. The international festival of pranks. I can hear you already asking, will they, or won't they? Well, we may. Or we may not. And the only way you will find out is if you keep watching.</p><p>And you'll want to keep watching because we lead off tonight with America, the land of opportunity, potentially again; hundreds of thousands are heading back to work. The U.S. economy gained more than 200,000 jobs last month and it sealed a solid 6 months of growth rates in the States.</p><p>Look at the way they have rose. It was a bit of a blip in January after some winter weather. But that growth, the trend seems to be heading firmly up. The unemployment rate in the U.S. now stands at 8.8 percent. Still high by the standards of developed countries and certainly by the United States, but that is the best number that has been seen in two years. And most of the growth now starting to come from the private sector, which added 230,000 jobs. The public sector battling against these cuts, of course, with the cuts, cut 14,000 and recovery is most definitely not on the cards. Certainly as budget deficits, both local, state, and federal level, continue; 13.5 million people are still out of work in the United States.</p><p><person><nameText>Jeff Joerres </nameText></person>is the CEO and chairman of Manpower Group, the new name for Manpower Inc., one of the world's largest employment agencies. Jeff is with me from Milwaukee.</p><p>Jeff, you just heard me summarize the situation. Good jobs, good private sector job growth, a fall in the unemployment, but it is still not enough.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFF JOERRES, </nameText></person>CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN, MANPOWER GROUP: Yes, we have to put it in context, as you said. This is good news. Because if you really simplify things is it getting the same, is it getting worse, or it is getting better? And it is getting better. So this is good news. The question is, when do we get to a point where we can actually feel like we are on the other side and get a breakthrough, which is closer to 300,000, 350,000, when we are really making up ground for the last four years of losing jobs. So, good news, just a long way to go yet.</p><p>QUEST: OK, traditionally, at this point in a recovery we should be seeing much more growth. You know, what you are seeing are those sectors where there is demand. What are they?</p><p>JOERRES: Well, we are still seeing demand in manufacturing. And that his key, because some of the entry-level and mid-level jobs in manufacturing pay better, it is great for the economy. But what we are also still seeing, across the board, whether it be the additions in health care, the additions in services, the additions in our industry. We added 29,000 jobs in our industry. What we are not seeing yet, is hiring in anticipation of demand. Companies are still getting more with less, driving and stretching out that workforce. And actually putting a lot of stress on that workforce right now.</p><p>QUEST: OK, if that is the situation and consumers are tapped out, they haven't fully deleveraged or they are-there is the prospect of higher interest rates. Not this year, but certainly they will arrive. Are we not just going to have to accept that the days of 4 to 5 percent unemployment are not going to be with us for many years?</p><p>JOERRES: I would agree. I mean I think it is mathematical. If you go to 250,000 jobs, or 300,000, you are still three and a half years away. You mentioned in your opening, the discouraged worker. How many turns in to that category in the next two to three years when they haven't found a job. Unemployment now goes for two years in the U.S., antiquating their skills. Companies are really in trouble right now being able to find talent. There is a mismatch. So, this \"Human Age\", which you announced and helped us announce, in the World Economic Forum, is on top of us. The conundrums are deeper than ever before.</p><p>QUEST: Jeff, many thanks. Have a good weekend, even with these numbers.</p><p>JOERRES: You too.</p><p>QUEST: And we'll talk again. Many thanks indeed. <person><nameText>Jeff Joerres </nameText></person>joining me from Milwaukee.</p><p>April the 1st, and the start of that new quarter. We need to take stock. And it is useful to do so by having a look and seeing where global economies-who gets the gold star. And what happens and where we go. This is the situation that you need to look at so far.</p><p>You've got the United States with its jobless level of 8.8, 2.1 inflation, and GDP. So far, so good. I suppose you could arguably say that gets across, that gets an OK. That's not too bad.</p><p>You then end up with Japan. We have to be a little bit careful with Japan, because of the tsunami and the earthquake. But the jobless level is high by their traditional standards. And inflation is an OK number. GDP, that is going to change.</p><p>It is the Euro Zone, jobless, a bad number, inflation, a bad number, the GDP, so-so, not too keen on that. And one of the reasons for all of this is the policies being put in place by them.</p><p>In the United States you have QE, which is nearly a trillion in the latest rounds, with states like Wisconsin, California, Illinois, making cuts. Japan, of course, has a crisis funding bill coming forward, probably in about April, and in 2010, there will be-there was obviously, 10s of billions in a stimulus package.</p><p>There is only one word of any relevance in the European Euro Zone. Except for that at the moment, it is, of course, going to be, very much the case, austerity.</p><p>Todd Benjamin is here to talk more about the situation and how it factors in.</p><p>TODD BENJAMIN, FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you. Great to see you.</p><p>You know, it is interesting how you are grading all of those, I don't think I would be quite as generous as you are. You know, I think there are shadings and I think it is not as simplistic as you make it out to be.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, simplistic?</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk about those jobless numbers to start with, in the United States.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Well, I think, you know, as Jeff said, it is great news. You know, it is the strongest number that we've had for a while. But still the long-term unemployed, it is very bad for them. Wages are stagnant. It has been that way four out of five months, which is great from an inflation standpoint, but not from a purchasing power standpoint. And the big question I have is once this QE2, this quantitative easing, ends in June- and it sounds like it will from all the noises most of the Fed members are making-is will the private sector really pick up the banner and create enough jobs to keep the economy growing?</p><p>QUEST: Not in the short-term, they won't.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Absolutely not. And so I'm a bid concerned about what happens, as you know, Jeff was saying, even Dudley, the vice chairman of the Fed, was talking today. He said, hey, not so fast. Not so fast, a lot of problems still in the economy. Including this idea, he said, even if you got 300,000 jobs a month, you would still have plenty of slack in the labor market by 2012. So it is going to be a very, very long process.</p><p>QUEST: All right. So, you've got Japan out of the equation for the short term. Germany is going quite well.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Exactly.</p><p>QUEST: But the rest of the Euro Zone isn't.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes, and I think you make a very important distinction here. You know, if you look at Germany it is going well. But if you look at other countries, you know, like Italy, like Ireland, like Spain, like Greece, like Portugal.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Lots and lots of problems.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>QUEST: You called me simplistic? Well, you said that my-</p><p>BENJAMIN: You are not simplistic. I just think this is-</p><p>QUEST: All right. The United States, A, B, or C?</p><p>BENJAMIN: I would give it probably a C, minus.</p><p>QUEST: A C, minus. I'm going to be more generous. I'm going to say a B, minus.</p><p>Japan, I think, well, I think it is unfair to give Japan any form of grading just at the moment.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: It would be a little bit-</p><p>BENJAMIN: But it's reconstruction program is going to be about 6 percent of GDP. So, you could see a V-shaped recovery there.</p><p>QUEST: All right. We'll give it a V-shape, a charitable V-shape.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: The Euro Zone, I mean?</p><p>BENJAMIN: Let's strip out Germany.</p><p>QUEST: Yes?</p><p>BENJAMIN: And you get a D, minus, or F.</p><p>QUEST: We both agree on that. Todd Benjamin, many thanks indeed for joining us and putting us into that form of perspective.</p><p>BENJAMIN: You bet.</p><p>QUEST: Now, we need to look and see how the markets are trading at the moment. The Big Board is open in New York, up 87 points, at 12,407. We are heading to the New York Stock Exchange later in the program to find out why its parent company is the center of a bidding war.</p><p>Stock in Europe kicked off the second quarter with a strong session. Banking and energy shares top performers. Lloyds was up 5 percent in London. BP up 3.5 percent. These are the movements of the indices over the course of a week. Investors reacting to British/Irish-to Irish banks' stress tests.</p><p>When we come back in just a moment there will be more to talk about on the economic front and we'll be in Japan to show how the country's economic fate is now fairing, following the earthquake. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, good evening.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Tangible evidence is now starting to arrive of the financial damage being caused in Japan and the wider Asia region, by last month's earthquake and tsunami.</p><p>Now, manufacturing activity in March, it has fallen sharply, it is at its lowest point in two years. This is not surprising. The PMI down at 46.4. Remember anything under 50 percent shows contraction rather than expansion. Clearly recession of some sort on the horizon. The Japanese is cutting back and a new study says that China will over take Japan as the world's second largest tourist market. This is the Boston consulting group that say China will be that before the end of the year.</p><p>And if you look at trade overall, the ripple effects, if you look at the numbers that show exactly how much trade is done, intra-Asia, while countries like Australia and Indonesia are seeing exports to Japan obviously fall off. The Australian treasury says it will loose around $2 billion in ex-rev this fiscal year, as demand falls for things like coal and iron ore.</p><p>The ongoing struggle at Japan's crippled nuclear plant, attracted most of the headlines over the past few weeks. Now, as Martin Savidge explains, that is just one of the problems in a country facing economic catastrophe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In Japan the first Friday in April is traditionally the first day on the job for fresh-faced college graduates who generally work for one company their whole career.</p><p>Here the latest class of 7-Eleven employees sing a song of joy. But this year across the country the chorus is not nearly so strong. It is said to be the smallest class of new hires since mid-`90s. According to experts the devastating earthquake and tsunami will only accelerate that business trend.</p><p>JASPER KOLL, HEAD OF JAPANESE EQUITY RESEARCH, JP MORGAN: Those Japanese companies, moving more aggressively overseas, because that is where the profit margins are, and that is where the markets are. \\</p><p>SAVIDGE: The disaster's economic shock is being felt by land, air and sea. Japan's auto sales in March were down 37 percent. Toyota was hardest hit. Its sales were down nearly 50 percent, with 16 of 18 factories closed.</p><p>Since the quake, Japan airlines reports international air travel has dropped by 25 percent. Other carriers such as Delta are trimming routes to and from Japan and using smaller planes. Japan's seafood industry has had a double blow. More than 6,000 fishing boats were damaged or destroyed by the tsunami, while fear of radiation is cutting into exports and spoiling appetites in the world's second largest seafood market.</p><p>These are truly dark days with two large key power facilities off line because of tsunami damage, Tokyo Electric Power Company, TEPCO, has lost 20 percent of its production capacity. Threatening the Tokyo region with rolling blackouts to save energy, lights, escalators, even mass transit have been shut down.</p><p>(On camera): 6 million people ride the Tokyo subway every single day. Now those six million will have to fit into 20 percent fewer trains to save electricity.</p><p>(Voice over): With remarkable speed the disaster is even reshaping Japanese society. In light of so much suffering, excess is out, saving is in, celebration subdued. The change felt even by the seasons. As this sign simply says, the nation's iconic Cherry Blossom Festival has been cancelled. Martin Savidge, CNN, Tokyo.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: The situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant remains unstable and speculation is that the Japanese government plans to intervene, or even nationalize TEPCO, the Tokyo Electric Power Company. That speculation hasn't gone away. TEPCO shares are down another 3.5 percent on the first day of the new fiscal year in Japan. TEPCO is down close to 50 percent this week alone. Three-quarters of the value of the company on the exchanges have evaporated since the start of the crisis.</p><p>And no relief for the Nikkei. It finished the day off down around half a percent.</p><p>After the break, to New York, where the world's most famous stock exchange has become the center of a bidding war itself, in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: The New York Stock Exchange has been the home to many a bidding war for the companies listed on the exchange. And now, the exchange is the victim itself of the bidding war. NYSE Euronext, its parent company operating exchanges in New York and Europe, in February the New York Stock Exchange agreed to be bought by Deutsche Boerse, for $10 billion. Now it would have created the world's largest exchange.</p><p>But this is fascinating. Now, Nasdaq OMX, and Intercontinental Exchange, crashed the party.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>Launched and $11.3-billion bid. Good grief! The big board is now a big bid. Alison Kosik is in New York.</p><p>Alison, we thought, come on, be honest, we thought that Deutsche Boerse deal was done dusted and all we had to do was lick the envelope.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, but you know what? Nothing like a really good bidding war to get Wall Street in a flutter, right? You know? I mean, I was talking to some traders about this and, you know, just like with anything they are pros and cons. They say a big positive is what you are seeing right now. NYSE shares are up almost 13 percent. This is a great move for shareholders, because the offer comes with a 19 percent premium. And the NYSE could also keep its domestic ownership.</p><p>And then, of course, there are the negatives. You know, the Deutsche Boerse deal would be better. I'm talking about the negatives, for the Nasdaq. The Deutsche Boerse deal, traders say, would be better because it is a worldwide platform. And it is better for the NYSE in the long run.</p><p>Now, we spoke with Duncan Niederauer, the head of the NYSE, back in February, when the Deutsche Boerse was announced at the NYSE. He definitely echoed that sentiment. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, NYSE: The fact of the matter is the equity, the U.S. equity business for our company the way it is currently constructed, is not the majority of the business anymore. It was our view several years ago that with a lot of the competition in the business here, we could not rely on U.S. equities as our single source of profitability over the long run. We also appreciate that the markets are global. The capital markets are worldwide. And I think our view is we have got to continue to be invested in those markets and services across the value chain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KOSIK: And of course it is all about the money making derivatives. That is really where it is at these days, you know, and the fact is many people really don't mind the exchange, Richard, being controlled by an overseas company like Deutsche Boerse, especially since NYSE merged with Euronext a while back, right?</p><p>QUEST: OK, let's put aside who owns what in terms of overseas, and the xenophobic argument that will be brought forward about foreigners ramping up the ramparts of Wall Street. But the fact is Nasdaq is, if you like, the bogie man rival to the Big Board, ever since it started. And it is, you know, scooped up all the big tech stocks.</p><p>KOSIK: And you are right. I mean, there is this-you know this-there has been this ongoing rivalry between the Nasdaq and the NYSE. You know each one, the same customer. They all want the same market share. I mean, we saw the tit for tat going on when we saw the flash crash back on May 6 of last year. You know they were finger pointing, all right, who is responsible for the glitch? Yes, there is no love lost between the two exchanges.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>KOSIK: I can't imagine Duncan Niederauer sitting down with Bob Greifeld for tea at this point, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: OK. I don't know if you are a betting woman or not, but on this Friday, if ever you had to have a dollar on who is going to win, would it be the Nasdaq or the Deutsche Boerse?</p><p>KOSIK: I put my money on Deutsche Boerse, definitely. Yes.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>KOSIK: But it has to go through the regulatory process. But that is who I'm putting money on.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, oh, that is the boilerplate caveat that she' putting in at the end just to make sure. That is the disclaimer.</p><p>All right. Many thanks, Alison. Have a great weekend.</p><p>KOSIK: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Many thanks. Don't forget, what we say means absolutely nothing. Because it all depends on what the shareholders in those companies actually believe. But I think probably Alison is well and truly on the money.</p><p>One U.S. stock, Morgan Stanley has tipped for big growth this year, is Honeywell. CNN's Maggie Lake met the conglomerate's chief executive to find out why and bring us a closer look at this key company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): They have aerospace contracts around the world, but also make everything from home security alarms to energy efficient car products, and safety gloves. In short, a classic conglomerate, over a century old, with annual sales of $33 billion.</p><p>Morgan Stanley recently tipped Honeywell shares, which are currently at their highest level since the financial crisis. We met CEO David Cote at the firm's campus in New Jersey.</p><p>(on camera): With such uncertain times, such turmoil around the world, what is it that makes you so bullish about Honeywell's outlook?</p><p>DAVID COTE, CEO, HONEYWELL: I don't think there is as much uncertainty as a lot of people might suspect. I do believe as about nine, 10 months ago, the recovery started to become for real. And we started being a net revenue (ph) ourselves, at that time. And we saw orders continue to do well during that time. And I really think we're on the path to a global recovery right now, that could go on for four or five years, who knows?</p><p>But I do think that that the path that we're on. We're just very pleased with the positions that we have, because we pay a lot of attention to try be in the middle of macro trends that just are going to last for a long time. Whether it is energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, those are the sort of things that are going to last for a long time. We are well positioned within that. And that great positions in some good industries really puts you in the right places.</p><p>LAKE: You get 50 percent of your growth, globally.</p><p>COTE: Hmmm.</p><p>LAKE: Are those growth rates sustainable?</p><p>COTE: There are things that have to be managed as you go along. I would say the China track record has been very good at being able to figure out how you do this. Because it is not-an economy is not a static thing. In fact, one of the things you want to maintain is the dynamism in an economy.</p><p>China, so far, has made all the right calls. For 30 years they have been making the right decisions and proceeding inexorably to greater and greater growth for their people. India will have to make those same kind of decisions, because it didn't quite start so soon for them. There is more learning that needs to go on. As even the Indians would admit the bureaucracy is astounding.</p><p>LAKE (voice over): Last year China awarded Honeywell and $11 billion contract to make landing equipment for its new plane maker, Comac. Some firms have complained over a lack of openness in China, but it remains a key market for Honeywell.</p><p>COTE: The growing pains are tough for both, partners, right? And that is one of the things that has to get sorted through. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't complain about the things that do need to change. And we should. By the same token, we shouldn't view them as evil, or bad, or out to destroy us. Because at the end of the day, as you know, economics is not a zero-sum game; both sides benefit from the transaction or you wouldn't do it.</p><p>LAKE: You are growing and on an aggressive acquisition trial. Why does that work for Honeywell, when it didn't seem to work out for so many others?</p><p>COTE: First thing that we never allow to happen is exactly what you talked about. Is there is the zeal for the deal, as I call it. Where you just get so-this is going to be great. You all start believing your own stories. This is going to be terrific. And you actually start ignoring some of the stuff you find in due diligence. And you need to have the discipline that says even when you get to the final negotiating table you can still walk away. You can't fall so in live with anything that you'll do it regardless, because everything is going to be great.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Now that is advice from the top; zeal for the deal, from the CEO of Honeywell.</p><p>On Monday, on this program, we turn our focus to the supply chain as we examine how products that we use everyday might be linked to modern-day slavery. Part of our year-long freedom project, it is a week of coverage that could be here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, as we turn the spotlight on the business side of human trafficking.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. This is CNN and on this network it is the news that always comes first.</p><p>(NEWSBREAK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, this is CNN and, on this network, it's the news that always comes first.</p><p>Violence in northern Afghanistan after a demonstration turns deadly. Police in Mazar-i-Sharif say at least a dozen people, including eight UN workers, were killed when a UN operation center was attacked after this protest. The demonstration was against the reported burning of a Koran earlier this month by a pastor in Florida.</p><p>To the Ivory Coast, where forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara are closer to taking over the commercial capital of Abidjan. They've taken control of the state-run television and attacked the residents of the self-declared president Laurent Gbagbo. France, the US, and the African Union are now calling on Gbagbo to hand over power.</p><p>Libya's opposition says rebels have launched a new offensive near Al- Brega against forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi. Meanwhile, both sides are proposing ways to end the civil war off the battlefield, but the conditions they're setting are very different.</p><p>The financial fallout from the Japanese disaster, far and wide, as you've heard on this program. Now, for Japan, tourism accounts for just two percent of the economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.</p><p>Scott Durchslag is the president of Expedia Worldwide, and yesterday he joined me and told me what travel trends Expedia is seeing in the region and has been seeing since March the 11th.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT DURCHSLAG, PRESIDENT, EXPEDIA WORLDWIDE: Well, it's interesting. We're seeing, lately, there has been some decline in demand, as you'd expect, given the seriousness of what's happening there.</p><p>But in the first days, it was much more mixed, because you had an explosion of outbound travel, obviously, happening. And a lot of domestic hotel bookings happening. So, it's still very early days, in terms of the long-term impact on this, but at the moment we are seeing some decline in the demand.</p><p>QUEST: You see, the thing is, Japan is actually quite an important part for Expedia, isn't it? And you were looking at Japan as being a major source in revenue in the future.</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Yes, Japan is, for us, a pretty high-growth market, and it's part of our broader Asia investment profile, which is a market that's been growing 54 percent in the last two years.</p><p>QUEST: Just to explain that, you don't expect that to continue, surely?</p><p>DURCHSLAG: I do expect that to continue, sure. What's happening in Japan is one of many events that's been happening in a year that's out of Revelations. Floods in Australia, earthquakes, tsunamis, nuclear issues. It's been a very difficult year.</p><p>But overall, the intrinsics on Asia are very powerful, $200 billion travel market that's growing faster than any other market in the world, and online penetration, which is very important to us, is only 20 percent, less than half the US or Europe. So, there's a lot of upside growth in Asia.</p><p>QUEST: Which is why, of course, your deal with Tony Fernandes of AirAsia is particularly relevant, isn't it? Even though it's been criticized by the opponents?</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Well, sure. We are really excited about our partnership with AirAsia, the reason being, it's the first deal ever that brings together an online travel agency and a low-cost carrier.</p><p>QUEST: Now, aren't you in an uncomfortable position? Because you've got this deal, but you're still saying you are neutral or, at least, not biased towards that particular airline.</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Well, we're all about bringing the best choices to our travelers, and having a low-cost carrier on Expedia, in addition to all of the other 300 airlines that we have, 130,000 hotel rooms, that is only to the benefit of consumers.</p><p>QUEST: You've obviously online, and the penetration online is very severe and very harsh, the marketplace. But now, you're moving into social media, as well.</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Yes, we're driving a new strategy called Expedia Everywhere that's all about mobile. Because what's more intrinsically mobile than travel? And what's more intrinsically social than travel? One of the major trends in travel is friends and families going together.</p><p>So, we've announced just today the largest sweepstakes ever done on Facebook that's been hosted on Facebook, and we just announced last week a brand new application called Expedia Hotels, Mobile and social are the future of travel.</p><p>QUEST: Why? Why do you want -- I mean, I go online and I book my ticket. Why do I need Expedia getting in my Facebook, my Twitter, and all these other social media areas?</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Well, because first of all, we want to be a personalized travel assistant in your pocket while you're on the fly, if you're late, on a flight, or you have to rebook or a flight is canceled. With one click, you can do that on Expedia.</p><p>And socially, you want to be able to share your itinerary with your friends so they can come with you. Or your pictures afterwards.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: The president of Expedia Worldwide talking to me. On this program, of course, we take great importance to the travel and tourism industry.</p><p>Now, we've been hearing a lot about how the disaster in Japan has been affecting the travel industry. There is, of course, another factor that affects airline prices, and that is the cost of fuel. Brent is currently trading at almost $119 a barrel. It's gained 25 percent, give or take, since the start of the year.</p><p>On this program this week, we've had three airline chief executives, and here are their thoughts on the sky-high price of oil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIE WALSH, CEO, INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP: I think at $115 a barrel, it's a challenge. But I don't think it's going to undermine the economic recovery that we've seen in most major economies.</p><p>I think if oil goes above $150 a barrel, it's something that everybody will be concerned about, but I'm pleased to say we're not there at this point.</p><p>ROB FYFE, CEO, AIR NEW ZEALAND: I'd actually be happy with fuel at $150. I'd be happy with fuel at $200. We are actually an incredibly robust airline. We've got a very strong balance sheet. There's a lot of airlines out there that struggle to economically survive. They get by by the skin of their teeth. To be honest, if high fuel started to claim some of the struggling airlines out of the industry --</p><p>QUEST: Oh!</p><p>FYFE: -- it wouldn't concern me at all.</p><p>QUEST: Oh! Oh! That's a polite -- you just want -- you want nutcracker the competition!</p><p>FYFE: Well, the reality is, the strong should get stronger, and those that aren't strong enough should, actually, fall by the wayside.</p><p>JEFF SMISEK, CEO, UNITED AIRLINES: We need to make money no matter what the oil prices. And we need to adjust to that, which means investing in modern fuel-efficient aircraft, engines, operations. So, we need to learn to make money in high oil prices. And I believe that we're likely to have oil prices for a -- high oil prices for a long time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Jeff Smisk, Rob Fyfe, and Willie Walsh talking to me during the course of the week.</p><p>Frequent fliers, business travelers, are horrified when we board a plane and find children sitting in business class near us. Well, there are two sides to this argument, and anyone with a young family will tell you it's difficult flying with kids.</p><p>Well, today, we heard of a new airline that's courting a very specific clientele. These are flights exclusively for children.</p><p>The flight-booking site Skyscanner says Urchin Airways will become the world's first kids-only carrier. The rules will say no passengers under (sic) the age of 16 will be allowed onboard. There will be flight attendants, and children will be entertained during the flight with competitions and the cabin crew dressed as clowns. Urchin will coordinate with other mainline regular carriers so parents and children can be reunited at their final destination. The families we spoke to thought this was a most exciting prospect.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's a wonderful idea. They're going to have so much fun. They've talked of little else for days. I mean, win- win. I get to drink a glass of wine and they get to play. It's perfect. I'll meet them at the other end. It's wonderful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Well, I can't wait to meet the clowns, because they're going to be cabin crew. And I heard there's going to be egg and spoon games, as well, so that sounds really fun.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Also, there's going to be, like, ice cream and we can eat it for supper, and there's going to be screaming contests and on one's there to say that we can't scream as much as we like.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: A brilliant idea, just don't book me ever, ever, on Urchin Airways.</p><p>That's not the only airline proposal raising eyebrows this Friday. Everyone, it seems, they're going to ever more weird and wonderful ways to keep your business. We'll talk about the airlines after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: It has been mild weather and we've had sunny skies. Western Europe's had a wonderful week. Except, of course, if you're heading towards allergy season, like myself. And frankly, Pedram, at the World Weather Center -- I -- I mean, I knew the weather was changing. The throat gets tighter, the nose starts running.</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, you don't need a forecast. When you see the conditions that have been as nice as they have, of course, they're going to have hard effects, there, on folks that are suffering allergies.</p><p>And as Richard said, it's been fairly mild, and the conditions over the next 24 hours, going to remain mild for at least one more day across portions of London. There it is. That's 17 degrees, your forecast high temperature. We'll call it partly to mostly cloudy by the afternoon hours, perhaps a shower.</p><p>That's really the good news out of this as it begins to help clean up the air, the atmosphere that has been a little polluted with the pollination that's been taking place out there.</p><p>But as we talked about, what's going on out there, especially across the United Kingdom? What's causing all this? Well, you have to keep in mind, Richard's not alone with this one. Some 20 percent of folks across the United Kingdom are affected by allergies this time of year.</p><p>Now, you just go back a couple of months, the harsh winter that we had. Remember the snow showers, the cold conditions? That actually helps promote early pollination as we get these warm spells that we were getting in the past few days. So, with the warm temperatures, that's helping things out.</p><p>What's the predominate pollen right now for this time of year? Typically, we talk about birch, ash, elm, and willow, the tree pollens. That's probably what Richard is feeling, here, the past few days with the tree pollens being among the high.</p><p>Now, if you suffer symptoms in June and July, more than likely, that becomes a grass pollen concern as we head on towards the summer season.</p><p>But what do you do? Well, the best thing to do is to avoid the peak times. Experts say 7:00 to 10:00 AM, that's one of the times the trees begin pollinating, and also releasing pollen about 4:00 to 7:00 PM. So, early mornings, early afternoons, that's really the concern out there, being staying indoors.</p><p>Also, changing your clothes. Believe it or not, changing your clothes when you get back inside the house, that could help the concern, as well, as a lot of the pollen clings on right to your clothing and makes you sneeze all around the house after you've come indoors. So, you're wondering why you're feeling the symptoms when you're inside? That could be the reason. You can change your clothes.</p><p>But here is a storm system that is entering the picture. That, again, will help mix up the atmosphere a little bit as we head on into Saturday, partly to mostly cloudy skies around London, and Western Europe could get some showers out of this. And also across the north, a few showers.</p><p>So, the temperatures are going to cool down, that'll suppress some of the pollen levels, there, in the next few days, and the conditions are going to improve. But really, the warmest air mass still stays to the south, here, across portions of southern France into Spain, Portugal getting well above-average readings, some 10 to 12 degrees above average over the next couple of days.</p><p>And if you've got some travel plans out there, looks like travel not going to be affected by this much, as we're seeing breezy conditions and, again, a few showers possible. But all in all, an improving forecast for Mr. Quest out there, and perhaps some of the folks that are dealing with the allergies, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: We thank you for that. I'm not sure whether knowing about the allergies actually makes it any better, but Pedram, we do thank you. I think the most extraordinary thing is the way I'm finding them coming on as I get older. There must be a moral in there somewhere. Pedram, have a good weekend.</p><p>JAVAHERI: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Now, finally to you, don't say you weren't warned. April Fool's Day on a week when we've spoken to a number of the top airlines. The entire industry, why oh why is it the airline industry that decided to get April Fools silly?</p><p>For example, Virgin Atlantic, they announced that they were growing fresh herbs and vegetables for upper class passengers in the galley. Apparently, the galley would be onboard, and they promised fresh mint for mojitos.</p><p>That was an April Fool.</p><p>Ryanair had everyone confused. They said they had child-free flights from October. The press release was dated April the 1st, but it was released, seemingly, yesterday, because I read that story. So, Ryanair -- I'm not sure who the final fool was, Michael. Your press release came out early. Anyway, we still had that one.</p><p>And then, finally, yes. We did it to you. Urchin Airways, kids only flights, the opposite of Ryanair, kids only, sorry. April Fool!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: You've been April Fooled.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: They were, of course, in on the joke. And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in London. Whatever you're up to in the weekend ahead, have a good weekend. Thank you for your time and attention. MARKETPLACE AFRICA is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBYN CURNOW, CNN HOST: You're watching MARKETPLACE AFRICA. I'm Robyn Curnow here on the streets of Johannesburg. We begin this week's show with a look at a multibillion-dollar industry that is both dangerous and illegal -- counterfeit drugs.</p><p>The World Health Organization estimates that a third of all medicines in the developing world are fake. So, how do you choose between what is real and what isn't? Lives are lost in that gamble. But as Christian Purefoy now reports, mobile technology is helping Africans to make an educated choice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTIAN PUREFOY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Armed police cracking down hard on Nigeria's fake drug sellers. But, say the authorities, these raids are not enough to stop counterfeit drugs flooding Nigeria's streets.</p><p>GARBA MACDONALD, DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR OF ENFORCEMENT, NAFDAC: Considering the level of poverty, people will want to go for the cheapest.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): And the big men behind the sale of these drugs? Do they pose a danger to you and your men?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, they do. They are problems because they can organize, they have the money, they can organize thugs to attack us. We cannot deal with this without more policemen.</p><p>PUREFOY: So, this is big money.</p><p>MACDONALD: Oh, it's big money, yes, sure. Big money.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): As Femi Sorenmekun, director of a local diabetes drug company, explains, the major problem is identifying which box of drugs is real, and which is fake. Until now, with the introduction of a small scratch card packaged with all his medications.</p><p>FEMI SOREMEKUN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BIOCHEM PHARMACEUTICALS: Then they scratch it, and upon scratching it, a number is revealed.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): If we text that now -- ?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Definitely, if you text that now, you're going to --</p><p>PUREFOY: What happens?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: You're going to get a message telling you --</p><p>PUREFOY: Can we try it?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Yes, you can.</p><p>PUREFOY: There you go. So, that's almost immediate.</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Yes. Almost immediate.</p><p>PUREFOY: But when someone receives this text, it says \"OK,\" they know that drug is original.</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Is original.</p><p>PUREFOY: Has it worked? Has it helped your business? Has it helped the sales?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Yes, it has. We've been able to capture most of our market share back. Because we can't eliminate fake 100 percent. But what we've lost, we've captured it back, and we can see some growth, now, in the business.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): The idea is borrowed from the scratch cards sold on street corners across Africa use to top up mobile phones with credit.</p><p>Applying this scratch card innovation to the drug market is the idea of Ashifi Gogo.</p><p>ASHIFI GOGO, CEO, SPROXIL, INC.: The good thing is the consumer is not paying. The government is not paying, as well. And it's the pharm companies that are paying Sproxil for the service. The rationale being they can recoup market share that's been lost to counterfeiters.</p><p>So, in some sense, the counterfeiters are paying for the service, which puts a smile on lots of people's faces, I guess, except for the counterfeiters.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): A simple tool that investigators hope will make raids like this one less necessary. Christian Purefoy, CNN, Lagos, Nigeria.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: So, anti-malarial drugs are the most commonly counterfeited medication here in Africa. The United Nations estimates that in some parts of the continent, between 50 to 60 percent of all anti-insective drugs don't have acceptable levels of their active ingredients.</p><p>And more disturbingly, a World Health Organization Study found that Ghana was the worst affected, 67 percent of their most common anti-malarial drugs were found to have failed potency tests.</p><p>Now, up next, he coined the phrase \"BRIC\" to describe the top emerging-market economies. But what does he have to say about South Africa's entry into that elite club? Up next on MARKETPLACE AFRICA, we interview leading economist Jim O'Neill.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CURNOW: Welcome back to MARKETPLACE AFRICA. They're known as the fastest-growing emerging markets, Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Together, they're known as BRIC, an acronym coined by our next guest on Face Time, Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>In the next few weeks, South Africa joins the BRIC summit in Beijing, hoping its inclusion will raise its status and prestige on the world stage. But Jim O'Neill now weighs in on whether he thinks South Africa really deserves a seat at that table.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM O'NEILL, CHAIRMAN, GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT: To be a BRIC, it has to be an economy that is really at the core, today, or likely to be in the future, of the world economy. So, it has to be big enough to be economically impactful on everybody else.</p><p>And so, against that general background, an economy that is already three to five percent of global GDP or is likely to be on in a vaguely foreseeable future. And if you go with that definition, there's only a clear four there are, Brazil, Russia, India, India, and China.</p><p>To be a \"Next 11\" country, it is literally a phrase that I dreamed up seven years ago as a result of people saying, well, why just those four? Why not Indonesia? Why not Mexico? Why not Turkey? Why not South Africa? Et cetera et cetera. And it's a phrase to describe the next 11 largest population countries from the emerging world.</p><p>NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: If the N-11 is such a fluid --</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes.</p><p>ELBAGIR: -- concept, why do you think there has been so much controversy over South Africa jumping over the N-11 to be part of the BRICS club.</p><p>O'NEILL: South Africa's so unique and, in this context, quite odd. Because South Africa has some aspects of development, particularly financial markets, some aspects of the better standards of Western practices in terms of regulatory matters and Western law. And with that, there has been historic trade organizations that South Africa's linked to, particularly with Brazil and India.</p><p>And so, with the whole growth of the BRIC idea, particularly when it became a BRIC political club, for South Africa to be not part of it is obviously something that South African leaders feel a little bit, \"What's going on here?\"</p><p>Beyond that, I'm not sure why South Africa's managed to leap above it. Because if you look at the criteria I said earlier about what's a BRIC and what's a Next 11, South Africa doesn't even come close to -- certainly, not a BRIC. South African economy at, what? $350 billion is half the sum of global GDP.</p><p>So, it's nowhere near constituting a BRIC, and without staggering productivity improvements and major immigration or improvements in birthrates, et cetera, et cetera, it's never going to get there.</p><p>South Africa's really stimulated my mind to explore this further, because there are some others, like Poland, Saudi Arabia, who have more reason to be irked about these things, perhaps, than just South Africa. Because, of course, when you look at the Next 11 definition, South Africa doesn't actually have that many people, either. And in the context of the continent, Nigeria is the place that really matters.</p><p>ELBAGIR: I was going to say, do you think they've missed the trick by taking in South Africa rather than Nigeria?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think it's been, because the South African leaders and leading intellects have been so persistent about it and maybe the Chinese and Indians and others thought, \"You know what? OK, guys. If it shuts you up, come in.\"</p><p>But there is another angle to it, of course, that I'm sure South Africa has perhaps played on the notion that because they do have developed markets and western government standards in some areas, they've said, \"Look, we're the gateway to the rest of Africa,\" and that's certainly an argument with some legitimacy.</p><p>ELBAGIR: What would you advice -- if you were advising the South African government, what should they do to earn their place at the BRIC table?</p><p>O'NEILL: That South African --</p><p>ELBAGIR: The South African government. Or do you think it's a -- anyhow, it's a lost cause?</p><p>O'NEILL: No, I don't. No, nowhere is a lost cause. I think South African leaders have to be bolder about the basics and not be so worried about what club they're in or not. They've got acceptance, they're in the G-20, they've been invited to the big political meeters -- leaders' meeting, and they're there.</p><p>What they've now got to do is, as with the World Cup, turn an event into some lasting improvement. Stop thinking that because of Apartheid and other tragic historical things, stop thinking that world owes South Africa something for its past, and do things to create a better environment where you can attract a lot more international business.</p><p>And most importantly, embrace all your own people in a competitive, open way and find everybody jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: Is South Africa qualified to be a member of BRIC? Tell us what you think. We're having a discussion on our Facebook page. But for now, let's just take a look at what's trending this week.</p><p>Foreign mining firms in Zimbabwe are scrambling following President Robert Mugabe's demand that they must sell a majority stake to local black Zimbabweans within six months. Shares at major mining companies dropped sharply upon the news.</p><p>The regulation follows an indigenization act signed into law three years ago, which aims to make foreign companies junior partners in Zimbabwe.</p><p>And Kumba Iron Ore is proposing a $7 billion steel plant in South Africa to help reduce unemployment.</p><p>President Jacob Zuma has asked businesses to help create 5 million jobs in the coming decade. The proposed plant would create 3,000 jobs and export up to five billion tons of steel each year to buyers in Asia.</p><p>So, if you have any ideas on who we should interview or what stories we should be doing, please do connect with us. We're on Facebook, we're on Twitter, and you can e-mail us. We'd love to hear what you have to say.</p><p>But until next week, for me, Robyn Curnow, here in Johannesburg, good- bye.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2011 Cable News Network, Inc.

Sorry clear evidence of real damage now at Japan's economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a Friday. We're together. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.</p><p>April the 1st, and the start of a new quarter, and of course, April Fool's Day. The international festival of pranks. I can hear you already asking, will they, or won't they? Well, we may. Or we may not. And the only way you will find out is if you keep watching.</p><p>And you'll want to keep watching because we lead off tonight with America, the land of opportunity, potentially again; hundreds of thousands are heading back to work. The U.S. economy gained more than 200,000 jobs last month and it sealed a solid 6 months of growth rates in the States.</p><p>Look at the way they have rose. It was a bit of a blip in January after some winter weather. But that growth, the trend seems to be heading firmly up. The unemployment rate in the U.S. now stands at 8.8 percent. Still high by the standards of developed countries and certainly by the United States, but that is the best number that has been seen in two years. And most of the growth now starting to come from the private sector, which added 230,000 jobs. The public sector battling against these cuts, of course, with the cuts, cut 14,000 and recovery is most definitely not on the cards. Certainly as budget deficits, both local, state, and federal level, continue; 13.5 million people are still out of work in the United States.</p><p><person><nameText>Jeff Joerres </nameText></person>is the CEO and chairman of Manpower Group, the new name for Manpower Inc., one of the world's largest employment agencies. Jeff is with me from Milwaukee.</p><p>Jeff, you just heard me summarize the situation. Good jobs, good private sector job growth, a fall in the unemployment, but it is still not enough.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFF JOERRES, </nameText></person>CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN, MANPOWER GROUP: Yes, we have to put it in context, as you said. This is good news. Because if you really simplify things is it getting the same, is it getting worse, or it is getting better? And it is getting better. So this is good news. The question is, when do we get to a point where we can actually feel like we are on the other side and get a breakthrough, which is closer to 300,000, 350,000, when we are really making up ground for the last four years of losing jobs. So, good news, just a long way to go yet.</p><p>QUEST: OK, traditionally, at this point in a recovery we should be seeing much more growth. You know, what you are seeing are those sectors where there is demand. What are they?</p><p>JOERRES: Well, we are still seeing demand in manufacturing. And that his key, because some of the entry-level and mid-level jobs in manufacturing pay better, it is great for the economy. But what we are also still seeing, across the board, whether it be the additions in health care, the additions in services, the additions in our industry. We added 29,000 jobs in our industry. What we are not seeing yet, is hiring in anticipation of demand. Companies are still getting more with less, driving and stretching out that workforce. And actually putting a lot of stress on that workforce right now.</p><p>QUEST: OK, if that is the situation and consumers are tapped out, they haven't fully deleveraged or they are-there is the prospect of higher interest rates. Not this year, but certainly they will arrive. Are we not just going to have to accept that the days of 4 to 5 percent unemployment are not going to be with us for many years?</p><p>JOERRES: I would agree. I mean I think it is mathematical. If you go to 250,000 jobs, or 300,000, you are still three and a half years away. You mentioned in your opening, the discouraged worker. How many turns in to that category in the next two to three years when they haven't found a job. Unemployment now goes for two years in the U.S., antiquating their skills. Companies are really in trouble right now being able to find talent. There is a mismatch. So, this \"Human Age\", which you announced and helped us announce, in the World Economic Forum, is on top of us. The conundrums are deeper than ever before.</p><p>QUEST: Jeff, many thanks. Have a good weekend, even with these numbers.</p><p>JOERRES: You too.</p><p>QUEST: And we'll talk again. Many thanks indeed. <person><nameText>Jeff Joerres </nameText></person>joining me from Milwaukee.</p><p>April the 1st, and the start of that new quarter. We need to take stock. And it is useful to do so by having a look and seeing where global economies-who gets the gold star. And what happens and where we go. This is the situation that you need to look at so far.</p><p>You've got the United States with its jobless level of 8.8, 2.1 inflation, and GDP. So far, so good. I suppose you could arguably say that gets across, that gets an OK. That's not too bad.</p><p>You then end up with Japan. We have to be a little bit careful with Japan, because of the tsunami and the earthquake. But the jobless level is high by their traditional standards. And inflation is an OK number. GDP, that is going to change.</p><p>It is the Euro Zone, jobless, a bad number, inflation, a bad number, the GDP, so-so, not too keen on that. And one of the reasons for all of this is the policies being put in place by them.</p><p>In the United States you have QE, which is nearly a trillion in the latest rounds, with states like Wisconsin, California, Illinois, making cuts. Japan, of course, has a crisis funding bill coming forward, probably in about April, and in 2010, there will be-there was obviously, 10s of billions in a stimulus package.</p><p>There is only one word of any relevance in the European Euro Zone. Except for that at the moment, it is, of course, going to be, very much the case, austerity.</p><p>Todd Benjamin is here to talk more about the situation and how it factors in.</p><p>TODD BENJAMIN, FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you. Great to see you.</p><p>You know, it is interesting how you are grading all of those, I don't think I would be quite as generous as you are. You know, I think there are shadings and I think it is not as simplistic as you make it out to be.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, simplistic?</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk about those jobless numbers to start with, in the United States.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Well, I think, you know, as Jeff said, it is great news. You know, it is the strongest number that we've had for a while. But still the long-term unemployed, it is very bad for them. Wages are stagnant. It has been that way four out of five months, which is great from an inflation standpoint, but not from a purchasing power standpoint. And the big question I have is once this QE2, this quantitative easing, ends in June- and it sounds like it will from all the noises most of the Fed members are making-is will the private sector really pick up the banner and create enough jobs to keep the economy growing?</p><p>QUEST: Not in the short-term, they won't.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Absolutely not. And so I'm a bid concerned about what happens, as you know, Jeff was saying, even Dudley, the vice chairman of the Fed, was talking today. He said, hey, not so fast. Not so fast, a lot of problems still in the economy. Including this idea, he said, even if you got 300,000 jobs a month, you would still have plenty of slack in the labor market by 2012. So it is going to be a very, very long process.</p><p>QUEST: All right. So, you've got Japan out of the equation for the short term. Germany is going quite well.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Exactly.</p><p>QUEST: But the rest of the Euro Zone isn't.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes, and I think you make a very important distinction here. You know, if you look at Germany it is going well. But if you look at other countries, you know, like Italy, like Ireland, like Spain, like Greece, like Portugal.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Lots and lots of problems.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>QUEST: You called me simplistic? Well, you said that my-</p><p>BENJAMIN: You are not simplistic. I just think this is-</p><p>QUEST: All right. The United States, A, B, or C?</p><p>BENJAMIN: I would give it probably a C, minus.</p><p>QUEST: A C, minus. I'm going to be more generous. I'm going to say a B, minus.</p><p>Japan, I think, well, I think it is unfair to give Japan any form of grading just at the moment.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: It would be a little bit-</p><p>BENJAMIN: But it's reconstruction program is going to be about 6 percent of GDP. So, you could see a V-shaped recovery there.</p><p>QUEST: All right. We'll give it a V-shape, a charitable V-shape.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: The Euro Zone, I mean?</p><p>BENJAMIN: Let's strip out Germany.</p><p>QUEST: Yes?</p><p>BENJAMIN: And you get a D, minus, or F.</p><p>QUEST: We both agree on that. Todd Benjamin, many thanks indeed for joining us and putting us into that form of perspective.</p><p>BENJAMIN: You bet.</p><p>QUEST: Now, we need to look and see how the markets are trading at the moment. The Big Board is open in New York, up 87 points, at 12,407. We are heading to the New York Stock Exchange later in the program to find out why its parent company is the center of a bidding war.</p><p>Stock in Europe kicked off the second quarter with a strong session. Banking and energy shares top performers. Lloyds was up 5 percent in London. BP up 3.5 percent. These are the movements of the indices over the course of a week. Investors reacting to British/Irish-to Irish banks' stress tests.</p><p>When we come back in just a moment there will be more to talk about on the economic front and we'll be in Japan to show how the country's economic fate is now fairing, following the earthquake. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, good evening.</p><p>QUEST: Tangible evidence is now starting to arrive of the financial damage being caused in Japan and the wider Asia region, by last month's earthquake and tsunami.</p><p>Now, manufacturing activity in March, it has fallen sharply, it is at its lowest point in two years. This is not surprising. The PMI down at 46.4. Remember anything under 50 percent shows contraction rather than expansion. Clearly recession of some sort on the horizon. The Japanese is cutting back and a new study says that China will over take Japan as the world's second largest tourist market. This is the Boston consulting group that say China will be that before the end of the year.</p><p>And if you look at trade overall, the ripple effects, if you look at the numbers that show exactly how much trade is done, intra-Asia, while countries like Australia and Indonesia are seeing exports to Japan obviously fall off. The Australian treasury says it will loose around $2 billion in ex-rev this fiscal year, as demand falls for things like coal and iron ore.</p><p>The ongoing struggle at Japan's crippled nuclear plant, attracted most of the headlines over the past few weeks. Now, as Martin Savidge explains, that is just one of the problems in a country facing economic catastrophe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In Japan the first Friday in April is traditionally the first day on the job for fresh-faced college graduates who generally work for one company their whole career.</p><p>Here the latest class of 7-Eleven employees sing a song of joy. But this year across the country the chorus is not nearly so strong. It is said to be the smallest class of new hires since mid-`90s. According to experts the devastating earthquake and tsunami will only accelerate that business trend.</p><p>JASPER KOLL, HEAD OF JAPANESE EQUITY RESEARCH, JP MORGAN: Those Japanese companies, moving more aggressively overseas, because that is where the profit margins are, and that is where the markets are. \\</p><p>SAVIDGE: The disaster's economic shock is being felt by land, air and sea. Japan's auto sales in March were down 37 percent. Toyota was hardest hit. Its sales were down nearly 50 percent, with 16 of 18 factories closed.</p><p>Since the quake, Japan airlines reports international air travel has dropped by 25 percent. Other carriers such as Delta are trimming routes to and from Japan and using smaller planes. Japan's seafood industry has had a double blow. More than 6,000 fishing boats were damaged or destroyed by the tsunami, while fear of radiation is cutting into exports and spoiling appetites in the world's second largest seafood market.</p><p>These are truly dark days with two large key power facilities off line because of tsunami damage, Tokyo Electric Power Company, TEPCO, has lost 20 percent of its production capacity. Threatening the Tokyo region with rolling blackouts to save energy, lights, escalators, even mass transit have been shut down.</p><p>(On camera): 6 million people ride the Tokyo subway every single day. Now those six million will have to fit into 20 percent fewer trains to save electricity.</p><p>(Voice over): With remarkable speed the disaster is even reshaping Japanese society. In light of so much suffering, excess is out, saving is in, celebration subdued. The change felt even by the seasons. As this sign simply says, the nation's iconic Cherry Blossom Festival has been cancelled. Martin Savidge, CNN, Tokyo.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: The situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant remains unstable and speculation is that the Japanese government plans to intervene, or even nationalize TEPCO, the Tokyo Electric Power Company. That speculation hasn't gone away. TEPCO shares are down another 3.5 percent on the first day of the new fiscal year in Japan. TEPCO is down close to 50 percent this week alone. Three-quarters of the value of the company on the exchanges have evaporated since the start of the crisis.</p><p>And no relief for the Nikkei. It finished the day off down around half a percent.</p><p>After the break, to New York, where the world's most famous stock exchange has become the center of a bidding war itself, in a moment.</p><p>QUEST: The New York Stock Exchange has been the home to many a bidding war for the companies listed on the exchange. And now, the exchange is the victim itself of the bidding war. NYSEEuronext, its parent company operating exchanges in New York and Europe, in February the New York Stock Exchange agreed to be bought by Deutsche Boerse, for $10 billion. Now it would have created the world's largest exchange.</p><p>But this is fascinating. Now, Nasdaq OMX, and Intercontinental Exchange, crashed the party.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>Launched and $11.3-billion bid. Good grief! The big board is now a big bid. Alison Kosik is in New York.</p><p>Alison, we thought, come on, be honest, we thought that Deutsche Boerse deal was done dusted and all we had to do was lick the envelope.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, but you know what? Nothing like a really good bidding war to get Wall Street in a flutter, right? You know? I mean, I was talking to some traders about this and, you know, just like with anything they are pros and cons. They say a big positive is what you are seeing right now. NYSE shares are up almost 13 percent. This is a great move for shareholders, because the offer comes with a 19 percent premium. And the NYSE could also keep its domestic ownership.</p><p>And then, of course, there are the negatives. You know, the Deutsche Boerse deal would be better. I'm talking about the negatives, for the Nasdaq. The Deutsche Boerse deal, traders say, would be better because it is a worldwide platform. And it is better for the NYSE in the long run.</p><p>Now, we spoke with Duncan Niederauer, the head of the NYSE, back in February, when the Deutsche Boerse was announced at the NYSE. He definitely echoed that sentiment. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, NYSE: The fact of the matter is the equity, the U.S. equity business for our company the way it is currently constructed, is not the majority of the business anymore. It was our view several years ago that with a lot of the competition in the business here, we could not rely on U.S. equities as our single source of profitability over the long run. We also appreciate that the markets are global. The capital markets are worldwide. And I think our view is we have got to continue to be invested in those markets and services across the value chain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KOSIK: And of course it is all about the money making derivatives. That is really where it is at these days, you know, and the fact is many people really don't mind the exchange, Richard, being controlled by an overseas company like Deutsche Boerse, especially since NYSE merged with Euronext a while back, right?</p><p>QUEST: OK, let's put aside who owns what in terms of overseas, and the xenophobic argument that will be brought forward about foreigners ramping up the ramparts of Wall Street. But the fact is Nasdaq is, if you like, the bogie man rival to the Big Board, ever since it started. And it is, you know, scooped up all the big tech stocks.</p><p>KOSIK: And you are right. I mean, there is this-you know this-there has been this ongoing rivalry between the Nasdaq and the NYSE. You know each one, the same customer. They all want the same market share. I mean, we saw the tit for tat going on when we saw the flash crash back on May 6 of last year. You know they were finger pointing, all right, who is responsible for the glitch? Yes, there is no love lost between the two exchanges.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>KOSIK: I can't imagine Duncan Niederauer sitting down with Bob Greifeld for tea at this point, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: OK. I don't know if you are a betting woman or not, but on this Friday, if ever you had to have a dollar on who is going to win, would it be the Nasdaq or the Deutsche Boerse?</p><p>KOSIK: I put my money on Deutsche Boerse, definitely. Yes.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>KOSIK: But it has to go through the regulatory process. But that is who I'm putting money on.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, oh, that is the boilerplate caveat that she' putting in at the end just to make sure. That is the disclaimer.</p><p>All right. Many thanks, Alison. Have a great weekend.</p><p>KOSIK: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Many thanks. Don't forget, what we say means absolutely nothing. Because it all depends on what the shareholders in those companies actually believe. But I think probably Alison is well and truly on the money.</p><p>One U.S. stock, Morgan Stanley has tipped for big growth this year, is Honeywell. CNN's Maggie Lake met the conglomerate's chief executive to find out why and bring us a closer look at this key company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): They have aerospace contracts around the world, but also make everything from home security alarms to energy efficient car products, and safety gloves. In short, a classic conglomerate, over a century old, with annual sales of $33 billion.</p><p>Morgan Stanley recently tipped Honeywell shares, which are currently at their highest level since the financial crisis. We met CEO David Cote at the firm's campus in New Jersey.</p><p>(on camera): With such uncertain times, such turmoil around the world, what is it that makes you so bullish about Honeywell's outlook?</p><p>DAVID COTE, CEO, HONEYWELL: I don't think there is as much uncertainty as a lot of people might suspect. I do believe as about nine, 10 months ago, the recovery started to become for real. And we started being a net revenue (ph) ourselves, at that time. And we saw orders continue to do well during that time. And I really think we're on the path to a global recovery right now, that could go on for four or five years, who knows?</p><p>But I do think that that the path that we're on. We're just very pleased with the positions that we have, because we pay a lot of attention to try be in the middle of macro trends that just are going to last for a long time. Whether it is energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, those are the sort of things that are going to last for a long time. We are well positioned within that. And that great positions in some good industries really puts you in the right places.</p><p>LAKE: You get 50 percent of your growth, globally.</p><p>COTE: Hmmm.</p><p>LAKE: Are those growth rates sustainable?</p><p>COTE: There are things that have to be managed as you go along. I would say the China track record has been very good at being able to figure out how you do this. Because it is not-an economy is not a static thing. In fact, one of the things you want to maintain is the dynamism in an economy.</p><p>China, so far, has made all the right calls. For 30 years they have been making the right decisions and proceeding inexorably to greater and greater growth for their people. India will have to make those same kind of decisions, because it didn't quite start so soon for them. There is more learning that needs to go on. As even the Indians would admit the bureaucracy is astounding.</p><p>LAKE (voice over): Last year China awarded Honeywell and $11 billion contract to make landing equipment for its new plane maker, Comac. Some firms have complained over a lack of openness in China, but it remains a key market for Honeywell.</p><p>COTE: The growing pains are tough for both, partners, right? And that is one of the things that has to get sorted through. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't complain about the things that do need to change. And we should. By the same token, we shouldn't view them as evil, or bad, or out to destroy us. Because at the end of the day, as you know, economics is not a zero-sum game; both sides benefit from the transaction or you wouldn't do it.</p><p>LAKE: You are growing and on an aggressive acquisition trial. Why does that work for Honeywell, when it didn't seem to work out for so many others?</p><p>COTE: First thing that we never allow to happen is exactly what you talked about. Is there is the zeal for the deal, as I call it. Where you just get so-this is going to be great. You all start believing your own stories. This is going to be terrific. And you actually start ignoring some of the stuff you find in due diligence. And you need to have the discipline that says even when you get to the final negotiating table you can still walk away. You can't fall so in live with anything that you'll do it regardless, because everything is going to be great.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Now that is advice from the top; zeal for the deal, from the CEO of Honeywell.</p><p>On Monday, on this program, we turn our focus to the supply chain as we examine how products that we use everyday might be linked to modern-day slavery. Part of our year-long freedom project, it is a week of coverage that could be here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, as we turn the spotlight on the business side of human trafficking.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. This is CNN and on this network it is the news that always comes first.</p><p>(NEWSBREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, this is CNN and, on this network, it's the news that always comes first.</p><p>Violence in northern Afghanistan after a demonstration turns deadly. Police in Mazar-i-Sharif say at least a dozen people, including eight UN workers, were killed when a UN operation center was attacked after this protest. The demonstration was against the reported burning of a Koran earlier this month by a pastor in Florida.</p><p>To the Ivory Coast, where forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara are closer to taking over the commercial capital of Abidjan. They've taken control of the state-run television and attacked the residents of the self-declared president Laurent Gbagbo. France, the US, and the African Union are now calling on Gbagbo to hand over power.</p><p>Libya's opposition says rebels have launched a new offensive near Al- Brega against forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi. Meanwhile, both sides are proposing ways to end the civil war off the battlefield, but the conditions they're setting are very different.</p><p>The financial fallout from the Japanese disaster, far and wide, as you've heard on this program. Now, for Japan, tourism accounts for just two percent of the economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.</p><p>Scott Durchslag is the president of Expedia Worldwide, and yesterday he joined me and told me what travel trends Expedia is seeing in the region and has been seeing since March the 11th.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT DURCHSLAG, PRESIDENT, EXPEDIA WORLDWIDE: Well, it's interesting. We're seeing, lately, there has been some decline in demand, as you'd expect, given the seriousness of what's happening there.</p><p>But in the first days, it was much more mixed, because you had an explosion of outbound travel, obviously, happening. And a lot of domestic hotel bookings happening. So, it's still very early days, in terms of the long-term impact on this, but at the moment we are seeing some decline in the demand.</p><p>QUEST: You see, the thing is, Japan is actually quite an important part for Expedia, isn't it? And you were looking at Japan as being a major source in revenue in the future.</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Yes, Japan is, for us, a pretty high-growth market, and it's part of our broader Asia investment profile, which is a market that's been growing 54 percent in the last two years.</p><p>QUEST: Just to explain that, you don't expect that to continue, surely?</p><p>DURCHSLAG: I do expect that to continue, sure. What's happening in Japan is one of many events that's been happening in a year that's out of Revelations. Floods in Australia, earthquakes, tsunamis, nuclear issues. It's been a very difficult year.</p><p>But overall, the intrinsics on Asia are very powerful, $200 billion travel market that's growing faster than any other market in the world, and online penetration, which is very important to us, is only 20 percent, less than half the US or Europe. So, there's a lot of upside growth in Asia.</p><p>QUEST: Which is why, of course, your deal with Tony Fernandes of AirAsia is particularly relevant, isn't it? Even though it's been criticized by the opponents?</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Well, sure. We are really excited about our partnership with AirAsia, the reason being, it's the first deal ever that brings together an online travel agency and a low-cost carrier.</p><p>QUEST: Now, aren't you in an uncomfortable position? Because you've got this deal, but you're still saying you are neutral or, at least, not biased towards that particular airline.</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Well, we're all about bringing the best choices to our travelers, and having a low-cost carrier on Expedia, in addition to all of the other 300 airlines that we have, 130,000 hotel rooms, that is only to the benefit of consumers.</p><p>QUEST: You've obviously online, and the penetration online is very severe and very harsh, the marketplace. But now, you're moving into social media, as well.</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Yes, we're driving a new strategy called Expedia Everywhere that's all about mobile. Because what's more intrinsically mobile than travel? And what's more intrinsically social than travel? One of the major trends in travel is friends and families going together.</p><p>So, we've announced just today the largest sweepstakes ever done on Facebook that's been hosted on Facebook, and we just announced last week a brand new application called Expedia Hotels, Mobile and social are the future of travel.</p><p>QUEST: Why? Why do you want -- I mean, I go online and I book my ticket. Why do I need Expedia getting in my Facebook, my Twitter, and all these other social media areas?</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Well, because first of all, we want to be a personalized travel assistant in your pocket while you're on the fly, if you're late, on a flight, or you have to rebook or a flight is canceled. With one click, you can do that on Expedia.</p><p>And socially, you want to be able to share your itinerary with your friends so they can come with you. Or your pictures afterwards.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: The president of Expedia Worldwide talking to me. On this program, of course, we take great importance to the travel and tourism industry.</p><p>Now, we've been hearing a lot about how the disaster in Japan has been affecting the travel industry. There is, of course, another factor that affects airline prices, and that is the cost of fuel. Brent is currently trading at almost $119 a barrel. It's gained 25 percent, give or take, since the start of the year.</p><p>On this program this week, we've had three airline chief executives, and here are their thoughts on the sky-high price of oil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIE WALSH, CEO, INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP: I think at $115 a barrel, it's a challenge. But I don't think it's going to undermine the economic recovery that we've seen in most major economies.</p><p>I think if oil goes above $150 a barrel, it's something that everybody will be concerned about, but I'm pleased to say we're not there at this point.</p><p>ROB FYFE, CEO, AIR NEW ZEALAND: I'd actually be happy with fuel at $150. I'd be happy with fuel at $200. We are actually an incredibly robust airline. We've got a very strong balance sheet. There's a lot of airlines out there that struggle to economically survive. They get by by the skin of their teeth. To be honest, if high fuel started to claim some of the struggling airlines out of the industry --</p><p>QUEST: Oh!</p><p>FYFE: -- it wouldn't concern me at all.</p><p>QUEST: Oh! Oh! That's a polite -- you just want -- you want nutcracker the competition!</p><p>FYFE: Well, the reality is, the strong should get stronger, and those that aren't strong enough should, actually, fall by the wayside.</p><p>JEFF SMISEK, CEO, UNITED AIRLINES: We need to make money no matter what the oil prices. And we need to adjust to that, which means investing in modern fuel-efficient aircraft, engines, operations. So, we need to learn to make money in high oil prices. And I believe that we're likely to have oil prices for a -- high oil prices for a long time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Jeff Smisk, Rob Fyfe, and Willie Walsh talking to me during the course of the week.</p><p>Frequent fliers, business travelers, are horrified when we board a plane and find children sitting in business class near us. Well, there are two sides to this argument, and anyone with a young family will tell you it's difficult flying with kids.</p><p>Well, today, we heard of a new airline that's courting a very specific clientele. These are flights exclusively for children.</p><p>The flight-booking site Skyscanner says Urchin Airways will become the world's first kids-only carrier. The rules will say no passengers under (sic) the age of 16 will be allowed onboard. There will be flight attendants, and children will be entertained during the flight with competitions and the cabin crew dressed as clowns. Urchin will coordinate with other mainline regular carriers so parents and children can be reunited at their final destination. The families we spoke to thought this was a most exciting prospect.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's a wonderful idea. They're going to have so much fun. They've talked of little else for days. I mean, win- win. I get to drink a glass of wine and they get to play. It's perfect. I'll meet them at the other end. It's wonderful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Well, I can't wait to meet the clowns, because they're going to be cabin crew. And I heard there's going to be egg and spoon games, as well, so that sounds really fun.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Also, there's going to be, like, ice cream and we can eat it for supper, and there's going to be screaming contests and on one's there to say that we can't scream as much as we like.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: A brilliant idea, just don't book me ever, ever, on Urchin Airways.</p><p>That's not the only airline proposal raising eyebrows this Friday. Everyone, it seems, they're going to ever more weird and wonderful ways to keep your business. We'll talk about the airlines after the break.</p><p>QUEST: It has been mild weather and we've had sunny skies. Western Europe's had a wonderful week. Except, of course, if you're heading towards allergy season, like myself. And frankly, Pedram, at the World Weather Center -- I -- I mean, I knew the weather was changing. The throat gets tighter, the nose starts running.</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, you don't need a forecast. When you see the conditions that have been as nice as they have, of course, they're going to have hard effects, there, on folks that are suffering allergies.</p><p>And as Richard said, it's been fairly mild, and the conditions over the next 24 hours, going to remain mild for at least one more day across portions of London. There it is. That's 17 degrees, your forecast high temperature. We'll call it partly to mostly cloudy by the afternoon hours, perhaps a shower.</p><p>That's really the good news out of this as it begins to help clean up the air, the atmosphere that has been a little polluted with the pollination that's been taking place out there.</p><p>But as we talked about, what's going on out there, especially across the United Kingdom? What's causing all this? Well, you have to keep in mind, Richard's not alone with this one. Some 20 percent of folks across the United Kingdom are affected by allergies this time of year.</p><p>Now, you just go back a couple of months, the harsh winter that we had. Remember the snow showers, the cold conditions? That actually helps promote early pollination as we get these warm spells that we were getting in the past few days. So, with the warm temperatures, that's helping things out.</p><p>What's the predominate pollen right now for this time of year? Typically, we talk about birch, ash, elm, and willow, the tree pollens. That's probably what Richard is feeling, here, the past few days with the tree pollens being among the high.</p><p>Now, if you suffer symptoms in June and July, more than likely, that becomes a grass pollen concern as we head on towards the summer season.</p><p>But what do you do? Well, the best thing to do is to avoid the peak times. Experts say 7:00 to 10:00 AM, that's one of the times the trees begin pollinating, and also releasing pollen about 4:00 to 7:00 PM. So, early mornings, early afternoons, that's really the concern out there, being staying indoors.</p><p>Also, changing your clothes. Believe it or not, changing your clothes when you get back inside the house, that could help the concern, as well, as a lot of the pollen clings on right to your clothing and makes you sneeze all around the house after you've come indoors. So, you're wondering why you're feeling the symptoms when you're inside? That could be the reason. You can change your clothes.</p><p>But here is a storm system that is entering the picture. That, again, will help mix up the atmosphere a little bit as we head on into Saturday, partly to mostly cloudy skies around London, and Western Europe could get some showers out of this. And also across the north, a few showers.</p><p>So, the temperatures are going to cool down, that'll suppress some of the pollen levels, there, in the next few days, and the conditions are going to improve. But really, the warmest air mass still stays to the south, here, across portions of southern France into Spain, Portugal getting well above-average readings, some 10 to 12 degrees above average over the next couple of days.</p><p>And if you've got some travel plans out there, looks like travel not going to be affected by this much, as we're seeing breezy conditions and, again, a few showers possible. But all in all, an improving forecast for Mr. Quest out there, and perhaps some of the folks that are dealing with the allergies, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: We thank you for that. I'm not sure whether knowing about the allergies actually makes it any better, but Pedram, we do thank you. I think the most extraordinary thing is the way I'm finding them coming on as I get older. There must be a moral in there somewhere. Pedram, have a good weekend.</p><p>JAVAHERI: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Now, finally to you, don't say you weren't warned. April Fool's Day on a week when we've spoken to a number of the top airlines. The entire industry, why oh why is it the airline industry that decided to get April Fools silly?</p><p>For example, Virgin Atlantic, they announced that they were growing fresh herbs and vegetables for upper class passengers in the galley. Apparently, the galley would be onboard, and they promised fresh mint for mojitos.</p><p>That was an April Fool.</p><p>Ryanair had everyone confused. They said they had child-free flights from October. The press release was dated April the 1st, but it was released, seemingly, yesterday, because I read that story. So, Ryanair -- I'm not sure who the final fool was, Michael. Your press release came out early. Anyway, we still had that one.</p><p>And then, finally, yes. We did it to you. Urchin Airways, kids only flights, the opposite of Ryanair, kids only, sorry. April Fool!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: You've been April Fooled.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: They were, of course, in on the joke. And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in London. Whatever you're up to in the weekend ahead, have a good weekend. Thank you for your time and attention. MARKETPLACE AFRICA is next.</p><p>ROBYN CURNOW, CNN HOST: You're watching MARKETPLACE AFRICA. I'm Robyn Curnow here on the streets of Johannesburg. We begin this week's show with a look at a multibillion-dollar industry that is both dangerous and illegal -- counterfeit drugs.</p><p>The World Health Organization estimates that a third of all medicines in the developing world are fake. So, how do you choose between what is real and what isn't? Lives are lost in that gamble. But as Christian Purefoy now reports, mobile technology is helping Africans to make an educated choice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTIAN PUREFOY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Armed police cracking down hard on Nigeria's fake drug sellers. But, say the authorities, these raids are not enough to stop counterfeit drugs flooding Nigeria's streets.</p><p>GARBA MACDONALD, DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR OF ENFORCEMENT, NAFDAC: Considering the level of poverty, people will want to go for the cheapest.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): And the big men behind the sale of these drugs? Do they pose a danger to you and your men?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, they do. They are problems because they can organize, they have the money, they can organize thugs to attack us. We cannot deal with this without more policemen.</p><p>PUREFOY: So, this is big money.</p><p>MACDONALD: Oh, it's big money, yes, sure. Big money.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): As Femi Sorenmekun, director of a local diabetes drug company, explains, the major problem is identifying which box of drugs is real, and which is fake. Until now, with the introduction of a small scratch card packaged with all his medications.</p><p>FEMI SOREMEKUN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BIOCHEM PHARMACEUTICALS: Then they scratch it, and upon scratching it, a number is revealed.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): If we text that now -- ?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Definitely, if you text that now, you're going to --</p><p>PUREFOY: What happens?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: You're going to get a message telling you --</p><p>PUREFOY: Can we try it?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Yes, you can.</p><p>PUREFOY: There you go. So, that's almost immediate.</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Yes. Almost immediate.</p><p>PUREFOY: But when someone receives this text, it says \"OK,\" they know that drug is original.</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Is original.</p><p>PUREFOY: Has it worked? Has it helped your business? Has it helped the sales?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Yes, it has. We've been able to capture most of our market share back. Because we can't eliminate fake 100 percent. But what we've lost, we've captured it back, and we can see some growth, now, in the business.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): The idea is borrowed from the scratch cards sold on street corners across Africa use to top up mobile phones with credit.</p><p>Applying this scratch card innovation to the drug market is the idea of Ashifi Gogo.</p><p>ASHIFI GOGO, CEO, SPROXIL, INC.: The good thing is the consumer is not paying. The government is not paying, as well. And it's the pharm companies that are paying Sproxil for the service. The rationale being they can recoup market share that's been lost to counterfeiters.</p><p>So, in some sense, the counterfeiters are paying for the service, which puts a smile on lots of people's faces, I guess, except for the counterfeiters.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): A simple tool that investigators hope will make raids like this one less necessary. Christian Purefoy, CNN, Lagos, Nigeria.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: So, anti-malarial drugs are the most commonly counterfeited medication here in Africa. The United Nations estimates that in some parts of the continent, between 50 to 60 percent of all anti-insective drugs don't have acceptable levels of their active ingredients.</p><p>And more disturbingly, a World Health Organization Study found that Ghana was the worst affected, 67 percent of their most common anti-malarial drugs were found to have failed potency tests.</p><p>Now, up next, he coined the phrase \"BRIC\" to describe the top emerging-market economies. But what does he have to say about South Africa's entry into that elite club? Up next on MARKETPLACE AFRICA, we interview leading economist Jim O'Neill.</p><p>CURNOW: Welcome back to MARKETPLACE AFRICA. They're known as the fastest-growing emerging markets, Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Together, they're known as BRIC, an acronym coined by our next guest on Face Time, Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>In the next few weeks, South Africa joins the BRIC summit in Beijing, hoping its inclusion will raise its status and prestige on the world stage. But Jim O'Neill now weighs in on whether he thinks South Africa really deserves a seat at that table.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM O'NEILL, CHAIRMAN, GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT: To be a BRIC, it has to be an economy that is really at the core, today, or likely to be in the future, of the world economy. So, it has to be big enough to be economically impactful on everybody else.</p><p>And so, against that general background, an economy that is already three to five percent of global GDP or is likely to be on in a vaguely foreseeable future. And if you go with that definition, there's only a clear four there are, Brazil, Russia, India, India, and China.</p><p>To be a \"Next 11\" country, it is literally a phrase that I dreamed up seven years ago as a result of people saying, well, why just those four? Why not Indonesia? Why not Mexico? Why not Turkey? Why not South Africa? Et cetera et cetera. And it's a phrase to describe the next 11 largest population countries from the emerging world.</p><p>NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: If the N-11 is such a fluid --</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes.</p><p>ELBAGIR: -- concept, why do you think there has been so much controversy over South Africa jumping over the N-11 to be part of the BRICS club.</p><p>O'NEILL: South Africa's so unique and, in this context, quite odd. Because South Africa has some aspects of development, particularly financial markets, some aspects of the better standards of Western practices in terms of regulatory matters and Western law. And with that, there has been historic trade organizations that South Africa's linked to, particularly with Brazil and India.</p><p>And so, with the whole growth of the BRIC idea, particularly when it became a BRIC political club, for South Africa to be not part of it is obviously something that South African leaders feel a little bit, \"What's going on here?\"</p><p>Beyond that, I'm not sure why South Africa's managed to leap above it. Because if you look at the criteria I said earlier about what's a BRIC and what's a Next 11, South Africa doesn't even come close to -- certainly, not a BRIC. South African economy at, what? $350 billion is half the sum of global GDP.</p><p>So, it's nowhere near constituting a BRIC, and without staggering productivity improvements and major immigration or improvements in birthrates, et cetera, et cetera, it's never going to get there.</p><p>South Africa's really stimulated my mind to explore this further, because there are some others, like Poland, Saudi Arabia, who have more reason to be irked about these things, perhaps, than just South Africa. Because, of course, when you look at the Next 11 definition, South Africa doesn't actually have that many people, either. And in the context of the continent, Nigeria is the place that really matters.</p><p>ELBAGIR: I was going to say, do you think they've missed the trick by taking in South Africa rather than Nigeria?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think it's been, because the South African leaders and leading intellects have been so persistent about it and maybe the Chinese and Indians and others thought, \"You know what? OK, guys. If it shuts you up, come in.\"</p><p>But there is another angle to it, of course, that I'm sure South Africa has perhaps played on the notion that because they do have developed markets and western government standards in some areas, they've said, \"Look, we're the gateway to the rest of Africa,\" and that's certainly an argument with some legitimacy.</p><p>ELBAGIR: What would you advice -- if you were advising the South African government, what should they do to earn their place at the BRIC table?</p><p>O'NEILL: That South African --</p><p>ELBAGIR: The South African government. Or do you think it's a -- anyhow, it's a lost cause?</p><p>O'NEILL: No, I don't. No, nowhere is a lost cause. I think South African leaders have to be bolder about the basics and not be so worried about what club they're in or not. They've got acceptance, they're in the G-20, they've been invited to the big political meeters -- leaders' meeting, and they're there.</p><p>What they've now got to do is, as with the World Cup, turn an event into some lasting improvement. Stop thinking that because of Apartheid and other tragic historical things, stop thinking that world owes South Africa something for its past, and do things to create a better environment where you can attract a lot more international business.</p><p>And most importantly, embrace all your own people in a competitive, open way and find everybody jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: Is South Africa qualified to be a member of BRIC? Tell us what you think. We're having a discussion on our Facebook page. But for now, let's just take a look at what's trending this week.</p><p>Foreign mining firms in Zimbabwe are scrambling following President Robert Mugabe's demand that they must sell a majority stake to local black Zimbabweans within six months. Shares at major mining companies dropped sharply upon the news.</p><p>The regulation follows an indigenization act signed into law three years ago, which aims to make foreign companies junior partners in Zimbabwe.</p><p>And Kumba Iron Ore is proposing a $7 billion steel plant in South Africa to help reduce unemployment.</p><p>President Jacob Zuma has asked businesses to help create 5 million jobs in the coming decade. The proposed plant would create 3,000 jobs and export up to five billion tons of steel each year to buyers in Asia.</p><p>So, if you have any ideas on who we should interview or what stories we should be doing, please do connect with us. We're on Facebook, we're on Twitter, and you can e-mail us.

Sorry clear evidence of real damage now at Japan's economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a Friday. We're together. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.</p><p>April the 1st, and the start of a new quarter, and of course, April Fool's Day. The international festival of pranks. I can hear you already asking, will they, or won't they? Well, we may. Or we may not. And the only way you will find out is if you keep watching.</p><p>And you'll want to keep watching because we lead off tonight with America, the land of opportunity, potentially again; hundreds of thousands are heading back to work. The U.S. economy gained more than 200,000 jobs last month and it sealed a solid 6 months of growth rates in the States.</p><p>Look at the way they have rose. It was a bit of a blip in January after some winter weather. But that growth, the trend seems to be heading firmly up. The unemployment rate in the U.S. now stands at 8.8 percent. Still high by the standards of developed countries and certainly by the United States, but that is the best number that has been seen in two years. And most of the growth now starting to come from the private sector, which added 230,000 jobs. The public sector battling against these cuts, of course, with the cuts, cut 14,000 and recovery is most definitely not on the cards. Certainly as budget deficits, both local, state, and federal level, continue; 13.5 million people are still out of work in the United States.</p><p><person><nameText>Jeff Joerres </nameText></person>is the CEO and chairman of Manpower Group, the new name for Manpower Inc., one of the world's largest employment agencies. Jeff is with me from Milwaukee.</p><p>Jeff, you just heard me summarize the situation. Good jobs, good private sector job growth, a fall in the unemployment, but it is still not enough.</p><p><person><nameText>JEFF JOERRES, </nameText></person>CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN, MANPOWER GROUP: Yes, we have to put it in context, as you said. This is good news. Because if you really simplify things is it getting the same, is it getting worse, or it is getting better? And it is getting better. So this is good news. The question is, when do we get to a point where we can actually feel like we are on the other side and get a breakthrough, which is closer to 300,000, 350,000, when we are really making up ground for the last four years of losing jobs. So, good news, just a long way to go yet.</p><p>QUEST: OK, traditionally, at this point in a recovery we should be seeing much more growth. You know, what you are seeing are those sectors where there is demand. What are they?</p><p>JOERRES: Well, we are still seeing demand in manufacturing. And that his key, because some of the entry-level and mid-level jobs in manufacturing pay better, it is great for the economy. But what we are also still seeing, across the board, whether it be the additions in health care, the additions in services, the additions in our industry. We added 29,000 jobs in our industry. What we are not seeing yet, is hiring in anticipation of demand. Companies are still getting more with less, driving and stretching out that workforce. And actually putting a lot of stress on that workforce right now.</p><p>QUEST: OK, if that is the situation and consumers are tapped out, they haven't fully deleveraged or they are-there is the prospect of higher interest rates. Not this year, but certainly they will arrive. Are we not just going to have to accept that the days of 4 to 5 percent unemployment are not going to be with us for many years?</p><p>JOERRES: I would agree. I mean I think it is mathematical. If you go to 250,000 jobs, or 300,000, you are still three and a half years away. You mentioned in your opening, the discouraged worker. How many turns in to that category in the next two to three years when they haven't found a job. Unemployment now goes for two years in the U.S., antiquating their skills. Companies are really in trouble right now being able to find talent. There is a mismatch. So, this \"Human Age\", which you announced and helped us announce, in the World Economic Forum, is on top of us. The conundrums are deeper than ever before.</p><p>QUEST: Jeff, many thanks. Have a good weekend, even with these numbers.</p><p>JOERRES: You too.</p><p>QUEST: And we'll talk again. Many thanks indeed. <person><nameText>Jeff Joerres </nameText></person>joining me from Milwaukee.</p><p>April the 1st, and the start of that new quarter. We need to take stock. And it is useful to do so by having a look and seeing where global economies-who gets the gold star. And what happens and where we go. This is the situation that you need to look at so far.</p><p>You've got the United States with its jobless level of 8.8, 2.1 inflation, and GDP. So far, so good. I suppose you could arguably say that gets across, that gets an OK. That's not too bad.</p><p>You then end up with Japan. We have to be a little bit careful with Japan, because of the tsunami and the earthquake. But the jobless level is high by their traditional standards. And inflation is an OK number. GDP, that is going to change.</p><p>It is the Euro Zone, jobless, a bad number, inflation, a bad number, the GDP, so-so, not too keen on that. And one of the reasons for all of this is the policies being put in place by them.</p><p>In the United States you have QE, which is nearly a trillion in the latest rounds, with states like Wisconsin, California, Illinois, making cuts. Japan, of course, has a crisis funding bill coming forward, probably in about April, and in 2010, there will be-there was obviously, 10s of billions in a stimulus package.</p><p>There is only one word of any relevance in the European Euro Zone. Except for that at the moment, it is, of course, going to be, very much the case, austerity.</p><p>Todd Benjamin is here to talk more about the situation and how it factors in.</p><p>TODD BENJAMIN, FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you. Great to see you.</p><p>You know, it is interesting how you are grading all of those, I don't think I would be quite as generous as you are. You know, I think there are shadings and I think it is not as simplistic as you make it out to be.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, simplistic?</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk about those jobless numbers to start with, in the United States.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Well, I think, you know, as Jeff said, it is great news. You know, it is the strongest number that we've had for a while. But still the long-term unemployed, it is very bad for them. Wages are stagnant. It has been that way four out of five months, which is great from an inflation standpoint, but not from a purchasing power standpoint. And the big question I have is once this QE2, this quantitative easing, ends in June- and it sounds like it will from all the noises most of the Fed members are making-is will the private sector really pick up the banner and create enough jobs to keep the economy growing?</p><p>QUEST: Not in the short-term, they won't.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Absolutely not. And so I'm a bid concerned about what happens, as you know, Jeff was saying, even Dudley, the vice chairman of the Fed, was talking today. He said, hey, not so fast. Not so fast, a lot of problems still in the economy. Including this idea, he said, even if you got 300,000 jobs a month, you would still have plenty of slack in the labor market by 2012. So it is going to be a very, very long process.</p><p>QUEST: All right. So, you've got Japan out of the equation for the short term. Germany is going quite well.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Exactly.</p><p>QUEST: But the rest of the Euro Zone isn't.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes, and I think you make a very important distinction here. You know, if you look at Germany it is going well. But if you look at other countries, you know, like Italy, like Ireland, like Spain, like Greece, like Portugal.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Lots and lots of problems.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>QUEST: You called me simplistic? Well, you said that my-</p><p>BENJAMIN: You are not simplistic. I just think this is-</p><p>QUEST: All right. The United States, A, B, or C?</p><p>BENJAMIN: I would give it probably a C, minus.</p><p>QUEST: A C, minus. I'm going to be more generous. I'm going to say a B, minus.</p><p>Japan, I think, well, I think it is unfair to give Japan any form of grading just at the moment.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: It would be a little bit-</p><p>BENJAMIN: But it's reconstruction program is going to be about 6 percent of GDP. So, you could see a V-shaped recovery there.</p><p>QUEST: All right. We'll give it a V-shape, a charitable V-shape.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: The Euro Zone, I mean?</p><p>BENJAMIN: Let's strip out Germany.</p><p>QUEST: Yes?</p><p>BENJAMIN: And you get a D, minus, or F.</p><p>QUEST: We both agree on that. Todd Benjamin, many thanks indeed for joining us and putting us into that form of perspective.</p><p>BENJAMIN: You bet.</p><p>QUEST: Now, we need to look and see how the markets are trading at the moment. The Big Board is open in New York, up 87 points, at 12,407. We are heading to the New York Stock Exchange later in the program to find out why its parent company is the center of a bidding war.</p><p>Stock in Europe kicked off the second quarter with a strong session. Banking and energy shares top performers. Lloyds was up 5 percent in London. BP up 3.5 percent. These are the movements of the indices over the course of a week. Investors reacting to British/Irish-to Irish banks' stress tests.</p><p>When we come back in just a moment there will be more to talk about on the economic front and we'll be in Japan to show how the country's economic fate is now fairing, following the earthquake. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, good evening.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Tangible evidence is now starting to arrive of the financial damage being caused in Japan and the wider Asia region, by last month's earthquake and tsunami.</p><p>Now, manufacturing activity in March, it has fallen sharply, it is at its lowest point in two years. This is not surprising. The PMI down at 46.4. Remember anything under 50 percent shows contraction rather than expansion. Clearly recession of some sort on the horizon. The Japanese is cutting back and a new study says that China will over take Japan as the world's second largest tourist market. This is the Boston consulting group that say China will be that before the end of the year.</p><p>And if you look at trade overall, the ripple effects, if you look at the numbers that show exactly how much trade is done, intra-Asia, while countries like Australia and Indonesia are seeing exports to Japan obviously fall off. The Australian treasury says it will loose around $2 billion in ex-rev this fiscal year, as demand falls for things like coal and iron ore.</p><p>The ongoing struggle at Japan's crippled nuclear plant, attracted most of the headlines over the past few weeks. Now, as Martin Savidge explains, that is just one of the problems in a country facing economic catastrophe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In Japan the first Friday in April is traditionally the first day on the job for fresh-faced college graduates who generally work for one company their whole career.</p><p>Here the latest class of 7-Eleven employees sing a song of joy. But this year across the country the chorus is not nearly so strong. It is said to be the smallest class of new hires since mid-`90s. According to experts the devastating earthquake and tsunami will only accelerate that business trend.</p><p>JASPER KOLL, HEAD OF JAPANESE EQUITY RESEARCH, JP MORGAN: Those Japanese companies, moving more aggressively overseas, because that is where the profit margins are, and that is where the markets are. \\</p><p>SAVIDGE: The disaster's economic shock is being felt by land, air and sea. Japan's auto sales in March were down 37 percent. Toyota was hardest hit. Its sales were down nearly 50 percent, with 16 of 18 factories closed.</p><p>Since the quake, Japan airlines reports international air travel has dropped by 25 percent. Other carriers such as Delta are trimming routes to and from Japan and using smaller planes. Japan's seafood industry has had a double blow. More than 6,000 fishing boats were damaged or destroyed by the tsunami, while fear of radiation is cutting into exports and spoiling appetites in the world's second largest seafood market.</p><p>These are truly dark days with two large key power facilities off line because of tsunami damage, Tokyo Electric Power Company, TEPCO, has lost 20 percent of its production capacity. Threatening the Tokyo region with rolling blackouts to save energy, lights, escalators, even mass transit have been shut down.</p><p>(On camera): 6 million people ride the Tokyo subway every single day. Now those six million will have to fit into 20 percent fewer trains to save electricity.</p><p>(Voice over): With remarkable speed the disaster is even reshaping Japanese society. In light of so much suffering, excess is out, saving is in, celebration subdued. The change felt even by the seasons. As this sign simply says, the nation's iconic Cherry Blossom Festival has been cancelled. Martin Savidge, CNN, Tokyo.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: The situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant remains unstable and speculation is that the Japanese government plans to intervene, or even nationalize TEPCO, the Tokyo Electric Power Company. That speculation hasn't gone away. TEPCO shares are down another 3.5 percent on the first day of the new fiscal year in Japan. TEPCO is down close to 50 percent this week alone. Three-quarters of the value of the company on the exchanges have evaporated since the start of the crisis.</p><p>And no relief for the Nikkei. It finished the day off down around half a percent.</p><p>After the break, to New York, where the world's most famous stock exchange has become the center of a bidding war itself, in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: The New York Stock Exchange has been the home to many a bidding war for the companies listed on the exchange. And now, the exchange is the victim itself of the bidding war. NYSEEuronext, its parent company operating exchanges in New York and Europe, in February the New York Stock Exchange agreed to be bought by Deutsche Boerse, for $10 billion. Now it would have created the world's largest exchange.</p><p>But this is fascinating. Now, Nasdaq OMX, and Intercontinental Exchange, crashed the party.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>Launched and $11.3-billion bid. Good grief! The big board is now a big bid. Alison Kosik is in New York.</p><p>Alison, we thought, come on, be honest, we thought that Deutsche Boerse deal was done dusted and all we had to do was lick the envelope.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, but you know what? Nothing like a really good bidding war to get Wall Street in a flutter, right? You know? I mean, I was talking to some traders about this and, you know, just like with anything they are pros and cons. They say a big positive is what you are seeing right now. NYSE shares are up almost 13 percent. This is a great move for shareholders, because the offer comes with a 19 percent premium. And the NYSE could also keep its domestic ownership.</p><p>And then, of course, there are the negatives. You know, the Deutsche Boerse deal would be better. I'm talking about the negatives, for the Nasdaq. The Deutsche Boerse deal, traders say, would be better because it is a worldwide platform. And it is better for the NYSE in the long run.</p><p>Now, we spoke with Duncan Niederauer, the head of the NYSE, back in February, when the Deutsche Boerse was announced at the NYSE. He definitely echoed that sentiment. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, NYSE: The fact of the matter is the equity, the U.S. equity business for our company the way it is currently constructed, is not the majority of the business anymore. It was our view several years ago that with a lot of the competition in the business here, we could not rely on U.S. equities as our single source of profitability over the long run. We also appreciate that the markets are global. The capital markets are worldwide. And I think our view is we have got to continue to be invested in those markets and services across the value chain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KOSIK: And of course it is all about the money making derivatives. That is really where it is at these days, you know, and the fact is many people really don't mind the exchange, Richard, being controlled by an overseas company like Deutsche Boerse, especially since NYSE merged with Euronext a while back, right?</p><p>QUEST: OK, let's put aside who owns what in terms of overseas, and the xenophobic argument that will be brought forward about foreigners ramping up the ramparts of Wall Street. But the fact is Nasdaq is, if you like, the bogie man rival to the Big Board, ever since it started. And it is, you know, scooped up all the big tech stocks.</p><p>KOSIK: And you are right. I mean, there is this-you know this-there has been this ongoing rivalry between the Nasdaq and the NYSE. You know each one, the same customer. They all want the same market share. I mean, we saw the tit for tat going on when we saw the flash crash back on May 6 of last year. You know they were finger pointing, all right, who is responsible for the glitch? Yes, there is no love lost between the two exchanges.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>KOSIK: I can't imagine Duncan Niederauer sitting down with Bob Greifeld for tea at this point, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: OK. I don't know if you are a betting woman or not, but on this Friday, if ever you had to have a dollar on who is going to win, would it be the Nasdaq or the Deutsche Boerse?</p><p>KOSIK: I put my money on Deutsche Boerse, definitely. Yes.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>KOSIK: But it has to go through the regulatory process. But that is who I'm putting money on.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, oh, that is the boilerplate caveat that she' putting in at the end just to make sure. That is the disclaimer.</p><p>All right. Many thanks, Alison. Have a great weekend.</p><p>KOSIK: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Many thanks. Don't forget, what we say means absolutely nothing. Because it all depends on what the shareholders in those companies actually believe. But I think probably Alison is well and truly on the money.</p><p>One U.S. stock, Morgan Stanley has tipped for big growth this year, is Honeywell. CNN's Maggie Lake met the conglomerate's chief executive to find out why and bring us a closer look at this key company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): They have aerospace contracts around the world, but also make everything from home security alarms to energy efficient car products, and safety gloves. In short, a classic conglomerate, over a century old, with annual sales of $33 billion.</p><p>Morgan Stanley recently tipped Honeywell shares, which are currently at their highest level since the financial crisis. We met CEO David Cote at the firm's campus in New Jersey.</p><p>(on camera): With such uncertain times, such turmoil around the world, what is it that makes you so bullish about Honeywell's outlook?</p><p>DAVID COTE, CEO, HONEYWELL: I don't think there is as much uncertainty as a lot of people might suspect. I do believe as about nine, 10 months ago, the recovery started to become for real. And we started being a net revenue (ph) ourselves, at that time. And we saw orders continue to do well during that time. And I really think we're on the path to a global recovery right now, that could go on for four or five years, who knows?</p><p>But I do think that that the path that we're on. We're just very pleased with the positions that we have, because we pay a lot of attention to try be in the middle of macro trends that just are going to last for a long time. Whether it is energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, those are the sort of things that are going to last for a long time. We are well positioned within that. And that great positions in some good industries really puts you in the right places.</p><p>LAKE: You get 50 percent of your growth, globally.</p><p>COTE: Hmmm.</p><p>LAKE: Are those growth rates sustainable?</p><p>COTE: There are things that have to be managed as you go along. I would say the China track record has been very good at being able to figure out how you do this. Because it is not-an economy is not a static thing. In fact, one of the things you want to maintain is the dynamism in an economy.</p><p>China, so far, has made all the right calls. For 30 years they have been making the right decisions and proceeding inexorably to greater and greater growth for their people. India will have to make those same kind of decisions, because it didn't quite start so soon for them. There is more learning that needs to go on. As even the Indians would admit the bureaucracy is astounding.</p><p>LAKE (voice over): Last year China awarded Honeywell and $11 billion contract to make landing equipment for its new plane maker, Comac. Some firms have complained over a lack of openness in China, but it remains a key market for Honeywell.</p><p>COTE: The growing pains are tough for both, partners, right? And that is one of the things that has to get sorted through. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't complain about the things that do need to change. And we should. By the same token, we shouldn't view them as evil, or bad, or out to destroy us. Because at the end of the day, as you know, economics is not a zero-sum game; both sides benefit from the transaction or you wouldn't do it.</p><p>LAKE: You are growing and on an aggressive acquisition trial. Why does that work for Honeywell, when it didn't seem to work out for so many others?</p><p>COTE: First thing that we never allow to happen is exactly what you talked about. Is there is the zeal for the deal, as I call it. Where you just get so-this is going to be great. You all start believing your own stories. This is going to be terrific. And you actually start ignoring some of the stuff you find in due diligence. And you need to have the discipline that says even when you get to the final negotiating table you can still walk away. You can't fall so in live with anything that you'll do it regardless, because everything is going to be great.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Now that is advice from the top; zeal for the deal, from the CEO of Honeywell.</p><p>On Monday, on this program, we turn our focus to the supply chain as we examine how products that we use everyday might be linked to modern-day slavery. Part of our year-long freedom project, it is a week of coverage that could be here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, as we turn the spotlight on the business side of human trafficking.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. This is CNN and on this network it is the news that always comes first.</p><p>(NEWSBREAK)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, this is CNN and, on this network, it's the news that always comes first.</p><p>Violence in northern Afghanistan after a demonstration turns deadly. Police in Mazar-i-Sharif say at least a dozen people, including eight UN workers, were killed when a UN operation center was attacked after this protest. The demonstration was against the reported burning of a Koran earlier this month by a pastor in Florida.</p><p>To the Ivory Coast, where forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara are closer to taking over the commercial capital of Abidjan. They've taken control of the state-run television and attacked the residents of the self-declared president Laurent Gbagbo. France, the US, and the African Union are now calling on Gbagbo to hand over power.</p><p>Libya's opposition says rebels have launched a new offensive near Al- Brega against forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi. Meanwhile, both sides are proposing ways to end the civil war off the battlefield, but the conditions they're setting are very different.</p><p>The financial fallout from the Japanese disaster, far and wide, as you've heard on this program. Now, for Japan, tourism accounts for just two percent of the economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.</p><p>Scott Durchslag is the president of Expedia Worldwide, and yesterday he joined me and told me what travel trends Expedia is seeing in the region and has been seeing since March the 11th.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT DURCHSLAG, PRESIDENT, EXPEDIA WORLDWIDE: Well, it's interesting. We're seeing, lately, there has been some decline in demand, as you'd expect, given the seriousness of what's happening there.</p><p>But in the first days, it was much more mixed, because you had an explosion of outbound travel, obviously, happening. And a lot of domestic hotel bookings happening. So, it's still very early days, in terms of the long-term impact on this, but at the moment we are seeing some decline in the demand.</p><p>QUEST: You see, the thing is, Japan is actually quite an important part for Expedia, isn't it? And you were looking at Japan as being a major source in revenue in the future.</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Yes, Japan is, for us, a pretty high-growth market, and it's part of our broader Asia investment profile, which is a market that's been growing 54 percent in the last two years.</p><p>QUEST: Just to explain that, you don't expect that to continue, surely?</p><p>DURCHSLAG: I do expect that to continue, sure. What's happening in Japan is one of many events that's been happening in a year that's out of Revelations. Floods in Australia, earthquakes, tsunamis, nuclear issues. It's been a very difficult year.</p><p>But overall, the intrinsics on Asia are very powerful, $200 billion travel market that's growing faster than any other market in the world, and online penetration, which is very important to us, is only 20 percent, less than half the US or Europe. So, there's a lot of upside growth in Asia.</p><p>QUEST: Which is why, of course, your deal with Tony Fernandes of AirAsia is particularly relevant, isn't it? Even though it's been criticized by the opponents?</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Well, sure. We are really excited about our partnership with AirAsia, the reason being, it's the first deal ever that brings together an online travel agency and a low-cost carrier.</p><p>QUEST: Now, aren't you in an uncomfortable position? Because you've got this deal, but you're still saying you are neutral or, at least, not biased towards that particular airline.</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Well, we're all about bringing the best choices to our travelers, and having a low-cost carrier on Expedia, in addition to all of the other 300 airlines that we have, 130,000 hotel rooms, that is only to the benefit of consumers.</p><p>QUEST: You've obviously online, and the penetration online is very severe and very harsh, the marketplace. But now, you're moving into social media, as well.</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Yes, we're driving a new strategy called Expedia Everywhere that's all about mobile. Because what's more intrinsically mobile than travel? And what's more intrinsically social than travel? One of the major trends in travel is friends and families going together.</p><p>So, we've announced just today the largest sweepstakes ever done on Facebook that's been hosted on Facebook, and we just announced last week a brand new application called Expedia Hotels, Mobile and social are the future of travel.</p><p>QUEST: Why? Why do you want -- I mean, I go online and I book my ticket. Why do I need Expedia getting in my Facebook, my Twitter, and all these other social media areas?</p><p>DURCHSLAG: Well, because first of all, we want to be a personalized travel assistant in your pocket while you're on the fly, if you're late, on a flight, or you have to rebook or a flight is canceled. With one click, you can do that on Expedia.</p><p>And socially, you want to be able to share your itinerary with your friends so they can come with you. Or your pictures afterwards.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: The president of Expedia Worldwide talking to me. On this program, of course, we take great importance to the travel and tourism industry.</p><p>Now, we've been hearing a lot about how the disaster in Japan has been affecting the travel industry. There is, of course, another factor that affects airline prices, and that is the cost of fuel. Brent is currently trading at almost $119 a barrel. It's gained 25 percent, give or take, since the start of the year.</p><p>On this program this week, we've had three airline chief executives, and here are their thoughts on the sky-high price of oil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIE WALSH, CEO, INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP: I think at $115 a barrel, it's a challenge. But I don't think it's going to undermine the economic recovery that we've seen in most major economies.</p><p>I think if oil goes above $150 a barrel, it's something that everybody will be concerned about, but I'm pleased to say we're not there at this point.</p><p>ROB FYFE, CEO, AIR NEW ZEALAND: I'd actually be happy with fuel at $150. I'd be happy with fuel at $200. We are actually an incredibly robust airline. We've got a very strong balance sheet. There's a lot of airlines out there that struggle to economically survive. They get by by the skin of their teeth. To be honest, if high fuel started to claim some of the struggling airlines out of the industry --</p><p>QUEST: Oh!</p><p>FYFE: -- it wouldn't concern me at all.</p><p>QUEST: Oh! Oh! That's a polite -- you just want -- you want nutcracker the competition!</p><p>FYFE: Well, the reality is, the strong should get stronger, and those that aren't strong enough should, actually, fall by the wayside.</p><p>JEFF SMISEK, CEO, UNITED AIRLINES: We need to make money no matter what the oil prices. And we need to adjust to that, which means investing in modern fuel-efficient aircraft, engines, operations. So, we need to learn to make money in high oil prices. And I believe that we're likely to have oil prices for a -- high oil prices for a long time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Jeff Smisk, Rob Fyfe, and Willie Walsh talking to me during the course of the week.</p><p>Frequent fliers, business travelers, are horrified when we board a plane and find children sitting in business class near us. Well, there are two sides to this argument, and anyone with a young family will tell you it's difficult flying with kids.</p><p>Well, today, we heard of a new airline that's courting a very specific clientele. These are flights exclusively for children.</p><p>The flight-booking site Skyscanner says Urchin Airways will become the world's first kids-only carrier. The rules will say no passengers under (sic) the age of 16 will be allowed onboard. There will be flight attendants, and children will be entertained during the flight with competitions and the cabin crew dressed as clowns. Urchin will coordinate with other mainline regular carriers so parents and children can be reunited at their final destination. The families we spoke to thought this was a most exciting prospect.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's a wonderful idea. They're going to have so much fun. They've talked of little else for days. I mean, win- win. I get to drink a glass of wine and they get to play. It's perfect. I'll meet them at the other end. It's wonderful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Well, I can't wait to meet the clowns, because they're going to be cabin crew. And I heard there's going to be egg and spoon games, as well, so that sounds really fun.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: Also, there's going to be, like, ice cream and we can eat it for supper, and there's going to be screaming contests and on one's there to say that we can't scream as much as we like.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: A brilliant idea, just don't book me ever, ever, on Urchin Airways.</p><p>That's not the only airline proposal raising eyebrows this Friday. Everyone, it seems, they're going to ever more weird and wonderful ways to keep your business. We'll talk about the airlines after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: It has been mild weather and we've had sunny skies. Western Europe's had a wonderful week. Except, of course, if you're heading towards allergy season, like myself. And frankly, Pedram, at the World Weather Center -- I -- I mean, I knew the weather was changing. The throat gets tighter, the nose starts running.</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, you don't need a forecast. When you see the conditions that have been as nice as they have, of course, they're going to have hard effects, there, on folks that are suffering allergies.</p><p>And as Richard said, it's been fairly mild, and the conditions over the next 24 hours, going to remain mild for at least one more day across portions of London. There it is. That's 17 degrees, your forecast high temperature. We'll call it partly to mostly cloudy by the afternoon hours, perhaps a shower.</p><p>That's really the good news out of this as it begins to help clean up the air, the atmosphere that has been a little polluted with the pollination that's been taking place out there.</p><p>But as we talked about, what's going on out there, especially across the United Kingdom? What's causing all this? Well, you have to keep in mind, Richard's not alone with this one. Some 20 percent of folks across the United Kingdom are affected by allergies this time of year.</p><p>Now, you just go back a couple of months, the harsh winter that we had. Remember the snow showers, the cold conditions? That actually helps promote early pollination as we get these warm spells that we were getting in the past few days. So, with the warm temperatures, that's helping things out.</p><p>What's the predominate pollen right now for this time of year? Typically, we talk about birch, ash, elm, and willow, the tree pollens. That's probably what Richard is feeling, here, the past few days with the tree pollens being among the high.</p><p>Now, if you suffer symptoms in June and July, more than likely, that becomes a grass pollen concern as we head on towards the summer season.</p><p>But what do you do? Well, the best thing to do is to avoid the peak times. Experts say 7:00 to 10:00 AM, that's one of the times the trees begin pollinating, and also releasing pollen about 4:00 to 7:00 PM. So, early mornings, early afternoons, that's really the concern out there, being staying indoors.</p><p>Also, changing your clothes. Believe it or not, changing your clothes when you get back inside the house, that could help the concern, as well, as a lot of the pollen clings on right to your clothing and makes you sneeze all around the house after you've come indoors. So, you're wondering why you're feeling the symptoms when you're inside? That could be the reason. You can change your clothes.</p><p>But here is a storm system that is entering the picture. That, again, will help mix up the atmosphere a little bit as we head on into Saturday, partly to mostly cloudy skies around London, and Western Europe could get some showers out of this. And also across the north, a few showers.</p><p>So, the temperatures are going to cool down, that'll suppress some of the pollen levels, there, in the next few days, and the conditions are going to improve. But really, the warmest air mass still stays to the south, here, across portions of southern France into Spain, Portugal getting well above-average readings, some 10 to 12 degrees above average over the next couple of days.</p><p>And if you've got some travel plans out there, looks like travel not going to be affected by this much, as we're seeing breezy conditions and, again, a few showers possible. But all in all, an improving forecast for Mr. Quest out there, and perhaps some of the folks that are dealing with the allergies, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: We thank you for that. I'm not sure whether knowing about the allergies actually makes it any better, but Pedram, we do thank you. I think the most extraordinary thing is the way I'm finding them coming on as I get older. There must be a moral in there somewhere. Pedram, have a good weekend.</p><p>JAVAHERI: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Now, finally to you, don't say you weren't warned. April Fool's Day on a week when we've spoken to a number of the top airlines. The entire industry, why oh why is it the airline industry that decided to get April Fools silly?</p><p>For example, Virgin Atlantic, they announced that they were growing fresh herbs and vegetables for upper class passengers in the galley. Apparently, the galley would be onboard, and they promised fresh mint for mojitos.</p><p>That was an April Fool.</p><p>Ryanair had everyone confused. They said they had child-free flights from October. The press release was dated April the 1st, but it was released, seemingly, yesterday, because I read that story. So, Ryanair -- I'm not sure who the final fool was, Michael. Your press release came out early. Anyway, we still had that one.</p><p>And then, finally, yes. We did it to you. Urchin Airways, kids only flights, the opposite of Ryanair, kids only, sorry. April Fool!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: You've been April Fooled.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: They were, of course, in on the joke. And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in London. Whatever you're up to in the weekend ahead, have a good weekend. Thank you for your time and attention. MARKETPLACE AFRICA is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROBYN CURNOW, CNN HOST: You're watching MARKETPLACE AFRICA. I'm Robyn Curnow here on the streets of Johannesburg. We begin this week's show with a look at a multibillion-dollar industry that is both dangerous and illegal -- counterfeit drugs.</p><p>The World Health Organization estimates that a third of all medicines in the developing world are fake. So, how do you choose between what is real and what isn't? Lives are lost in that gamble. But as Christian Purefoy now reports, mobile technology is helping Africans to make an educated choice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTIAN PUREFOY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Armed police cracking down hard on Nigeria's fake drug sellers. But, say the authorities, these raids are not enough to stop counterfeit drugs flooding Nigeria's streets.</p><p>GARBA MACDONALD, DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR OF ENFORCEMENT, NAFDAC: Considering the level of poverty, people will want to go for the cheapest.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): And the big men behind the sale of these drugs? Do they pose a danger to you and your men?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, they do. They are problems because they can organize, they have the money, they can organize thugs to attack us. We cannot deal with this without more policemen.</p><p>PUREFOY: So, this is big money.</p><p>MACDONALD: Oh, it's big money, yes, sure. Big money.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): As Femi Sorenmekun, director of a local diabetes drug company, explains, the major problem is identifying which box of drugs is real, and which is fake. Until now, with the introduction of a small scratch card packaged with all his medications.</p><p>FEMI SOREMEKUN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BIOCHEM PHARMACEUTICALS: Then they scratch it, and upon scratching it, a number is revealed.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): If we text that now -- ?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Definitely, if you text that now, you're going to --</p><p>PUREFOY: What happens?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: You're going to get a message telling you --</p><p>PUREFOY: Can we try it?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Yes, you can.</p><p>PUREFOY: There you go. So, that's almost immediate.</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Yes. Almost immediate.</p><p>PUREFOY: But when someone receives this text, it says \"OK,\" they know that drug is original.</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Is original.</p><p>PUREFOY: Has it worked? Has it helped your business? Has it helped the sales?</p><p>SOREMEKUN: Yes, it has. We've been able to capture most of our market share back. Because we can't eliminate fake 100 percent. But what we've lost, we've captured it back, and we can see some growth, now, in the business.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): The idea is borrowed from the scratch cards sold on street corners across Africa use to top up mobile phones with credit.</p><p>Applying this scratch card innovation to the drug market is the idea of Ashifi Gogo.</p><p>ASHIFI GOGO, CEO, SPROXIL, INC.: The good thing is the consumer is not paying. The government is not paying, as well. And it's the pharm companies that are paying Sproxil for the service. The rationale being they can recoup market share that's been lost to counterfeiters.</p><p>So, in some sense, the counterfeiters are paying for the service, which puts a smile on lots of people's faces, I guess, except for the counterfeiters.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): A simple tool that investigators hope will make raids like this one less necessary. Christian Purefoy, CNN, Lagos, Nigeria.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: So, anti-malarial drugs are the most commonly counterfeited medication here in Africa. The United Nations estimates that in some parts of the continent, between 50 to 60 percent of all anti-insective drugs don't have acceptable levels of their active ingredients.</p><p>And more disturbingly, a World Health Organization Study found that Ghana was the worst affected, 67 percent of their most common anti-malarial drugs were found to have failed potency tests.</p><p>Now, up next, he coined the phrase \"BRIC\" to describe the top emerging-market economies. But what does he have to say about South Africa's entry into that elite club? Up next on MARKETPLACE AFRICA, we interview leading economist Jim O'Neill.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CURNOW: Welcome back to MARKETPLACE AFRICA. They're known as the fastest-growing emerging markets, Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Together, they're known as BRIC, an acronym coined by our next guest on Face Time, Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>In the next few weeks, South Africa joins the BRIC summit in Beijing, hoping its inclusion will raise its status and prestige on the world stage. But Jim O'Neill now weighs in on whether he thinks South Africa really deserves a seat at that table.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM O'NEILL, CHAIRMAN, GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT: To be a BRIC, it has to be an economy that is really at the core, today, or likely to be in the future, of the world economy. So, it has to be big enough to be economically impactful on everybody else.</p><p>And so, against that general background, an economy that is already three to five percent of global GDP or is likely to be on in a vaguely foreseeable future. And if you go with that definition, there's only a clear four there are, Brazil, Russia, India, India, and China.</p><p>To be a \"Next 11\" country, it is literally a phrase that I dreamed up seven years ago as a result of people saying, well, why just those four? Why not Indonesia? Why not Mexico? Why not Turkey? Why not South Africa? Et cetera et cetera. And it's a phrase to describe the next 11 largest population countries from the emerging world.</p><p>NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: If the N-11 is such a fluid --</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes.</p><p>ELBAGIR: -- concept, why do you think there has been so much controversy over South Africa jumping over the N-11 to be part of the BRICS club.</p><p>O'NEILL: South Africa's so unique and, in this context, quite odd. Because South Africa has some aspects of development, particularly financial markets, some aspects of the better standards of Western practices in terms of regulatory matters and Western law. And with that, there has been historic trade organizations that South Africa's linked to, particularly with Brazil and India.</p><p>And so, with the whole growth of the BRIC idea, particularly when it became a BRIC political club, for South Africa to be not part of it is obviously something that South African leaders feel a little bit, \"What's going on here?\"</p><p>Beyond that, I'm not sure why South Africa's managed to leap above it. Because if you look at the criteria I said earlier about what's a BRIC and what's a Next 11, South Africa doesn't even come close to -- certainly, not a BRIC. South African economy at, what? $350 billion is half the sum of global GDP.</p><p>So, it's nowhere near constituting a BRIC, and without staggering productivity improvements and major immigration or improvements in birthrates, et cetera, et cetera, it's never going to get there.</p><p>South Africa's really stimulated my mind to explore this further, because there are some others, like Poland, Saudi Arabia, who have more reason to be irked about these things, perhaps, than just South Africa. Because, of course, when you look at the Next 11 definition, South Africa doesn't actually have that many people, either. And in the context of the continent, Nigeria is the place that really matters.</p><p>ELBAGIR: I was going to say, do you think they've missed the trick by taking in South Africa rather than Nigeria?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think it's been, because the South African leaders and leading intellects have been so persistent about it and maybe the Chinese and Indians and others thought, \"You know what? OK, guys. If it shuts you up, come in.\"</p><p>But there is another angle to it, of course, that I'm sure South Africa has perhaps played on the notion that because they do have developed markets and western government standards in some areas, they've said, \"Look, we're the gateway to the rest of Africa,\" and that's certainly an argument with some legitimacy.</p><p>ELBAGIR: What would you advice -- if you were advising the South African government, what should they do to earn their place at the BRIC table?</p><p>O'NEILL: That South African --</p><p>ELBAGIR: The South African government. Or do you think it's a -- anyhow, it's a lost cause?</p><p>O'NEILL: No, I don't. No, nowhere is a lost cause. I think South African leaders have to be bolder about the basics and not be so worried about what club they're in or not. They've got acceptance, they're in the G-20, they've been invited to the big political meeters -- leaders' meeting, and they're there.</p><p>What they've now got to do is, as with the World Cup, turn an event into some lasting improvement. Stop thinking that because of Apartheid and other tragic historical things, stop thinking that world owes South Africa something for its past, and do things to create a better environment where you can attract a lot more international business.</p><p>And most importantly, embrace all your own people in a competitive, open way and find everybody jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW: Is South Africa qualified to be a member of BRIC? Tell us what you think. We're having a discussion on our Facebook page. But for now, let's just take a look at what's trending this week.</p><p>Foreign mining firms in Zimbabwe are scrambling following President Robert Mugabe's demand that they must sell a majority stake to local black Zimbabweans within six months. Shares at major mining companies dropped sharply upon the news.</p><p>The regulation follows an indigenization act signed into law three years ago, which aims to make foreign companies junior partners in Zimbabwe.</p><p>And Kumba Iron Ore is proposing a $7 billion steel plant in South Africa to help reduce unemployment.</p><p>President Jacob Zuma has asked businesses to help create 5 million jobs in the coming decade. The proposed plant would create 3,000 jobs and export up to five billion tons of steel each year to buyers in Asia.</p><p>So, if you have any ideas on who we should interview or what stories we should be doing, please do connect with us. We're on Facebook, we're on Twitter, and you can e-mail us. We'd love to hear what you have to say.</p><p>But until next week, for me, Robyn Curnow, here in Johannesburg, good- bye.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2011 Cable News Network, Inc.

Sorry clear evidence of real damage now  at Japan's economy. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  It is a Friday.  We're together.  I'm Richard Quest and I mean  business. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Good evening. </p><p>  April the 1st, and the start of a new quarter, and of course, April  Fool's Day.  The international festival of pranks.  I can hear you already  asking, will they, or won't they?  Well, we may.  Or we may not.  And the  only way you will find out is if you keep watching.  </p><p>  And you'll want to keep watching because we lead off tonight with  America, the land of opportunity, potentially again; hundreds of thousands  are heading back to work.  The U.S. economy gained more than 200,000 jobs  last month and it sealed a solid 6 months of growth rates in the States.  </p><p>  Look at the way they have rose.  It was a bit of a blip in January  after some winter weather.  But that growth, the trend seems to be heading  firmly up.  The unemployment rate in the U.S. now stands at 8.8 percent.   Still high by the standards of developed countries and certainly by the  United States, but that is the best number that has been seen in two years.   And most of the growth now starting to come from the private sector, which  added 230,000 jobs.  The public sector battling against these cuts, of  course, with the cuts, cut 14,000 and recovery is most definitely not on  the cards.  Certainly as budget deficits, both local, state, and federal  level, continue; 13.5 million people are still out of work in the United  States.</p><p>  Jeff Joerres is the CEO and chairman of Manpower Group, the new name  for Manpower Inc., one of the world's largest employment agencies.  Jeff is  with me from Milwaukee. </p><p>  Jeff, you just heard me summarize the situation.  Good jobs, good  private sector job growth, a fall in the unemployment, but it is still not  enough.  </p><p>  JEFF JOERRES, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN, MANPOWER GROUP:  Yes, we have to put it  in context, as you said.  This is good news.  Because if you really  simplify things is it getting the same, is it getting worse, or it is  getting better?  And it is getting better.  So this is good news.  The  question is, when do we get to a point where we can actually feel like we  are on the other side and get a breakthrough, which is closer to 300,000,  350,000, when we are really making up ground for the last four years of  losing jobs.  So, good news, just a long way to go yet.  </p><p>  QUEST:  OK, traditionally, at this point in a recovery we should be  seeing much more growth.  You know, what you are seeing are those sectors  where there is demand.  What are they?</p><p>  JOERRES:  Well, we are still seeing demand in manufacturing.  And that  his key, because some of the entry-level and mid-level jobs in  manufacturing pay better, it is great for the economy.  But what we are  also still seeing, across the board, whether it be the additions in health  care, the additions in services, the additions in our industry.  We added  29,000 jobs in our industry.  What we are not seeing yet, is hiring in  anticipation of demand.  Companies are still getting more with less,  driving and stretching out that workforce.  And actually putting a lot of  stress on that workforce right now.  </p><p>  QUEST:  OK, if that is the situation and consumers are tapped out,  they haven't fully deleveraged or they are-there is the prospect of higher  interest rates. Not this year, but certainly they will arrive.  Are we not  just going to have to accept that the days of 4 to 5 percent unemployment  are not going to be with us for many years?</p><p>  JOERRES:  I would agree.  I mean I think it is mathematical.  If you  go to 250,000 jobs, or 300,000, you are still three and a half years away.   You mentioned in your opening, the discouraged worker.  How many turns in  to that category in the next two to three years when they haven't found a  job.  Unemployment now goes for two years in the U.S., antiquating their  skills.  Companies are really in trouble right now being able to find  talent.  There is a mismatch.  So, this \"Human Age\", which you announced  and helped us announce, in the World Economic Forum, is on top of us.  The  conundrums are deeper than ever before. </p><p>  QUEST:  Jeff, many thanks.  Have a good weekend, even with these  numbers. </p><p>  JOERRES:  You too. </p><p>  QUEST:  And we'll talk again.  Many thanks indeed.  Jeff Joerres  joining me from Milwaukee.  </p><p>  April the 1st, and the start of that new quarter.  We need to take  stock.  And it is useful to do so by having a look and seeing where global  economies-who gets the gold star.  And what happens and where we go.  This  is the situation that you need to look at so far.  </p><p>  You've got the United States with its jobless level of 8.8, 2.1  inflation, and GDP.  So far, so good.  I suppose you could arguably say  that gets across, that gets an OK.  That's not too bad.  </p><p>  You then end up with Japan.  We have to be a little bit careful with  Japan, because of the tsunami and the earthquake.  But the jobless level is  high by their traditional standards.  And inflation is an OK number.  GDP,  that is going to change. </p><p>  It is the Euro Zone, jobless, a bad number, inflation, a bad number,  the GDP, so-so, not too keen on that.  And one of the reasons for all of  this is the policies being put in place by them. </p><p>  In the United States you have QE, which is nearly a trillion in the  latest rounds, with states like Wisconsin, California, Illinois, making  cuts.  Japan, of course, has a crisis funding bill coming forward, probably  in about April, and in 2010, there will be-there was obviously, 10s of  billions in a stimulus package.  </p><p>  There is only one word of any relevance in the European Euro Zone.   Except for that at the moment, it is, of course, going to be, very much the  case, austerity. </p><p>  Todd Benjamin is here to talk more about the situation and how it  factors in. </p><p>  TODD BENJAMIN, FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see you.  Great to see  you. </p><p>  You know, it is interesting how you are grading all of those, I don't  think I would be quite as generous as you are.  You know, I think there are  shadings and I think it is not as simplistic as you make it out to be. </p><p>  QUEST:  Oh, simplistic?  </p><p>  BENJAMIN:  Yes. </p><p>  (LAUGHTER) </p><p>  QUEST:  Let's talk about those jobless numbers to start with, in the  United States.  </p><p>  BENJAMIN:  Well, I think, you know, as Jeff said, it is great news.   You know, it is the strongest number that we've had for a while.  But still  the long-term unemployed, it is very bad for them.  Wages are stagnant.  It  has been that way four out of five months, which is great from an inflation  standpoint, but not from a purchasing power standpoint.  And the big  question I have is once this QE2, this quantitative easing, ends in June- and it sounds like it will from all the noises most of the Fed members are  making-is will the private sector really pick up the banner and create  enough jobs to keep the economy growing? </p><p>  QUEST:  Not in the short-term, they won't.  </p><p>  BENJAMIN:  Absolutely not.  And so I'm a bid concerned about what  happens, as you know, Jeff was saying, even Dudley, the vice chairman of  the Fed, was talking today.  He said, hey, not so fast.  Not so fast, a lot  of problems still in the economy.  Including this idea, he said, even if  you got 300,000 jobs a month, you would still have plenty of slack in the  labor market by 2012.  So it is going to be a very, very long process. </p><p>  QUEST:  All right.  So, you've got Japan out of the equation for the  short term.  Germany is going quite well. </p><p>  BENJAMIN:  Exactly. </p><p>  QUEST:  But the rest of the Euro Zone isn't. </p><p>  BENJAMIN:  Yes, and I think you make a very important distinction  here.  You know, if you look at Germany it is going well.  But if you look  at other countries, you know, like Italy, like Ireland, like Spain, like  Greece, like Portugal.  </p><p>  QUEST:  Right. </p><p>  BENJAMIN:  Lots and lots of problems.</p><p>  (DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>  QUEST:  You called me simplistic?  Well, you said that my-</p><p>  BENJAMIN:  You are not simplistic.  I just think this is-</p><p>  QUEST:  All right.  The United States, A, B, or C?  </p><p>  BENJAMIN:  I would give it probably a C, minus. </p><p>  QUEST:  A C, minus.  I'm going to be more generous.  I'm going to say  a B, minus. </p><p>  Japan, I think, well, I think it is unfair to give Japan any form of  grading just at the moment.  </p><p>  BENJAMIN:  Absolutely.  </p><p>  QUEST:  It would be a little bit-</p><p>  BENJAMIN:  But it's reconstruction program is going to be about 6  percent of GDP.  So, you could see a V-shaped recovery there. </p><p>  QUEST:  All right.  We'll give it a V-shape, a charitable V-shape.  </p><p>  BENJAMIN:  Yes.</p><p>  QUEST:  The Euro Zone, I mean?</p><p>  BENJAMIN:  Let's strip out Germany.</p><p>  QUEST:  Yes?</p><p>  BENJAMIN:  And you get a D, minus, or F. </p><p>  QUEST:  We both agree on that.  Todd Benjamin, many thanks indeed for  joining us and putting us into that form of perspective. </p><p>  BENJAMIN:  You bet. </p><p>  QUEST:  Now, we need to look and see how the markets are trading at  the moment.  The Big Board is open in New York, up 87 points, at 12,407.   We are heading to the New York Stock Exchange later in the program to find  out why its parent company is the center of a bidding war. </p><p>  Stock in Europe kicked off the second quarter with a strong session.   Banking and energy shares top performers.  Lloyds was up 5 percent in  London.  BP up 3.5 percent.  These are the movements of the indices over  the course of a week.  Investors reacting to British/Irish-to Irish banks'  stress tests.  </p><p>  When we come back in just a moment there will be more to talk about on  the economic front and we'll be in Japan to show how the country's economic  fate is now fairing, following the earthquake.  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, good  evening. </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  QUEST:  Tangible evidence is now starting to arrive of the financial  damage being caused in Japan and the wider Asia region, by last month's  earthquake and tsunami.  </p><p>  Now, manufacturing activity in March, it has fallen sharply, it is at  its lowest point in two years.  This is not surprising.  The PMI down at  46.4.  Remember anything under 50 percent shows contraction rather than  expansion.  Clearly recession of some sort on the horizon.  The Japanese is  cutting back and a new study says that China will over take Japan as the  world's second largest tourist market.  This is the Boston consulting group  that say China will be that before the end of the year.  </p><p>  And if you look at trade overall, the ripple effects, if you look at  the numbers that show exactly how much trade is done, intra-Asia, while  countries like Australia and Indonesia are seeing exports to Japan  obviously fall off.  The Australian treasury says it will loose around $2  billion in ex-rev this fiscal year, as demand falls for things like coal  and iron ore.  </p><p>  The ongoing struggle at Japan's crippled nuclear plant, attracted most  of the headlines over the past few weeks.  Now, as Martin Savidge explains,  that is just one of the problems in a country facing economic catastrophe.   </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  In  Japan the first Friday in April is traditionally the first day on the job  for fresh-faced college graduates who generally work for one company their  whole career.  </p><p>  Here the latest class of 7-Eleven employees sing a song of joy.  But  this year across the country the chorus is not nearly so strong.  It is  said to be the smallest class of new hires since mid-`90s.  According to  experts the devastating earthquake and tsunami will only accelerate that  business trend. </p><p>  JASPER KOLL, HEAD OF JAPANESE EQUITY RESEARCH, JP MORGAN:  Those  Japanese companies, moving more aggressively overseas, because that is  where the profit margins are, and that is where the markets are. \\</p><p>  SAVIDGE:  The disaster's economic shock is being felt by land, air and  sea.  Japan's auto sales in March were down 37 percent.  Toyota was hardest  hit.  Its sales were down nearly 50 percent, with 16 of 18 factories  closed.  </p><p>  Since the quake, Japan airlines reports international air travel has  dropped by 25 percent.  Other carriers such as Delta are trimming routes to  and from Japan and using smaller planes.  Japan's seafood industry has had  a double blow.  More than 6,000 fishing boats were damaged or destroyed by  the tsunami, while fear of radiation is cutting into exports and spoiling  appetites in the world's second largest seafood market.  </p><p>  These are truly dark days with two large key power facilities off line  because of tsunami damage, Tokyo Electric Power Company, TEPCO, has lost 20  percent of its production capacity.  Threatening the Tokyo region with  rolling blackouts to save energy, lights, escalators, even mass transit  have been shut down.  </p><p>  (On camera):  6 million people ride the Tokyo subway every single day.   Now those six million will have to fit into 20 percent fewer trains to save  electricity.  </p><p>  (Voice over):  With remarkable speed the disaster is even reshaping  Japanese society.  In light of so much suffering, excess is out, saving is  in, celebration subdued.  The change felt even by the seasons.  As this  sign simply says, the nation's iconic Cherry Blossom Festival has been  cancelled.  Martin Savidge, CNN, Tokyo. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  QUEST:  The situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant remains unstable  and speculation is that the Japanese government plans to intervene, or even  nationalize TEPCO, the Tokyo Electric Power Company.  That speculation  hasn't gone away.  TEPCO shares are down another 3.5 percent on the first  day of the new fiscal year in Japan.  TEPCO is down close to 50 percent  this week alone.  Three-quarters of the value of the company on the  exchanges have evaporated since the start of the crisis.  </p><p>  And no relief for the Nikkei.  It finished the day off down around  half a percent.</p><p>  After the break, to New York, where the world's most famous stock  exchange has become the center of a bidding war itself, in a moment. </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>  QUEST:  The New York Stock Exchange has been the home to many a  bidding war for the companies listed on the exchange.  And now, the  exchange is the victim itself of the bidding war.  NYSEEuronext, its  parent company operating exchanges in New York and Europe, in February the  New York Stock Exchange agreed to be bought by Deutsche Boerse, for $10  billion.  Now it would have created the world's largest exchange.  </p><p>  But this is fascinating.  Now, Nasdaq OMX, and Intercontinental  Exchange, crashed the party.</p><p>  (DESK BELL CHIMES) </p><p>  Launched and $11.3-billion bid.  Good grief!  The big board is now a  big bid.  Alison Kosik is in New York.  </p><p>  Alison, we thought, come on, be honest, we thought that Deutsche  Boerse deal was done dusted and all we had to do was lick the envelope. </p><p>  ALISON KOSIK, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, but you know what?   Nothing like a really good bidding war to get Wall Street in a flutter,  right?  You know?  I mean, I was talking to some traders about this and,  you know, just like with anything they are pros and cons.  They say a big  positive is what you are seeing right now.  NYSE shares are up almost 13  percent.  This is a great move for shareholders, because the offer comes  with a 19 percent premium.  And the NYSE could also keep its domestic  ownership.  </p><p>  And then, of course, there are the negatives.  You know, the Deutsche  Boerse deal would be better.  I'm talking about the negatives, for the  Nasdaq.  The Deutsche Boerse deal, traders say, would be better because it  is a worldwide platform.  And it is better for the NYSE in the long run.  </p><p>  Now, we spoke with Duncan Niederauer, the head of the NYSE, back in  February, when the Deutsche Boerse was announced at the NYSE.  He  definitely echoed that sentiment.  Take a listen. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, NYSE:  The fact of the matter is the equity, the  U.S. equity business for our company the way it is currently constructed,  is not the majority of the business anymore.  It was our view several years  ago that with a lot of the competition in the business here, we could not  rely on U.S. equities as our single source of profitability over the long  run.  We also appreciate that the markets are global.  The capital markets  are worldwide.  And I think our view is we have got to continue to be  invested in those markets and services across the value chain.  </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  KOSIK:  And of course it is all about the money making derivatives.   That is really where it is at these days, you know, and the fact is many  people really don't mind the exchange, Richard, being controlled by an  overseas company like Deutsche Boerse, especially since NYSE merged with  Euronext a while back, right?</p><p>  QUEST:  OK, let's put aside who owns what in terms of overseas, and  the xenophobic argument that will be brought forward about foreigners  ramping up the ramparts of Wall Street.  But the fact is Nasdaq is, if you  like, the bogie man rival to the Big Board, ever since it started.  And it  is, you know, scooped up all the big tech stocks. </p><p>  KOSIK:  And you are right.  I mean, there is this-you know this-there  has been this ongoing rivalry between the Nasdaq and the NYSE.  You know  each one, the same customer.  They all want the same market share.  I mean,  we saw the tit for tat going on when we saw the flash crash back on May 6  of last year.  You know they were finger pointing, all right, who is  responsible for the glitch?  Yes, there is no love lost between the two  exchanges.  </p><p>  QUEST:  All right.  </p><p>  KOSIK:  I can't imagine Duncan Niederauer sitting down with Bob  Greifeld for tea at this point, Richard. </p><p>  QUEST:  OK.  I don't know if you are a betting woman or not, but on  this Friday, if ever you had to have a dollar on who is going to win, would  it be the Nasdaq or the Deutsche Boerse?</p><p>  KOSIK:  I put my money on Deutsche Boerse, definitely.  Yes. </p><p>  QUEST:  All right.  </p><p>  KOSIK:  But it has to go through the regulatory process.  But that is  who I'm putting money on.  </p><p>  QUEST:  Oh, oh, that is the boilerplate caveat that she' putting in at  the end just to make sure.  That is the disclaimer.  </p><p>  All right.  Many thanks, Alison.  Have a great weekend. </p><p>  KOSIK:  Thank you. </p><p>  QUEST:  Many thanks.  Don't forget, what we say means absolutely  nothing.  Because it all depends on what the shareholders in those  companies actually believe.  But I think probably Alison is well and truly  on the money.  </p><p>  One U.S. stock, Morgan Stanley has tipped for big growth this year, is  Honeywell.  CNN's Maggie Lake met the conglomerate's chief executive to  find out why and bring us a closer look at this key company. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MAGGIE LAKE, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  They have  aerospace contracts around the world, but also make everything from home  security alarms to energy efficient car products, and safety gloves.  In  short, a classic conglomerate, over a century old, with annual sales of $33  billion.  </p><p>Morgan Stanley recently tipped Honeywell shares, which are currently  at their highest level since the financial crisis.  We met CEO David Cote  at the firm's campus in New Jersey. </p><p>  (on camera):   With such uncertain times, such turmoil around the  world, what is it that makes you so bullish about Honeywell's outlook?</p><p>  DAVID COTE, CEO, HONEYWELL:  I don't think there is as much  uncertainty as a lot of people might suspect.  I do believe as about nine,  10 months ago, the recovery started to become for real.  And we started  being a net revenue (ph) ourselves, at that time.  And we saw orders  continue to do well during that time.  And I really think we're on the path  to a global recovery right now, that could go on for four or five years,  who knows?  </p><p>  But I do think that that the path that we're on.  We're just very  pleased with the positions that we have, because we pay a lot of attention  to try be in the middle of macro trends that just are going to last for a  long time.  Whether it is energy efficiency, clean energy generation,  safety and security, those are the sort of things that are going to last  for a long time.  We are well positioned within that.  And that great  positions in some good industries really puts you in the right places.  </p><p>  LAKE:   You get 50 percent of your growth, globally.  </p><p>  COTE:  Hmmm.</p><p>  LAKE:  Are those growth rates sustainable?</p><p>  COTE:  There are things that have to be managed as you go along.  I  would say the China track record has been very good at being able to figure  out how you do this.  Because it is not-an economy is not a static thing.   In fact, one of the things you want to maintain is the dynamism in an  economy.  </p><p>  China, so far, has made all the right calls.  For 30 years they have  been making the right decisions and proceeding inexorably to greater and  greater growth for their people.  India will have to make those same kind  of decisions, because it didn't quite start so soon for them.  There is  more learning that needs to go on.  As even the Indians would admit the  bureaucracy is astounding. </p><p>  LAKE (voice over):  Last year China awarded Honeywell and $11 billion  contract to make landing equipment for its new plane maker, Comac.  Some  firms have complained over a lack of openness in China, but it remains a  key market for Honeywell.  </p><p>  COTE:  The growing pains are tough for both, partners, right?  And  that is one of the things that has to get sorted through.  It doesn't mean  that we shouldn't complain about the things that do need to change.  And we  should.  By the same token, we shouldn't view them as evil, or bad, or out  to destroy us.  Because at the end of the day, as you know, economics is  not a zero-sum game; both sides benefit from the transaction or you  wouldn't do it.  </p><p>  LAKE:   You are growing and on an aggressive acquisition trial.  Why  does that work for Honeywell, when it didn't seem to work out for so many  others?</p><p>  COTE:  First thing that we never allow to happen is exactly what you  talked about.  Is there is the zeal for the deal, as I call it.  Where you  just get so-this is going to be great.  You all start believing your own  stories.  This is going to be terrific.  And you actually start ignoring  some of the stuff you find in due diligence.  And you need to have the  discipline that says even when you get to the final negotiating table you  can still walk away.  You can't fall so in live with anything that you'll  do it regardless, because everything is going to be great. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  QUEST:  Now that is advice from the top; zeal for the deal, from the  CEO of Honeywell. </p><p>  On Monday, on this program, we turn our focus to the supply chain as  we examine how products that we use everyday might be linked to modern-day  slavery.  Part of our year-long freedom project, it is a week of coverage  that could be here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, as we turn the spotlight on the  business side of human trafficking. </p><p>  (DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>  QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  This is CNN  and on this network it is the news that always comes first.  </p><p>  (NEWSBREAK) </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>  QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, this is CNN  and, on this network, it's the news that always comes first.  </p><p>  Violence in northern Afghanistan after a demonstration turns deadly.   Police in Mazar-i-Sharif say at least a dozen people, including eight UN  workers, were killed when a UN operation center was attacked after this  protest.  The demonstration was against the reported burning of a Koran  earlier this month by a pastor in Florida.</p><p>  To the Ivory Coast, where forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara are closer  to taking over the commercial capital of Abidjan.  They've taken control of  the state-run television and attacked the residents of the self-declared  president Laurent Gbagbo.  France, the US, and the African Union are now  calling on Gbagbo to hand over power.</p><p>Libya's opposition says rebels have launched a new offensive near Al- Brega against forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi.  Meanwhile, both sides are  proposing ways to end the civil war off the battlefield, but the conditions  they're setting are very different.</p><p>  The financial fallout from the Japanese disaster, far and wide, as  you've heard on this program.  Now, for Japan, tourism accounts for just  two percent of the economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism  Council.</p><p>  Scott Durchslag is the president of Expedia Worldwide, and yesterday  he joined me and told me what travel trends Expedia is seeing in the region  and has been seeing since March the 11th.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  SCOTT DURCHSLAG, PRESIDENT, EXPEDIA WORLDWIDE:  Well, it's  interesting.  We're seeing, lately, there has been some decline in demand,  as you'd expect, given the seriousness of what's happening there.  </p><p>  But in the first days, it was much more mixed, because you had an  explosion of outbound travel, obviously, happening.  And a lot of domestic  hotel bookings happening.  So, it's still very early days, in terms of the  long-term impact on this, but at the moment we are seeing some decline in  the demand.</p><p>  QUEST:  You see, the thing is, Japan is actually quite an important  part for Expedia, isn't it?  And you were looking at Japan as being a major  source in revenue in the future.</p><p>  DURCHSLAG:  Yes, Japan is, for us, a pretty high-growth market, and  it's part of our broader Asia investment profile, which is a market that's  been growing 54 percent in the last two years.</p><p>  QUEST:  Just to explain that, you don't expect that to continue,  surely?</p><p>  DURCHSLAG:  I do expect that to continue, sure.  What's happening in  Japan is one of many events that's been happening in a year that's out of  Revelations.  Floods in Australia, earthquakes, tsunamis, nuclear issues.   It's been a very difficult year.</p><p>  But overall, the intrinsics on Asia are very powerful, $200 billion  travel market that's growing faster than any other market in the world, and  online penetration, which is very important to us, is only 20 percent, less  than half the US or Europe.  So, there's a lot of upside growth in Asia.</p><p>  QUEST:  Which is why, of course, your deal with Tony Fernandes of  AirAsia is particularly relevant, isn't it?  Even though it's been  criticized by the opponents?</p><p>  DURCHSLAG:  Well, sure.  We are really excited about our partnership  with AirAsia, the reason being, it's the first deal ever that brings  together an online travel agency and a low-cost carrier.</p><p>  QUEST:  Now, aren't you in an uncomfortable position?  Because you've  got this deal, but you're still saying you are neutral or, at least, not  biased towards that particular airline.</p><p>  DURCHSLAG:  Well, we're all about bringing the best choices to our  travelers, and having a low-cost carrier on Expedia, in addition to all of  the other 300 airlines that we have, 130,000 hotel rooms, that is only to  the benefit of consumers.</p><p>  QUEST:  You've obviously online, and the penetration online is very  severe and very harsh, the marketplace.  But now, you're moving into social  media, as well.</p><p>  DURCHSLAG:  Yes, we're driving a new strategy called Expedia  Everywhere that's all about mobile.  Because what's more intrinsically  mobile than travel?  And what's more intrinsically social than travel?  One  of the major trends in travel is friends and families going together.</p><p>  So, we've announced just today the largest sweepstakes ever done on  Facebook that's been hosted on Facebook, and we just announced last week a  brand new application called Expedia Hotels,  Mobile and social are the  future of travel.</p><p>  QUEST:  Why?  Why do you want -- I mean, I go online and I book my  ticket.  Why do I need Expedia getting in my Facebook, my Twitter, and all  these other social media areas?</p><p>  DURCHSLAG:  Well, because first of all, we want to be a personalized  travel assistant in your pocket while you're on the fly, if you're late, on  a flight, or you have to rebook or a flight is canceled.  With one click,  you can do that on Expedia.</p><p>  And socially, you want to be able to share your itinerary with your  friends so they can come with you.  Or your pictures afterwards.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  QUEST:  The president of Expedia Worldwide talking to me.  On this  program, of course, we take great importance to the travel and tourism  industry.</p><p>  Now, we've been hearing a lot about how the disaster in Japan has been  affecting the travel industry.  There is, of course, another factor that  affects airline prices, and that is the cost of fuel.  Brent is currently  trading at almost $119 a barrel.  It's gained 25 percent, give or take,  since the start of the year.</p><p>  On this program this week, we've had three airline chief executives,  and here are their thoughts on the sky-high price of oil.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  WILLIE WALSH, CEO, INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP:  I think at $115 a  barrel, it's a challenge.  But I don't think it's going to undermine the  economic recovery that we've seen in most major economies.  </p><p>  I think if oil goes above $150 a barrel, it's something that everybody  will be concerned about, but I'm pleased to say we're not there at this  point.</p><p>  ROB FYFE, CEO, AIR NEW ZEALAND:  I'd actually be happy with fuel at  $150.  I'd be happy with fuel at $200.  We are actually an incredibly  robust airline.  We've got a very strong balance sheet.  There's a lot of  airlines out there that struggle to economically survive.  They get by by  the skin of their teeth.  To be honest, if high fuel started to claim some  of the struggling airlines out of the industry --</p><p>  QUEST:  Oh!  </p><p>  FYFE:  -- it wouldn't concern me at all.</p><p>  QUEST:  Oh!  Oh!  That's a polite -- you just want -- you want  nutcracker the competition!</p><p>  FYFE:  Well, the reality is, the strong should get stronger, and those  that aren't strong enough should, actually, fall by the wayside.</p><p>  JEFF SMISEK, CEO, UNITED AIRLINES:  We need to make money no matter  what the oil prices.  And we need to adjust to that, which means investing  in modern fuel-efficient aircraft, engines, operations.  So, we need to  learn to make money in high oil prices.  And I believe that we're likely to  have oil prices for a -- high oil prices for a long time.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  QUEST:  Jeff Smisk, Rob Fyfe, and Willie Walsh talking to me during  the course of the week.</p><p>  Frequent fliers, business travelers, are horrified when we board a  plane and find children sitting in business class near us.  Well, there are  two sides to this argument, and anyone with a young family will tell you  it's difficult flying with kids.</p><p>  Well, today, we heard of a new airline that's courting a very specific  clientele.  These are flights exclusively for children.</p><p>  The flight-booking site Skyscanner says Urchin Airways will become the  world's first kids-only carrier.  The rules will say no passengers under  (sic) the age of 16 will be allowed onboard.  There will be flight  attendants, and children will be entertained during the flight with  competitions and the cabin crew dressed as clowns.  Urchin will coordinate  with other mainline regular carriers so parents and children can be  reunited at their final destination.  The families we spoke to thought this  was a most exciting prospect.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it's a wonderful idea.  They're going to  have so much fun.  They've talked of little else for days.  I mean, win- win.  I get to drink a glass of wine and they get to play.  It's perfect.   I'll meet them at the other end.  It's wonderful.</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED GIRL:  Well, I can't wait to meet the clowns, because  they're going to be cabin crew.  And I heard there's going to be egg and  spoon games, as well, so that sounds really fun.</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED GIRL:  Also, there's going to be, like, ice cream and we  can eat it for supper, and there's going to be screaming contests and on  one's there to say that we can't scream as much as we like.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  QUEST:  A brilliant idea, just don't book me ever, ever, on Urchin  Airways. </p><p>  That's not the only airline proposal raising eyebrows this Friday.   Everyone, it seems, they're going to ever more weird and wonderful ways to  keep your business.  We'll talk about the airlines after the break.</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>  QUEST:  It has been mild weather and we've had sunny skies.  Western  Europe's had a wonderful week.  Except, of course, if you're heading  towards allergy season, like myself.  And frankly, Pedram, at the World  Weather Center -- I -- I mean, I knew the weather was changing.  The throat  gets tighter, the nose starts running.</p><p>  PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, you don't need a forecast.   When you see the conditions that have been as nice as they have, of course,  they're going to have hard effects, there, on folks that are suffering  allergies.</p><p>  And as Richard said, it's been fairly mild, and the conditions over  the next 24 hours, going to remain mild for at least one more day across  portions of London.  There it is.  That's 17 degrees, your forecast high  temperature.  We'll call it partly to mostly cloudy by the afternoon hours,  perhaps a shower. </p><p>  That's really the good news out of this as it begins to help clean up  the air, the atmosphere that has been a little polluted with the  pollination that's been taking place out there.</p><p>  But as we talked about, what's going on out there, especially across  the United Kingdom?  What's causing all this?  Well, you have to keep in  mind, Richard's not alone with this one.  Some 20 percent of folks across  the United Kingdom are affected by allergies this time of year.</p><p>  Now, you just go back a couple of months, the harsh winter that we  had.  Remember the snow showers, the cold conditions?  That actually helps  promote early pollination as we get these warm spells that we were getting  in the past few days.  So, with the warm temperatures, that's helping  things out.</p><p>  What's the predominate pollen right now for this time of year?   Typically, we talk about birch, ash, elm, and willow, the tree pollens.   That's probably what Richard is feeling, here, the past few days with the  tree pollens being among the high.</p><p>  Now, if you suffer symptoms in June and July, more than likely, that  becomes a grass pollen concern as we head on towards the summer season.</p><p>  But what do you do?  Well, the best thing to do is to avoid the peak  times.  Experts say 7:00 to 10:00 AM, that's one of the times the trees  begin pollinating, and also releasing pollen about 4:00 to 7:00 PM.  So,  early mornings, early afternoons, that's really the concern out there,  being staying indoors.</p><p>  Also, changing your clothes.  Believe it or not, changing your clothes  when you get back inside the house, that could help the concern, as well,  as a lot of the pollen clings on right to your clothing and makes you  sneeze all around the house after you've come indoors.  So, you're  wondering why you're feeling the symptoms when you're inside?  That could  be the reason.  You can change your clothes.</p><p>  But here is a storm system that is entering the picture.  That, again,  will help mix up the atmosphere a little bit as we head on into Saturday,  partly to mostly cloudy skies around London, and Western Europe could get  some showers out of this.  And also across the north, a few showers.</p><p>  So, the temperatures are going to cool down, that'll suppress some of  the pollen levels, there, in the next few days, and the conditions are  going to improve.  But really, the warmest air mass still stays to the  south, here, across portions of southern France into Spain, Portugal  getting well above-average readings, some 10 to 12 degrees above average  over the next couple of days.</p><p>  And if you've got some travel plans out there, looks like travel not  going to be affected by this much, as we're seeing breezy conditions and,  again, a few showers possible.  But all in all, an improving forecast for  Mr. Quest out there, and perhaps some of the folks that are dealing with  the allergies, Richard.</p><p>  QUEST:  We thank you for that.  I'm not sure whether knowing about the  allergies actually makes it any better, but Pedram, we do thank you.  I  think the most extraordinary thing is the way I'm finding them coming on as  I get older.  There must be a moral in there somewhere.  Pedram, have a  good weekend.</p><p>  JAVAHERI:  Yes.</p><p>  QUEST:  Now, finally to you, don't say you weren't warned.  April  Fool's Day on a week when we've spoken to a number of the top airlines.   The entire industry, why oh why is it the airline industry that decided to  get April Fools silly?</p><p>  For example, Virgin Atlantic, they announced that they were growing  fresh herbs and vegetables for upper class passengers in the galley.   Apparently, the galley would be onboard, and they promised fresh mint for  mojitos.</p><p>  That was an April Fool.</p><p>Ryanair had everyone confused.  They said they had child-free flights  from October.  The press release was dated April the 1st, but it was  released, seemingly, yesterday, because I read that story.  So, Ryanair --  I'm not sure who the final fool was, Michael.  Your press release came out  early.  Anyway, we still had that one.</p><p>  And then, finally, yes.  We did it to you.  Urchin Airways, kids only  flights, the opposite of Ryanair, kids only, sorry.  April Fool!</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED GIRL:  You've been April Fooled.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  QUEST:  They were, of course, in on the joke.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in London.  Whatever you're up to  in the weekend ahead, have a good weekend.  Thank you for your time and  attention.  MARKETPLACE AFRICA is next.</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  ROBYN CURNOW, CNN HOST:  You're watching MARKETPLACE AFRICA.  I'm  Robyn Curnow here on the streets of Johannesburg.  We begin this week's  show with a look at a multibillion-dollar industry that is both dangerous  and illegal -- counterfeit drugs.  </p><p>  The World Health Organization estimates that a third of all medicines  in the developing world are fake.  So, how do you choose between what is  real and what isn't?  Lives are lost in that gamble.  But as Christian  Purefoy now reports, mobile technology is helping Africans to make an  educated choice.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  CHRISTIAN PUREFOY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Armed police  cracking down hard on Nigeria's fake drug sellers.  But, say the  authorities, these raids are not enough to stop counterfeit drugs flooding  Nigeria's streets.</p><p>  GARBA MACDONALD, DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR OF ENFORCEMENT, NAFDAC:   Considering the level of poverty, people will want to go for the cheapest.</p><p>  PUREFOY (on camera):  And the big men behind the sale of these drugs?   Do they pose a danger to you and your men?</p><p>  MACDONALD:  Yes, they do.  They are problems because they can  organize, they have the money, they can organize thugs to attack us.  We  cannot deal with this without more policemen.</p><p>  PUREFOY:  So, this is big money.</p><p>  MACDONALD:  Oh, it's big money, yes, sure.  Big money.  </p><p>  PUREFOY (voice-over):  As Femi Sorenmekun, director of a local  diabetes drug company, explains, the major problem is identifying which box  of drugs is real, and which is fake.  Until now, with the introduction of a  small scratch card packaged with all his medications.</p><p>  FEMI SOREMEKUN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BIOCHEM PHARMACEUTICALS:  Then they  scratch it, and upon scratching it, a number is revealed.</p><p>  PUREFOY (on camera):  If we text that now -- ?</p><p>  SOREMEKUN:  Definitely, if you text that now, you're going to --</p><p>  PUREFOY:  What happens?</p><p>  SOREMEKUN:  You're going to get a message telling you --</p><p>  PUREFOY:  Can we try it?</p><p>  SOREMEKUN:  Yes, you can.</p><p>  PUREFOY:  There you go.  So, that's almost immediate.</p><p>  SOREMEKUN:  Yes.  Almost immediate.</p><p>  PUREFOY:  But when someone receives this text, it says \"OK,\" they know  that drug is original.</p><p>  SOREMEKUN:  Is original.</p><p>  PUREFOY:  Has it worked?  Has it helped your business?  Has it helped  the sales?</p><p>  SOREMEKUN:  Yes, it has.  We've been able to capture most of our  market share back.  Because we can't eliminate fake 100 percent.  But what  we've lost, we've captured it back, and we can see some growth, now, in the  business.</p><p>  PUREFOY (voice-over):  The idea is borrowed from the scratch cards  sold on street corners across Africa use to top up mobile phones with  credit.</p><p>  Applying this scratch card innovation to the drug market is the idea  of Ashifi Gogo.</p><p>  ASHIFI GOGO, CEO, SPROXIL, INC.:  The good thing is the consumer is  not paying.  The government is not paying, as well.  And it's the pharm  companies that are paying Sproxil for the service.  The rationale being  they can recoup market share that's been lost to counterfeiters.</p><p>  So, in some sense, the counterfeiters are paying for the service,  which puts a smile on lots of people's faces, I guess, except for the  counterfeiters.</p><p>  PUREFOY (voice-over):  A simple tool that investigators hope will make  raids like this one less necessary.  Christian Purefoy, CNN, Lagos,  Nigeria.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  CURNOW:  So, anti-malarial drugs are the most commonly counterfeited  medication here in Africa.  The United Nations estimates that in some parts  of the continent, between 50 to 60 percent of all anti-insective drugs  don't have acceptable levels of their active ingredients.</p><p>  And more disturbingly, a World Health Organization Study found that  Ghana was the worst affected, 67 percent of their most common anti-malarial  drugs were found to have failed potency tests.</p><p>  Now, up next, he coined the phrase \"BRIC\" to describe the top  emerging-market economies.  But what does he have to say about South  Africa's entry into that elite club?  Up next on MARKETPLACE AFRICA, we  interview leading economist Jim O'Neill.</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  CURNOW:  Welcome back to MARKETPLACE AFRICA.  They're known as the  fastest-growing emerging markets, Brazil, Russia, India, and China.   Together, they're known as BRIC, an acronym coined by our next guest on  Face Time, Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs.  </p><p>  In the next few weeks, South Africa joins the BRIC summit in Beijing,  hoping its inclusion will raise its status and prestige on the world stage.   But Jim O'Neill now weighs in on whether he thinks South Africa really  deserves a seat at that table.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JIM O'NEILL, CHAIRMAN, GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT:  To be a BRIC,  it has to be an economy that is really at the core, today, or likely to be  in the future, of the world economy.  So, it has to be big enough to be  economically impactful on everybody else.</p><p>  And so, against that general background, an economy that is already  three to five percent of global GDP or is likely to be on in a vaguely  foreseeable future.  And if you go with that definition, there's only a  clear four there are, Brazil, Russia, India, India, and China.  </p><p>  To be a \"Next 11\" country, it is literally a phrase that I dreamed up  seven years ago as a result of people saying, well, why just those four?   Why not Indonesia?  Why not Mexico?  Why not Turkey?  Why not South Africa?   Et cetera et cetera.  And it's a phrase to describe the next 11 largest  population countries from the emerging world.</p><p>  NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  If the N-11 is such a fluid --</p><p>  O'NEILL:  Yes.</p><p>  ELBAGIR:  -- concept, why do you think there has been so much  controversy over South Africa jumping over the N-11 to be part of the BRICS  club.</p><p>  O'NEILL:  South Africa's so unique and, in this context, quite odd.   Because South Africa has some aspects of development, particularly  financial markets, some aspects of the better standards of Western  practices in terms of regulatory matters and Western law.  And with that,  there has been historic trade organizations that South Africa's linked to,  particularly with Brazil and India. </p><p>  And so, with the whole growth of the BRIC idea, particularly when it  became a BRIC political club, for South Africa to be not part of it is  obviously something that South African leaders feel a little bit, \"What's  going on here?\"</p><p>  Beyond that, I'm not sure why South Africa's managed to leap above it.   Because if you look at the criteria I said earlier about what's a BRIC and  what's a Next 11, South Africa doesn't even come close to -- certainly, not  a BRIC.  South African economy at, what?  $350 billion is half the sum of  global GDP.  </p><p>  So, it's nowhere near constituting a BRIC, and without staggering  productivity improvements and major immigration or improvements in  birthrates, et cetera, et cetera, it's never going to get there.  </p><p>  South Africa's really stimulated my mind to explore this further,  because there are some others, like Poland, Saudi Arabia, who have more  reason to be irked about these things, perhaps, than just South Africa.   Because, of course, when you look at the Next 11 definition, South Africa  doesn't actually have that many people, either.  And in the context of the  continent, Nigeria is the place that really matters.</p><p>  ELBAGIR:  I was going to say, do you think they've missed the trick by  taking in South Africa rather than Nigeria?</p><p>  O'NEILL:  I think it's been, because the South African leaders and  leading intellects have been so persistent about it and maybe the Chinese  and Indians and others thought, \"You know what?  OK, guys.  If it shuts you  up, come in.\"</p><p>  But there is another angle to it, of course, that I'm sure South  Africa has perhaps played on the notion that because they do have developed  markets and western government standards in some areas, they've said,  \"Look, we're the gateway to the rest of Africa,\" and that's certainly an  argument with some legitimacy.</p><p>  ELBAGIR:  What would you advice -- if you were advising the South  African government, what should they do to earn their place at the BRIC  table?</p><p>  O'NEILL:  That South African --</p><p>  ELBAGIR:  The South African government.  Or do you think it's a --  anyhow, it's a lost cause?</p><p>  O'NEILL:  No, I don't.  No, nowhere is a lost cause.  I think South  African leaders have to be bolder about the basics and not be so worried  about what club they're in or not.  They've got acceptance, they're in the  G-20, they've been invited to the big political meeters -- leaders'  meeting, and they're there.  </p><p>  What they've now got to do is, as with the World Cup, turn an event  into some lasting improvement.  Stop thinking that because of Apartheid and  other tragic historical things, stop thinking that world owes South Africa  something for its past, and do things to create a better environment where  you can attract a lot more international business.</p><p>  And most importantly, embrace all your own people in a competitive,  open way and find everybody jobs.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  CURNOW:  Is South Africa qualified to be a member of BRIC?  Tell us  what you think.  We're having a discussion on our Facebook page.  But for  now, let's just take a look at what's trending this week.</p><p>  Foreign mining firms in Zimbabwe are scrambling following President  Robert Mugabe's demand that they must sell a majority stake to local black  Zimbabweans within six months.  Shares at major mining companies dropped  sharply upon the news.</p><p>  The regulation follows an indigenization act signed into law three  years ago, which aims to make foreign companies junior partners in  Zimbabwe.</p><p>  And Kumba Iron Ore is proposing a $7 billion steel plant in South  Africa to help reduce unemployment.  </p><p>  President Jacob Zuma has asked businesses to help create 5 million  jobs in the coming decade.  The proposed plant would create 3,000 jobs and  export up to five billion tons of steel each year to buyers in Asia.</p><p>  So, if you have any ideas on who we should interview or what stories  we should be doing, please do connect with us.

Sorry clear evidence of real damage now  at Japan's economy. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a Friday.  We're together.  I'm Richard Quest and I mean  business. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening. </p><p>April the 1st, and the start of a new quarter, and of course, April  Fool's Day.  The international festival of pranks.  I can hear you already  asking, will they, or won't they?  Well, we may.  Or we may not.  And the  only way you will find out is if you keep watching.  </p><p>And you'll want to keep watching because we lead off tonight with  America, the land of opportunity, potentially again; hundreds of thousands  are heading back to work.  The U.S. economy gained more than 200,000 jobs  last month and it sealed a solid 6 months of growth rates in the States.  </p><p>Look at the way they have rose.  It was a bit of a blip in January  after some winter weather.  But that growth, the trend seems to be heading  firmly up.  The unemployment rate in the U.S. now stands at 8.8 percent.   Still high by the standards of developed countries and certainly by the  United States, but that is the best number that has been seen in two years.   And most of the growth now starting to come from the private sector, which  added 230,000 jobs.  The public sector battling against these cuts, of  course, with the cuts, cut 14,000 and recovery is most definitely not on  the cards.  Certainly as budget deficits, both local, state, and federal  level, continue; 13.5 million people are still out of work in the United  States.</p><p>Jeff Joerres is the CEO and chairman of Manpower Group, the new name  for Manpower Inc., one of the world's largest employment agencies.  Jeff is  with me from Milwaukee. </p><p>Jeff, you just heard me summarize the situation.  Good jobs, good  private sector job growth, a fall in the unemployment, but it is still not  enough.  </p><p>JEFF JOERRES, CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN, MANPOWER GROUP:  Yes, we have to put it  in context, as you said.  This is good news.  Because if you really  simplify things is it getting the same, is it getting worse, or it is  getting better?  And it is getting better.  So this is good news.  The  question is, when do we get to a point where we can actually feel like we  are on the other side and get a breakthrough, which is closer to 300,000,  350,000, when we are really making up ground for the last four years of  losing jobs.  So, good news, just a long way to go yet.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK, traditionally, at this point in a recovery we should be  seeing much more growth.  You know, what you are seeing are those sectors  where there is demand.  What are they?</p><p>JOERRES:  Well, we are still seeing demand in manufacturing.  And that  his key, because some of the entry-level and mid-level jobs in  manufacturing pay better, it is great for the economy.  But what we are  also still seeing, across the board, whether it be the additions in health  care, the additions in services, the additions in our industry.  We added  29,000 jobs in our industry.  What we are not seeing yet, is hiring in  anticipation of demand.  Companies are still getting more with less,  driving and stretching out that workforce.  And actually putting a lot of  stress on that workforce right now.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK, if that is the situation and consumers are tapped out,  they haven't fully deleveraged or they are-there is the prospect of higher  interest rates. Not this year, but certainly they will arrive.  Are we not  just going to have to accept that the days of 4 to 5 percent unemployment  are not going to be with us for many years?</p><p>JOERRES:  I would agree.  I mean I think it is mathematical.  If you  go to 250,000 jobs, or 300,000, you are still three and a half years away.   You mentioned in your opening, the discouraged worker.  How many turns in  to that category in the next two to three years when they haven't found a  job.  Unemployment now goes for two years in the U.S., antiquating their  skills.  Companies are really in trouble right now being able to find  talent.  There is a mismatch.  So, this \"Human Age\", which you announced  and helped us announce, in the World Economic Forum, is on top of us.  The  conundrums are deeper than ever before. </p><p>QUEST:  Jeff, many thanks.  Have a good weekend, even with these  numbers. </p><p>JOERRES:  You too. </p><p>QUEST:  And we'll talk again.  Many thanks indeed.  Jeff Joerres  joining me from Milwaukee.  </p><p>April the 1st, and the start of that new quarter.  We need to take  stock.  And it is useful to do so by having a look and seeing where global  economies-who gets the gold star.  And what happens and where we go.  This  is the situation that you need to look at so far.  </p><p>You've got the United States with its jobless level of 8.8, 2.1  inflation, and GDP.  So far, so good.  I suppose you could arguably say  that gets across, that gets an OK.  That's not too bad.  </p><p>You then end up with Japan.  We have to be a little bit careful with  Japan, because of the tsunami and the earthquake.  But the jobless level is  high by their traditional standards.  And inflation is an OK number.  GDP,  that is going to change. </p><p>It is the Euro Zone, jobless, a bad number, inflation, a bad number,  the GDP, so-so, not too keen on that.  And one of the reasons for all of  this is the policies being put in place by them. </p><p>In the United States you have QE, which is nearly a trillion in the  latest rounds, with states like Wisconsin, California, Illinois, making  cuts.  Japan, of course, has a crisis funding bill coming forward, probably  in about April, and in 2010, there will be-there was obviously, 10s of  billions in a stimulus package.  </p><p>There is only one word of any relevance in the European Euro Zone.   Except for that at the moment, it is, of course, going to be, very much the  case, austerity. </p><p>Todd Benjamin is here to talk more about the situation and how it  factors in. </p><p>TODD BENJAMIN, FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see you.  Great to see  you. </p><p>You know, it is interesting how you are grading all of those, I don't  think I would be quite as generous as you are.  You know, I think there are  shadings and I think it is not as simplistic as you make it out to be. </p><p>QUEST:  Oh, simplistic?  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Yes. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>QUEST:  Let's talk about those jobless numbers to start with, in the  United States.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Well, I think, you know, as Jeff said, it is great news.   You know, it is the strongest number that we've had for a while.  But still  the long-term unemployed, it is very bad for them.  Wages are stagnant.  It  has been that way four out of five months, which is great from an inflation  standpoint, but not from a purchasing power standpoint.  And the big  question I have is once this QE2, this quantitative easing, ends in June- and it sounds like it will from all the noises most of the Fed members are  making-is will the private sector really pick up the banner and create  enough jobs to keep the economy growing? </p><p>QUEST:  Not in the short-term, they won't.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Absolutely not.  And so I'm a bid concerned about what  happens, as you know, Jeff was saying, even Dudley, the vice chairman of  the Fed, was talking today.  He said, hey, not so fast.  Not so fast, a lot  of problems still in the economy.  Including this idea, he said, even if  you got 300,000 jobs a month, you would still have plenty of slack in the  labor market by 2012.  So it is going to be a very, very long process. </p><p>QUEST:  All right.  So, you've got Japan out of the equation for the  short term.  Germany is going quite well. </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Exactly. </p><p>QUEST:  But the rest of the Euro Zone isn't. </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Yes, and I think you make a very important distinction  here.  You know, if you look at Germany it is going well.  But if you look  at other countries, you know, like Italy, like Ireland, like Spain, like  Greece, like Portugal.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right. </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Lots and lots of problems.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES)</p><p>QUEST:  You called me simplistic?  Well, you said that my-</p><p>BENJAMIN:  You are not simplistic.  I just think this is-</p><p>QUEST:  All right.  The United States, A, B, or C?  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  I would give it probably a C, minus. </p><p>QUEST:  A C, minus.  I'm going to be more generous.  I'm going to say  a B, minus. </p><p>Japan, I think, well, I think it is unfair to give Japan any form of  grading just at the moment.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Absolutely.  </p><p>QUEST:  It would be a little bit-</p><p>BENJAMIN:  But it's reconstruction program is going to be about 6  percent of GDP.  So, you could see a V-shaped recovery there. </p><p>QUEST:  All right.  We'll give it a V-shape, a charitable V-shape.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Yes.</p><p>QUEST:  The Euro Zone, I mean?</p><p>BENJAMIN:  Let's strip out Germany.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes?</p><p>BENJAMIN:  And you get a D, minus, or F. </p><p>QUEST:  We both agree on that.  Todd Benjamin, many thanks indeed for  joining us and putting us into that form of perspective. </p><p>BENJAMIN:  You bet. </p><p>QUEST:  Now, we need to look and see how the markets are trading at  the moment.  The Big Board is open in New York, up 87 points, at 12,407.   We are heading to the New York Stock Exchange later in the program to find  out why its parent company is the center of a bidding war. </p><p>Stock in Europe kicked off the second quarter with a strong session.   Banking and energy shares top performers.  Lloyds was up 5 percent in  London.  BP up 3.5 percent.  These are the movements of the indices over  the course of a week.  Investors reacting to British/Irish-to Irish banks'  stress tests.  </p><p>When we come back in just a moment there will be more to talk about on  the economic front and we'll be in Japan to show how the country's economic  fate is now fairing, following the earthquake.  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, good  evening. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tangible evidence is now starting to arrive of the financial  damage being caused in Japan and the wider Asia region, by last month's  earthquake and tsunami.  </p><p>Now, manufacturing activity in March, it has fallen sharply, it is at  its lowest point in two years.  This is not surprising.  The PMI down at  46.4.  Remember anything under 50 percent shows contraction rather than  expansion.  Clearly recession of some sort on the horizon.  The Japanese is  cutting back and a new study says that China will over take Japan as the  world's second largest tourist market.  This is the Boston consulting group  that say China will be that before the end of the year.  </p><p>And if you look at trade overall, the ripple effects, if you look at  the numbers that show exactly how much trade is done, intra-Asia, while  countries like Australia and Indonesia are seeing exports to Japan  obviously fall off.  The Australian treasury says it will loose around $2  billion in ex-rev this fiscal year, as demand falls for things like coal  and iron ore.  </p><p>The ongoing struggle at Japan's crippled nuclear plant, attracted most  of the headlines over the past few weeks.  Now, as Martin Savidge explains,  that is just one of the problems in a country facing economic catastrophe.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  In  Japan the first Friday in April is traditionally the first day on the job  for fresh-faced college graduates who generally work for one company their  whole career.  </p><p>Here the latest class of 7-Eleven employees sing a song of joy.  But  this year across the country the chorus is not nearly so strong.  It is  said to be the smallest class of new hires since mid-`90s.  According to  experts the devastating earthquake and tsunami will only accelerate that  business trend. </p><p>JASPER KOLL, HEAD OF JAPANESE EQUITY RESEARCH, JP MORGAN:  Those  Japanese companies, moving more aggressively overseas, because that is  where the profit margins are, and that is where the markets are. \\</p><p>SAVIDGE:  The disaster's economic shock is being felt by land, air and  sea.  Japan's auto sales in March were down 37 percent.  Toyota was hardest  hit.  Its sales were down nearly 50 percent, with 16 of 18 factories  closed.  </p><p>Since the quake, Japan airlines reports international air travel has  dropped by 25 percent.  Other carriers such as Delta are trimming routes to  and from Japan and using smaller planes.  Japan's seafood industry has had  a double blow.  More than 6,000 fishing boats were damaged or destroyed by  the tsunami, while fear of radiation is cutting into exports and spoiling  appetites in the world's second largest seafood market.  </p><p>These are truly dark days with two large key power facilities off line  because of tsunami damage, Tokyo Electric Power Company, TEPCO, has lost 20  percent of its production capacity.  Threatening the Tokyo region with  rolling blackouts to save energy, lights, escalators, even mass transit  have been shut down.  </p><p>(On camera):  6 million people ride the Tokyo subway every single day.   Now those six million will have to fit into 20 percent fewer trains to save  electricity.  </p><p>(Voice over):  With remarkable speed the disaster is even reshaping  Japanese society.  In light of so much suffering, excess is out, saving is  in, celebration subdued.  The change felt even by the seasons.  As this  sign simply says, the nation's iconic Cherry Blossom Festival has been  cancelled.  Martin Savidge, CNN, Tokyo. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  The situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant remains unstable  and speculation is that the Japanese government plans to intervene, or even  nationalize TEPCO, the Tokyo Electric Power Company.  That speculation  hasn't gone away.  TEPCO shares are down another 3.5 percent on the first  day of the new fiscal year in Japan.  TEPCO is down close to 50 percent  this week alone.  Three-quarters of the value of the company on the  exchanges have evaporated since the start of the crisis.  </p><p>And no relief for the Nikkei.  It finished the day off down around  half a percent.</p><p>After the break, to New York, where the world's most famous stock  exchange has become the center of a bidding war itself, in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  The New York Stock Exchange has been the home to many a  bidding war for the companies listed on the exchange.  And now, the  exchange is the victim itself of the bidding war.  NYSEEuronext, its  parent company operating exchanges in New York and Europe, in February the  New York Stock Exchange agreed to be bought by Deutsche Boerse, for $10  billion.  Now it would have created the world's largest exchange.  </p><p>But this is fascinating.  Now, Nasdaq OMX, and Intercontinental  Exchange, crashed the party.</p><p>(DESK BELL CHIMES) </p><p>Launched and $11.3-billion bid.  Good grief!  The big board is now a  big bid.  Alison Kosik is in New York.  </p><p>Alison, we thought, come on, be honest, we thought that Deutsche  Boerse deal was done dusted and all we had to do was lick the envelope. </p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, but you know what?   Nothing like a really good bidding war to get Wall Street in a flutter,  right?  You know?  I mean, I was talking to some traders about this and,  you know, just like with anything they are pros and cons.  They say a big  positive is what you are seeing right now.  NYSE shares are up almost 13  percent.  This is a great move for shareholders, because the offer comes  with a 19 percent premium.  And the NYSE could also keep its domestic  ownership.  </p><p>And then, of course, there are the negatives.  You know, the Deutsche  Boerse deal would be better.  I'm talking about the negatives, for the  Nasdaq.  The Deutsche Boerse deal, traders say, would be better because it  is a worldwide platform.  And it is better for the NYSE in the long run.  </p><p>Now, we spoke with Duncan Niederauer, the head of the NYSE, back in  February, when the Deutsche Boerse was announced at the NYSE.  He  definitely echoed that sentiment.  Take a listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DUNCAN NIEDERAUER, NYSE:  The fact of the matter is the equity, the  U.S. equity business for our company the way it is currently constructed,  is not the majority of the business anymore.  It was our view several years  ago that with a lot of the competition in the business here, we could not  rely on U.S. equities as our single source of profitability over the long  run.  We also appreciate that the markets are global.  The capital markets  are worldwide.  And I think our view is we have got to continue to be  invested in those markets and services across the value chain.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KOSIK:  And of course it is all about the money making derivatives.   That is really where it is at these days, you know, and the fact is many  people really don't mind the exchange, Richard, being controlled by an  overseas company like Deutsche Boerse, especially since NYSE merged with  Euronext a while back, right?</p><p>QUEST:  OK, let's put aside who owns what in terms of overseas, and  the xenophobic argument that will be brought forward about foreigners  ramping up the ramparts of Wall Street.  But the fact is Nasdaq is, if you  like, the bogie man rival to the Big Board, ever since it started.  And it  is, you know, scooped up all the big tech stocks. </p><p>KOSIK:  And you are right.  I mean, there is this-you know this-there  has been this ongoing rivalry between the Nasdaq and the NYSE.  You know  each one, the same customer.  They all want the same market share.  I mean,  we saw the tit for tat going on when we saw the flash crash back on May 6  of last year.  You know they were finger pointing, all right, who is  responsible for the glitch?  Yes, there is no love lost between the two  exchanges.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right.  </p><p>KOSIK:  I can't imagine Duncan Niederauer sitting down with Bob  Greifeld for tea at this point, Richard. </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  I don't know if you are a betting woman or not, but on  this Friday, if ever you had to have a dollar on who is going to win, would  it be the Nasdaq or the Deutsche Boerse?</p><p>KOSIK:  I put my money on Deutsche Boerse, definitely.  Yes. </p><p>QUEST:  All right.  </p><p>KOSIK:  But it has to go through the regulatory process.  But that is  who I'm putting money on.  </p><p>QUEST:  Oh, oh, that is the boilerplate caveat that she' putting in at  the end just to make sure.  That is the disclaimer.  </p><p>All right.  Many thanks, Alison.  Have a great weekend. </p><p>KOSIK:  Thank you. </p><p>QUEST:  Many thanks.  Don't forget, what we say means absolutely  nothing.  Because it all depends on what the shareholders in those  companies actually believe.  But I think probably Alison is well and truly  on the money.  </p><p>One U.S. stock, Morgan Stanley has tipped for big growth this year, is  Honeywell.  CNN's Maggie Lake met the conglomerate's chief executive to  find out why and bring us a closer look at this key company. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  They have  aerospace contracts around the world, but also make everything from home  security alarms to energy efficient car products, and safety gloves.  In  short, a classic conglomerate, over a century old, with annual sales of $33  billion.  </p><p>Morgan Stanley recently tipped Honeywell shares, which are currently  at their highest level since the financial crisis.  We met CEO David Cote  at the firm's campus in New Jersey. </p><p>(on camera):   With such uncertain times, such turmoil around the  world, what is it that makes you so bullish about Honeywell's outlook?</p><p>DAVID COTE, CEO, HONEYWELL:  I don't think there is as much  uncertainty as a lot of people might suspect.  I do believe as about nine,  10 months ago, the recovery started to become for real.  And we started  being a net revenue (ph) ourselves, at that time.  And we saw orders  continue to do well during that time.  And I really think we're on the path  to a global recovery right now, that could go on for four or five years,  who knows?  </p><p>But I do think that that the path that we're on.  We're just very  pleased with the positions that we have, because we pay a lot of attention  to try be in the middle of macro trends that just are going to last for a  long time.  Whether it is energy efficiency, clean energy generation,  safety and security, those are the sort of things that are going to last  for a long time.  We are well positioned within that.  And that great  positions in some good industries really puts you in the right places.  </p><p>LAKE:   You get 50 percent of your growth, globally.  </p><p>COTE:  Hmmm.</p><p>LAKE:  Are those growth rates sustainable?</p><p>COTE:  There are things that have to be managed as you go along.  I  would say the China track record has been very good at being able to figure  out how you do this.  Because it is not-an economy is not a static thing.   In fact, one of the things you want to maintain is the dynamism in an  economy.  </p><p>China, so far, has made all the right calls.  For 30 years they have  been making the right decisions and proceeding inexorably to greater and  greater growth for their people.  India will have to make those same kind  of decisions, because it didn't quite start so soon for them.  There is  more learning that needs to go on.  As even the Indians would admit the  bureaucracy is astounding. </p><p>LAKE (voice over):  Last year China awarded Honeywell and $11 billion  contract to make landing equipment for its new plane maker, Comac.  Some  firms have complained over a lack of openness in China, but it remains a  key market for Honeywell.  </p><p>COTE:  The growing pains are tough for both, partners, right?  And  that is one of the things that has to get sorted through.  It doesn't mean  that we shouldn't complain about the things that do need to change.  And we  should.  By the same token, we shouldn't view them as evil, or bad, or out  to destroy us.  Because at the end of the day, as you know, economics is  not a zero-sum game; both sides benefit from the transaction or you  wouldn't do it.  </p><p>LAKE:   You are growing and on an aggressive acquisition trial.  Why  does that work for Honeywell, when it didn't seem to work out for so many  others?</p><p>COTE:  First thing that we never allow to happen is exactly what you  talked about.  Is there is the zeal for the deal, as I call it.  Where you  just get so-this is going to be great.  You all start believing your own  stories.  This is going to be terrific.  And you actually start ignoring  some of the stuff you find in due diligence.  And you need to have the  discipline that says even when you get to the final negotiating table you  can still walk away.  You can't fall so in live with anything that you'll  do it regardless, because everything is going to be great. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  Now that is advice from the top; zeal for the deal, from the  CEO of Honeywell. </p><p>On Monday, on this program, we turn our focus to the supply chain as  we examine how products that we use everyday might be linked to modern-day  slavery.

We're seeing, lately, there has been some decline in demand,  as you'd expect, given the seriousness of what's happening there.  </p><p>But in the first days, it was much more mixed, because you had an  explosion of outbound travel, obviously, happening.  And a lot of domestic  hotel bookings happening.  So, it's still very early days, in terms of the  long-term impact on this, but at the moment we are seeing some decline in  the demand.</p><p>QUEST:  You see, the thing is, Japan is actually quite an important  part for Expedia, isn't it?  And you were looking at Japan as being a major  source in revenue in the future.</p><p>DURCHSLAG:  Yes, Japan is, for us, a pretty high-growth market, and  it's part of our broader Asia investment profile, which is a market that's  been growing 54 percent in the last two years.</p><p>QUEST:  Just to explain that, you don't expect that to continue,  surely?</p><p>DURCHSLAG:  I do expect that to continue, sure.  What's happening in  Japan is one of many events that's been happening in a year that's out of  Revelations.  Floods in Australia, earthquakes, tsunamis, nuclear issues.   It's been a very difficult year.</p><p>But overall, the intrinsics on Asia are very powerful, $200 billion  travel market that's growing faster than any other market in the world, and  online penetration, which is very important to us, is only 20 percent, less  than half the US or Europe.  So, there's a lot of upside growth in Asia.</p><p>QUEST:  Which is why, of course, your deal with Tony Fernandes of  AirAsia is particularly relevant, isn't it?  Even though it's been  criticized by the opponents?</p><p>DURCHSLAG:  Well, sure.  We are really excited about our partnership  with AirAsia, the reason being, it's the first deal ever that brings  together an online travel agency and a low-cost carrier.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, aren't you in an uncomfortable position?  Because you've  got this deal, but you're still saying you are neutral or, at least, not  biased towards that particular airline.</p><p>DURCHSLAG:  Well, we're all about bringing the best choices to our  travelers, and having a low-cost carrier on Expedia, in addition to all of  the other 300 airlines that we have, 130,000 hotel rooms, that is only to  the benefit of consumers.</p><p>QUEST:  You've obviously online, and the penetration online is very  severe and very harsh, the marketplace.  But now, you're moving into social  media, as well.</p><p>DURCHSLAG:  Yes, we're driving a new strategy called Expedia  Everywhere that's all about mobile.  Because what's more intrinsically  mobile than travel?  And what's more intrinsically social than travel?  One  of the major trends in travel is friends and families going together.</p><p>So, we've announced just today the largest sweepstakes ever done on  Facebook that's been hosted on Facebook, and we just announced last week a  brand new application called Expedia Hotels,  Mobile and social are the  future of travel.</p><p>QUEST:  Why?  Why do you want -- I mean, I go online and I book my  ticket.  Why do I need Expedia getting in my Facebook, my Twitter, and all  these other social media areas?</p><p>DURCHSLAG:  Well, because first of all, we want to be a personalized  travel assistant in your pocket while you're on the fly, if you're late, on  a flight, or you have to rebook or a flight is canceled.  With one click,  you can do that on Expedia.</p><p>And socially, you want to be able to share your itinerary with your  friends so they can come with you.  Or your pictures afterwards.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  The president of Expedia Worldwide talking to me.  On this  program, of course, we take great importance to the travel and tourism  industry.</p><p>Now, we've been hearing a lot about how the disaster in Japan has been  affecting the travel industry.  There is, of course, another factor that  affects airline prices, and that is the cost of fuel.  Brent is currently  trading at almost $119 a barrel.  It's gained 25 percent, give or take,  since the start of the year.</p><p>On this program this week, we've had three airline chief executives,  and here are their thoughts on the sky-high price of oil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIE WALSH, CEO, INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP:  I think at $115 a  barrel, it's a challenge.  But I don't think it's going to undermine the  economic recovery that we've seen in most major economies.  </p><p>I think if oil goes above $150 a barrel, it's something that everybody  will be concerned about, but I'm pleased to say we're not there at this  point.</p><p>ROB FYFE, CEO, AIR NEW ZEALAND:  I'd actually be happy with fuel at  $150.  I'd be happy with fuel at $200.  We are actually an incredibly  robust airline.  We've got a very strong balance sheet.  There's a lot of  airlines out there that struggle to economically survive.  They get by by  the skin of their teeth.  To be honest, if high fuel started to claim some  of the struggling airlines out of the industry --</p><p>QUEST:  Oh!  </p><p>FYFE:  -- it wouldn't concern me at all.</p><p>QUEST:  Oh!  Oh!  That's a polite -- you just want -- you want  nutcracker the competition!</p><p>FYFE:  Well, the reality is, the strong should get stronger, and those  that aren't strong enough should, actually, fall by the wayside.</p><p>JEFF SMISEK, CEO, UNITED AIRLINES:  We need to make money no matter  what the oil prices.  And we need to adjust to that, which means investing  in modern fuel-efficient aircraft, engines, operations.  So, we need to  learn to make money in high oil prices.  And I believe that we're likely to  have oil prices for a -- high oil prices for a long time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Jeff Smisk, Rob Fyfe, and Willie Walsh talking to me during  the course of the week.</p><p>Frequent fliers, business travelers, are horrified when we board a  plane and find children sitting in business class near us.  Well, there are  two sides to this argument, and anyone with a young family will tell you  it's difficult flying with kids.</p><p>Well, today, we heard of a new airline that's courting a very specific  clientele.  These are flights exclusively for children.</p><p>The flight-booking site Skyscanner says Urchin Airways will become the  world's first kids-only carrier.  The rules will say no passengers under  (sic) the age of 16 will be allowed onboard.  There will be flight  attendants, and children will be entertained during the flight with  competitions and the cabin crew dressed as clowns.  Urchin will coordinate  with other mainline regular carriers so parents and children can be  reunited at their final destination.  The families we spoke to thought this  was a most exciting prospect.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it's a wonderful idea.  They're going to  have so much fun.  They've talked of little else for days.  I mean, win- win.  I get to drink a glass of wine and they get to play.  It's perfect.   I'll meet them at the other end.  It's wonderful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL:  Well, I can't wait to meet the clowns, because  they're going to be cabin crew.  And I heard there's going to be egg and  spoon games, as well, so that sounds really fun.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL:  Also, there's going to be, like, ice cream and we  can eat it for supper, and there's going to be screaming contests and on  one's there to say that we can't scream as much as we like.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  A brilliant idea, just don't book me ever, ever, on Urchin  Airways. </p><p>That's not the only airline proposal raising eyebrows this Friday.   Everyone, it seems, they're going to ever more weird and wonderful ways to  keep your business.  We'll talk about the airlines after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>QUEST:  It has been mild weather and we've had sunny skies.  Western  Europe's had a wonderful week.  Except, of course, if you're heading  towards allergy season, like myself.  And frankly, Pedram, at the World  Weather Center -- I -- I mean, I knew the weather was changing.  The throat  gets tighter, the nose starts running.</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, you don't need a forecast.   When you see the conditions that have been as nice as they have, of course,  they're going to have hard effects, there, on folks that are suffering  allergies.</p><p>And as Richard said, it's been fairly mild, and the conditions over  the next 24 hours, going to remain mild for at least one more day across  portions of London.  There it is.  That's 17 degrees, your forecast high  temperature.  We'll call it partly to mostly cloudy by the afternoon hours,  perhaps a shower. </p><p>That's really the good news out of this as it begins to help clean up  the air, the atmosphere that has been a little polluted with the  pollination that's been taking place out there.</p><p>But as we talked about, what's going on out there, especially across  the United Kingdom?  What's causing all this?  Well, you have to keep in  mind, Richard's not alone with this one.  Some 20 percent of folks across  the United Kingdom are affected by allergies this time of year.</p><p>Now, you just go back a couple of months, the harsh winter that we  had.  Remember the snow showers, the cold conditions?  That actually helps  promote early pollination as we get these warm spells that we were getting  in the past few days.  So, with the warm temperatures, that's helping  things out.</p><p>What's the predominate pollen right now for this time of year?   Typically, we talk about birch, ash, elm, and willow, the tree pollens.   That's probably what Richard is feeling, here, the past few days with the  tree pollens being among the high.</p><p>Now, if you suffer symptoms in June and July, more than likely, that  becomes a grass pollen concern as we head on towards the summer season.</p><p>But what do you do?  Well, the best thing to do is to avoid the peak  times.  Experts say 7:00 to 10:00 AM, that's one of the times the trees  begin pollinating, and also releasing pollen about 4:00 to 7:00 PM.  So,  early mornings, early afternoons, that's really the concern out there,  being staying indoors.</p><p>Also, changing your clothes.  Believe it or not, changing your clothes  when you get back inside the house, that could help the concern, as well,  as a lot of the pollen clings on right to your clothing and makes you  sneeze all around the house after you've come indoors.  So, you're  wondering why you're feeling the symptoms when you're inside?  That could  be the reason.  You can change your clothes.</p><p>But here is a storm system that is entering the picture.  That, again,  will help mix up the atmosphere a little bit as we head on into Saturday,  partly to mostly cloudy skies around London, and Western Europe could get  some showers out of this.  And also across the north, a few showers.</p><p>So, the temperatures are going to cool down, that'll suppress some of  the pollen levels, there, in the next few days, and the conditions are  going to improve.  But really, the warmest air mass still stays to the  south, here, across portions of southern France into Spain, Portugal  getting well above-average readings, some 10 to 12 degrees above average  over the next couple of days.</p><p>And if you've got some travel plans out there, looks like travel not  going to be affected by this much, as we're seeing breezy conditions and,  again, a few showers possible.  But all in all, an improving forecast for  Mr. Quest out there, and perhaps some of the folks that are dealing with  the allergies, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  We thank you for that.  I'm not sure whether knowing about the  allergies actually makes it any better, but Pedram, we do thank you.  I  think the most extraordinary thing is the way I'm finding them coming on as  I get older.  There must be a moral in there somewhere.  Pedram, have a  good weekend.</p><p>JAVAHERI:  Yes.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, finally to you, don't say you weren't warned.  April  Fool's Day on a week when we've spoken to a number of the top airlines.   The entire industry, why oh why is it the airline industry that decided to  get April Fools silly?</p><p>For example, Virgin Atlantic, they announced that they were growing  fresh herbs and vegetables for upper class passengers in the galley.   Apparently, the galley would be onboard, and they promised fresh mint for  mojitos.</p><p>That was an April Fool.</p><p>Ryanair had everyone confused.  They said they had child-free flights  from October.  The press release was dated April the 1st, but it was  released, seemingly, yesterday, because I read that story.  So, Ryanair --  I'm not sure who the final fool was, Michael.  Your press release came out  early.  Anyway, we still had that one.</p><p>And then, finally, yes.  We did it to you.  Urchin Airways, kids only  flights, the opposite of Ryanair, kids only, sorry.  April Fool!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED GIRL:  You've been April Fooled.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  They were, of course, in on the joke.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in London.  Whatever you're up to  in the weekend ahead, have a good weekend.  Thank you for your time and  attention.

But, say the  authorities, these raids are not enough to stop counterfeit drugs flooding  Nigeria's streets.</p><p>GARBA MACDONALD, DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR OF ENFORCEMENT, NAFDAC:   Considering the level of poverty, people will want to go for the cheapest.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera):  And the big men behind the sale of these drugs?   Do they pose a danger to you and your men?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, they do.  They are problems because they can  organize, they have the money, they can organize thugs to attack us.  We  cannot deal with this without more policemen.</p><p>PUREFOY:  So, this is big money.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Oh, it's big money, yes, sure.  Big money.  </p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over):  As Femi Sorenmekun, director of a local  diabetes drug company, explains, the major problem is identifying which box  of drugs is real, and which is fake.  Until now, with the introduction of a  small scratch card packaged with all his medications.</p><p>FEMI SOREMEKUN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BIOCHEM PHARMACEUTICALS:  Then they  scratch it, and upon scratching it, a number is revealed.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera):  If we text that now -- ?</p><p>SOREMEKUN:  Definitely, if you text that now, you're going to --</p><p>PUREFOY:  What happens?</p><p>SOREMEKUN:  You're going to get a message telling you --</p><p>PUREFOY:  Can we try it?</p><p>SOREMEKUN:  Yes, you can.</p><p>PUREFOY:  There you go.  So, that's almost immediate.</p><p>SOREMEKUN:  Yes.  Almost immediate.</p><p>PUREFOY:  But when someone receives this text, it says \"OK,\" they know  that drug is original.</p><p>SOREMEKUN:  Is original.</p><p>PUREFOY:  Has it worked?  Has it helped your business?  Has it helped  the sales?</p><p>SOREMEKUN:  Yes, it has.  We've been able to capture most of our  market share back.  Because we can't eliminate fake 100 percent.  But what  we've lost, we've captured it back, and we can see some growth, now, in the  business.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over):  The idea is borrowed from the scratch cards  sold on street corners across Africa use to top up mobile phones with  credit.</p><p>Applying this scratch card innovation to the drug market is the idea  of Ashifi Gogo.</p><p>ASHIFI GOGO, CEO, SPROXIL, INC.:  The good thing is the consumer is  not paying.  The government is not paying, as well.  And it's the pharm  companies that are paying Sproxil for the service.  The rationale being  they can recoup market share that's been lost to counterfeiters.</p><p>So, in some sense, the counterfeiters are paying for the service,  which puts a smile on lots of people's faces, I guess, except for the  counterfeiters.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over):  A simple tool that investigators hope will make  raids like this one less necessary.  Christian Purefoy, CNN, Lagos,  Nigeria.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW:  So, anti-malarial drugs are the most commonly counterfeited  medication here in Africa.  The United Nations estimates that in some parts  of the continent, between 50 to 60 percent of all anti-insective drugs  don't have acceptable levels of their active ingredients.</p><p>And more disturbingly, a World Health Organization Study found that  Ghana was the worst affected, 67 percent of their most common anti-malarial  drugs were found to have failed potency tests.</p><p>Now, up next, he coined the phrase \"BRIC\" to describe the top  emerging-market economies.  But what does he have to say about South  Africa's entry into that elite club?  Up next on MARKETPLACE AFRICA, we  interview leading economist Jim O'Neill.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CURNOW:  Welcome back to MARKETPLACE AFRICA.  They're known as the  fastest-growing emerging markets, Brazil, Russia, India, and China.   Together, they're known as BRIC, an acronym coined by our next guest on  Face Time, Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs.  </p><p>In the next few weeks, South Africa joins the BRIC summit in Beijing,  hoping its inclusion will raise its status and prestige on the world stage.   But Jim O'Neill now weighs in on whether he thinks South Africa really  deserves a seat at that table.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM O'NEILL, CHAIRMAN, GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT:  To be a BRIC,  it has to be an economy that is really at the core, today, or likely to be  in the future, of the world economy.  So, it has to be big enough to be  economically impactful on everybody else.</p><p>And so, against that general background, an economy that is already  three to five percent of global GDP or is likely to be on in a vaguely  foreseeable future.  And if you go with that definition, there's only a  clear four there are, Brazil, Russia, India, India, and China.  </p><p>To be a \"Next 11\" country, it is literally a phrase that I dreamed up  seven years ago as a result of people saying, well, why just those four?   Why not Indonesia?  Why not Mexico?  Why not Turkey?  Why not South Africa?   Et cetera et cetera.  And it's a phrase to describe the next 11 largest  population countries from the emerging world.</p><p>NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  If the N-11 is such a fluid --</p><p>O'NEILL:  Yes.</p><p>ELBAGIR:  -- concept, why do you think there has been so much  controversy over South Africa jumping over the N-11 to be part of the BRICS  club.</p><p>O'NEILL:  South Africa's so unique and, in this context, quite odd.   Because South Africa has some aspects of development, particularly  financial markets, some aspects of the better standards of Western  practices in terms of regulatory matters and Western law.  And with that,  there has been historic trade organizations that South Africa's linked to,  particularly with Brazil and India. </p><p>And so, with the whole growth of the BRIC idea, particularly when it  became a BRIC political club, for South Africa to be not part of it is  obviously something that South African leaders feel a little bit, \"What's  going on here?\"</p><p>Beyond that, I'm not sure why South Africa's managed to leap above it.   Because if you look at the criteria I said earlier about what's a BRIC and  what's a Next 11, South Africa doesn't even come close to -- certainly, not  a BRIC.  South African economy at, what?  $350 billion is half the sum of  global GDP.  </p><p>So, it's nowhere near constituting a BRIC, and without staggering  productivity improvements and major immigration or improvements in  birthrates, et cetera, et cetera, it's never going to get there.  </p><p>South Africa's really stimulated my mind to explore this further,  because there are some others, like Poland, Saudi Arabia, who have more  reason to be irked about these things, perhaps, than just South Africa.   Because, of course, when you look at the Next 11 definition, South Africa  doesn't actually have that many people, either.  And in the context of the  continent, Nigeria is the place that really matters.</p><p>ELBAGIR:  I was going to say, do you think they've missed the trick by  taking in South Africa rather than Nigeria?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I think it's been, because the South African leaders and  leading intellects have been so persistent about it and maybe the Chinese  and Indians and others thought, \"You know what?  OK, guys.  If it shuts you  up, come in.\"</p><p>But there is another angle to it, of course, that I'm sure South  Africa has perhaps played on the notion that because they do have developed  markets and western government standards in some areas, they've said,  \"Look, we're the gateway to the rest of Africa,\" and that's certainly an  argument with some legitimacy.</p><p>ELBAGIR:  What would you advice -- if you were advising the South  African government, what should they do to earn their place at the BRIC  table?</p><p>O'NEILL:  That South African --</p><p>ELBAGIR:  The South African government.  Or do you think it's a --  anyhow, it's a lost cause?</p><p>O'NEILL:  No, I don't.  No, nowhere is a lost cause.  I think South  African leaders have to be bolder about the basics and not be so worried  about what club they're in or not.  They've got acceptance, they're in the  G-20, they've been invited to the big political meeters -- leaders'  meeting, and they're there.  </p><p>What they've now got to do is, as with the World Cup, turn an event  into some lasting improvement.  Stop thinking that because of Apartheid and  other tragic historical things, stop thinking that world owes South Africa  something for its past, and do things to create a better environment where  you can attract a lot more international business.</p><p>And most importantly, embrace all your own people in a competitive,  open way and find everybody jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CURNOW:  Is South Africa qualified to be a member of BRIC?  Tell us  what you think.  We're having a discussion on our Facebook page.  But for  now, let's just take a look at what's trending this week.</p><p>Foreign mining firms in Zimbabwe are scrambling following President  Robert Mugabe's demand that they must sell a majority stake to local black  Zimbabweans within six months.  Shares at major mining companies dropped  sharply upon the news.</p><p>The regulation follows an indigenization act signed into law three  years ago, which aims to make foreign companies junior partners in  Zimbabwe.</p><p>And Kumba Iron Ore is proposing a $7 billion steel plant in South  Africa to help reduce unemployment.  </p><p>President Jacob Zuma has asked businesses to help create 5 million  jobs in the coming decade.  The proposed plant would create 3,000 jobs and  export up to five billion tons of steel each year to buyers in Asia.</p><p>So, if you have any ideas on who we should interview or what stories  we should be doing, please do connect with us.  We're on Facebook, we're on  Twitter, and you can e-mail us.  We'd love to hear what you have to say.  </p><p>But until next week, for me, Robyn Curnow, here in Johannesburg, good- bye.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2011 Cable News Network, Inc.

Today, Qualcomm shares are heading the opposite direction after a U.S. judge ruled that the company's patent licensing practices are both unlawful and anticompetitive. </p><p>QCOM is down 11 percent today as of this writing. The ruling was handed down by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, whose name should be familiar to those that have followed lawsuits involving \"big tech\" over the past decade. Koh ruled that given its position as the leading supplier of 4G LTE modems found in modern smartphones, it has unfairly backed its customers into a corner to accept unsavory licensing terms. Her ruling sided with the case brought forth by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC[3]).A lot of the Qualcomm violations that Koh pointed out were alsobrought to light by Apple[4]. However, the folks in Cupertino settled with Qualcomm after it was determined that it wouldn't be able to get 5G modems to the market in time due toIntel's laggard development pace[5].'Qualcomm's licensing practices have strangled competition in the CDMA and the premium LTE modem chip markets for years, and harmed rivals, OEMs, and end consumers in the process,' said Koh in her ruling, which stretched on for 230 pages.Koh has stipulated that Qualcomm be monitored for seven years to ensure that the company not only renovates its contracts with customers, but also sets fair and reasonable prices for patent licensing (among other things).In a statement issued this morning, Qualcomm said that it will seek a stay of the judgement and that it will file an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9thCircuit.'We strongly disagree with the judge's conclusions, her interpretation of the facts and her application of the law,' said Don Rosenberg, who serves as Qualcomm's executive vice president and general counsel.Qualcomm has also been used by regulatory agencies inTaiwan[6], China and South Korea for its anticompetitive practices and has paid nearly $2 billion in fines to those countries as a result of its violations.

He used the address to blast Hollywood, big tech companies and research institutions, accusing them of often being too cosy with the ruling Chinese Communist Party.    Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.    \"Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease\" the Chinese ruling party, Barr charged.    Barr indicated major companies were facing extortion pressures to do lobbying for Beijing, arguing China was \"hiding behind American voices\" and interfering in domestic politics.    He warned business had to disclose any lobbying on behalf of foreign governments, under regulations known as FARA. Failure to do so could lead to prosecution.    The attorney general directly accused some of the biggest US technology companies, including Apple, of being \"all to willing to collaborate\" with Beijing.    \"Globalisation does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of the communist Chinese drum will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade or the free exchange of ideas,\" Barr said.   From Iron Man 3 to Top Gun 2, how China influences Hollywood   He warned against US dependence on China to produce essential goods like medical supplies, and blasted major American companies like Apple and Disney for kowtowing to Chinese pressures to give up secrets, compromise their values, and censor their own products.    \"If Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.\"    He, meanwhile, praised technology companies including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn for saying they would not comply with Chinese governmental requests for user data after Beijing imposed a new security law on Hong Kong.    \"If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule,\" Barr said.

The department also is examining Google\u2019s online advertising practices, said the person, who could not discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Antitrust officials at the department briefed state attorneys general Sept 24 on the planned action against Google, seeking support from states across the country that share concerns about Google\u2019s conduct.    The anticipated lawsuit against Google could be the government\u2019s biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the groundbreaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.    Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.    Spokespeople for Google, whose parent company is Alphabet Inc, and headquarters is in Mountain View, California, declined comment on Sept 24.    Google has maintained that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. The company says its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.    For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 US states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \"potential monopolistic behaviour\u201d.    Now with 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department is approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement. Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google.    The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to President Donald Trump said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with US elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.    The company has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views.    Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices. Among other things, the regulators found that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.    Google controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favouring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.    Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world\u2019s largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system. \u2013

But doing so may be more difficult than it seems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Tuesday, the USDepartment of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of major technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It said the probe will take into account \"widespread concerns\" about social media, search engines and online retail services.</p><p>\"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\" Makan Delrahim, the department's chief antitrust officer, said in a statement. \"The Department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.\"</p><p>The terse but momentous announcement follows months of concern in Congress and elsewhere over the sway of firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon. Lawmakers and Democratic presidential candidates have called for stricter regulation or even breakups of the big tech companies , which have drawn intense scrutiny following scandals involving compromised user privacy, security lapses and misinformation and extremism that flourished on their platforms.</p><p>Facebook is awaiting a significant judgment from the Federal Trade Commission over its privacy practices, one that will reportedly include a $5bn(\u00a34bn) fine and impose other limits on its operations. The FTC also reportedly plans to hand Google a multimillion dollar fine over its handling of children's information on YouTube. Europe has investigated and fined a number of major UStech companies over the past several years.</p><p>\"It seems like the nation's law enforcement agencies are finally waking up to the threat posed by big tech,\" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which has criticised Amazon for stifling independent businesses. Mitchell testified at a House hearing last week.</p><p>President Donald Trump also has repeatedly criticised the big tech companies by name in recent months. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that they are biased against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>But Big Tech could also present a difficult target, as current interpretations of USantitrust law don't obviously apply to companies offering inexpensive goods or free online services. The Justice Department did not name specific companies in its announcement.</p><p>Read more</p><p>Facebook fined $5bn for 'inappropriate' sharing of personal data</p><p>The Justice investigation mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Its chairman, David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has sharply criticised the conduct of Silicon Valley giants and said legislative or regulatory changes may be needed. He has called breaking up the companies a last resort.</p><p>Major tech companies already facing that congressional scrutiny declined to comment on the Justice Department probe. Amazon and Facebook had no comment. Apple and Google referred inquiries to public statements by their executives.</p><p>Shares of Facebook, Amazon and Apple were down slightly in after-hours trading Tuesday.</p><p>Traditional antitrust law focuses on dominant businesses that harm consumers, typically defined as price-gouging and similar behaviours. But many tech companies offer free products that are paid for by a largely invisible trade in the personal data gleaned from those services. Others like Amazon offer consistently low prices on a wide array of merchandise.</p><p>\"That is going to be a tough one for (regulators) to prove,\" said University of Pennsylvania law professor Herbert Hovenkamp.</p><p>Read more</p><p>Cambridge Analytica 'used people's fashion tastes to help elect Trump'</p><p>Facebook freezes hundreds of apps amid post-Cambridge Analytica review</p><p>US government preparing potential investigation into Google</p><p>Beyond that, the companies could face scrutiny for buying up smaller rivals that might be a threat to their business. Last week, Cicilline accused industry giants of creating a \"startup kill zone\" to insulate them from competition.</p><p>For instance, Google bought YouTube in 2006 when it was still a fledging video site struggling to survive an onslaught of copyright infringement lawsuits, and acquired the technology for its now-dominant Android software for smartphones in an even smaller deal. Facebook snapped up Instagram - now the fastest-growing part of its business - in its infancy, and Apple bought the technology powering its ubiquitous Siri assistant.</p><p>The Trump-era Justice Department has already tried to push the bounds of antitrust law, albeit unsuccessfully. The government employed a novel antitrust theory when it sued to block AT&amp;T's acquisition of Time Warner, arguing that the combined company could hike prices for programming to consumers' detriment. It lost the case both in lower court and on appeal.</p><p>In his January confirmation hearings, Attorney General William Barr acknowledged curiosity about how Silicon Valley giants grew so huge \"under the nose\" of antitrust enforcers. \"I don't' think big is necessarily bad,\" he said. \"But I want to find out more about that dynamic.\"</p><p>Trump has been a fierce critic of AT&amp;T, which owns CNN, in addition to many large tech companies. At various times, he has publicly criticised Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon for allegedly shady, biased or unpatriotic behaviour.</p><p>AP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-54726744</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-RY81-F021-6050-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><timeReceived>12:21 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Google declined comment.</p><p>Early in 2013, the FTC closed a long-running investigation of Google, giving it a slap on the wrist. Under FTC pressure, Google agreed to end the practice of \"scraping\" reviews and other data from rivals' websites for its own products, and to let advertisers export data to independently assess campaigns.</p><p>Google's search, YouTube, reviews, maps and other businesses, which are largely free to consumers but financed through advertising, have catapulted it from a startup to one of the world's richest companies in just two decades.</p><p>Along the way, it has made enemies in both the tech world, who have complained to law enforcers about its market dominance, and in Washington, where lawmakers have complained about issues from its alleged political bias to its plans for China.</p><p>TripAdvisor chief executive and co-founder Stephen Kaufer welcomed news that Google could face Justice Department antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>\"TripAdvisor remains concerned about Google's practices in the United States, the EU and throughout the world,\" Kaufer said in a statement.</p><p>\"For the good of consumers and competition on the internet, we welcome any renewed interest by US regulators into Google's anti-competitive behavior.\"</p><p>Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has pushed for action to break up Google, as well as other big tech companies.

Josh Hawley, a Republican Google critic, said on Twitter, regarding the investigation.</p><p>Google has faced a plethora of overseas probes.\u00a0Europe's competition authority, for one, hit Google with a 2.4 billion euro (US$2.7 billion) EU fine two years ago for unfairly promoting its own comparison shopping service.</p><p>Google has since offered to allow competitors to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page, giving them the chance to compete on equal terms.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google on Sunday said it was experiencing high levels of congestion in the eastern United States, affecting multiple services in Google Cloud, G Suite and YouTube.</p><p>\"We believe we have identified the root cause of the congestion and expect to return to normal service shortly,\" the company said, adding that the incident began at 3:25 p.m. EDT. It did not elaborate on the cause.</p><p>Snapchat, which also experienced outages, said it was aware of the issue. DownDetector.com - an outage tracking website - showed that the number of Snapchat-related complaints had peaked at more than 48,000 before falling to about 7,300 as of 7 p.m. EDT on Sunday.</p><p>Snapchat's parent company, Snap Inc., said in its annual report it used Google Cloud, but neither company responded to questions about whether the Snapchat outage was linked to the Google Cloud issues.</p><p>- Contact us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:english@hkej.com\">english@hkej.com</email></p><p>CG</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HKEJIT-2152835</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HKEJIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W83-P7V1-DXM8-X001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"648\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 EJ Insight of Hong Kong Economic Journal Co., Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>EJ Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5530\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
