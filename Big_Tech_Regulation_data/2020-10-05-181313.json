Lawmakers wrangle in Washington over a budget deal but investors aren`t fazed, sending stocks to new records.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Open house. The housing market is tight. And the upcoming spring selling season could be more competitive than ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Market monitor. Why our guest tonight says now the time to make some smart investment in smart tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, January 19th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>We`ve seen this movie before. Democrats and Republicans spar in the Capitol over funding the government or partially shutting it down. We`ve come to that 11th hour again today, and even though the plot is familiar, the drama is always captivating.</p><p>Hours ahead of a midnight deadline, Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, met with the president at the White House. The senator said progress was made, but disagreements remain.</p><p>Well, the drama in D.C. may have been captivating. But on Wall Street, it was naptivating. Investors mostly yawned and put on a drowsy smile. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq hit new highs. The Dow was up, so were bond yields, sending bond prices lower.</p><p>Today, the Dow Jones lost 53 points to 26,071. Nasdaq gained 40. And the S&amp;P 500 added 12.</p><p>So, if a possible government shutdown wasn`t top of mind for investors, what the heck is?</p><p>Bob Pisani takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stock rose fractionally today. The markets have already had a banner start to the year but many are concern had the prospects of a government shutdown could derail the rally.</p><p>Well, maybe, but based on history, it`s highly unlikely. In last few decades, stocks have barely budged in the days during a government shutdown. Beyond the shutdown, really, there is plenty of other forces that are driving the markets and may be affecting the markets this week.</p><p>Remember, we essentially went sideways. A big concern for the market right now is the bond market. The ten-year treasury yield rose to a near three- year high and it doesn`t seem to be a lot slowing it down. If rates continue to rise, that could be a major problem for stock market investors.</p><p>Also, there`s the energy market. Crude oil prices are up 10 percent over the last month, but this talk of oil beginning to up to out. So, U.S. oil output is expected to break through 10 million barrels per day and IEA said it expects U.S. production to overtake both Russian and Saudi Arabian production.</p><p>That`s good news but it`s putting a lid on the gains this year. Energy stocks, which have had been moving up, were all down this week.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The overall impact of a shutdown on the market maybe minimal, but sectors within the market respond differently, looking at data back to 1980. On average, the energy sector is up 2 percent during a shutdown, making it the best performing group. On the flip side, the information technology sector is the worst performing, falling nearly 2 percent.</p><p>But big gains come after the government reopens because two weeks after the government is back in business, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 have seen gains averaging more than 3 percent, with the Dow trading positively 100 percent of the time.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, despite the back and forth in Washington, money flowed into the stock market at the fastest pace ever during the past four weeks. According to the latest survey from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch, mutual funds and ETFs that focus on equity saw $58 billion of fresh money flowing in. The survey sites investor fear of missing out, a phenomenon we`ve reported on.</p><p>New money didn`t just go into exchange traded funds that passively track the market but also into actively run funds which have seen outflows over the past couple of years.</p><p>HERERA: Investor enthusiasm is indeed high. But is it too high?</p><p>And next week marks a big test for the market. Earnings come out.</p><p>Here to talk about what investors should be watching is Kevin Caron, Washington Crossing Advisers co-founder and portfolio manager.</p><p>Welcome back, Kevin. Good to see you, as always.</p><p>KEVIN CARON, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WASHINGTON CROSSING ADVISORS: It`s good to be here. Good to be here.</p><p>HERERA: You know, the issues that may be affecting the market, Bob Pisani mentioned one, and that is rising bond yields. But they are rising from historical low levels. Are you worried about the increase in interest rates?</p><p>CARON: We are matching it, but we are not particularly worried it because if you look at where it`s coming from, it`s coming from a much better economy. We are seeing investment spending picking up very strongly. And this is a big thing because for four years before this, before let`s say the middle part of 2017, investment spending was really quite weak and the economy was weak.</p><p>We are seeing that pick up. That`s actually good for growth. And the reason that the rates are rising is because we are seeing firmer prices.</p><p>This is something that the Fed has been looking to achieve for a long time. And now, we are getting inflation back up to about 2 percent. So, everything looks fairly good. And bond yields have been very low for a long time. So, we just see this as a readjustment of those yields to place where is they maybe should have been all along.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, Kevin, I want to talk about something else, and that is the passage of the tax bill, the biggest tax bill since 1986. We all remember what happened then a year later in 1987. There was a big crash. Tell me why you think this time may be different and we are probably to the going to have a crash. Or tell me why you might worry a little bit that things are getting a little -- going too far too high too fast.</p><p>CARON: Yes. Well, although the data is signaling good things in the economy, we do have to worry about valuations. Global equities have advanced very sharply in the last year, and U.S. equities are worth about $32 trillion. And to put that in perspective, the economy is only around about $19 trillion.</p><p>So, the stock market, which tends to eventually square up with the economy, looks relatively rich compared to the underlying economy.</p><p>So, if its exuberance gets to be too much, to use Alan Greenspan`s words, that eventually could end up forcing some kind of correction. So, we do need to be mindful of that.</p><p>HERERA: Where would you put money to work in this market given the level of valuing as that you just mentioned.</p><p>CARON: Well, we do like the United States from a global perspective. We think that ultimately the dollar begins to strengthen here somewhat particularly as the Fed begins to raise interest rates or continues to raise interest rates. We think that the sectors here in the United States, thing like consumer staples, health care -- staple -- sectors are places that have good balance sheets are places we want to focus because we are late in this cycle and we want to own companies that have very good balance sheets at this point, very consistent cash flows and we like those companies that raising their dividend consistently. So, those are the kind of things we are always looking for.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Kevin, thank you so much. You are a trooper. You are always the last one there.</p><p>MATHISEN: Yes, turn off the lights before you leave, Kevin.</p><p>HERERA: And it`s always on Friday night. But we thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>CARON: Thanks. Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN: That`s what founders do. They`re the last one.</p><p>HERERA: That`s what they do.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. As Bob reported a moment go, treasury yields are rising and there are no signs of them slowing down. Now, that means higher rates for those who want to borrow money. Not necessarily for those who want to deposit it. And the timing for the housing market and borrowers couldn`t be worse.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: There is still snow on the ground in much of the nation, but the spring housing market is right around the corner. And this year, it will be more competitive than ever. There`s already a supply crisis. Not enough homes for sale. And rising mortgage rates could make that even worse.</p><p>Rates were stuck near record lows for the bulk of last year but they are suddenly breaking out. The average rate on the 30-year fixed is up nearly a quarter point to 4.25 percent, thanks to the selloff in the bond market. Rates loosely follow the yields on the ten-year treasury.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, three bedrooms, right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>OLICK: Higher rates could keep potential move up sellers from listing their homes because they dent want to lose the rock bottom rate they locked in a couple of years ago. That reduces supply further. A rising rate environment could also cause more buyers especially those on the margins to jump in even faster now before rates rise even further and price them out.</p><p>JOHN BURNS, JOHN BURNS REAL ESTATE CONSULTING CEO: One of the things I think is going to happen, and my realtor friends tell me this too, is they are concern people are not going to sell their home and just stay in it. If there are fewer sellers are selling their home, there is going to be few homes on the market, and what does that do to home prices? They go up.</p><p>OLICK: And they`ve already been going up, accelerating their gains as demand rises and supply falls.</p><p>Higher interest rates usually cause home prices to cool off, because buyers have less purchasing power. But given how tight the market is nationwide, that is unlikely to happen this time around.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Switching gears now to a story that is also everywhere, the flu. The illness is widespread, stressing hospitals, impacting schools, some of which are closing and pressuring workplaces. One estimate puts the number of Americans sick at 11 million. And as we told you earlier, that could cost employers $9 billion in lost productivity.</p><p>Here to offer his comments on this flu season is Dr. William Schaffner. He is a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and one of the clearest spoken physicians I know.</p><p>Dr. Schaffner, welcome.</p><p>WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, M.D., VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE: Tyler, good to be with you.</p><p>MATHISEN: How worrisome at all are what we hear are episodic shortages of Tamiflu and other antivirals?</p><p>SCHAFFNER: Well, they are providing local difficulties, which we hope are temporary because the company is trying to get that Tamiflu out. These are what we call spot shortages. But with the rapid distribution that we now have in this country of pharmaceuticals that should be solved pretty quickly.</p><p>HERERA: How do you rate this flu season, Doctor? I mean, we are hearing it`s the worst in nine or 10 years. Do you agree with that? And what are you seeing on the frontlines?</p><p>SCHAFFNER: It looks pretty darn bad, Sue. There`s no doubt about it. We are seeing hospitalized cases in abundance in our neck of the woods. And in my colleagues` reports around the country, hospitals, doctors` offices, minute clinics, emergency departments, are all stretched in caring for patients at the present time. And we have got a pretty serious virus out there causing you it. It`s called H3N2. Makes you very sick.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, a lot of people, or I certainly have read that the vaccine that was administered through the fall and into the winter didn`t really target H3N2. And so, I wonder if a lot of people just say, hey, if they can`t pick which flu is going to come, why should I bother getting the vaccination?</p><p>SCHAFFNER: Well, let me provide some good news. H3N2 was indeed in the vaccine. We have a good match with what is circulating out there.</p><p>However, the vaccine never works as well as we would like against H3N2, and that`s what caused the distress. But remember, even if you get flu, despite the vaccine, you are less likely to have the severe complications of pneumonia, hospitalization and dying. I`ll take that any time.</p><p>HERERA: Anytime, yes.</p><p>Do you have a sense of where we are in terms of the cycle? Have we peaked, do you think? Is it going to be a longer flu season?</p><p>SCHAFFNER: We are still going up. So I don`t know that we`ve peaked yet. So, there is lots more flu to come I`m afraid.</p><p>MATHISEN: One very quick question. I was on an airplane flight earlier this week. I saw several people wearing surgical masks. Is that a good idea? Does it protect me at all?</p><p>SCHAFFNER: No evidence that it works conclusive and that`s why it`s not universally recommended.</p><p>MATHISEN: Dr. Schaffner, always great to hear from you. Dr. Schaffner is with Vanderbilt School of Medicine.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, as goes Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) so goes big tech. What to expect when the company reports earnings on Monday. But first, here`s a look at how the major indexes fared this week, all were higher.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, it was a rough week for General Electric (NYSE:GE) shareholders. You could say that again. The conglomerate, once the world`s most valuable company, stumbled for a fifth straight session, capping its biggest weekly percentage drop since the financial crisis. As we have reported, the Dow component announced a larger than expected impairment charge early in the week and the CEO suggested that he is considering a possible breakup of that once mighty company.</p><p>HERERA: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is raising the price of its prime monthly membership by nearly 20 percent. That fee is increasing to $12.99 a month from $10.99. The hike comes less than two years after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) introduced the monthly payment option as a way to attract new members. There is no price change if you pay annually. The price of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), like its monthly membership fee, rose in trading today.</p><p>MATHISEN: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares finished 2017 up more than 25 percent. The tear has continued into 2018. Since January 1, the stock has gained another 14 percent, easily outpacing the S&amp;P 500. And on Monday, shareholders will get a sense of whether the run can continue when the streaming video company reports its profits.</p><p>Julia Boorstin tells us what to expect.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: When Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reports earnings, it`s the company`s subscriber number that draws the most interest, the key indicator of just how fast the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is growing, with investors hoping that the company will top its own forecast of 6.3 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter, over 5 million of those from overseas.</p><p>BARTON CROCKETT, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS: We`ve thought that they would have peaked out in the United States a while ago. And they continue to grow faster than we would have anticipated. Internationally, it`s still very early days. So they are still many years from saturation internationally.</p><p>BOORSTIN: With Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares up about 60 percent in the past year and up about 10 percent since the company`s last earnings report, the pressure is on for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to keep up its growth. With analysts projecting revenue will grow by nearly one third from the prior year, while earnings are projected to grow by 175 percent over the same period.</p><p>On Netflix`s earnings call, investors and analysts will be looking for CEO Reed Hastings` guidance in what to expect in terms of growth, both in users and of margins in the year to come. And whether the company plans to invest even more in content than the up to $8 billion it already announced it will spend this year.</p><p>CROCKETT: What`s happening is their originals, the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) originals are what are now driving the growth in the service. And that is making it such that the competition that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is facing, the growing competition, isn`t really mattering.</p><p>BOORSTIN: And Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is facing more competition than ever as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to investment in content, amid reports that Jeff Bezos is focused on finding the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) equivalent of \"Game of Thrones\". And Disney (NYSE:DIS) is expected the ramp up investment in Hulu once it gains a majority stake through its Fox acquisition, raising the bar even higher for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Security company ADT has an alarming Wall Street debut and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Shares of ADT opened at $12.65 and fell from there, the lowest expected open in the $17 to $19 range.</p><p>But the company`s CEO wasn`t fazed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM WHALL, ADT CEO: We had a chance the meet all of the investors, all new for me. Grew up working with my parents, so the chance to actually represent ADT is a humbling opportunity. You know, performance always matters. So, you have to put a few quarters under our belt, I think the people will like what they see.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Shares of ADT dropped more than 11 percent on the day, finishing at $12.39.</p><p>Wedbush Securities raised its rating on Nike (NYSE:NKE) to outperform. And that was enough to kick the sneaker maker`s stock into high gear. Wedbush says Nike (NYSE:NKE) is set to grow North American sales as it debuts new products later year, including several that are set to echo the classic Nike (NYSE:NKE) styles of the past. Nike (NYSE:NKE) shares jumped almost 5 percent on the upgrade news to $67.21.</p><p>An experimental drug aimed at treating cancer of the bile duct achieved some promising results in Scotland. And that news helped drive up shares of drug maker Nucana. The drug is still in early phase testing. Nucana is a small cap stock. It rose $6, which is more than 41 percent to $21.20.</p><p>MATHISEN: Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU) posted fourth quarter profits to beat expectations. Revenue though came up a little bit short of estimates. The news did slow the railroad stocks run. It had been up as much as 6 percent since the start of the year. But today, shares down more than 1 percent at $110 on the bottom.</p><p>And Bunge, one of the world`s biggest traders of crops like soy beans and corn, reportedly being eyed by a takeover by Archer Daniels Midland. That`s according to \"The Wall Street Journal\". But \"The Journal\" says ADM might fine itself in a bidding war because Bunge was also approached by a mining conglomerate Glencore last May. Bunge shares were initially higher in after-hours trading. They ended the regular day up 11 percent to $77.56. ADM shares unchanged in the extended session following a percent gain today. Shares closed at $40.96.</p><p>HERERA: Tonight`s market monitor is betting on the power of smart technology. Last time he was on in August, he liked MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), which up is 15 percent. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), which is up 15 percent. And the IShares Core MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Emerging Markets ETF, which is up 15 percent.</p><p>Joining us is Ross Gerber. He is the president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki.</p><p>Welcome back. Nice to have you here, Ross.</p><p>ROSS GERBER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, GERBER KAWASAKI: Thanks. Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA: Let`s start first of all with your first pick which his Tesla. You think they have caught up with some of the issues that were plaguing the company for a while?</p><p>GERBER: Yes, Absolutely. They had to get the Model 3s out the door. I think they pretty much dealt with the battery issues that were preventing them from reaching their goals. And we are seeing the cars coming off.</p><p>But more importantly, the car is amazing and it`s probably the best automobile ever made that combines technology, smart technology like autonomous driving as well as it willing an electric car so it doesn`t use any gas. So, the cost of operation is very, very low relative to a gas car.</p><p>So we are very bullish on the future of Tesla?</p><p>MATHISEN: Your second pick is a small cap company called Control4. What do they do and why do you like it?</p><p>GERBER: Well, it`s also -- it`s a smart home product. In the higher end homes Control4 kind of dominates. So, it`s really just a combination of hardware and software in your home to run your entertainment systems, lighting, security, and everything else.</p><p>Control4 is a dominant player in the high end market and we think Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which has been focused on the lower end of the market will want to go up market and Control4 is the player.</p><p>HERERA: And you still hold MGM, which we mentioned is up considerably. You think it has more room to run.</p><p>GERBER: Absolutely. It just recently broke out from a $34 price range here. It`s moving higher now. But they`ve got so much going for them. And their play is online gambling for sports betting being approved by the Supreme Court this year and all the sports teams coming to Vegas driving new incremental revenue in Vegas for not only online but also off line betting on sports. But also, the second side is they are opening up another casino in Macau.</p><p>China is hot. It`s growing faster than what people realize. And Macau gaming company has been a wonderful source of income for them. And we expect that to continue.</p><p>HERERA: All right. On that note, thanks, Ross. Good to see you again.</p><p>GERBER: Good to see you, too. Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA: Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki.</p><p>And to read more about Ross`s stock picks, you can go to our Website, NBR.com.</p><p>MATHISEN: And coming up, why marijuana isn`t quite the cash crop some California business owners thought it would be.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Here`s a look at what to watch for next week. On Tuesday, a number of Dow components report their earnings, including J&amp;J, P&amp;G, Travelers and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Also on Tuesday, the World Economic Forum in Davos gets underway, bringing together business leaders and heads of state to discuss the global economy.</p><p>On Wednesday, we will find out if there was a rush to buy homes at the end of the year with the release of existing home sales. And that`s what to watch for next week.</p><p>MATHISEN: Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of President Trump`s inauguration. It`s been an eventful year in Washington and, of course, on Wall Street. During the past year, the S&amp;P 500 index has returned more than 25 percent and according to Market Watch, more than half of the index`s 500 stocks have seen gains of 20 percent or more.</p><p>HERERA: The fast growing marijuana industry is facing a growing number of challenges, even in states where recreational pot is legal. Take California for instance. Legalized creational marijuana went into effect at the start of the year. And many thought business would boom.</p><p>But as Aditi Roy reports, that`s not necessarily the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Ozzie Ozkay-Villa is a 34-year-old mom of two, lives s in upscale Marin, California, owns a business, and consumes marijuana-laced products almost every day.</p><p>OZZIE OZKAY-VILLA, MARIJUANA CONSUMER: When the kids are home and we`re having maybe a little bit of a rough patch, I might use a little bit just to ground myself and I just feel like I`m a much better parent.</p><p>ROY: She`s exactly the type of customer marijuana companies like Kiva Confections, which makes cannabis-laced chocolate are going after, especially now that California`s legal marijuana market is transitioning from medical to recreational, bringing in more potential customers and revenues.</p><p>KRISTI KNOBLICH PALMER, KIVA CONFECTIONS CO-FOUNDER: The opportunity in California is huge.</p><p>ROY: Kristi Knoblich Palmer is the cofounder of Kiva, a leading producer in marijuana edibles, a segment of the marijuana industry that seems to be exploding.</p><p>One new study by marijuana delivery start-up ease reports edibles are among the most appealing cannabis products to millennials. But sales of flowers or straight up marijuana went down 45 percent during the past year. Kiva is courting new users, or ones on the fence through low dosage products like their petra mints.</p><p>KNOBLICH PALMER: It focuses on micro dosing. So, allowing people to consume the minimum amount of cannabis while feeling the benefits without any of the negative effects. Those have been nicknamed mom mints by consumers because they`re perfect for who you just described, a working mom or dad.</p><p>OZKAY-VILLA: They are also very discrete. It`s not like I`m going to bathroom and pack a pipe.</p><p>ROY: But while demand for their products might be high, Kiva says it`s facing significant regulatory hurdle in capturing those sales. As a distributor, Kiva can only supply to other recreationally licensed companies. But many cities haven`t even started issuing recreational licenses, so Kiva is only supplying to around 100 dispensaries, versus the 1,100 normally an their roster when purely medicinal.</p><p>And to meet new packaging requirements, workers have to manually re-label products. The company has doubled its packaging staff and is paying for more hours and supplies. The company says new regulations and taxes have hiked their costs 45 percent. That means higher prices for their customers.</p><p>Still, Knoblich Palmer is hopeful that once they get over the shock of new regulations, the market opportunity will worth it.</p><p>KNOBLICH PALMER: People are excited about it and curious, and interested in the benefits of cannabis and how that might help them. So the opportunity here is huge.</p><p>ROY: Palmer says it could take up to a year before the company meets the challenges of the new regulations.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, Oakland, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And before we go, let`s take another look at the day and the week on Wall Street. Despite the 11th hour negotiations in Washington, to reach a budget deal, a deal that may or may not happen, stocks finished higher. The Dow rose 53 points to 26,071. Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500, well, they both finished at fresh records. And for the week, all of the major indexes were higher by about 1 percent.</p><p>HERERA: And who knows what will happen next week?</p><p>MATHISEN: Yes.</p><p>HERERA: Because this market is surprising almost everybody.</p><p>That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And thanks from me as well. I`m Tyler Mathisen. Have a great weekend, everyone.

Lawmakers  wrangle in Washington over a budget deal but investors aren't fazed,  sending stocks to new records.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Open house.  The housing  market is tight.  And the upcoming spring selling season could be more  competitive  than ever.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Market monitor.  Why our guest tonight says now the time to make  some smart investment in smart tech.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday,  January 19th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>We've seen this movie before.  Democrats and Republicans spar in the  Capitol over funding the government or partially shutting it down.  We've  come to that 11th hour again today, and even though the plot is familiar,  the drama is always captivating.  </p><p>Hours ahead of a midnight deadline, Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer,  met with the president at the White House.  The senator said progress was  made, but disagreements remain.  </p><p>Well, the drama in D.C. may have been captivating.  But on Wall Street, it  was naptivating. Investors mostly yawned and put on a drowsy smile.  The  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq hit new highs. The Dow was up, so were bond yields,  sending bond prices lower.  </p><p>Today, the Dow Jones lost 53 points to 26,071.  Nasdaq gained 40.  And the  S&amp;P 500 added 12.  </p><p>So, if a possible government shutdown wasn't top of mind for investors,  what the heck is?  </p><p>Bob Pisani takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stock rose fractionally  today.  The markets have already had a banner start to the year but many  are concern had the prospects of a government shutdown could derail the  rally.  </p><p>Well, maybe, but based on history, it's highly unlikely.  In last few  decades, stocks have barely budged in the days during a government  shutdown.  Beyond the shutdown, really, there is plenty of other forces  that are driving the markets and may be affecting the markets this week.  </p><p>Remember, we essentially went sideways.  A big concern for the market right  now is the bond market.  The ten-year treasury yield rose to a near three- year high and it doesn't seem to be a lot slowing it down.  If rates  continue to rise, that could be a major problem for stock market investors.  </p><p>Also, there's the energy market.  Crude oil prices are up 10 percent over  the last month, but this talk of oil beginning to up to out.  So, U.S. oil  output is expected to break through 10 million barrels per day and IEA said  it expects U.S. production to overtake both Russian and Saudi Arabian  production.  </p><p>That's good news but it's putting a lid on the gains this year.  Energy  stocks, which have had been moving up, were all down this week.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The overall impact of a shutdown on the market maybe minimal, but  sectors within the market respond differently, looking at data back to  1980.  On average, the energy sector is up 2 percent during a shutdown,  making it the best performing group.  On the flip side, the information  technology sector is the worst performing, falling nearly 2 percent.  </p><p>But big gains come after the government reopens because two weeks after the  government is back in business, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 have seen gains  averaging more than 3 percent, with the Dow trading positively 100 percent  of the time.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, despite the back and forth in Washington, money flowed  into the stock market at the fastest pace ever during the past four weeks.   According to the latest survey from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill  Lynch, mutual funds and ETFs that focus on equity saw $58 billion of fresh  money flowing in.  The survey sites investor fear of missing out, a  phenomenon we've reported on.  </p><p>New money didn't just go into exchange traded funds that passively track  the market but also into actively run funds which have seen outflows over  the past couple of years.  </p><p>HERERA:  Investor enthusiasm is indeed high.  But is it too high?  </p><p>And next week marks a big test for the market.  Earnings come out.  </p><p>Here to talk about what investors should be watching is Kevin Caron,  Washington Crossing Advisers co-founder and portfolio manager.  </p><p>Welcome back, Kevin.  Good to see you, as always.  </p><p>KEVIN CARON, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WASHINGTON CROSSING ADVISORS:  It's good to  be here.  Good to be here.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, the issues that may be affecting the market, Bob Pisani  mentioned one, and that is rising bond yields.  But they are rising from  historical low levels.  Are you worried about the increase in interest  rates?  </p><p>CARON:  We are matching it, but we are not particularly worried it because  if you look at where it's coming from, it's coming from a much better  economy.  We are seeing investment spending picking up very strongly.  And  this is a big thing because for four years before this, before let's say  the middle part of 2017, investment spending was really quite weak and the  economy was weak.  </p><p>We are seeing that pick up.  That's actually good for growth.  And the  reason that the rates are rising is because we are seeing firmer prices.  </p><p>This is something that the Fed has been looking to achieve for a long time.   And now, we are getting inflation back up to about 2 percent.  So,  everything looks fairly good.  And bond yields have been very low for a  long time.  So, we just see this as a readjustment of those yields to place  where is they maybe should have been all along.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, Kevin, I want to talk about something else, and that  is the passage of the tax bill, the biggest tax bill since 1986.  We all  remember what happened then a year later in 1987.  There was a big crash.   Tell me why you think this time may be different and we are probably to the  going to have a crash.  Or tell me why you might worry a little bit that  things are getting a little -- going too far too high too fast.  </p><p>CARON:  Yes.  Well, although the data is signaling good things in the  economy, we do have to worry about valuations.  Global equities have  advanced very sharply in the last year, and U.S. equities are worth about  $32 trillion.  And to put that in perspective, the economy is only around  about $19 trillion.  </p><p>So, the stock market, which tends to eventually square up with the economy,  looks relatively rich compared to the underlying economy.  </p><p>So, if its exuberance gets to be too much, to use Alan Greenspan's words,  that eventually could end up forcing some kind of correction.  So, we do  need to be mindful of that.  </p><p>HERERA:  Where would you put money to work in this market given the level  of valuing as that you just mentioned.  </p><p>CARON:  Well, we do like the United States from a global perspective.  We  think that ultimately the dollar begins to strengthen here somewhat  particularly as the Fed begins to raise interest rates or continues to  raise interest rates.  We think that the sectors here in the United States,  thing like consumer staples, health care -- staple -- sectors are places  that have good balance sheets are places we want to focus because we are  late in this cycle and we want to own companies that have very good balance  sheets at this point, very consistent cash flows and we like those  companies that raising their dividend consistently.  So, those are the kind  of things we are always looking for.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Kevin, thank you so much.  You are a trooper.  You are  always the last one there.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Yes, turn off the lights before you leave, Kevin.  </p><p>HERERA:  And it's always on Friday night.  But we thank you very much.   Appreciate it.</p><p>CARON:  Thanks.  Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN:  That's what founders do.  They're the last one.</p><p>HERERA:  That's what they do.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  As Bob reported a moment go, treasury yields are  rising and there are no signs of them slowing down.  Now, that means higher  rates for those who want to borrow money.  Not necessarily for those who  want to deposit it.  And the timing for the housing market and borrowers  couldn't be worse.  </p><p>Diana Olick explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  There is still snow on  the ground in much of the nation, but the spring housing market is right  around the corner.  And this year, it will be more competitive than ever.   There's already a supply crisis.  Not enough homes for sale.  And rising  mortgage rates could make that even worse.  </p><p>Rates were stuck near record lows for the bulk of last year but they are  suddenly breaking out.  The average rate on the 30-year fixed is up nearly  a quarter point to 4.25 percent, thanks to the selloff in the bond market.   Rates loosely follow the yields on the ten-year treasury.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, three bedrooms, right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  </p><p>OLICK:  Higher rates could keep potential move up sellers from listing  their homes because they dent want to lose the rock bottom rate they locked  in a couple of years ago.  That reduces supply further.  A rising rate  environment could also cause more buyers especially those on the margins to  jump in even faster now before rates rise even further and price them out.  </p><p>JOHN BURNS, JOHN BURNS REAL ESTATE CONSULTING CEO:  One of the things I  think is going to happen, and my realtor friends tell me this too, is they  are concern people are not going to sell their home and just stay in it.   If there are fewer sellers are selling their home, there is going to be few  homes on the market, and what does that do to home prices?  They go up.  </p><p>OLICK:  And they've already been going up, accelerating their gains as  demand rises and supply falls.  </p><p>Higher interest rates usually cause home prices to cool off, because buyers  have less purchasing power.  But given how tight the market is nationwide,  that is unlikely to happen this time around.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Switching gears now to a story that is also everywhere, the flu.   The illness is widespread, stressing hospitals, impacting schools, some of  which are closing and pressuring workplaces.  One estimate puts the number  of Americans sick at 11 million.  And as we told you earlier, that could  cost employers $9 billion in lost productivity.  </p><p>Here to offer his comments on this flu season is Dr. William Schaffner.  He  is a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and  one of the clearest spoken physicians I know.  </p><p>Dr. Schaffner, welcome.  </p><p>WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, M.D., VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE:   Tyler, good to be with you.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  How worrisome at all are what we hear are episodic shortages of  Tamiflu and other antivirals?  </p><p>SCHAFFNER:  Well, they are providing local difficulties, which we hope are  temporary because the company is trying to get that Tamiflu out.  These are  what we call spot shortages.  But with the rapid distribution that we now  have in this country of pharmaceuticals that should be solved pretty  quickly.  </p><p>HERERA:  How do you rate this flu season, Doctor?  I mean, we are hearing  it's the worst in nine or 10 years.  Do you agree with that?  And what are  you seeing on the frontlines?</p><p>SCHAFFNER:  It looks pretty darn bad, Sue.  There's no doubt about it.  We  are seeing hospitalized cases in abundance in our neck of the woods.  And  in my colleagues' reports around the country, hospitals, doctors' offices,  minute clinics, emergency departments, are all stretched in caring for  patients at the present time.  And we have got a pretty serious virus out  there causing you it.  It's called H3N2.  Makes you very sick.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, a lot of people, or I certainly have read that the vaccine  that was administered through the fall and into the winter didn't really  target H3N2.  And so, I wonder if a lot of people just say, hey, if they  can't pick which flu is going to come, why should I bother getting the  vaccination?  </p><p>SCHAFFNER:  Well, let me provide some good news.  H3N2 was indeed in the  vaccine.  We have a good match with what is circulating out there.  </p><p>However, the vaccine never works as well as we would like against H3N2, and  that's what caused the distress.  But remember, even if you get flu,  despite the vaccine, you are less likely to have the severe complications  of pneumonia, hospitalization and dying.  I'll take that any time.  </p><p>HERERA:  Anytime, yes.  </p><p>Do you have a sense of where we are in terms of the cycle?  Have we peaked,  do you think?  Is it going to be a longer flu season?  </p><p>SCHAFFNER:  We are still going up.  So I don't know that we've peaked yet.   So, there is lots more flu to come I'm afraid.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  One very quick question.  I was on an airplane flight earlier  this week.  I saw several people wearing surgical masks.  Is that a good  idea?  Does it protect me at all?  </p><p>SCHAFFNER:  No evidence that it works conclusive and that's why it's not  universally recommended.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Dr. Schaffner, always great to hear from you.  Dr. Schaffner is  with Vanderbilt School of Medicine.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, as goes Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) so goes big tech.  What  to expect when the company reports earnings on Monday.  But first, here's a  look at how the major indexes fared this week, all were higher.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, it was a rough week for General Electric (NYSE:GE)  shareholders.  You could say that again.  The conglomerate, once the  world's most valuable company, stumbled for a fifth straight session,  capping its biggest weekly percentage drop since the financial crisis.  As  we have reported, the Dow component announced a larger than expected  impairment charge early in the week and the CEO suggested that he is  considering a possible breakup of that once mighty company.  </p><p>HERERA:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is raising the price of its prime monthly  membership by nearly 20 percent.  That fee is increasing to $12.99 a month  from $10.99.  The hike comes less than two years after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  introduced the monthly payment option as a way to attract new members.   There is no price change if you pay annually.  The price of Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN), like its monthly membership fee, rose in trading today.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares finished 2017 up more than 25  percent.  The tear has continued into 2018.  Since January 1, the stock has  gained another 14 percent, easily outpacing the S&amp;P 500.  And on Monday,  shareholders will get a sense of whether the run can continue when the  streaming video company reports its profits.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin tells us what to expect.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  When Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) reports earnings, it's the company's subscriber number that  draws the most interest, the key indicator of just how fast the Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) is growing, with investors hoping that the company will top  its own forecast of 6.3 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter, over  5 million of those from overseas.  </p><p>BARTON CROCKETT, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS:  We've thought that they would have  peaked out in the United States a while ago.  And they continue to grow  faster than we would have anticipated.  Internationally, it's still very  early days.  So they are still many years from saturation internationally.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  With Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares up about 60 percent in the  past year and up about 10 percent since the company's last earnings report,  the pressure is on for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to keep up its growth.  With  analysts projecting revenue will grow by nearly one third from the prior  year, while earnings are projected to grow by 175 percent over the same  period.  </p><p>On Netflix's earnings call, investors and analysts will be looking for CEO  Reed Hastings' guidance in what to expect in terms of growth, both in users  and of margins in the year to come.  And whether the company plans to  invest even more in content than the up to $8 billion it already announced  it will spend this year.  </p><p>CROCKETT:  What's happening is their originals, the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  originals are what are now driving the growth in the service.  And that is  making it such that the competition that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is facing,  the growing competition, isn't really mattering.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  And Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is facing more competition than ever  as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to investment in content, amid reports  that Jeff Bezos is focused on finding the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) equivalent  of \"Game of Thrones\".  And Disney (NYSE:DIS) is expected the ramp up  investment in Hulu once it gains a majority stake through its Fox  acquisition, raising the bar even higher for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Security company ADT has an alarming Wall Street debut and that's  where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>Shares of ADT opened at $12.65 and fell from there, the lowest expected  open in the $17 to $19 range.</p><p>But the company's CEO wasn't fazed.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM WHALL, ADT CEO:  We had a chance the meet all of the investors, all new  for me.  Grew up working with my parents, so the chance to actually  represent ADT is a humbling opportunity.  You know, performance always  matters.  So, you have to put a few quarters under our belt, I think the  people will like what they see.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  Shares of ADT dropped more than 11 percent on the day, finishing  at $12.39.  </p><p>Wedbush Securities raised its rating on Nike (NYSE:NKE) to outperform.  And  that was enough to kick the sneaker maker's stock into high gear.  Wedbush  says Nike (NYSE:NKE) is set to grow North American sales as it debuts new  products later year, including several that are set to echo the classic  Nike (NYSE:NKE) styles of the past.  Nike (NYSE:NKE) shares jumped almost 5  percent on the upgrade news to $67.21.  </p><p>An experimental drug aimed at treating cancer of the bile duct achieved  some promising results in Scotland.  And that news helped drive up shares  of drug maker Nucana.  The drug is still in early phase testing.  Nucana is  a small cap stock.  It rose $6, which is more than 41 percent to $21.20.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU) posted fourth quarter  profits to beat expectations.  Revenue though came up a little bit short of  estimates.  The news did slow the railroad stocks run.  It had been up as  much as 6 percent since the start of the year.  But today, shares down more  than 1 percent at $110 on the bottom.  </p><p>And Bunge, one of the world's biggest traders of crops like soy beans and  corn, reportedly being eyed by a takeover by Archer Daniels Midland.   That's according to \"The Wall Street Journal\".  But \"The Journal\" says ADM  might fine itself in a bidding war because Bunge was also approached by a  mining conglomerate Glencore last May.  Bunge shares were initially higher  in after-hours trading.  They ended the regular day up 11 percent to  $77.56.  ADM shares unchanged in the extended session following a percent  gain today.  Shares closed at $40.96.  </p><p>HERERA: Tonight's market monitor is betting on the power of smart  technology.  Last time he was on in August, he liked MGM Resorts  (NYSE:MGM), which up is 15 percent.  Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI),  which is up 15 percent.  And the IShares Core MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Emerging  Markets ETF, which is up 15 percent.  </p><p>Joining us is Ross Gerber.  He is the president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki.  </p><p>Welcome back.  Nice to have you here, Ross.</p><p>ROSS GERBER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, GERBER KAWASAKI:  Thanks.  Thanks for  having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  Let's start first of all with your first pick which his Tesla.   You think they have caught up with some of the issues that were plaguing  the company for a while?  </p><p>GERBER:  Yes, Absolutely.  They had to get the Model 3s out the door.  I  think they pretty much dealt with the battery issues that were preventing  them from reaching their goals.  And we are seeing the cars coming off.  </p><p>But more importantly, the car is amazing and it's probably the best  automobile ever made that combines technology, smart technology like  autonomous driving as well as it willing an electric car so it doesn't use  any gas.  So, the cost of operation is very, very low relative to a gas  car.  </p><p>So we are very bullish on the future of Tesla?  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Your second pick is a small cap company called Control4.  What  do they do and why do you like it?</p><p>GERBER:  Well, it's also -- it's a smart home product.  In the higher end  homes Control4 kind of dominates.  So, it's really just a combination of  hardware and software in your home to run your entertainment systems,  lighting, security, and everything else.  </p><p>Control4 is a dominant player in the high end market and we think Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which has been focused on the lower  end of the market will want to go up market and Control4 is the player.  </p><p>HERERA:  And you still hold MGM, which we mentioned is up considerably.   You think it has more room to run.  </p><p>GERBER:  Absolutely.  It just recently broke out from a $34 price range  here.  It's moving higher now.  But they've got so much going for them.   And their play is online gambling for sports betting being approved by the  Supreme Court this year and all the sports teams coming to Vegas driving  new incremental revenue in Vegas for not only online but also off line  betting on sports.  But also, the second side is they are opening up  another casino in Macau.  </p><p>China is hot.  It's growing faster than what people realize.  And Macau  gaming company has been a wonderful source of income for them.  And we  expect that to continue.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that note, thanks, Ross.  Good to see you again.  </p><p>GERBER:  Good to see you, too.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki.  </p><p>And to read more about Ross's stock picks, you can go to our Website,  NBR.com.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And coming up, why marijuana isn't quite the cash crop some  California business owners thought it would be.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Here's a look at what to watch for next week.  On Tuesday, a  number of Dow components report their earnings, including J&amp;J, P&amp;G,  Travelers and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).  Also on Tuesday, the World Economic Forum  in Davos gets underway, bringing together business leaders and heads of  state to discuss the global economy.  </p><p>On Wednesday, we will find out if there was a rush to buy homes at the end  of the year with the release of existing home sales.  And that's what to  watch for next week.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of President Trump's  inauguration.  It's been an eventful year in Washington and, of course, on  Wall Street.  During the past year, the S&amp;P 500 index has returned more  than 25 percent and according to Market Watch, more than half of the  index's 500 stocks have seen gains of 20 percent or more.  </p><p>HERERA:  The fast growing marijuana industry is facing a growing number of  challenges, even in states where recreational pot is legal.  Take  California for instance.  Legalized creational marijuana went into effect  at the start of the year.  And many thought business would boom.  </p><p>But as Aditi Roy reports, that's not necessarily the case.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Ozzie Ozkay-Villa is a  34-year-old mom of two, lives s in upscale Marin, California, owns a  business, and consumes marijuana-laced products almost every day.  </p><p>OZZIE OZKAY-VILLA, MARIJUANA CONSUMER:  When the kids are home and we're  having maybe a little bit of a rough patch, I might use a little bit just  to ground myself and I just feel like I'm a much better parent.  </p><p>ROY:  She's exactly the type of customer marijuana companies like Kiva  Confections, which makes cannabis-laced chocolate are going after,  especially now that California's legal marijuana market is transitioning  from medical to recreational, bringing in more potential customers and  revenues.  </p><p>KRISTI KNOBLICH PALMER, KIVA CONFECTIONS CO-FOUNDER:  The opportunity in  California is huge.  </p><p>ROY:  Kristi Knoblich Palmer is the cofounder of Kiva, a leading producer  in marijuana edibles, a segment of the marijuana industry that seems to be  exploding.  </p><p>One new study by marijuana delivery start-up ease reports edibles are among  the most appealing cannabis products to millennials.  But sales of flowers  or straight up marijuana went down 45 percent during the past year.  Kiva  is courting new users, or ones on the fence through low dosage products  like their petra mints.  </p><p>KNOBLICH PALMER:  It focuses on micro dosing.  So, allowing people to  consume the minimum amount of cannabis while feeling the benefits without  any of the negative effects.  Those have been nicknamed mom mints by  consumers because they're perfect for who you just described, a working mom  or dad.  </p><p>OZKAY-VILLA:  They are also very discrete.  It's not like I'm going to  bathroom and pack a pipe.  </p><p>ROY:  But while demand for their products might be high, Kiva says it's  facing significant regulatory hurdle in capturing those sales.  As a  distributor, Kiva can only supply to other recreationally licensed  companies.  But many cities haven't even started issuing recreational  licenses, so Kiva is only supplying to around 100 dispensaries, versus the  1,100 normally an their roster when purely medicinal.  </p><p>And to meet new packaging requirements, workers have to manually re-label  products.  The company has doubled its packaging staff and is paying for  more hours and supplies.  The company says new regulations and taxes have  hiked their costs 45 percent.  That means higher prices for their  customers.  </p><p>Still, Knoblich Palmer is hopeful that once they get over the shock of new  regulations, the market opportunity will worth it.  </p><p>KNOBLICH PALMER:  People are excited about it and curious, and interested  in the benefits of cannabis and how that might help them.  So the  opportunity here is huge.  </p><p>ROY:  Palmer says it could take up to a year before the company meets the  challenges of the new regulations.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, Oakland, California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And before we go, let's take another look at the day and the  week on Wall Street.  Despite the 11th hour negotiations in Washington, to  reach a budget deal, a deal that may or may not happen, stocks finished  higher.  The Dow rose 53 points to 26,071.  Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500, well, they  both finished at fresh records.  And for the week, all of the major indexes  were higher by about 1 percent.  </p><p>HERERA:  And who knows what will happen next week?  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Yes.</p><p>HERERA:  Because this market is surprising almost everybody.  </p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for  joining us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  weekend, everyone.

Lawmakers  wrangle in Washington over a budget deal but investors aren't fazed,  sending stocks to new records.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Open house.  The housing  market is tight.  And the upcoming spring selling season could be more  competitive  than ever.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  Market monitor.  Why our guest tonight says now the time to make  some smart investment in smart tech.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday,  January 19th.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> We've seen this movie before.  Democrats and Republicans spar in the  Capitol over funding the government or partially shutting it down.  We've  come to that 11th hour again today, and even though the plot is familiar,  the drama is always captivating.  </p><p> Hours ahead of a midnight deadline, Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer,  met with the president at the White House.  The senator said progress was  made, but disagreements remain.  </p><p> Well, the drama in D.C. may have been captivating.  But on Wall Street, it  was naptivating. Investors mostly yawned and put on a drowsy smile.  The  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq hit new highs. The Dow was up, so were bond yields,  sending bond prices lower.  </p><p> Today, the Dow Jones lost 53 points to 26,071.  Nasdaq gained 40.  And the  S&amp;P 500 added 12.  </p><p> So, if a possible government shutdown wasn't top of mind for investors,  what the heck is?  </p><p> Bob Pisani takes a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stock rose fractionally  today.  The markets have already had a banner start to the year but many  are concern had the prospects of a government shutdown could derail the  rally.  </p><p> Well, maybe, but based on history, it's highly unlikely.  In last few  decades, stocks have barely budged in the days during a government  shutdown.  Beyond the shutdown, really, there is plenty of other forces  that are driving the markets and may be affecting the markets this week.  </p><p> Remember, we essentially went sideways.  A big concern for the market right  now is the bond market.  The ten-year treasury yield rose to a near three- year high and it doesn't seem to be a lot slowing it down.  If rates  continue to rise, that could be a major problem for stock market investors.  </p><p> Also, there's the energy market.  Crude oil prices are up 10 percent over  the last month, but this talk of oil beginning to up to out.  So, U.S. oil  output is expected to break through 10 million barrels per day and IEA said  it expects U.S. production to overtake both Russian and Saudi Arabian  production.  </p><p> That's good news but it's putting a lid on the gains this year.  Energy  stocks, which have had been moving up, were all down this week.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  The overall impact of a shutdown on the market maybe minimal, but  sectors within the market respond differently, looking at data back to  1980.  On average, the energy sector is up 2 percent during a shutdown,  making it the best performing group.  On the flip side, the information  technology sector is the worst performing, falling nearly 2 percent.  </p><p> But big gains come after the government reopens because two weeks after the  government is back in business, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 have seen gains  averaging more than 3 percent, with the Dow trading positively 100 percent  of the time.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, despite the back and forth in Washington, money flowed  into the stock market at the fastest pace ever during the past four weeks.   According to the latest survey from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill  Lynch, mutual funds and ETFs that focus on equity saw $58 billion of fresh  money flowing in.  The survey sites investor fear of missing out, a  phenomenon we've reported on.  </p><p> New money didn't just go into exchange traded funds that passively track  the market but also into actively run funds which have seen outflows over  the past couple of years.  </p><p> HERERA:  Investor enthusiasm is indeed high.  But is it too high?  </p><p> And next week marks a big test for the market.  Earnings come out.  </p><p> Here to talk about what investors should be watching is Kevin Caron,  Washington Crossing Advisers co-founder and portfolio manager.  </p><p> Welcome back, Kevin.  Good to see you, as always.  </p><p> KEVIN CARON, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WASHINGTON CROSSING ADVISORS:  It's good to  be here.  Good to be here.  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, the issues that may be affecting the market, Bob Pisani  mentioned one, and that is rising bond yields.  But they are rising from  historical low levels.  Are you worried about the increase in interest  rates?  </p><p> CARON:  We are matching it, but we are not particularly worried it because  if you look at where it's coming from, it's coming from a much better  economy.  We are seeing investment spending picking up very strongly.  And  this is a big thing because for four years before this, before let's say  the middle part of 2017, investment spending was really quite weak and the  economy was weak.  </p><p> We are seeing that pick up.  That's actually good for growth.  And the  reason that the rates are rising is because we are seeing firmer prices.  </p><p> This is something that the Fed has been looking to achieve for a long time.   And now, we are getting inflation back up to about 2 percent.  So,  everything looks fairly good.  And bond yields have been very low for a  long time.  So, we just see this as a readjustment of those yields to place  where is they maybe should have been all along.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  You know, Kevin, I want to talk about something else, and that  is the passage of the tax bill, the biggest tax bill since 1986.  We all  remember what happened then a year later in 1987.  There was a big crash.   Tell me why you think this time may be different and we are probably to the  going to have a crash.  Or tell me why you might worry a little bit that  things are getting a little -- going too far too high too fast.  </p><p> CARON:  Yes.  Well, although the data is signaling good things in the  economy, we do have to worry about valuations.  Global equities have  advanced very sharply in the last year, and U.S. equities are worth about  $32 trillion.  And to put that in perspective, the economy is only around  about $19 trillion.  </p><p> So, the stock market, which tends to eventually square up with the economy,  looks relatively rich compared to the underlying economy.  </p><p> So, if its exuberance gets to be too much, to use Alan Greenspan's words,  that eventually could end up forcing some kind of correction.  So, we do  need to be mindful of that.  </p><p> HERERA:  Where would you put money to work in this market given the level  of valuing as that you just mentioned.  </p><p> CARON:  Well, we do like the United States from a global perspective.  We  think that ultimately the dollar begins to strengthen here somewhat  particularly as the Fed begins to raise interest rates or continues to  raise interest rates.  We think that the sectors here in the United States,  thing like consumer staples, health care -- staple -- sectors are places  that have good balance sheets are places we want to focus because we are  late in this cycle and we want to own companies that have very good balance  sheets at this point, very consistent cash flows and we like those  companies that raising their dividend consistently.  So, those are the kind  of things we are always looking for.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  Kevin, thank you so much.  You are a trooper.  You are  always the last one there.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Yes, turn off the lights before you leave, Kevin.  </p><p> HERERA:  And it's always on Friday night.  But we thank you very much.   Appreciate it.</p><p> CARON:  Thanks.  Thank you.</p><p> MATHISEN:  That's what founders do.  They're the last one.</p><p> HERERA:  That's what they do.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right.  As Bob reported a moment go, treasury yields are  rising and there are no signs of them slowing down.  Now, that means higher  rates for those who want to borrow money.  Not necessarily for those who  want to deposit it.  And the timing for the housing market and borrowers  couldn't be worse.  </p><p> Diana Olick explains.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  There is still snow on  the ground in much of the nation, but the spring housing market is right  around the corner.  And this year, it will be more competitive than ever.   There's already a supply crisis.  Not enough homes for sale.  And rising  mortgage rates could make that even worse.  </p><p> Rates were stuck near record lows for the bulk of last year but they are  suddenly breaking out.  The average rate on the 30-year fixed is up nearly  a quarter point to 4.25 percent, thanks to the selloff in the bond market.   Rates loosely follow the yields on the ten-year treasury.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, three bedrooms, right?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  </p><p> OLICK:  Higher rates could keep potential move up sellers from listing  their homes because they dent want to lose the rock bottom rate they locked  in a couple of years ago.  That reduces supply further.  A rising rate  environment could also cause more buyers especially those on the margins to  jump in even faster now before rates rise even further and price them out.  </p><p> JOHN BURNS, JOHN BURNS REAL ESTATE CONSULTING CEO:  One of the things I  think is going to happen, and my realtor friends tell me this too, is they  are concern people are not going to sell their home and just stay in it.   If there are fewer sellers are selling their home, there is going to be few  homes on the market, and what does that do to home prices?  They go up.  </p><p> OLICK:  And they've already been going up, accelerating their gains as  demand rises and supply falls.  </p><p> Higher interest rates usually cause home prices to cool off, because buyers  have less purchasing power.  But given how tight the market is nationwide,  that is unlikely to happen this time around.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Switching gears now to a story that is also everywhere, the flu.   The illness is widespread, stressing hospitals, impacting schools, some of  which are closing and pressuring workplaces.  One estimate puts the number  of Americans sick at 11 million.  And as we told you earlier, that could  cost employers $9 billion in lost productivity.  </p><p> Here to offer his comments on this flu season is Dr. William Schaffner.  He  is a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and  one of the clearest spoken physicians I know.  </p><p> Dr. Schaffner, welcome.  </p><p> WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, M.D., VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE:   Tyler, good to be with you.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  How worrisome at all are what we hear are episodic shortages of  Tamiflu and other antivirals?  </p><p> SCHAFFNER:  Well, they are providing local difficulties, which we hope are  temporary because the company is trying to get that Tamiflu out.  These are  what we call spot shortages.  But with the rapid distribution that we now  have in this country of pharmaceuticals that should be solved pretty  quickly.  </p><p> HERERA:  How do you rate this flu season, Doctor?  I mean, we are hearing  it's the worst in nine or 10 years.  Do you agree with that?  And what are  you seeing on the frontlines?</p><p> SCHAFFNER:  It looks pretty darn bad, Sue.  There's no doubt about it.  We  are seeing hospitalized cases in abundance in our neck of the woods.  And  in my colleagues' reports around the country, hospitals, doctors' offices,  minute clinics, emergency departments, are all stretched in caring for  patients at the present time.  And we have got a pretty serious virus out  there causing you it.  It's called H3N2.  Makes you very sick.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  So, a lot of people, or I certainly have read that the vaccine  that was administered through the fall and into the winter didn't really  target H3N2.  And so, I wonder if a lot of people just say, hey, if they  can't pick which flu is going to come, why should I bother getting the  vaccination?  </p><p> SCHAFFNER:  Well, let me provide some good news.  H3N2 was indeed in the  vaccine.  We have a good match with what is circulating out there.  </p><p> However, the vaccine never works as well as we would like against H3N2, and  that's what caused the distress.  But remember, even if you get flu,  despite the vaccine, you are less likely to have the severe complications  of pneumonia, hospitalization and dying.  I'll take that any time.  </p><p> HERERA:  Anytime, yes.  </p><p> Do you have a sense of where we are in terms of the cycle?  Have we peaked,  do you think?  Is it going to be a longer flu season?  </p><p> SCHAFFNER:  We are still going up.  So I don't know that we've peaked yet.   So, there is lots more flu to come I'm afraid.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  One very quick question.  I was on an airplane flight earlier  this week.  I saw several people wearing surgical masks.  Is that a good  idea?  Does it protect me at all?  </p><p> SCHAFFNER:  No evidence that it works conclusive and that's why it's not  universally recommended.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Dr. Schaffner, always great to hear from you.  Dr. Schaffner is  with Vanderbilt School of Medicine.  </p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, as goes Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) so goes big tech.  What  to expect when the company reports earnings on Monday.  But first, here's a  look at how the major indexes fared this week, all were higher.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, it was a rough week for General Electric (NYSE:GE)  shareholders.  You could say that again.  The conglomerate, once the  world's most valuable company, stumbled for a fifth straight session,  capping its biggest weekly percentage drop since the financial crisis.  As  we have reported, the Dow component announced a larger than expected  impairment charge early in the week and the CEO suggested that he is  considering a possible breakup of that once mighty company.  </p><p> HERERA:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is raising the price of its prime monthly  membership by nearly 20 percent.  That fee is increasing to $12.99 a month  from $10.99.  The hike comes less than two years after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  introduced the monthly payment option as a way to attract new members.   There is no price change if you pay annually.  The price of Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN), like its monthly membership fee, rose in trading today.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares finished 2017 up more than 25  percent.  The tear has continued into 2018.  Since January 1, the stock has  gained another 14 percent, easily outpacing the S&amp;P 500.  And on Monday,  shareholders will get a sense of whether the run can continue when the  streaming video company reports its profits.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin tells us what to expect.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  When Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) reports earnings, it's the company's subscriber number that  draws the most interest, the key indicator of just how fast the Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) is growing, with investors hoping that the company will top  its own forecast of 6.3 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter, over  5 million of those from overseas.  </p><p> BARTON CROCKETT, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS:  We've thought that they would have  peaked out in the United States a while ago.  And they continue to grow  faster than we would have anticipated.  Internationally, it's still very  early days.  So they are still many years from saturation internationally.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  With Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares up about 60 percent in the  past year and up about 10 percent since the company's last earnings report,  the pressure is on for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to keep up its growth.  With  analysts projecting revenue will grow by nearly one third from the prior  year, while earnings are projected to grow by 175 percent over the same  period.  </p><p>On Netflix's earnings call, investors and analysts will be looking for CEO  Reed Hastings' guidance in what to expect in terms of growth, both in users  and of margins in the year to come.  And whether the company plans to  invest even more in content than the up to $8 billion it already announced  it will spend this year.  </p><p> CROCKETT:  What's happening is their originals, the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  originals are what are now driving the growth in the service.  And that is  making it such that the competition that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is facing,  the growing competition, isn't really mattering.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  And Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is facing more competition than ever  as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to investment in content, amid reports  that Jeff Bezos is focused on finding the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) equivalent  of \"Game of Thrones\".  And Disney (NYSE:DIS) is expected the ramp up  investment in Hulu once it gains a majority stake through its Fox  acquisition, raising the bar even higher for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Security company ADT has an alarming Wall Street debut and that's  where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> Shares of ADT opened at $12.65 and fell from there, the lowest expected  open in the $17 to $19 range.</p><p> But the company's CEO wasn't fazed.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM WHALL, ADT CEO:  We had a chance the meet all of the investors, all new  for me.  Grew up working with my parents, so the chance to actually  represent ADT is a humbling opportunity.  You know, performance always  matters.  So, you have to put a few quarters under our belt, I think the  people will like what they see.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  Shares of ADT dropped more than 11 percent on the day, finishing  at $12.39.  </p><p> Wedbush Securities raised its rating on Nike (NYSE:NKE) to outperform.  And  that was enough to kick the sneaker maker's stock into high gear.  Wedbush  says Nike (NYSE:NKE) is set to grow North American sales as it debuts new  products later year, including several that are set to echo the classic  Nike (NYSE:NKE) styles of the past.  Nike (NYSE:NKE) shares jumped almost 5  percent on the upgrade news to $67.21.  </p><p> An experimental drug aimed at treating cancer of the bile duct achieved  some promising results in Scotland.  And that news helped drive up shares  of drug maker Nucana.  The drug is still in early phase testing.  Nucana is  a small cap stock.  It rose $6, which is more than 41 percent to $21.20.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU) posted fourth quarter  profits to beat expectations.  Revenue though came up a little bit short of  estimates.  The news did slow the railroad stocks run.  It had been up as  much as 6 percent since the start of the year.  But today, shares down more  than 1 percent at $110 on the bottom.  </p><p> And Bunge, one of the world's biggest traders of crops like soy beans and  corn, reportedly being eyed by a takeover by Archer Daniels Midland.   That's according to \"The Wall Street Journal\".  But \"The Journal\" says ADM  might fine itself in a bidding war because Bunge was also approached by a  mining conglomerate Glencore last May.  Bunge shares were initially higher  in after-hours trading.  They ended the regular day up 11 percent to  $77.56.  ADM shares unchanged in the extended session following a percent  gain today.  Shares closed at $40.96.  </p><p> HERERA: Tonight's market monitor is betting on the power of smart  technology.  Last time he was on in August, he liked MGM Resorts  (NYSE:MGM), which up is 15 percent.  Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI),  which is up 15 percent.  And the IShares Core MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Emerging  Markets ETF, which is up 15 percent.  </p><p> Joining us is Ross Gerber.  He is the president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki.  </p><p> Welcome back.  Nice to have you here, Ross.</p><p> ROSS GERBER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, GERBER KAWASAKI:  Thanks.  Thanks for  having me.  </p><p> HERERA:  Let's start first of all with your first pick which his Tesla.   You think they have caught up with some of the issues that were plaguing  the company for a while?  </p><p>GERBER:  Yes, Absolutely.  They had to get the Model 3s out the door.  I  think they pretty much dealt with the battery issues that were preventing  them from reaching their goals.  And we are seeing the cars coming off.  </p><p> But more importantly, the car is amazing and it's probably the best  automobile ever made that combines technology, smart technology like  autonomous driving as well as it willing an electric car so it doesn't use  any gas.  So, the cost of operation is very, very low relative to a gas  car.  </p><p> So we are very bullish on the future of Tesla?  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Your second pick is a small cap company called Control4.  What  do they do and why do you like it?</p><p>GERBER:  Well, it's also -- it's a smart home product.  In the higher end  homes Control4 kind of dominates.  So, it's really just a combination of  hardware and software in your home to run your entertainment systems,  lighting, security, and everything else.  </p><p> Control4 is a dominant player in the high end market and we think Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which has been focused on the lower  end of the market will want to go up market and Control4 is the player.  </p><p> HERERA:  And you still hold MGM, which we mentioned is up considerably.   You think it has more room to run.  </p><p>GERBER:  Absolutely.  It just recently broke out from a $34 price range  here.  It's moving higher now.  But they've got so much going for them.   And their play is online gambling for sports betting being approved by the  Supreme Court this year and all the sports teams coming to Vegas driving  new incremental revenue in Vegas for not only online but also off line  betting on sports.  But also, the second side is they are opening up  another casino in Macau.  </p><p> China is hot.  It's growing faster than what people realize.  And Macau  gaming company has been a wonderful source of income for them.  And we  expect that to continue.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  On that note, thanks, Ross.  Good to see you again.  </p><p>GERBER:  Good to see you, too.  Thanks for having me.</p><p> HERERA:  Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki.  </p><p> And to read more about Ross's stock picks, you can go to our Website,  NBR.com.</p><p> MATHISEN:  And coming up, why marijuana isn't quite the cash crop some  California business owners thought it would be.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  Here's a look at what to watch for next week.  On Tuesday, a  number of Dow components report their earnings, including J&amp;J, P&amp;G,  Travelers and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).  Also on Tuesday, the World Economic Forum  in Davos gets underway, bringing together business leaders and heads of  state to discuss the global economy.  </p><p>On Wednesday, we will find out if there was a rush to buy homes at the end  of the year with the release of existing home sales.  And that's what to  watch for next week.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of President Trump's  inauguration.  It's been an eventful year in Washington and, of course, on  Wall Street.  During the past year, the S&amp;P 500 index has returned more  than 25 percent and according to Market Watch, more than half of the  index's 500 stocks have seen gains of 20 percent or more.  </p><p> HERERA:  The fast growing marijuana industry is facing a growing number of  challenges, even in states where recreational pot is legal.  Take  California for instance.  Legalized creational marijuana went into effect  at the start of the year.  And many thought business would boom.  </p><p> But as Aditi Roy reports, that's not necessarily the case.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Ozzie Ozkay-Villa is a  34-year-old mom of two, lives s in upscale Marin, California, owns a  business, and consumes marijuana-laced products almost every day.  </p><p> OZZIE OZKAY-VILLA, MARIJUANA CONSUMER:  When the kids are home and we're  having maybe a little bit of a rough patch, I might use a little bit just  to ground myself and I just feel like I'm a much better parent.  </p><p> ROY:  She's exactly the type of customer marijuana companies like Kiva  Confections, which makes cannabis-laced chocolate are going after,  especially now that California's legal marijuana market is transitioning  from medical to recreational, bringing in more potential customers and  revenues.  </p><p> KRISTI KNOBLICH PALMER, KIVA CONFECTIONS CO-FOUNDER:  The opportunity in  California is huge.  </p><p> ROY:  Kristi Knoblich Palmer is the cofounder of Kiva, a leading producer  in marijuana edibles, a segment of the marijuana industry that seems to be  exploding.  </p><p> One new study by marijuana delivery start-up ease reports edibles are among  the most appealing cannabis products to millennials.  But sales of flowers  or straight up marijuana went down 45 percent during the past year.  Kiva  is courting new users, or ones on the fence through low dosage products  like their petra mints.  </p><p> KNOBLICH PALMER:  It focuses on micro dosing.  So, allowing people to  consume the minimum amount of cannabis while feeling the benefits without  any of the negative effects.  Those have been nicknamed mom mints by  consumers because they're perfect for who you just described, a working mom  or dad.  </p><p> OZKAY-VILLA:  They are also very discrete.  It's not like I'm going to  bathroom and pack a pipe.  </p><p> ROY:  But while demand for their products might be high, Kiva says it's  facing significant regulatory hurdle in capturing those sales.  As a  distributor, Kiva can only supply to other recreationally licensed  companies.  But many cities haven't even started issuing recreational  licenses, so Kiva is only supplying to around 100 dispensaries, versus the  1,100 normally an their roster when purely medicinal.  </p><p> And to meet new packaging requirements, workers have to manually re-label  products.  The company has doubled its packaging staff and is paying for  more hours and supplies.  The company says new regulations and taxes have  hiked their costs 45 percent.  That means higher prices for their  customers.  </p><p> Still, Knoblich Palmer is hopeful that once they get over the shock of new  regulations, the market opportunity will worth it.  </p><p> KNOBLICH PALMER:  People are excited about it and curious, and interested  in the benefits of cannabis and how that might help them.  So the  opportunity here is huge.  </p><p> ROY:  Palmer says it could take up to a year before the company meets the  challenges of the new regulations.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, Oakland, California.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  And before we go, let's take another look at the day and the  week on Wall Street.  Despite the 11th hour negotiations in Washington, to  reach a budget deal, a deal that may or may not happen, stocks finished  higher.  The Dow rose 53 points to 26,071.  Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500, well, they  both finished at fresh records.  And for the week, all of the major indexes  were higher by about 1 percent.  </p><p> HERERA:  And who knows what will happen next week?  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Yes.</p><p> HERERA:  Because this market is surprising almost everybody.  </p><p> That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for  joining us.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  weekend, everyone.  And we will see you here on Monday.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Fewer iPhones  sold and revenue won't be as strong as expected.  So, what should investors  do with shares of one of the world's most valuable companies?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Global hot spots.  With  the emerging markets in focus, which countries in crisis could have the  biggest impact on your money?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  And now, it's the Fed's turn.  Central Bank policymakers meet this  week.  Will they or won't they continue to cut back on stimulus, especially  with the recent turmoil in the markets?  </p><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  January 27th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome. </p><p>A rough day for stocks got rougher after the market closed, that's because  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its quarterly earnings.  The revenue and  profit numbers were fine.  They beat Wall Street estimates, in fact, but  sales of iPhones at 51 million units fell short of forecast, and Apple's  own revenue predictions for the current quarter disappointed investors, and  they initially sold the stock hard in after hours trading. </p><p>Seema Mody joins us now from the NASDAQ with some insight into Apple's  results. </p><p>Seema, what are the big takeaways you see in the numbers tonight?</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Tyler, those disappoint  iPhone sales.  That seems to be what's worrying the street.  Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) sold 51 million iPhones in the first quarter whereas Wall  Street was expecting around 54 million phones to have been sold.  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) analysts telling me that means Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is dealing  with saturation at the high end of the smartphone market. </p><p>Now, the amount of iPads sold in the first quarter also fell short of  street consensus.  So while the overall earnings and revenue numbers beat  estimates, it's the iPhone and iPad sales that seems to be worrying the  street.  That's why we're looking at shares down after hours -- Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN:  All right, Seema.  Seema Mody, thank you very much. </p><p>Well, it was an up and down session on Wall Street today, but mostly down,  despite some brief flurries and I'm not talking snow.  The major averages  all extended last week's losses.  Investors were chilled by a 7 percent  decline in new home sales and lingering worries about China's economy and  the currencies and economies of several emerging market countries.  Oh, and  there's also that Fed meeting that begins tomorrow.  Taper talk didn't  cheer the markets very much today, either. </p><p>The Dow down 41 points, the NASDAQ was off 44 with the tech sector weighing  on the index.  The S&amp;P lost eight. </p><p>GHARIB:  The biggest gainer in today's losing session for the Dow was  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT).  The giant equipment maker reported earnings and  revenues that topped analysts' estimates.  Shares surged nearly 6 percent  on that news. </p><p>Morgan Brennan has more on what drove Cat's strong quarter and why  investors are buying in. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  With  profit up almost 50 percent from a year ago, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the  world's largest maker of mining and construction equipment, blew past  expectations.  Some are saying the better than expected numbers represent a  watershed event for a company that struggled in recent years. </p><p>ELI LUSTGARTEN, LONGBOW SECURITIES:  Mining is weak and remains weak, but  the other two parts, (INAUDIBLE) and construction will more than offset it  and with head winds you're going to have a better year in '14.  This really  changes the outlook for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to a much more positive  scenario for the next couple years. </p><p>BRENNAN:  Because Cat's heavy machinery supplies a variety of industrial  needs across the globe, it's considered a good early indicator for the  global economy.  Cat's good numbers are particularly encouraging after the  drop in demand since 2012, taking the stock town 6 percent over the past  year and more than 20 percent over the past two. </p><p>Demand for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) products may be coming back, especially  in North America where construction is beginning to rebound.  But the  earnings also reflect aggressive cost-cutting measures.  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) has cut almost 10,000 jobs in the past year and slashed  inventory levels.  The company's profits also shine a spotlight on China  where recent data is fueling worries about the health of the world's second  largest economy.  Even so, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) says sales and revenues  grew 20 percent last year and analysts note that it's exposure to the  country means relatively small. </p><p>ANDY KAPLOWITZ, BARCLAYS CAPITAL:  China is a pretty small portion of the  business and obviously, it affects their mining business quite a bit.  If  we can just get some stability in emerging markets, I think that's where  you could see the stock really perform really well.  </p><p>BRENNAN (on camera):  But these headwinds may not keep the stock down for  long.  Shares of Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) hit their highest level since late  2011 during today's trading, and with the company planning to buy back  another $10 billion worth of stock, a number of analysts continue to rate  it a buy. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, remember 1997?  Well, many investors do and now, they  are wondering if this is the start of a similar currency crisis and what it  might mean for your money.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB:  Two big events this week that are worrying investors here in the  U.S. and all over the globe -- the selloff in currencies in emerging  markets and the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. </p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more on the global currency hot spots, and why  they matter to American investors. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The  troubled emerging markets this week weren't necessarily the biggest or most  important economies, at least not yet.  Turkey and Argentina are the  cornerstone of the recent massive sell off, especially when it comes to  their currencies.  It started with political troubles, which has made  investing in those countries far more risky, and that led investors to  abandon their investments. </p><p>When you leave a country as an investor, you sell the currency because you  don't need it anymore.  We've seen the selling occur though also in other  parts of Latin America, including Brazil and Mexico, plus, parts of  Southeast as Indonesia and India, and you can add South Africa to the mix,  as well. </p><p>These countries have the particular issues, but here's what's true of all  of them -- when interest rates were extremely low in the United States,  investors were willing to go to riskier places in the world in order to get  paid higher interest rates.  But as the U.S. economy improves, and the Fed  begins to take its foot off the gas pedal, U.S. interest rates are expected  to rise. </p><p>That makes those other countries less attractive unless they rate their  interest rates too.  The problem is that slows down their economy. </p><p>The Turkish central bank is holding an emergency meeting tomorrow where  they are expected to hike rates between 2 percent and 4 percent.  Those are  extreme moves to American whose are used to the Fed moving only a quarter  percent out a time.  But desperate times call for desperate measures. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  More now on the other big concern for the markets this week,  that would be the Fed's meeting kicking off tomorrow.  Steve Liesman has  more on how the decisions on the asset-buying stimulus plans and interest  rates could further roil world markets. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Broad expectations  on Wall Street that neither emerging markets problems or currency  volatility, nor a weak December employment report will stay the Federal  Reserve from its appointed rounds of completing Q.E.3 this year.  It's  expected to continue the process it began in December with another cut to  bond purchase at its January meeting which ends on Wednesday. </p><p>This is, of course, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's last meeting after eight  years in the leadership seat.  Janet Yellen takes over as chair on February  1st and the first meeting will be in March when there will be a press  conference. </p><p>But for now, here is market observers think the Fed is likely considering  recent market volatility.  Does it change the forecast?  Answer, probably  not.  Does it represent systemic risks to the U.S. and global systems?   Again, the answer is probably not, and are there underlying macro economic  troubles that link all of the countries again?  The answer appears to be  no.</p><p>Officials who I spoke with say the events of the past several days is more  linked to specific events in specific countries, more political than  economic.</p><p>ROBERT HORMATS, KISSINGER ASSOCIATES VICE CHAIRMAN:  Several of them have  very key elections, and most of these elections have a high level of  uncertainty attached to them.  India is having elections.  Turkey is having  elections.  Brazil is having elections for just to name a few, and these  are all very complicated. </p><p>LIESMAN:  But there is also a link to Fed policy, a lot of money has  flooded into emerging markets seeking higher rates of return on those  countries' bonds.  Now that the Fed is reducing efforts to keep rates low  here in the U.S., and interest rates have risen a bit, some of that money  is fleeing emerging markets and coming back home. </p><p>But there is another reason, the outlook for growth has also changed, with  less great expected in the emerging countries and more in developed  countries like the U.S. and Europe.  So, money is following the growth. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  The currency sell off in the emerging markets bring back bad  memories of the 1997 Asian crisis.  Back then, there were fears of a world- wide economic meltdown.  But as Sara Eisen reports, this time, things are  different.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Plunging  currencies from Argentina to Turkey to Ukraine are triggering bad memories  on Wall Street.  It all goes back to 1997, when a sharp drop in Thailand's  currency, the baht, set off a chain reaction in other markets, nailing  economies in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.  It sent shock waves  around the world, and multiple bailouts from the IMF and even the United  States.</p><p>Investors are wondering, could Argentina or Turkey become the next  Thailand?  But some on Wall Street say this time is different.</p><p>MARC CHANDLER, BROWN BROTHERS CHAIRMAN:  This isn't a crisis level.  This  is a couple of base selloff.  I'm not sure that it's going to be sustained  to affect policy or to affect economic outcomes.</p><p>EISEN:  So, what's changed?  China is a bigger economic power house.  Now,  the world's second biggest economy, share of the world economy is four  times what it was in 1997.</p><p>That means China could act as an anchor of stability if developing markets  shake or cause trouble if it shows signs of weakness. </p><p>ALAN RUSKIN, DEUTSCHE BANK:  There is capital that's actually come back  into China and that's the point of maximum vulnerability.</p><p>EISEN:  Another difference now, the Federal Reserve is in the middle of a  balancing act, tapering or scaling back its stimulus it put in place to  help fight the financial crisis without disrupting the economy and market.   The worry for U.S. investors, the world economies are now much more  intertwined, and an emerging market meltdown could hit U.S. markets and  companies particularly multinationals.  That have depended on faster  growing developing nations for growth.</p><p>RUSKIN:  The big worry is that the E.M. currencies and E.M. countries share  of GDP is much larger than it was back 1997, 1998.  So, you had developing  countries roughly about 20 percent of GDP and then, it's now about 40  percent of GDP.  So, the ripple effect can be much larger. </p><p>EISEN (on camera):  And while analysts say brace for more financial swings  and turbulence ahead, it doesn't appear to be a full-blown crisis ala 1997  yet.  The key will be reaction to the Federal Reserve announcement  Wednesday and any news on the health of China's economy. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, here to discuss everything under the sun from currency  turmoil to the Fed, to the faith of emerging market economies, maybe even  the Super Bowl, is Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer for U.S. Trust. </p><p>Chris, welcome.  Good to have you with us.</p><p>CHRIS HYZY, US TRUST CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER:  How are you doing, Tyler?</p><p>MATHISEN:  Let's start where Sara Eisen left off and that is with the  currency turmoil currently rattling everywhere from Thailand to Argentina  to Turkey to South Africa.  Is this possibly going to become a kind of  contagion that can do really sustained damage to developed markets or not? </p><p>HYZY:  You know, when you take a look at the picture going on now versus  the mid to late 1990s as you've referenced, virtually, every emerging  market had a currency crisis.  From 1994, starting in Mexico, and going all  the way to the Russian ruble in 1998, and again with Argentina and Brazil  in the early 2000s.  You would say it's back to the future all over again. </p><p>But the key main difference is, number one, the United States is on firm  footing and getting better from a growth outlook perspective -- obviously  from a monetary policy perspective -- there is fed tapering concerns,  pulling liquidity away from particularly those countries that need it.   That's still going to be there.  </p><p>But from a financial contagion perspective, putting what's going on today,  making it very similar to back then, complete polar opposite as far as  we're concerned and the other big difference is, $17 trillion in cash  around the world, Tyler, that's out there, that's very liquid, that's still  trying to find a home to invest in for the next few years. </p><p>GHARIB:  You know, Chris, on Friday, after the markets closed, people were  really freaked out going into this weekend.  I mean, there is the Dow down  over 300 points, and all this talk about crisis.  What changed that today  it was just like a normal, you know, middle of the road kind of sale off on  Wall Street? </p><p>HYZY:  You know, part of it is the fact the selling pressure just didn't  pull through as much as everyone expected.  They tried it around midday  when the Dow and S&amp;P were down around 1 percent or so. </p><p>But everyone is pointing to the fact we haven't had a big correction.  We  had a six to seven percent correction, somewhere around May, June, when  tapering talk about the first initial shot.  Emerging markets never came  back except for the one episode in the fall. </p><p>But the reason it's not pulling through right now, is because the outlook  for 2014 is a much better growth outlook than last year.  Europe is going  to grow at 1 percent versus negative one.  Japan is probably going to  repeat their performance and the U.S. will grow close to 3 1/2 versus two. </p><p>So, the outlook economically in profits, even in fair valued markets is a  lot better this year than last year.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Let's talk about the Fed a little bit.  Since they last met,  some of the economic data have not been exactly rosy -- a poor jobs number.   Today, some housing numbers were a little bit soggy. </p><p>Do you think that will change in any way their proclivity to taper or pull  back on stimulus?</p><p>HYZY:  It really doesn't look that way, Tyler.  The only thing that's  really going to change their so-called measured tapering under the Yellen  Fed is that this particular noise in the system around the emerging markets  becomes a contagion.  We think that's extremely low probability event.   It's out there, but it's the low probability event.</p><p>The job numbers going back to December, there is a lot of noise in the  system and any one month jobs number.  When you go back and look at the  three-month trends, they are robust and, yes, they're not as strong as  prior cycles, but I would argue that there is a lot of reason for that, a  lot is demographics. </p><p>The one thing that I think a lot of investment participants are getting  wrong is they're looking at the participation rate, and they're assuming  that people are leaving the job force because they are discouraged.   Actually, the growth in jobs is heavier than the growth in the  participation rate.  So, the unemployment rate goes down.  You know, that's  actually a pretty good thing and that's why we should see a lower  unemployment rate than the Fed even expects by mid-year.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Chris, thank you very much for your insight tonight.</p><p>HYZY:  You bet.  Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer for U.S. Trust.</p><p>GHARIB:  Well, economists are not only worried about slowing growth in  China, but also the rise of what's called a shadow banking system there.   From Beijing, Eunice Yoon explains what that is and the risks involved. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Joe Zhang  is a shadow banker.  He runs a micro credit firm in southern China.  A  former investment banker, he now funds small-time clients, anyone from  fruit growers and street hawkers to mom and pop shops.</p><p>JOE ZHANG, SHADOW BANKER:  We are a very important supplement to the  traditional banking system.  Small and medium-size companies and under  privileged consumers have no way to access a bank credit, but they can come  to us.</p><p>YOON:  China's financial sector has long been controlled by the government.   The big state-run banks funnel funds to other state-owned enterprises, or  industries and projects targeted by government economic policy.</p><p>(on camera):  State-owned enterprises easily get funding for big projects  like this one. </p><p>(voice-over):  That means some companies can cash in whenever they want,  while others, usually private companies, are largely cut off, fostering an  alternative shadow financial sector.</p><p>Jong charges borrowers 24 percent a year on loans that need to be paid back  in three to nine months.</p><p>ZHANG:  That's really scapegoating people like us.  And we are doing an  achievement business. </p><p>YOON:  But not everybody in shadow banking is.  The $6 trillion industry  encompasses all sorts of untraditional financing, everything from micro- lenders to indirect or off balance shut loans.</p><p>Recently, some of those investments have gone sour, raising fears of  defaults in an unregulated sector that could endanger the nation's banks  and ripple throughout the world.  Zhang says his clients are riskier, but  he argues shadow bankers like him do more rigorous credit analysis than  government-backed banks. </p><p>ZHANG:  We have skin in the game, so to speak.  We're very careful with the  management of our money.  If we -- our loans go bad, it hurts our own  pocket. </p><p>YOON:  Yet, if too many loans go bad, many believe it will hurt China and  the world. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Coming up, why two Dow components, both big drug makers, are  having very different days. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Some big tech firms have reached a deal with the Justice  Department over the NSA's spying on Americans.  The agreement settles how  much tech and telecom companies will now be allowed to disclose to the  public about the NSA's phone and Internet recordkeeping on U.S. citizens. </p><p>GHARIB:  Back now to our top story.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), our guest tonight  owns shares of the company and says he's adding more to his portfolio.   He's John Stephenson, portfolio manager at First Asset Investment.</p><p>John, thanks for joining us. </p><p>You know, everybody this afternoon was talking about what's wrong with  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and it's stock was selling off, and you're adding to  your portfolios.  What does Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have going for it?</p><p>JOHN STEPHENSON, FIRST ASSET INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT:  Pretty much  everything.  The stock is cheap.  That's the first thing.  It's trading at  nine times ex-cash versus the overall market of 15 times and tech sector  13.6. </p><p>And if you throw in the implications of cash, you're at 12.7 times or so,  so still cheap.  It's got early days with China, Brazil, India, so emerging  markets are a growth story.  It hasn't done anything in enterprise. </p><p>Plus, it has a ton of potential.  I mean, it's got 575 million customers  that they can tap into new services, internet based services, or just  additional offerings.  So, that's something and then, of course, there's a  widely rumored iWatch, iTV, maybe a combined iPad/MacBook Air. </p><p>So, there is tons of potential the company has and again, it's a company  that is very inexpensive.  So, I think it really has everything going for  it. </p><p>MATHISEN:  John, the company had record revenues in the quarter.  It beat  estimates on the top and bottom lines.  And yet, investors seem to focus on  two things -- iPhone sales, which didn't quite measure up to the forecast  and the outlook for the current quarter's revenues. </p><p>Are they getting it wrong?</p><p>STEPHENSON:  Well, I think there is some concern.  I mean, first quarter is  seasonally weak.  Of course, you have this last quarter, very, very strong  because of the holiday season.  I think what really came down to guidance - - iPhone sales were a little bit light of 51 million, versus the street  expectation of 56 million. </p><p>But when you look at what happened is earnings were quite substantial.   They really beat quote handedly, 1450 versus 1409.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Yes.</p><p>STEPHENSON:  And I think the deal was the iPhone 5S, which is high margin,   really carried the day.  So, I think the good news is they are selling more  of the high margin stuff and again, all of China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) is huge  and I think you've got the potential of $10 billion or more in addition  revenue over the course of the next 12 months because this is just a new  deal. </p><p>So, I think overall, it looks very attractive going forward.  But again,  the guidance was a little weak and people were disappointed.  I mean, it  came in quite a bit lower than people were hoping. </p><p>GHARIB:  Right, right.  You know, I hear what you're saying, John, but I  just wonder -- do you think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) management, Tim Cook, is  going to will feel pressured that he has to do something to, you know, stem  the sell off in the stock, maybe raise the dividend, maybe, you know, buy  back shares, these are the things that Carl Icahn, the activist investor,  has been calling for.</p><p>STEPHENSON:  Yes.  No, I think there's going to be some of that.  But I  don't think you're going to see $142 a share coming back to investors any  time soon.  I mean, I think you're looking at some potential per share buy  back, some potential for dividend increase.  I think that's clearly where  they need to go over time.</p><p>But I think what they should be doing is innovating for that next wave,  because I think that's really what the street is looking for.  What is  going to take it harder?  Will it be the iPhone 6 potentially with the  bigger screen?  That will allow them to go more head-to-head with Samsung's  offering.  But I think that's where the focus will remain and should  remain. </p><p>MATHISEN:  That's one of the things I've been curious about, whether  they're going to come out with a larger screen phone because my guess is  what I seem to hear you suggesting, John, is that they need to get their  wow back.  They haven't had the wow in the last year or two. </p><p>STEPHENSON:  Yes, I don't know if you're like me, Tyler, but I mean, I have  every Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) product out there.  And, you know, it's pretty  exciting at first and then you think I know my way around the 5 and the 5S,  and, you know, I don't see a huge implication for it.  </p><p>But I do think that what they have done is they put together a lot of  really good pieces.  I do think the large screen iPhone that's rumored to  come out with a five-inch screen will be a big game changer for them.  I do  think their early days in the enterprise market, and keep in mind the  biometrics with the 5S, that will help them in terms of security going  forward.  </p><p>And they have a fully integrated program with both the software and the  hardware.  And that allows them a tremendous user experience, when you buy  an android phone and they are the bread and butter of this company, you're  stuck with the operating system.  But, you know, within a month, 70 percent  of the people have a new operating system when iOS is updated. </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  John, thanks a lot for all that information.  Really  appreciate it.</p><p>John Stephenson, portfolio manager at First Asset Investment Management.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) and Charter  Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) are reportedly nearing a deal to buy Time  Warner (NYSE:TWX) assets, and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market  Focus\".</p><p>Charter has agreed in principle to sell some of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)  Cable's assets to Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), but only if it  succeeds in buying the remaining parts of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable for  itself.  The deal to sell off some assets will give Charter additional  funds to complete the takeover of the cable company.  Shares of Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) up slightly $52.49, at the close there.  Shares  of Charter surged 4 percent to $136.92.  Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable fell  a little, $133.45. </p><p>Pfizer's experimental lung cancer drug failed to meet its goals in two late  stage trials.  Patients given the drug did not show improved survival  without the disease progressing.  The results disappointed investors and  shares fell nearly 1 1/2 percent to $29.66. </p><p>Shares of Merck (NYSE:MRK) hit a record-high after Morgan Stanley  (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) upgraded the stock to overweight from underweight.   The analyst there said the company's prospects for a new cancer drug have  improved and could bring more than $6 billion in annual sales to the  company by the year 2020.  The drugmaker stock up 1 percent to $52.53. </p><p>GHARIB:  Well, it was just the opposite at Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems.   Its rating was downgraded by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase, from neutral to  underweight.  The firm sited Cisco's high evaluation, as well as weakness  in the emerging markets.  Shares slipped a fraction to $22 a share. </p><p>AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) told British regulators it won't be making a near-term bid  for European telecom giant Vodafone.  Now that AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) has denied a  takeover bid, it must wait six months if it decides to make a buyout offer  for the company.  That's according to U.K. takeover rules. </p><p>Shares of AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) rose slightly to $33.51.</p><p>And Royal Caribbean posted an earnings beat thanks, to improved ticket  sales.  The cruise operator also gave investors a rosier full year outlook,  despite a recent illness outbreak that affected 600 passengers on one of  its ship recently. </p><p>The company CEO doesn't think the outbreak will deter customers. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD FAIN, ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  I don't think it has  a big impact on bookings because most people understand just how common  this is.  It's the second most common illness in America.  Of course, you  up in the north are having bad weather and the winter, this kind of does  occur.  Unfortunately, an outbreak is defined as only 3 percent of the  people and it's still a very rare occurrence. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB:  And shares were up nearly 2 percent to $48.04.</p><p>And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie Gharib.  Thanks  for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And thanks for me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  evening, everybody.

Fewer iPhones sold and revenue won't be as strong as expected. So, what should investors do with shares of one of the world's most valuable companies?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Global hot spots. With the emerging markets in focus, which countries in crisis could have the biggest impact on your money?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And now, it's the Fed's turn. Central Bank policymakers meet this week. Will they or won't they continue to cut back on stimulus, especially with the recent turmoil in the markets?</p><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, January 27th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>A rough day for stocks got rougher after the market closed, that's because Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its quarterly earnings. The revenue and profit numbers were fine. They beat Wall Street estimates, in fact, but sales of iPhones at 51 million units fell short of forecast, and Apple's own revenue predictions for the current quarter disappointed investors, and they initially sold the stock hard in after hours trading.</p><p>Seema Mody joins us now from the NASDAQ with some insight into Apple's results.</p><p>Seema, what are the big takeaways you see in the numbers tonight?</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tyler, those disappoint iPhone sales. That seems to be what's worrying the street. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sold 51 million iPhones in the first quarter whereas Wall Street was expecting around 54 million phones to have been sold. Gartner (NYSE:IT) analysts telling me that means Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is dealing with saturation at the high end of the smartphone market.</p><p>Now, the amount of iPads sold in the first quarter also fell short of street consensus. So while the overall earnings and revenue numbers beat estimates, it's the iPhone and iPad sales that seems to be worrying the street. That's why we're looking at shares down after hours -- Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right, Seema. Seema Mody, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, it was an up and down session on Wall Street today, but mostly down, despite some brief flurries and I'm not talking snow. The major averages all extended last week's losses. Investors were chilled by a 7 percent decline in new home sales and lingering worries about China's economy and the currencies and economies of several emerging market countries. Oh, and there's also that Fed meeting that begins tomorrow. Taper talk didn't cheer the markets very much today, either.</p><p>The Dow down 41 points, the NASDAQ was off 44 with the tech sector weighing on the index. The S&amp;P lost eight.</p><p>GHARIB: The biggest gainer in today's losing session for the Dow was Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). The giant equipment maker reported earnings and revenues that topped analysts' estimates. Shares surged nearly 6 percent on that news.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more on what drove Cat's strong quarter and why investors are buying in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With profit up almost 50 percent from a year ago, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the world's largest maker of mining and construction equipment, blew past expectations. Some are saying the better than expected numbers represent a watershed event for a company that struggled in recent years.</p><p>ELI LUSTGARTEN, LONGBOW SECURITIES: Mining is weak and remains weak, but the other two parts, (INAUDIBLE) and construction will more than offset it and with head winds you're going to have a better year in '14. This really changes the outlook for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to a much more positive scenario for the next couple years.</p><p>BRENNAN: Because Cat's heavy machinery supplies a variety of industrial needs across the globe, it's considered a good early indicator for the global economy. Cat's good numbers are particularly encouraging after the drop in demand since 2012, taking the stock town 6 percent over the past year and more than 20 percent over the past two.</p><p>Demand for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) products may be coming back, especially in North America where construction is beginning to rebound. But the earnings also reflect aggressive cost-cutting measures. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has cut almost 10,000 jobs in the past year and slashed inventory levels. The company's profits also shine a spotlight on China where recent data is fueling worries about the health of the world's second largest economy. Even so, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) says sales and revenues grew 20 percent last year and analysts note that it's exposure to the country means relatively small.</p><p>ANDY KAPLOWITZ, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: China is a pretty small portion of the business and obviously, it affects their mining business quite a bit. If we can just get some stability in emerging markets, I think that's where you could see the stock really perform really well.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): But these headwinds may not keep the stock down for long. Shares of Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) hit their highest level since late 2011 during today's trading, and with the company planning to buy back another $10 billion worth of stock, a number of analysts continue to rate it a buy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, remember 1997? Well, many investors do and now, they are wondering if this is the start of a similar currency crisis and what it might mean for your money.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: Two big events this week that are worrying investors here in the U.S. and all over the globe -- the selloff in currencies in emerging markets and the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more on the global currency hot spots, and why they matter to American investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The troubled emerging markets this week weren't necessarily the biggest or most important economies, at least not yet. Turkey and Argentina are the cornerstone of the recent massive sell off, especially when it comes to their currencies. It started with political troubles, which has made investing in those countries far more risky, and that led investors to abandon their investments.</p><p>When you leave a country as an investor, you sell the currency because you don't need it anymore. We've seen the selling occur though also in other parts of Latin America, including Brazil and Mexico, plus, parts of Southeast as Indonesia and India, and you can add South Africa to the mix, as well.</p><p>These countries have the particular issues, but here's what's true of all of them -- when interest rates were extremely low in the United States, investors were willing to go to riskier places in the world in order to get paid higher interest rates. But as the U.S. economy improves, and the Fed begins to take its foot off the gas pedal, U.S. interest rates are expected to rise.</p><p>That makes those other countries less attractive unless they rate their interest rates too. The problem is that slows down their economy.</p><p>The Turkish central bank is holding an emergency meeting tomorrow where they are expected to hike rates between 2 percent and 4 percent. Those are extreme moves to American whose are used to the Fed moving only a quarter percent out a time. But desperate times call for desperate measures.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: More now on the other big concern for the markets this week, that would be the Fed's meeting kicking off tomorrow. Steve Liesman has more on how the decisions on the asset-buying stimulus plans and interest rates could further roil world markets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Broad expectations on Wall Street that neither emerging markets problems or currency volatility, nor a weak December employment report will stay the Federal Reserve from its appointed rounds of completing Q.E.3 this year. It's expected to continue the process it began in December with another cut to bond purchase at its January meeting which ends on Wednesday.</p><p>This is, of course, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's last meeting after eight years in the leadership seat. Janet Yellen takes over as chair on February 1st and the first meeting will be in March when there will be a press conference.</p><p>But for now, here is market observers think the Fed is likely considering recent market volatility. Does it change the forecast? Answer, probably not. Does it represent systemic risks to the U.S. and global systems? Again, the answer is probably not, and are there underlying macro economic troubles that link all of the countries again? The answer appears to be no.</p><p>Officials who I spoke with say the events of the past several days is more linked to specific events in specific countries, more political than economic.</p><p>ROBERT HORMATS, KISSINGER ASSOCIATES VICE CHAIRMAN: Several of them have very key elections, and most of these elections have a high level of uncertainty attached to them. India is having elections. Turkey is having elections. Brazil is having elections for just to name a few, and these are all very complicated.</p><p>LIESMAN: But there is also a link to Fed policy, a lot of money has flooded into emerging markets seeking higher rates of return on those countries' bonds. Now that the Fed is reducing efforts to keep rates low here in the U.S., and interest rates have risen a bit, some of that money is fleeing emerging markets and coming back home.</p><p>But there is another reason, the outlook for growth has also changed, with less great expected in the emerging countries and more in developed countries like the U.S. and Europe. So, money is following the growth.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: The currency sell off in the emerging markets bring back bad memories of the 1997 Asian crisis. Back then, there were fears of a world- wide economic meltdown. But as Sara Eisen reports, this time, things are different.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Plunging currencies from Argentina to Turkey to Ukraine are triggering bad memories on Wall Street. It all goes back to 1997, when a sharp drop in Thailand's currency, the baht, set off a chain reaction in other markets, nailing economies in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. It sent shock waves around the world, and multiple bailouts from the IMF and even the United States.</p><p>Investors are wondering, could Argentina or Turkey become the next Thailand? But some on Wall Street say this time is different.</p><p>MARC CHANDLER, BROWN BROTHERS CHAIRMAN: This isn't a crisis level. This is a couple of base selloff. I'm not sure that it's going to be sustained to affect policy or to affect economic outcomes.</p><p>EISEN: So, what's changed? China is a bigger economic power house. Now, the world's second biggest economy, share of the world economy is four times what it was in 1997.</p><p>That means China could act as an anchor of stability if developing markets shake or cause trouble if it shows signs of weakness.</p><p>ALAN RUSKIN, DEUTSCHE BANK: There is capital that's actually come back into China and that's the point of maximum vulnerability.</p><p>EISEN: Another difference now, the Federal Reserve is in the middle of a balancing act, tapering or scaling back its stimulus it put in place to help fight the financial crisis without disrupting the economy and market. The worry for U.S. investors, the world economies are now much more intertwined, and an emerging market meltdown could hit U.S. markets and companies particularly multinationals. That have depended on faster growing developing nations for growth.</p><p>RUSKIN: The big worry is that the E.M. currencies and E.M. countries share of GDP is much larger than it was back 1997, 1998. So, you had developing countries roughly about 20 percent of GDP and then, it's now about 40 percent of GDP. So, the ripple effect can be much larger.</p><p>EISEN (on camera): And while analysts say brace for more financial swings and turbulence ahead, it doesn't appear to be a full-blown crisis ala 1997 yet. The key will be reaction to the Federal Reserve announcement Wednesday and any news on the health of China's economy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, here to discuss everything under the sun from currency turmoil to the Fed, to the faith of emerging market economies, maybe even the Super Bowl, is Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer for U.S. Trust.</p><p>Chris, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>CHRIS HYZY, US TRUST CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER: How are you doing, Tyler?</p><p>MATHISEN: Let's start where Sara Eisen left off and that is with the currency turmoil currently rattling everywhere from Thailand to Argentina to Turkey to South Africa. Is this possibly going to become a kind of contagion that can do really sustained damage to developed markets or not?</p><p>HYZY: You know, when you take a look at the picture going on now versus the mid to late 1990s as you've referenced, virtually, every emerging market had a currency crisis. From 1994, starting in Mexico, and going all the way to the Russian ruble in 1998, and again with Argentina and Brazil in the early 2000s. You would say it's back to the future all over again.</p><p>But the key main difference is, number one, the United States is on firm footing and getting better from a growth outlook perspective -- obviously from a monetary policy perspective -- there is fed tapering concerns, pulling liquidity away from particularly those countries that need it. That's still going to be there.</p><p>But from a financial contagion perspective, putting what's going on today, making it very similar to back then, complete polar opposite as far as we're concerned and the other big difference is, $17 trillion in cash around the world, Tyler, that's out there, that's very liquid, that's still trying to find a home to invest in for the next few years.</p><p>GHARIB: You know, Chris, on Friday, after the markets closed, people were really freaked out going into this weekend. I mean, there is the Dow down over 300 points, and all this talk about crisis. What changed that today it was just like a normal, you know, middle of the road kind of sale off on Wall Street?</p><p>HYZY: You know, part of it is the fact the selling pressure just didn't pull through as much as everyone expected. They tried it around midday when the Dow and S&amp;P were down around 1 percent or so.</p><p>But everyone is pointing to the fact we haven't had a big correction. We had a six to seven percent correction, somewhere around May, June, when tapering talk about the first initial shot. Emerging markets never came back except for the one episode in the fall.</p><p>But the reason it's not pulling through right now, is because the outlook for 2014 is a much better growth outlook than last year. Europe is going to grow at 1 percent versus negative one. Japan is probably going to repeat their performance and the U.S. will grow close to 3 1/2 versus two.</p><p>So, the outlook economically in profits, even in fair valued markets is a lot better this year than last year.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let's talk about the Fed a little bit. Since they last met, some of the economic data have not been exactly rosy -- a poor jobs number. Today, some housing numbers were a little bit soggy.</p><p>Do you think that will change in any way their proclivity to taper or pull back on stimulus?</p><p>HYZY: It really doesn't look that way, Tyler. The only thing that's really going to change their so-called measured tapering under the Yellen Fed is that this particular noise in the system around the emerging markets becomes a contagion. We think that's extremely low probability event. It's out there, but it's the low probability event.</p><p>The job numbers going back to December, there is a lot of noise in the system and any one month jobs number. When you go back and look at the three-month trends, they are robust and, yes, they're not as strong as prior cycles, but I would argue that there is a lot of reason for that, a lot is demographics.</p><p>The one thing that I think a lot of investment participants are getting wrong is they're looking at the participation rate, and they're assuming that people are leaving the job force because they are discouraged. Actually, the growth in jobs is heavier than the growth in the participation rate. So, the unemployment rate goes down. You know, that's actually a pretty good thing and that's why we should see a lower unemployment rate than the Fed even expects by mid-year.</p><p>MATHISEN: Chris, thank you very much for your insight tonight.</p><p>HYZY: You bet. Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN: Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer for U.S. Trust.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, economists are not only worried about slowing growth in China, but also the rise of what's called a shadow banking system there. From Beijing, Eunice Yoon explains what that is and the risks involved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Joe Zhang is a shadow banker. He runs a micro credit firm in southern China. A former investment banker, he now funds small-time clients, anyone from fruit growers and street hawkers to mom and pop shops.</p><p>JOE ZHANG, SHADOW BANKER: We are a very important supplement to the traditional banking system. Small and medium-size companies and under privileged consumers have no way to access a bank credit, but they can come to us.</p><p>YOON: China's financial sector has long been controlled by the government. The big state-run banks funnel funds to other state-owned enterprises, or industries and projects targeted by government economic policy.</p><p>(on camera): State-owned enterprises easily get funding for big projects like this one.</p><p>(voice-over): That means some companies can cash in whenever they want, while others, usually private companies, are largely cut off, fostering an alternative shadow financial sector.</p><p>Jong charges borrowers 24 percent a year on loans that need to be paid back in three to nine months.</p><p>ZHANG: That's really scapegoating people like us. And we are doing an achievement business.</p><p>YOON: But not everybody in shadow banking is. The $6 trillion industry encompasses all sorts of untraditional financing, everything from micro- lenders to indirect or off balance shut loans.</p><p>Recently, some of those investments have gone sour, raising fears of defaults in an unregulated sector that could endanger the nation's banks and ripple throughout the world. Zhang says his clients are riskier, but he argues shadow bankers like him do more rigorous credit analysis than government-backed banks.</p><p>ZHANG: We have skin in the game, so to speak. We're very careful with the management of our money. If we -- our loans go bad, it hurts our own pocket.</p><p>YOON: Yet, if too many loans go bad, many believe it will hurt China and the world.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Coming up, why two Dow components, both big drug makers, are having very different days.</p><p>MATHISEN: Some big tech firms have reached a deal with the Justice Department over the NSA's spying on Americans. The agreement settles how much tech and telecom companies will now be allowed to disclose to the public about the NSA's phone and Internet recordkeeping on U.S. citizens.</p><p>GHARIB: Back now to our top story. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), our guest tonight owns shares of the company and says he's adding more to his portfolio. He's John Stephenson, portfolio manager at First Asset Investment.</p><p>John, thanks for joining us.</p><p>You know, everybody this afternoon was talking about what's wrong with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and it's stock was selling off, and you're adding to your portfolios. What does Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have going for it?</p><p>JOHN STEPHENSON, FIRST ASSET INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: Pretty much everything. The stock is cheap. That's the first thing. It's trading at nine times ex-cash versus the overall market of 15 times and tech sector 13.6.</p><p>And if you throw in the implications of cash, you're at 12.7 times or so, so still cheap. It's got early days with China, Brazil, India, so emerging markets are a growth story. It hasn't done anything in enterprise.</p><p>Plus, it has a ton of potential. I mean, it's got 575 million customers that they can tap into new services, internet based services, or just additional offerings. So, that's something and then, of course, there's a widely rumored iWatch, iTV, maybe a combined iPad/MacBook Air.</p><p>So, there is tons of potential the company has and again, it's a company that is very inexpensive. So, I think it really has everything going for it.</p><p>MATHISEN: John, the company had record revenues in the quarter. It beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. And yet, investors seem to focus on two things -- iPhone sales, which didn't quite measure up to the forecast and the outlook for the current quarter's revenues.</p><p>Are they getting it wrong?</p><p>STEPHENSON: Well, I think there is some concern. I mean, first quarter is seasonally weak. Of course, you have this last quarter, very, very strong because of the holiday season. I think what really came down to guidance - - iPhone sales were a little bit light of 51 million, versus the street expectation of 56 million.</p><p>But when you look at what happened is earnings were quite substantial. They really beat quote handedly, 1450 versus 1409.</p><p>MATHISEN: Yes.</p><p>STEPHENSON: And I think the deal was the iPhone 5S, which is high margin, really carried the day. So, I think the good news is they are selling more of the high margin stuff and again, all of China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) is huge and I think you've got the potential of $10 billion or more in addition revenue over the course of the next 12 months because this is just a new deal.</p><p>So, I think overall, it looks very attractive going forward. But again, the guidance was a little weak and people were disappointed. I mean, it came in quite a bit lower than people were hoping.</p><p>GHARIB: Right, right. You know, I hear what you're saying, John, but I just wonder -- do you think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) management, Tim Cook, is going to will feel pressured that he has to do something to, you know, stem the sell off in the stock, maybe raise the dividend, maybe, you know, buy back shares, these are the things that Carl Icahn, the activist investor, has been calling for.</p><p>STEPHENSON: Yes. No, I think there's going to be some of that. But I don't think you're going to see $142 a share coming back to investors any time soon. I mean, I think you're looking at some potential per share buy back, some potential for dividend increase. I think that's clearly where they need to go over time.</p><p>But I think what they should be doing is innovating for that next wave, because I think that's really what the street is looking for. What is going to take it harder? Will it be the iPhone 6 potentially with the bigger screen? That will allow them to go more head-to-head with Samsung's offering. But I think that's where the focus will remain and should remain.</p><p>MATHISEN: That's one of the things I've been curious about, whether they're going to come out with a larger screen phone because my guess is what I seem to hear you suggesting, John, is that they need to get their wow back. They haven't had the wow in the last year or two.</p><p>STEPHENSON: Yes, I don't know if you're like me, Tyler, but I mean, I have every Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) product out there. And, you know, it's pretty exciting at first and then you think I know my way around the 5 and the 5S, and, you know, I don't see a huge implication for it.</p><p>But I do think that what they have done is they put together a lot of really good pieces. I do think the large screen iPhone that's rumored to come out with a five-inch screen will be a big game changer for them. I do think their early days in the enterprise market, and keep in mind the biometrics with the 5S, that will help them in terms of security going forward.</p><p>And they have a fully integrated program with both the software and the hardware. And that allows them a tremendous user experience, when you buy an android phone and they are the bread and butter of this company, you're stuck with the operating system. But, you know, within a month, 70 percent of the people have a new operating system when iOS is updated.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. John, thanks a lot for all that information. Really appreciate it.</p><p>John Stephenson, portfolio manager at First Asset Investment Management.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) are reportedly nearing a deal to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) assets, and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Charter has agreed in principle to sell some of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable's assets to Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), but only if it succeeds in buying the remaining parts of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable for itself. The deal to sell off some assets will give Charter additional funds to complete the takeover of the cable company. Shares of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) up slightly $52.49, at the close there. Shares of Charter surged 4 percent to $136.92. Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable fell a little, $133.45.</p><p>Pfizer's experimental lung cancer drug failed to meet its goals in two late stage trials. Patients given the drug did not show improved survival without the disease progressing. The results disappointed investors and shares fell nearly 1 1/2 percent to $29.66.</p><p>Shares of Merck (NYSE:MRK) hit a record-high after Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) upgraded the stock to overweight from underweight. The analyst there said the company's prospects for a new cancer drug have improved and could bring more than $6 billion in annual sales to the company by the year 2020. The drugmaker stock up 1 percent to $52.53.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, it was just the opposite at Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems. Its rating was downgraded by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase, from neutral to underweight. The firm sited Cisco's high evaluation, as well as weakness in the emerging markets. Shares slipped a fraction to $22 a share.</p><p>AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) told British regulators it won't be making a near-term bid for European telecom giant Vodafone. Now that AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) has denied a takeover bid, it must wait six months if it decides to make a buyout offer for the company.

Fewer iPhones sold and revenue won`t be as strong as expected. So, what should investors do with shares of one of the world`s most valuable companies?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Global hot spots. With the emerging markets in focus, which countries in crisis could have the biggest impact on your money?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And now, it`s the Fed`s turn. Central Bank policymakers meet this week. Will they or won`t they continue to cut back on stimulus, especially with the recent turmoil in the markets?</p><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, January 27th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>A rough day for stocks got rougher after the market closed, that`s because Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its quarterly earnings. The revenue and profit numbers were fine. They beat Wall Street estimates, in fact, but sales of iPhones at 51 million units fell short of forecast, and Apple`s own revenue predictions for the current quarter disappointed investors, and they initially sold the stock hard in after hours trading.</p><p>Seema Mody joins us now from the NASDAQ with some insight into Apple`s results.</p><p>Seema, what are the big takeaways you see in the numbers tonight?</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tyler, those disappoint iPhone sales. That seems to be what`s worrying the street. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sold 51 million iPhones in the first quarter whereas Wall Street was expecting around 54 million phones to have been sold. Gartner (NYSE:IT) analysts telling me that means Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is dealing with saturation at the high end of the smartphone market.</p><p>Now, the amount of iPads sold in the first quarter also fell short of street consensus. So while the overall earnings and revenue numbers beat estimates, it`s the iPhone and iPad sales that seems to be worrying the street. That`s why we`re looking at shares down after hours -- Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right, Seema. Seema Mody, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, it was an up and down session on Wall Street today, but mostly down, despite some brief flurries and I`m not talking snow. The major averages all extended last week`s losses. Investors were chilled by a 7 percent decline in new home sales and lingering worries about China`s economy and the currencies and economies of several emerging market countries. Oh, and there`s also that Fed meeting that begins tomorrow. Taper talk didn`t cheer the markets very much today, either.</p><p>The Dow down 41 points, the NASDAQ was off 44 with the tech sector weighing on the index. The S&amp;P lost eight.</p><p>GHARIB: The biggest gainer in today`s losing session for the Dow was Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). The giant equipment maker reported earnings and revenues that topped analysts` estimates. Shares surged nearly 6 percent on that news.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more on what drove Cat`s strong quarter and why investors are buying in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With profit up almost 50 percent from a year ago, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), the world`s largest maker of mining and construction equipment, blew past expectations. Some are saying the better than expected numbers represent a watershed event for a company that struggled in recent years.</p><p>ELI LUSTGARTEN, LONGBOW SECURITIES: Mining is weak and remains weak, but the other two parts, (INAUDIBLE) and construction will more than offset it and with head winds you`re going to have a better year in `14. This really changes the outlook for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to a much more positive scenario for the next couple years.</p><p>BRENNAN: Because Cat`s heavy machinery supplies a variety of industrial needs across the globe, it`s considered a good early indicator for the global economy. Cat`s good numbers are particularly encouraging after the drop in demand since 2012, taking the stock town 6 percent over the past year and more than 20 percent over the past two.</p><p>Demand for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) products may be coming back, especially in North America where construction is beginning to rebound. But the earnings also reflect aggressive cost-cutting measures. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has cut almost 10,000 jobs in the past year and slashed inventory levels. The company`s profits also shine a spotlight on China where recent data is fueling worries about the health of the world`s second largest economy. Even so, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) says sales and revenues grew 20 percent last year and analysts note that it`s exposure to the country means relatively small.</p><p>ANDY KAPLOWITZ, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: China is a pretty small portion of the business and obviously, it affects their mining business quite a bit. If we can just get some stability in emerging markets, I think that`s where you could see the stock really perform really well.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): But these headwinds may not keep the stock down for long. Shares of Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) hit their highest level since late 2011 during today`s trading, and with the company planning to buy back another $10 billion worth of stock, a number of analysts continue to rate it a buy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, remember 1997? Well, many investors do and now, they are wondering if this is the start of a similar currency crisis and what it might mean for your money.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: Two big events this week that are worrying investors here in the U.S. and all over the globe -- the selloff in currencies in emerging markets and the Federal Reserve`s two-day policy meeting.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more on the global currency hot spots, and why they matter to American investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The troubled emerging markets this week weren`t necessarily the biggest or most important economies, at least not yet. Turkey and Argentina are the cornerstone of the recent massive sell off, especially when it comes to their currencies. It started with political troubles, which has made investing in those countries far more risky, and that led investors to abandon their investments.</p><p>When you leave a country as an investor, you sell the currency because you don`t need it anymore. We`ve seen the selling occur though also in other parts of Latin America, including Brazil and Mexico, plus, parts of Southeast as Indonesia and India, and you can add South Africa to the mix, as well.</p><p>These countries have the particular issues, but here`s what`s true of all of them -- when interest rates were extremely low in the United States, investors were willing to go to riskier places in the world in order to get paid higher interest rates. But as the U.S. economy improves, and the Fed begins to take its foot off the gas pedal, U.S. interest rates are expected to rise.</p><p>That makes those other countries less attractive unless they rate their interest rates too. The problem is that slows down their economy.</p><p>The Turkish central bank is holding an emergency meeting tomorrow where they are expected to hike rates between 2 percent and 4 percent. Those are extreme moves to American whose are used to the Fed moving only a quarter percent out a time. But desperate times call for desperate measures.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: More now on the other big concern for the markets this week, that would be the Fed`s meeting kicking off tomorrow. Steve Liesman has more on how the decisions on the asset-buying stimulus plans and interest rates could further roil world markets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Broad expectations on Wall Street that neither emerging markets problems or currency volatility, nor a weak December employment report will stay the Federal Reserve from its appointed rounds of completing Q.E.3 this year. It`s expected to continue the process it began in December with another cut to bond purchase at its January meeting which ends on Wednesday.</p><p>This is, of course, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke`s last meeting after eight years in the leadership seat. Janet Yellen takes over as chair on February 1st and the first meeting will be in March when there will be a press conference.</p><p>But for now, here is market observers think the Fed is likely considering recent market volatility. Does it change the forecast? Answer, probably not. Does it represent systemic risks to the U.S. and global systems? Again, the answer is probably not, and are there underlying macro economic troubles that link all of the countries again? The answer appears to be no.</p><p>Officials who I spoke with say the events of the past several days is more linked to specific events in specific countries, more political than economic.</p><p>ROBERT HORMATS, KISSINGER ASSOCIATES VICE CHAIRMAN: Several of them have very key elections, and most of these elections have a high level of uncertainty attached to them. India is having elections. Turkey is having elections. Brazil is having elections for just to name a few, and these are all very complicated.</p><p>LIESMAN: But there is also a link to Fed policy, a lot of money has flooded into emerging markets seeking higher rates of return on those countries` bonds. Now that the Fed is reducing efforts to keep rates low here in the U.S., and interest rates have risen a bit, some of that money is fleeing emerging markets and coming back home.</p><p>But there is another reason, the outlook for growth has also changed, with less great expected in the emerging countries and more in developed countries like the U.S. and Europe. So, money is following the growth.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: The currency sell off in the emerging markets bring back bad memories of the 1997 Asian crisis. Back then, there were fears of a world- wide economic meltdown. But as Sara Eisen reports, this time, things are different.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Plunging currencies from Argentina to Turkey to Ukraine are triggering bad memories on Wall Street. It all goes back to 1997, when a sharp drop in Thailand`s currency, the baht, set off a chain reaction in other markets, nailing economies in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. It sent shock waves around the world, and multiple bailouts from the IMF and even the United States.</p><p>Investors are wondering, could Argentina or Turkey become the next Thailand? But some on Wall Street say this time is different.</p><p>MARC CHANDLER, BROWN BROTHERS CHAIRMAN: This isn`t a crisis level. This is a couple of base selloff. I`m not sure that it`s going to be sustained to affect policy or to affect economic outcomes.</p><p>EISEN: So, what`s changed? China is a bigger economic power house. Now, the world`s second biggest economy, share of the world economy is four times what it was in 1997.</p><p>That means China could act as an anchor of stability if developing markets shake or cause trouble if it shows signs of weakness.</p><p>ALAN RUSKIN, DEUTSCHE BANK: There is capital that`s actually come back into China and that`s the point of maximum vulnerability.</p><p>EISEN: Another difference now, the Federal Reserve is in the middle of a balancing act, tapering or scaling back its stimulus it put in place to help fight the financial crisis without disrupting the economy and market. The worry for U.S. investors, the world economies are now much more intertwined, and an emerging market meltdown could hit U.S. markets and companies particularly multinationals. That have depended on faster growing developing nations for growth.</p><p>RUSKIN: The big worry is that the E.M. currencies and E.M. countries share of GDP is much larger than it was back 1997, 1998. So, you had developing countries roughly about 20 percent of GDP and then, it`s now about 40 percent of GDP. So, the ripple effect can be much larger.</p><p>EISEN (on camera): And while analysts say brace for more financial swings and turbulence ahead, it doesn`t appear to be a full-blown crisis ala 1997 yet. The key will be reaction to the Federal Reserve announcement Wednesday and any news on the health of China`s economy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, here to discuss everything under the sun from currency turmoil to the Fed, to the faith of emerging market economies, maybe even the Super Bowl, is Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer for U.S. Trust.</p><p>Chris, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>CHRIS HYZY, US TRUST CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER: How are you doing, Tyler?</p><p>MATHISEN: Let`s start where Sara Eisen left off and that is with the currency turmoil currently rattling everywhere from Thailand to Argentina to Turkey to South Africa. Is this possibly going to become a kind of contagion that can do really sustained damage to developed markets or not?</p><p>HYZY: You know, when you take a look at the picture going on now versus the mid to late 1990s as you`ve referenced, virtually, every emerging market had a currency crisis. From 1994, starting in Mexico, and going all the way to the Russian ruble in 1998, and again with Argentina and Brazil in the early 2000s. You would say it`s back to the future all over again.</p><p>But the key main difference is, number one, the United States is on firm footing and getting better from a growth outlook perspective -- obviously from a monetary policy perspective -- there is fed tapering concerns, pulling liquidity away from particularly those countries that need it. That`s still going to be there.</p><p>But from a financial contagion perspective, putting what`s going on today, making it very similar to back then, complete polar opposite as far as we`re concerned and the other big difference is, $17 trillion in cash around the world, Tyler, that`s out there, that`s very liquid, that`s still trying to find a home to invest in for the next few years.</p><p>GHARIB: You know, Chris, on Friday, after the markets closed, people were really freaked out going into this weekend. I mean, there is the Dow down over 300 points, and all this talk about crisis. What changed that today it was just like a normal, you know, middle of the road kind of sale off on Wall Street?</p><p>HYZY: You know, part of it is the fact the selling pressure just didn`t pull through as much as everyone expected. They tried it around midday when the Dow and S&amp;P were down around 1 percent or so.</p><p>But everyone is pointing to the fact we haven`t had a big correction. We had a six to seven percent correction, somewhere around May, June, when tapering talk about the first initial shot. Emerging markets never came back except for the one episode in the fall.</p><p>But the reason it`s not pulling through right now, is because the outlook for 2014 is a much better growth outlook than last year. Europe is going to grow at 1 percent versus negative one. Japan is probably going to repeat their performance and the U.S. will grow close to 3 1/2 versus two.</p><p>So, the outlook economically in profits, even in fair valued markets is a lot better this year than last year.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let`s talk about the Fed a little bit. Since they last met, some of the economic data have not been exactly rosy -- a poor jobs number. Today, some housing numbers were a little bit soggy.</p><p>Do you think that will change in any way their proclivity to taper or pull back on stimulus?</p><p>HYZY: It really doesn`t look that way, Tyler. The only thing that`s really going to change their so-called measured tapering under the Yellen Fed is that this particular noise in the system around the emerging markets becomes a contagion. We think that`s extremely low probability event. It`s out there, but it`s the low probability event.</p><p>The job numbers going back to December, there is a lot of noise in the system and any one month jobs number. When you go back and look at the three-month trends, they are robust and, yes, they`re not as strong as prior cycles, but I would argue that there is a lot of reason for that, a lot is demographics.</p><p>The one thing that I think a lot of investment participants are getting wrong is they`re looking at the participation rate, and they`re assuming that people are leaving the job force because they are discouraged. Actually, the growth in jobs is heavier than the growth in the participation rate. So, the unemployment rate goes down. You know, that`s actually a pretty good thing and that`s why we should see a lower unemployment rate than the Fed even expects by mid-year.</p><p>MATHISEN: Chris, thank you very much for your insight tonight.</p><p>HYZY: You bet. Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN: Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer for U.S. Trust.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, economists are not only worried about slowing growth in China, but also the rise of what`s called a shadow banking system there. From Beijing, Eunice Yoon explains what that is and the risks involved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Joe Zhang is a shadow banker. He runs a micro credit firm in southern China. A former investment banker, he now funds small-time clients, anyone from fruit growers and street hawkers to mom and pop shops.</p><p>JOE ZHANG, SHADOW BANKER: We are a very important supplement to the traditional banking system. Small and medium-size companies and under privileged consumers have no way to access a bank credit, but they can come to us.</p><p>YOON: China`s financial sector has long been controlled by the government. The big state-run banks funnel funds to other state-owned enterprises, or industries and projects targeted by government economic policy.</p><p>(on camera): State-owned enterprises easily get funding for big projects like this one.</p><p>(voice-over): That means some companies can cash in whenever they want, while others, usually private companies, are largely cut off, fostering an alternative shadow financial sector.</p><p>Jong charges borrowers 24 percent a year on loans that need to be paid back in three to nine months.</p><p>ZHANG: That`s really scapegoating people like us. And we are doing an achievement business.</p><p>YOON: But not everybody in shadow banking is. The $6 trillion industry encompasses all sorts of untraditional financing, everything from micro- lenders to indirect or off balance shut loans.</p><p>Recently, some of those investments have gone sour, raising fears of defaults in an unregulated sector that could endanger the nation`s banks and ripple throughout the world. Zhang says his clients are riskier, but he argues shadow bankers like him do more rigorous credit analysis than government-backed banks.</p><p>ZHANG: We have skin in the game, so to speak. We`re very careful with the management of our money. If we -- our loans go bad, it hurts our own pocket.</p><p>YOON: Yet, if too many loans go bad, many believe it will hurt China and the world.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Coming up, why two Dow components, both big drug makers, are having very different days.</p><p>MATHISEN: Some big tech firms have reached a deal with the Justice Department over the NSA`s spying on Americans. The agreement settles how much tech and telecom companies will now be allowed to disclose to the public about the NSA`s phone and Internet recordkeeping on U.S. citizens.</p><p>GHARIB: Back now to our top story. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), our guest tonight owns shares of the company and says he`s adding more to his portfolio. He`s John Stephenson, portfolio manager at First Asset Investment.</p><p>John, thanks for joining us.</p><p>You know, everybody this afternoon was talking about what`s wrong with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and it`s stock was selling off, and you`re adding to your portfolios. What does Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have going for it?</p><p>JOHN STEPHENSON, FIRST ASSET INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: Pretty much everything. The stock is cheap. That`s the first thing. It`s trading at nine times ex-cash versus the overall market of 15 times and tech sector 13.6.</p><p>And if you throw in the implications of cash, you`re at 12.7 times or so, so still cheap. It`s got early days with China, Brazil, India, so emerging markets are a growth story. It hasn`t done anything in enterprise.</p><p>Plus, it has a ton of potential. I mean, it`s got 575 million customers that they can tap into new services, internet based services, or just additional offerings. So, that`s something and then, of course, there`s a widely rumored iWatch, iTV, maybe a combined iPad/MacBook Air.</p><p>So, there is tons of potential the company has and again, it`s a company that is very inexpensive. So, I think it really has everything going for it.</p><p>MATHISEN: John, the company had record revenues in the quarter. It beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. And yet, investors seem to focus on two things -- iPhone sales, which didn`t quite measure up to the forecast and the outlook for the current quarter`s revenues.</p><p>Are they getting it wrong?</p><p>STEPHENSON: Well, I think there is some concern. I mean, first quarter is seasonally weak. Of course, you have this last quarter, very, very strong because of the holiday season. I think what really came down to guidance - - iPhone sales were a little bit light of 51 million, versus the street expectation of 56 million.</p><p>But when you look at what happened is earnings were quite substantial. They really beat quote handedly, 1450 versus 1409.</p><p>MATHISEN: Yes.</p><p>STEPHENSON: And I think the deal was the iPhone 5S, which is high margin, really carried the day. So, I think the good news is they are selling more of the high margin stuff and again, all of China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) is huge and I think you`ve got the potential of $10 billion or more in addition revenue over the course of the next 12 months because this is just a new deal.</p><p>So, I think overall, it looks very attractive going forward. But again, the guidance was a little weak and people were disappointed. I mean, it came in quite a bit lower than people were hoping.</p><p>GHARIB: Right, right. You know, I hear what you`re saying, John, but I just wonder -- do you think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) management, Tim Cook, is going to will feel pressured that he has to do something to, you know, stem the sell off in the stock, maybe raise the dividend, maybe, you know, buy back shares, these are the things that Carl Icahn, the activist investor, has been calling for.</p><p>STEPHENSON: Yes. No, I think there`s going to be some of that. But I don`t think you`re going to see $142 a share coming back to investors any time soon. I mean, I think you`re looking at some potential per share buy back, some potential for dividend increase. I think that`s clearly where they need to go over time.</p><p>But I think what they should be doing is innovating for that next wave, because I think that`s really what the street is looking for. What is going to take it harder? Will it be the iPhone 6 potentially with the bigger screen? That will allow them to go more head-to-head with Samsung`s offering. But I think that`s where the focus will remain and should remain.</p><p>MATHISEN: That`s one of the things I`ve been curious about, whether they`re going to come out with a larger screen phone because my guess is what I seem to hear you suggesting, John, is that they need to get their wow back. They haven`t had the wow in the last year or two.</p><p>STEPHENSON: Yes, I don`t know if you`re like me, Tyler, but I mean, I have every Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) product out there. And, you know, it`s pretty exciting at first and then you think I know my way around the 5 and the 5S, and, you know, I don`t see a huge implication for it.</p><p>But I do think that what they have done is they put together a lot of really good pieces. I do think the large screen iPhone that`s rumored to come out with a five-inch screen will be a big game changer for them. I do think their early days in the enterprise market, and keep in mind the biometrics with the 5S, that will help them in terms of security going forward.</p><p>And they have a fully integrated program with both the software and the hardware. And that allows them a tremendous user experience, when you buy an android phone and they are the bread and butter of this company, you`re stuck with the operating system. But, you know, within a month, 70 percent of the people have a new operating system when iOS is updated.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. John, thanks a lot for all that information. Really appreciate it.</p><p>John Stephenson, portfolio manager at First Asset Investment Management.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) are reportedly nearing a deal to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) assets, and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Charter has agreed in principle to sell some of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable`s assets to Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), but only if it succeeds in buying the remaining parts of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable for itself. The deal to sell off some assets will give Charter additional funds to complete the takeover of the cable company. Shares of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) up slightly $52.49, at the close there. Shares of Charter surged 4 percent to $136.92. Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable fell a little, $133.45.</p><p>Pfizer`s experimental lung cancer drug failed to meet its goals in two late stage trials. Patients given the drug did not show improved survival without the disease progressing. The results disappointed investors and shares fell nearly 1 1/2 percent to $29.66.</p><p>Shares of Merck (NYSE:MRK) hit a record-high after Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) upgraded the stock to overweight from underweight. The analyst there said the company`s prospects for a new cancer drug have improved and could bring more than $6 billion in annual sales to the company by the year 2020. The drugmaker stock up 1 percent to $52.53.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, it was just the opposite at Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems. Its rating was downgraded by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase, from neutral to underweight. The firm sited Cisco`s high evaluation, as well as weakness in the emerging markets. Shares slipped a fraction to $22 a share.</p><p>AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) told British regulators it won`t be making a near-term bid for European telecom giant Vodafone. Now that AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) has denied a takeover bid, it must wait six months if it decides to make a buyout offer for the company. That`s according to U.K. takeover rules.</p><p>Shares of AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) rose slightly to $33.51.</p><p>And Royal Caribbean posted an earnings beat thanks, to improved ticket sales. The cruise operator also gave investors a rosier full year outlook, despite a recent illness outbreak that affected 600 passengers on one of its ship recently.</p><p>The company CEO doesn`t think the outbreak will deter customers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD FAIN, ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: I don`t think it has a big impact on bookings because most people understand just how common this is. It`s the second most common illness in America. Of course, you up in the north are having bad weather and the winter, this kind of does occur. Unfortunately, an outbreak is defined as only 3 percent of the people and it`s still a very rare occurrence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB: And shares were up nearly 2 percent to $48.04.</p><p>And that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And thanks for me as well. I`m Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody. We`ll see you back here tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

It`s the worst day of the year for the market as focus shifts to tighter immigration policies and away from pro-growth reforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What`s at stake? The one state that may have the most on the line when it comes to President Trump`s executive orders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And modern medicine. A tiny patch that could have a big impact on monitoring your heart.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, January 30th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone. Welcome. I`m Sue Herera. Tyler Mathisen is off tonight.</p><p>Clouds formed by Washington, hung over Wall Street. Stocks stumbled following President Trump`s order Friday to tighten immigration from seven Middle Eastern countries with Muslim majority populations. The move caused confusion, legal challenges, criticism and according to some analysts, it increased uncertainty in the markets.</p><p>Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 122 points to 19,971. The NASDAQ was off 47. And the S&amp;P 500 dropped 13.</p><p>The lousy start to the week follows Dow`s historic topping of 20,000 just a few days ago. The rally since the election was sparked by the expectations that pro-growth policies like tax cuts would be enacted fairly quickly.</p><p>But as Bob Pisani reports, there is growing concern among investors that Washington`s focus is shifting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: From Trump bump to Trump slump?</p><p>The markets may have blown past its records last week, but stocks took big hit today as investors digest the key headlines and policy plans coming out of the new <person><nameText>Trump administration. </nameText></person>The problem today is investors are seeing <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>straying from themes that initially lifted stocks to new highs.</p><p>What moves the market forward? Well, that`s simple. It`s the reflation theme. It`s tax cuts and infrastructure spending. What stalls the market out is any lack of news on these stimulus measures, and when the administration focuses on more complicated issue like immigration policy and trade tensions and even Obamacare.</p><p>When there`s talk about changing the H1B visa program, a visa that`s very near and dear to the tech community, as we`re hearing this week, you can see an immediate snapback. Big tech and software names were all down because this may directly threaten their ability to bring in talent no matter where it is.</p><p>There`s also a growing worry that the tax cut issue is more complicated than it seems. The market wants a very clean, across-the-board reduction in taxes, period. But it`s being muddled by things like border adjustability taxes and caps on deductions. Beyond foreign policy fears, traders are more focused on the Fed meeting on Wednesday and the jobs report on Friday.</p><p>The Fed has a very delicate task at hand. They have to strike the perfect tone of economic bullishness without sending overly hawkish signals that could hint that they`re raising rates more rapidly than the market anticipates later this year. After all, Fed chair Janet Yellen still needs more clarity on Mr. Trump`s policies as well.</p><p>The bottom line, it`s going to be a very messy first 100 days. Earnings are slowly improving. But with so much policy uncertainty, CEOs have been reluctant to boost about 2017 earnings boost from the Trump agenda, at least so far.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And as Bob just reported, technology stocks fell today over concerns that the president`s immigration order will threaten the tech industry`s ability to bring in talent. That is a big deal for Silicon Valley which appears unified in its opposition to this executive order.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is a truly amazing group of people.</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It was just last month that then-President-elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>met with tech leaders at Trump Tower in New York City. Often at odds on the campaign trail, the two sides tried to find common ground.</p><p>So much for that truce. Now, tech has come out swinging against Trump`s executive order on immigration. CEOs and executives for most of the major tech companies voiced their concerns over the weekend, including those from Facebook, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix.</p><p>There is no issue more critical or personal in Silicon Valley than immigration. By one estimate, immigrants started more than half of the U.S. start-ups valued at $1 billion or more. And immigrants like Sundar Pichai run some of the most iconic tech companies like Google.</p><p>In response to that executive order, Pichai said, \"It`s painful to see the personal costs of this executive order on our colleagues. We`ve always made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.\"</p><p>But it is not just talk. Tech executives are also now taking action. Google co-founder Sergey Brin who emigrated to the U.S. from the Soviet Union, joined protesters at San Francisco International Airport.</p><p>Start-ups are also responding. Lyft cofounders John Zimmer and Logan Green saying they will donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years to defend the Constitution, they said. And Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is also being vocal on the issue, creating a $3 million defense fund for drivers who may be impacted by the ban.</p><p>But it is important that these tech leaders still maintain a relationship with the White House, given the range of issues in front of them, from tax reform and encryption, to anti-trust issues and trade.</p><p>It`s not yet clear what the impact of this action will be on these tech businesses because the issue is not being litigated. What is clear is that the show creates uncertainty for the sector, which sold off in today`s trading.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Other companies like Walmart, Coke and Procter and Gamble have also made statements on the immigration order. J.P. Morgan issued a memo to its employees, while Goldman Sachs CEO told his workers that his company does not support the president`s policy.</p><p>So, what will President Donald Trump`s tighter immigration policies mean for some of his other business friendly proposals?</p><p>Ed Mills joins us. He`s senior financial policy analyst at FBR Capital Markets to discuss all of this.</p><p>Welcome back, Ed. Nice to see you.</p><p>ED MILLS, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS SR. FINANCIAL POLICY ANALYST: Great to be here.</p><p>HERERA: Do you get the sense that some of the initiative that are important to the stock market like tax reform are being pushed to the side? Or is it simply that the more emotional issues are being tackled first?</p><p>MILLS: Well, what I think the markets saw when <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was elected was a kind of three-pronged, kind of reason why people were optimists. Less regulation, lower taxes, some level of fiscal stimulus. Two of those three need Congress to pass.</p><p>And what they see is that over the weekend, the administration gets off to a pretty rough start. Seeing members of his own party coming out opposed to it. And the majority in the House are pretty big, but in the Senate, you`re only with a two-person majority, so you lose two or three senators and you can`t get those tax cuts done. You can`t get that infrastructure spending done. You cannot enact the Trump agenda which is really behind a lot of the run-off in the market since the election.</p><p>HERERA: Do you anticipate that things might calm down a little bit as the president works his way through some of these initiatives?</p><p>MILLS: I do, I do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HERERA: Go ahead.</p><p>MILLS: Now, I do. I think what we`re seeing here was part of the reason why some of the other leaders in Congress have been pretty muted in response to things they had otherwise been opposed to during election, is that they see probably a once in a lifetime opportunity to get some of these things done. Paul Ryan has spent his adult life trying to do tax reform. We haven`t had a major tax reform bill in a generation.</p><p>So, once things settle down, the Republican are really going to try to drive through their agenda. And most of it can be done without the filibuster in the Senate. That`s what we see first with the Affordable Care Act. That`s what we`ll see next with tax cuts.</p><p>And more importantly, most of the regulatory things are all done through executive agencies.</p><p>HERERA: Right.</p><p>MILLS: Or folks that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>will ultimately get to put in the key personnel there, and they will run their course with or without Congress.</p><p>HERERA: But as you point out, the currency of Washington is the ability to get reelected. And there`s not as much time to do some of these complicated things like tax reform as perhaps some of the members of Congress would like.</p><p>MILLS: Yes, I mean, it`s kind of -- what I said at the election, everything is in play. Not everything is going to get done. And when you want to talk about timing, assume it takes longer. D.C. is set-up to go very slowly.</p><p>These members of Congress look at the next election. It might be an eon away from the next voter but it`s right around the corner. And they face voters and they don`t want to be on the wrong side of these policies.</p><p>So, Trump needs steady the course or pretty soon some members of his own party will abandon him and decide that they can`t go along with these policies. That`s where the policy agenda really gets threatened at that point.</p><p>HERERA: Which means we`ll be talking to you a lot, Ed. Thank you so much.</p><p>MILLS: It`s going to be interesting.</p><p>HERERA: It is.</p><p>Ed Mills with FBR Capital Markets.</p><p>So, as an investor in this politically charged environment, where should you be focused in the market?</p><p>Let`s turn to Mark Luschini. He is the chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. He has some answers for us I bet.</p><p>Good to see you again, Mark. Welcome back.</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: First of all, let`s talk about what happened specifically today. Is it political jitters or is it simply a mix of that and earnings? What did you make of it?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I took it as more the former than the latter, Sue. I mean, I think it was a little of the aftermath of what we saw, across the television over the weekend. And, obviously, it stirred some geopolitical tensions as well, as leaders around the world sort of weighing in and what it means to them and how to interact with the new <person><nameText>Trump administration, </nameText></person>given the executive orders in, the general flurry of activity in its first week in office.</p><p>At the moment, though, I think markets are going to sort of begin to refocus on earnings as we get deeper into earnings season, a more bigger, more market important companies begin to report. And that should drive the attention back to the fundamentals, which on balance at least early on this reporting season seemed to be pretty good.</p><p>HERERA: Is it possible for an investor at this point in the administration to separate out the politics from the fundamentals of the market? Or are they going to be intertwined for some time?</p><p>LUSCHINI: I think they`re going to be intertwined for some time. As the previous guest was speaking, as it related to some of these market friendly reforms that the market has already bought. I mean, that was attributed to the rally that we`ve seen since November 9, namely, of course, corporate tax reform and deregulation, to the extent things get in the way of action on those two fronts, particularly, I think it will serve as a source of distress for equity investors who again can focus on the underlying economic fundamentals.</p><p>But when prices are trading at 17 times even a little over, forward earnings estimates and a lot of expectations, in fact, almost unbridled enthusiasm for these policies to become reality get delayed, that will weigh on equity prices.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, I would assume you would agree with those a say this is the time you need to look at your financial plan. Take a look at your investment plan. Try on filter out some of the noise if you can. And stick with that.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Most definitely. I think we`re going to be dealing with this bouts of volatility, these bouts of market distress, if you will, until one, we get a full cabinet in place around <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>But as well, we start to see actual legislation be put down on paper relative to converting some of these campaign policies into more than promises. And I think at that point, which is probably more deeper into the year second, third quarter phenomenon, will market stabilize, and I begin to rally around the expectations that these will fulfill the obligation of being very market- friendly and boost corporate earnings and therefore, prices commensurate.</p><p>HERERA: All right. On that note, Mark, thank you.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Thank you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: Mark Luschini with Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>signed an executive order aimed at cutting regulations on business. And he said that agencies should eliminate two regulations for every new one. The White House later added that any new regulation should be offset by eliminating regulations with the same costs to business. It excludes regulations related to the military. He signed the order surrounded by small business owners who have often complained about their regulatory burden.</p><p>The president also said that Lockheed Martin will cut $600 million off the cost of the F-35 fighter jet program. The president said that applies to the next 90 planes. The total cost of the program is roughly $400 billion. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has repeatedly criticized for costs overruns and delays.</p><p>Still ahead, across America.</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Scott Cohn. Arguably, one state has the most on the line when it comes to Donald Trump`s executive orders. We will take you there, coming up, on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Volkswagen is once again the world`s largest automaker, selling more than 10 million cars last year. Toyota is number two.</p><p>V.W. can attribute the increase in sales to demand from China. The title comes as the automaker tries to distance itself from its global diesel emissions scandal. Volkswagen recently agreed to pay about $22 billion in settlements and plead guilty to criminal charges in the U.S.</p><p>General Motors and Honda have agreed to invest $85 million to join a joint venture that will produce hydrogen fuel cells system. The project will create 100 jobs. Production is expected to begin in 2020, at an existing GM plant that makes battery packs for hybrids.</p><p>The auto industry is the part of the heart and soul of the Michigan and no state has more at stake in President Trump`s executive orders, whether on immigration or trade. The Wolverine State voted for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>narrowly last fall. And as Scott Cohn reports from Detroit, that choice is coming into sharp focus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good afternoon. Welcome.</p><p>COHN: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>won Michigan by just 11,000 votes. His first ten days in office are putting that slim support to the test.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could this have been rolled out better without entrapping people with green cards? Those with H1B visas who work with GM and other companies?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obviously, obviously, it could have been done better. But it is what it is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are too many people coming to this country that we know nothing about.</p><p>COHN: More than just a blue collar state, Michigan is a state of immigrants. Only California took in more Syrian refugees last year. So, in Detroit, the new immigration restrictions hit home.</p><p>WALA ZEIN, SYRIAN AMERICAN: I came here seven years ago. I got married and I moved here, and is my mother, she moved here one year after the war, I applied for her. She has a green card and my father also has green card. He is actually outside of the U.S. right now.</p><p>COHN: Protests and vigils sprang up statewide over the weekend while business leaders in Michigan`s increasingly high-tech economy weighed the impact.</p><p>Michigan was already in the crosshairs of the Trump agenda on the issue of trade. No state has more on the line when it comes to the North American Free Trade agreement than this one.</p><p>Detroit is the busiest truck crossing between the U.S. and Canada, but Mexico is also a key link in the auto industry supply chain. By the numbers, Michigan`s economy depends on NAFTA in a way no other state does and economists here worry about upsetting a delicate balance.</p><p>DONALD GRIMES, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ECONOMIST: Be a bit of chaos at the beginning as they`re renegotiating because they might be confused over where the parts are going to come from for cars, or cars themselves.</p><p>COHN: The president claims he is already bringing jobs back.</p><p>TRUMP: They`re coming back by big numbers. Bigger number than people have seen. We saw Ford is announcing and has announced big plans coming back into Michigan and Ohio and different places.</p><p>COHN: Michigan bet on Trump to do just that. Now, it will learn if that bet pays off.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Scott Cohn in Detroit.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Some shareholders of Tempur Sealy might lose some sleep tonight and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Shares of the mattress maker were hammered after it cut ties with its largest customer, Mattress Firm, after the two companies failed to reach a contract agreement. Last year, Mattress Firm made up about 21 percent of Tempur Sealy`s worldwide sales. Tempur Sealy`s shares plunged 28 percent on the news to $45.49.</p><p>In an effort to obtain U.S. anti-trust approval, the drugstore chain Walgreens said it would reduce its acquisition offer for rival Rite Aid by at least $2 billion and divest even more stores. The companies also said they will push back the deadline for the deal to July. Following the news, Rite Aid shares fell more than 17 percent to $5.72. While shares of Walgreens were off 2 cents to $81.48.</p><p>Fitbit warned it wouldn`t meet its sales guidance for the latest quarter, due to weaker than expected demand during the holiday period. The fitness device maker also said it would slash about 6 percent of its global workforce, as that company works to reorganize its business. The cuts are expect to impact 110 jobs. Fitbit shares dropped about 16 percent to $6.06.</p><p>Software and equipment maker Keysight Technology said that it would take over data technology company Ixia for more than $1.5 billion. The merger is expected to expand Keysight`s global reach and add to its software portfolio. Keysight was off 2 cents to $36.99. But Ixia rose nearly 7 percent to $19.45.</p><p>And biotech company FibroGen and its China-based subsidiary said their experimental anemia drug performed well during two clinical trials. FibroGen said it plans to use the data from the testing when it files for a new drug application in China this year. Still, shares fell more than 6 percent to $21.80.</p><p>And a warning from Sony, the company plans to take a nearly $1 billion charge on its struggling music business. Sony said that decision was made after evaluating the future profitability of that unit which has lagged its competitors. And two weeks ago, the head of Sony Pictures Entertainment stepped down from his job after 13 years.</p><p>Apple reports its first quarter earnings tomorrow and investors will be paying close attention to the company guidance on iPhone sales, which continues to be that company`s biggest profit driver.</p><p>Brian White is the global head of technology at Drexel Hamilton and joins us now to discuss what he is expecting from Apple`s earning.</p><p>Good to see you. Welcome, Brian.</p><p>BRIAN WHITE, DREXEL HAMILTON GLOBAL HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY: Hey. Thanks, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: What you`re looking for, you think, is for Tim Cook to boost growth, specifically with sales, correct?</p><p>WHITE: Yes, we`ve had three consecutive quarters of iPhone declining year over year, and total sales declining. So, I think this is the quarter Apple will finally return to growth.</p><p>HERERA: And why will it be this quarter? What dynamic, if anything, has changed?</p><p>WHITE: Well, a couple of things. Number one, the negative comps start to go away. So, if you remember, when the iPhone 6 came out, it drove units up 37 percent in fiscal `15. That really hurt their fiscal `16.</p><p>So, now, we start on anniversary that. And the iPhone 7 got off to a strong start. So, if you combine both of those, I think you`re going to see 2 percent sales growth and I think you`ll see 2 percent unit growth in iPhones.</p><p>HERERA: OK. What are the expectations for the up coming iPhone X?</p><p>WHITE: You know, so, I think -- you know, this will be a September launch of 2017 is what we`re anticipating. You`re going to have a larger screen but the actual form factor won`t be bigger. And the way they`re going to do that is decrease the bezel on the screen.</p><p>So, it will be more glass, less metal. You have a lot of glass in the back. And I think because it is the tenth anniversary and it is going to be a form factor change, I think that will drive a nice upgrade.</p><p>So, you`re going start to see iPhone actually accelerate in fiscal `18 versus `17. But you`ll have growth in `17.</p><p>HERERA: You`ll have growth. What about the Macs sales? What are your expectations there and how key are they to this quarter`s results?</p><p>WHITE: So, you`re going on see a year over year decline in Macs for sure. But I do think you`re going to see better numbers than we`re projecting in the quarter. The simple reason being the Mac Book Pro I think did very well in the holidays.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, you have a buy rating on the stock. Is the target still $185?</p><p>WHITE: Yes, $185. And that`s based on `17 times -- our 2017 numbers plus the net cash per share. So --</p><p>HERERA: All right. Go ahead, Brian. Finish.</p><p>WHITE: Yes. So, it is our top pick and I think it is one of the most underappreciated stocks in the world right now.</p><p>HERERA: On that note -- Brian, thank you very much.</p><p>WHITE: Thanks.</p><p>HERERA: Brian White with Drexel Hamilton.</p><p>Coming up, modern medicine. A tiny patch that powers big data and it`s changing the way we monitor our hearts.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: More Americans signed contracts to buy homes last month. Pending home sales rose more than 1.5 percent, increasing the most in the western and southern parts of the country. The move higher may reflect an urgency among potential buyers to lock in a mortgage rate and they`ve been rising lately. Pending sales are considered a barometer of future purchases. A sale is usually completed after few months after a contract is signed.</p><p>Citigroup says it plans to exit the mortgage servicing business and turn its attention to making new loans. The bank will sell its servicing rights on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-backed loans, with $97 billion of outstanding balances to new Residential Investment Corp. Citi says that move will help cut expenses and improve shareholder returns. The deal is subject to regulatory approval.</p><p>And now to your health -- irregular heart rhythms are more common than some may think and affected as many as 6 million Americans. In serious cases, it can lead to stroke or heart failure. But our methods of monitoring heart rhythms are pretty antiquated, and that`s where small companies are trying to make some big changes.</p><p>Meg Tirrell has our latest \"Modern Medicine\" report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Gabriel Sarah`s heart is a mystery.</p><p>GABRIEL SARAH, UCSF PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIOLOGIST: It can cause sinkable episodes which are at times when I lose consciousness. I can`t see, I can`t hear. The room goes black and I can collapse.</p><p>TIRELL: Since 2012, he`s had ventricular tachycardia, causing the lower chamber of his heart to beat too fast.</p><p>His doctors don`t know why.</p><p>SARAH: I`ve had a bunch of studies, genetic studies, imaging studies, including an MRI of my heart and echo cardiograms, and everything has been negative, which is good and bad.</p><p>TIRRELL: Sarah a pediatric anetheslogist at the University of California- San Francisco is one of millions with cardiac arrhythmia or abnormal heartbeat. He says his condition, though, mysterious is well-managed. And with advancements in miniaturization and data storage, doctors say the way they monitor heart rhythms is changing, from cumbersome to convenient.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What I first saw it, my first reaction was, why didn`t I think of this?</p><p>TIRRELL: Sarah`s cardiologist fit him with his Zio patch from young San Francisco company iRhythm Technologies.</p><p>SARAH: I was worried that the picture that we were trying to paint with the monitor was not going to be complete, because the monitor was so small. But I found that in reality, the information we gathered from the Zio patch was just as comprehensive as any other monitor that I`ve ever won.</p><p>TIRRELL: Worn continuously for 14 days, the patch generates 30,000 pages of data on millions of heartbeats.</p><p>MIKE WEINSTEIN, JPM MANAGING DIRECTOR: They have more information about a normal heartbeat than any database in the world.</p><p>TIRRELL: A collection of information that becomes more useful as it grows.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That massive amount of data that gets curated by these algorithms is really under the control of a machine learned capabil9ty. And it gets smarter as we put more and more date into the database.</p><p>TIRRELL: J.P. Morgan analyst Mike Weinstein says that should lead to better diagnosis and big business -- a market opportunity of more than 10 million tests for abnormal heartbeat in the U.S. every year, worth more than a billion dollars. The Zio costs more than older ones, about $360 for Medicare, versus $100 to $150 for older monitors. And it`s suitable for every situtaiton.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s not transmitting in real-time. If someone has a worry of passing out, you want to know right away if that happens.</p><p>TIRRELL: With the hardware getting smaller, as the power of big data grows, doctors hope for increasing insights into the mysteries of the heartbeats.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSIENSS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And to read more about the new ways to monitor heart beats, head to our website, NBR.com.</p><p>On that note, that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

It's the worst  day of the year for the market as focus shifts to tighter immigration  policies and away from pro-growth reforms.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What's at stake?  The one state that may have the most on the line when it  comes to President Trump's executive orders.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And modern medicine.  A tiny patch that could have a big impact on  monitoring your heart.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  January 30th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone.  Welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is off  tonight.</p><p>Clouds formed by Washington, hung over Wall Street.  Stocks stumbled  following President Trump's order Friday to tighten immigration from seven  Middle Eastern countries with Muslim majority populations.  The move caused  confusion, legal challenges, criticism and according to some analysts, it  increased uncertainty in the markets.  </p><p>Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 122 points to 19,971.  The  NASDAQ was off 47.  And the S&amp;P 500 dropped 13.  </p><p>The lousy start to the week follows Dow's historic topping of 20,000 just a  few days ago.  The rally since the election was sparked by the expectations  that pro-growth policies like tax cuts would be enacted fairly quickly.  </p><p>But as Bob Pisani reports, there is growing concern among investors that  Washington's focus is shifting.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From Trump bump to  Trump slump?  </p><p>The markets may have blown past its records last week, but stocks took big  hit today as investors digest the key headlines and policy plans coming out  of the new Trump administration.  The problem today is investors are seeing  President Trump straying from themes that initially lifted stocks to new  highs.  </p><p>What moves the market forward?  Well, that's simple.  It's the reflation  theme.  It's tax cuts and infrastructure spending.  What stalls the market  out is any lack of news on these stimulus measures, and when the  administration focuses on more complicated issue like immigration policy  and trade tensions and even Obamacare.  </p><p>When there's talk about changing the H1B visa program, a visa that's very  near and dear to the tech community, as we're hearing this week, you can  see an immediate snapback.  Big tech and software names were all down  because this may directly threaten their ability to bring in talent no  matter where it is.  </p><p>There's also a growing worry that the tax cut issue is more complicated  than it seems.  The market wants a very clean, across-the-board reduction  in taxes, period.  But it's being muddled by things like border  adjustability taxes and caps on deductions.  Beyond foreign policy fears,  traders are more focused on the Fed meeting on Wednesday and the jobs  report on Friday.  </p><p>The Fed has a very delicate task at hand.  They have to strike the perfect  tone of economic bullishness without sending overly hawkish signals that  could hint that they're raising rates more rapidly than the market  anticipates later this year.  After all, Fed chair Janet Yellen still needs  more clarity on Mr. Trump's policies as well.  </p><p>The bottom line, it's going to be a very messy first 100 days.  Earnings  are slowly improving.  But with so much policy uncertainty, CEOs have been  reluctant to boost about 2017 earnings boost from the Trump agenda, at  least so far.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And as Bob just reported, technology stocks fell today over  concerns that the president's immigration order will threaten the tech  industry's ability to bring in talent.  That is a big deal for Silicon  Valley which appears unified in its opposition to this executive order.  </p><p>Josh Lipton has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is a truly amazing  group of people.  </p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It was just last month  that then-President-elect Donald Trump met with tech leaders at Trump Tower  in New York City.  Often at odds on the campaign trail, the two sides tried  to find common ground.  </p><p>So much for that truce.  Now, tech has come out swinging against Trump's  executive order on immigration.  CEOs and executives for most of the major  tech companies voiced their concerns over the weekend, including those from  Facebook, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix.  </p><p>There is no issue more critical or personal in Silicon Valley than  immigration.  By one estimate, immigrants started more than half of the  U.S. start-ups valued at $1 billion or more.  And immigrants like Sundar  Pichai run some of the most iconic tech companies like Google.  </p><p>In response to that executive order, Pichai said, \"It's painful to see the  personal costs of this executive order on our colleagues.  We've always  made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do  so.\"</p><p>But it is not just talk.  Tech executives are also now taking action.   Google co-founder Sergey Brin who emigrated to the U.S. from the Soviet  Union, joined protesters at San Francisco International Airport.  </p><p>Start-ups are also responding.  Lyft cofounders John Zimmer and Logan Green  saying they will donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years to  defend the Constitution, they said.  And Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is also  being vocal on the issue, creating a $3 million defense fund for drivers  who may be impacted by the ban.  </p><p>But it is important that these tech leaders still maintain a relationship  with the White House, given the range of issues in front of them, from tax  reform and encryption, to anti-trust issues and trade.  </p><p>It's not yet clear what the impact of this action will be on these tech  businesses because the issue is not being litigated.  What is clear is that  the show creates uncertainty for the sector, which sold off in today's  trading.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Other companies like Walmart, Coke and Procter and Gamble have  also made statements on the immigration order.  J.P. Morgan issued a memo  to its employees, while Goldman Sachs CEO told his workers that his company  does not support the president's policy.  </p><p>So, what will President Donald Trump's tighter immigration policies mean  for some of his other business friendly proposals?  </p><p>Ed Mills joins us.  He's senior financial policy analyst at FBR Capital  Markets to discuss all of this.  </p><p>Welcome back, Ed.  Nice to see you.  </p><p>ED MILLS, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS SR. FINANCIAL POLICY ANALYST:  Great to be  here.  </p><p>HERERA:  Do you get the sense that some of the initiative that are  important to the stock market like tax reform are being pushed to the side?   Or is it simply that the more emotional issues are being tackled first?  </p><p>MILLS:  Well, what I think the markets saw when Donald Trump was elected  was a kind of three-pronged, kind of reason why people were optimists.   Less regulation, lower taxes, some level of fiscal stimulus.  Two of those  three need Congress to pass.  </p><p>And what they see is that over the weekend, the administration gets off to  a pretty rough start.  Seeing members of his own party coming out opposed  to it.  And the majority in the House are pretty big, but in the Senate,  you're only with a two-person majority, so you lose two or three senators  and you can't get those tax cuts done.  You can't get that infrastructure  spending done.  You cannot enact the Trump agenda which is really behind a  lot of the run-off in the market since the election.  </p><p>HERERA:  Do you anticipate that things might calm down a little bit as the  president works his way through some of these initiatives?  </p><p>MILLS:  I do, I do.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HERERA:  Go ahead.  </p><p>MILLS:  Now, I do.  I think what we're seeing here was part of the reason  why some of the other leaders in Congress have been pretty muted in  response to things they had otherwise been opposed to during election, is  that they see probably a once in a lifetime opportunity to get some of  these things done.  Paul Ryan has spent his adult life trying to do tax  reform.  We haven't had a major tax reform bill in a generation.  </p><p>So, once things settle down, the Republican are really going to try to  drive through their agenda.  And most of it can be done without the  filibuster in the Senate.  That's what we see first with the Affordable  Care Act.  That's what we'll see next with tax cuts.  </p><p>And more importantly, most of the regulatory things are all done through  executive agencies.</p><p>HERERA:  Right.</p><p>MILLS:  Or folks that President Trump will ultimately get to put in the key  personnel there, and they will run their course with or without Congress.  </p><p>HERERA:  But as you point out, the currency of Washington is the ability to  get reelected.  And there's not as much time to do some of these  complicated things like tax reform as perhaps some of the members of  Congress would like.  </p><p>MILLS:  Yes, I mean, it's kind of -- what I said at the election,  everything is in play.  Not everything is going to get done.  And when you  want to talk about timing, assume it takes longer.  D.C. is set-up to go  very slowly.  </p><p>These members of Congress look at the next election.  It might be an eon  away from the next voter but it's right around the corner.  And they face  voters and they don't want to be on the wrong side of these policies.  </p><p>So, Trump needs steady the course or pretty soon some members of his own  party will abandon him and decide that they can't go along with these  policies.  That's where the policy agenda really gets threatened at that  point.  </p><p>HERERA:  Which means we'll be talking to you a lot, Ed.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>MILLS:  It's going to be interesting.  </p><p>HERERA:  It is.  </p><p>Ed Mills with FBR Capital Markets.</p><p>So, as an investor in this politically charged environment, where should  you be focused in the market?  </p><p>Let's turn to Mark Luschini.  He is the chief investment strategist at  Janney Montgomery Scott.  He has some answers for us I bet.</p><p>Good to see you again, Mark.  Welcome back.</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  First of all, let's talk about what happened specifically today.   Is it political jitters or is it simply a mix of that and earnings?  What  did you make of it?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  I took it as more the former than the latter, Sue.  I mean, I  think it was a little of the aftermath of what we saw, across the  television over the weekend.  And, obviously, it stirred some geopolitical  tensions as well, as leaders around the world sort of weighing in and what  it means to them and how to interact with the new Trump administration,  given the executive orders in, the general flurry of activity in its first  week in office.  </p><p>At the moment, though, I think markets are going to sort of begin to  refocus on earnings as we get deeper into earnings season, a more bigger,  more market important companies begin to report.  And that should drive the  attention back to the fundamentals, which on balance at least early on this  reporting season seemed to be pretty good.  </p><p>HERERA:  Is it possible for an investor at this point in the administration  to separate out the politics from the fundamentals of the market?  Or are  they going to be intertwined for some time?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  I think they're going to be intertwined for some time.  As the  previous guest was speaking, as it related to some of these market friendly  reforms that the market has already bought.  I mean, that was attributed to  the rally that we've seen since November 9, namely, of course, corporate  tax reform and deregulation, to the extent things get in the way of action  on those two fronts, particularly, I think it will serve as a source of  distress for equity investors who again can focus on the underlying  economic fundamentals.  </p><p>But when prices are trading at 17 times even a little over, forward  earnings estimates and a lot of expectations, in fact, almost unbridled  enthusiasm for these policies to become reality get delayed, that will  weigh on equity prices.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, I would assume you would agree with those a say this is the  time you need to look at your financial plan.  Take a look at your  investment plan.  Try on filter out some of the noise if you can.  And  stick with that.  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  Most definitely.  I think we're going to be dealing with this  bouts of volatility, these bouts of market distress, if you will, until  one, we get a full cabinet in place around Donald Trump.  But as well, we  start to see actual legislation be put down on paper relative to converting  some of these campaign policies into more than promises.  And I think at  that point, which is probably more deeper into the year second, third  quarter phenomenon, will market stabilize, and I begin to rally around the  expectations that these will fulfill the obligation of being very market- friendly and boost corporate earnings and therefore, prices commensurate.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that note, Mark, thank you.  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  Thank you, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  Mark Luschini with Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at cutting regulations on  business.  And he said that agencies should eliminate two regulations for  every new one.  The White House later added that any new regulation should  be offset by eliminating regulations with the same costs to business.  It  excludes regulations related to the military.  He signed the order  surrounded by small business owners who have often complained about their  regulatory burden.  </p><p>The president also said that Lockheed Martin will cut $600 million off the  cost of the F-35 fighter jet program.  The president said that applies to  the next 90 planes.  The total cost of the program is roughly $400 billion.   President Trump has repeatedly criticized for costs overruns and delays.  </p><p>Still ahead, across America.  </p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Scott Cohn.   Arguably, one state has the most on the line when it comes to Donald  Trump's executive orders.  We will take you there, coming up, on NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Volkswagen is once again the world's largest automaker, selling  more than 10 million cars last year.  Toyota is number two.  </p><p>V.W. can attribute the increase in sales to demand from China.  The title  comes as the automaker tries to distance itself from its global diesel  emissions scandal.  Volkswagen recently agreed to pay about $22 billion in  settlements and plead guilty to criminal charges in the U.S. </p><p>General Motors and Honda have agreed to invest $85 million to join a joint  venture that will produce hydrogen fuel cells system.  The project will  create 100 jobs.  Production is expected to begin in 2020, at an existing  GM plant that makes battery packs for hybrids.</p><p>The auto industry is the part of the heart and soul of the Michigan and no  state has more at stake in President Trump's executive orders, whether on  immigration or trade.  The Wolverine State voted for Donald Trump narrowly  last fall.  And as Scott Cohn reports from Detroit, that choice is coming  into sharp focus.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good afternoon.  Welcome.  </p><p>COHN:  Donald Trump won Michigan by just 11,000 votes.  His first ten days  in office are putting that slim support to the test.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could this have been rolled out better without  entrapping people with green cards?  Those with H1B visas who work with GM  and other companies?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Obviously, obviously, it could have been done better.   But it is what it is.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are too many people coming to this country that  we know nothing about.  </p><p>COHN:  More than just a blue collar state, Michigan is a state of  immigrants.  Only California took in more Syrian refugees last year.  So,  in Detroit, the new immigration restrictions hit home.  </p><p>WALA ZEIN, SYRIAN AMERICAN:  I came here seven years ago.  I got married  and I moved here, and is my mother, she moved here one year after the war,  I applied for her.  She has a green card and my father also has green card.   He is actually outside of the U.S. right now.</p><p>COHN:  Protests and vigils sprang up statewide over the weekend while  business leaders in Michigan's increasingly high-tech economy weighed the  impact.  </p><p>Michigan was already in the crosshairs of the Trump agenda on the issue of  trade.  No state has more on the line when it comes to the North American  Free Trade agreement than this one.</p><p>Detroit is the busiest truck crossing between the U.S. and Canada, but  Mexico is also a key link in the auto industry supply chain.  By the  numbers, Michigan's economy depends on NAFTA in a way no other state does  and economists here worry about upsetting a delicate balance.  </p><p>DONALD GRIMES, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ECONOMIST:  Be a bit of chaos at the  beginning as they're renegotiating because they might be confused over  where the parts are going to come from for cars, or cars themselves.  </p><p>COHN:  The president claims he is already bringing jobs back.  </p><p>TRUMP:  They're coming back by big numbers.  Bigger number than people have  seen.  We saw Ford is announcing and has announced big plans coming back  into Michigan and Ohio and different places.  </p><p>COHN:  Michigan bet on Trump to do just that.  Now, it will learn if that  bet pays off.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Scott Cohn in Detroit.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Some shareholders of Tempur Sealy might lose some sleep tonight  and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>Shares of the mattress maker were hammered after it cut ties with its  largest customer, Mattress Firm, after the two companies failed to reach a  contract agreement.  Last year, Mattress Firm made up about 21 percent of  Tempur Sealy's worldwide sales.  Tempur Sealy's shares plunged 28 percent  on the news to $45.49.  </p><p>In an effort to obtain U.S. anti-trust approval, the drugstore chain  Walgreens said it would reduce its acquisition offer for rival Rite Aid by  at least $2 billion and divest even more stores.  The companies also said  they will push back the deadline for the deal to July.  Following the news,  Rite Aid shares fell more than 17 percent to $5.72.  While shares of  Walgreens were off 2 cents to $81.48.</p><p>Fitbit warned it wouldn't meet its sales guidance for the latest quarter,  due to weaker than expected demand during the holiday period.  The fitness  device maker also said it would slash about 6 percent of its global  workforce, as that company works to reorganize its business.  The cuts are  expect to impact 110 jobs.  Fitbit shares dropped about 16 percent to  $6.06.  </p><p>Software and equipment maker Keysight Technology said that it would take  over data technology company Ixia for more than $1.5 billion.  The merger  is expected to expand Keysight's global reach and add to its software  portfolio.  Keysight was off 2 cents to $36.99.  But Ixia rose nearly 7  percent to $19.45.  </p><p>And biotech company FibroGen and its China-based subsidiary said their  experimental anemia drug performed well during two clinical trials.   FibroGen said it plans to use the data from the testing when it files for a  new drug application in China this year.  Still, shares fell more than 6  percent to $21.80.  </p><p>And a warning from Sony, the company plans to take a nearly $1 billion  charge on its struggling music business.  Sony said that decision was made  after evaluating the future profitability of that unit which has lagged its  competitors.  And two weeks ago, the head of Sony Pictures Entertainment  stepped down from his job after 13 years.  </p><p>Apple reports its first quarter earnings tomorrow and investors will be  paying close attention to the company guidance on iPhone sales, which  continues to be that company's biggest profit driver.  </p><p>Brian White is the global head of technology at Drexel Hamilton and joins  us now to discuss what he is expecting from Apple's earning.  </p><p>Good to see you.  Welcome, Brian.</p><p>BRIAN WHITE, DREXEL HAMILTON GLOBAL HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY:  Hey.  Thanks, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  What you're looking for, you think, is for Tim Cook to boost  growth, specifically with sales, correct?  </p><p>WHITE:  Yes, we've had three consecutive quarters of iPhone declining year  over year, and total sales declining.  So, I think this is the quarter  Apple will finally return to growth.  </p><p>HERERA:  And why will it be this quarter?  What dynamic, if anything, has  changed?  </p><p>WHITE:  Well, a couple of things.  Number one, the negative comps start to  go away.  So, if you remember, when the iPhone 6 came out, it drove units  up 37 percent in fiscal '15.  That really hurt their fiscal '16.  </p><p>So, now, we start on anniversary that.  And the iPhone 7 got off to a  strong start.  So, if you combine both of those, I think you're going to  see 2 percent sales growth and I think you'll see 2 percent unit growth in  iPhones. </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  What are the expectations for the up coming iPhone X?  </p><p>WHITE:  You know, so, I think -- you know, this will be a September launch  of 2017 is what we're anticipating.  You're going to have a larger screen  but the actual form factor won't be bigger.  And the way they're going to  do that is decrease the bezel on the screen.</p><p>So, it will be more glass, less metal.  You have a lot of glass in the  back.  And I think because it is the tenth anniversary and it is going to  be a form factor change, I think that will drive a nice upgrade.  </p><p>So, you're going start to see iPhone actually accelerate in fiscal '18  versus '17.  But you'll have growth in '17.  </p><p>HERERA:  You'll have growth.  What about the Macs sales?  What are your  expectations there and how key are they to this quarter's results?</p><p>WHITE:  So, you're going on see a year over year decline in Macs for sure.   But I do think you're going to see better numbers than we're projecting in  the quarter.  The simple reason being the Mac Book Pro I think did very  well in the holidays.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, you have a buy rating on the stock.  Is the target still  $185?  </p><p>WHITE:  Yes, $185.  And that's based on '17 times -- our 2017 numbers plus  the net cash per share.  So -- </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Go ahead, Brian.  Finish.</p><p>WHITE:  Yes.  So, it is our top pick and I think it is one of the most  underappreciated stocks in the world right now.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note -- Brian, thank you very much.  </p><p>WHITE:  Thanks.</p><p>HERERA:  Brian White with Drexel Hamilton.</p><p>Coming up, modern medicine.  A tiny patch that powers big data and it's  changing the way we monitor our hearts.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  More Americans signed contracts to buy homes last month.  Pending  home sales rose more than 1.5 percent, increasing the most in the western  and southern parts of the country.  The move higher may reflect an urgency  among potential buyers to lock in a mortgage rate and they've been rising  lately.  Pending sales are considered a barometer of future purchases.  A  sale is usually completed after few months after a contract is signed.  </p><p>Citigroup says it plans to exit the mortgage servicing business and turn  its attention to making new loans.  The bank will sell its servicing rights  on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-backed loans, with $97 billion of outstanding  balances to new Residential Investment Corp.Citi says that move will help  cut expenses and improve shareholder returns.  The deal is subject to  regulatory approval.  </p><p>And now to your health -- irregular heart rhythms are more common than some  may think and affected as many as 6 million Americans.  In serious cases,  it can lead to stroke or heart failure.  But our methods of monitoring  heart rhythms are pretty antiquated, and that's where small companies are  trying to make some big changes.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell has our latest \"Modern Medicine\" report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Gabriel Sarah's heart  is a mystery.  </p><p>GABRIEL SARAH, UCSF PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIOLOGIST:  It can cause sinkable  episodes which are at times when I lose consciousness.  I can't see, I  can't hear.  The room goes black and I can collapse.  </p><p>TIRELL:  Since 2012, he's had ventricular tachycardia, causing the lower  chamber of his heart to beat too fast.  </p><p>His doctors don't know why.  </p><p>SARAH:  I've had a bunch of studies, genetic studies, imaging studies,  including an MRI of my heart and echo cardiograms, and everything has been  negative, which is good and bad.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Sarah a pediatric anetheslogist at the University of California- San Francisco is one of millions with cardiac arrhythmia or abnormal  heartbeat.  He says his condition, though, mysterious is well-managed.  And  with advancements in miniaturization and data storage, doctors say the way  they monitor heart rhythms is changing, from cumbersome to convenient.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What I first saw it, my first reaction was, why didn't  I think of this?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Sarah's cardiologist fit him with his Zio patch from young San  Francisco company iRhythm Technologies.  </p><p>SARAH:  I was worried that the picture that we were trying to paint with  the monitor was not going to be complete, because the monitor was so small.   But I found that in reality, the information we gathered from the Zio patch  was just as comprehensive as any other monitor that I've ever won.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Worn continuously for 14 days, the patch generates 30,000 pages  of data on millions of heartbeats.  </p><p>MIKE WEINSTEIN, JPM MANAGING DIRECTOR:  They have more information about a  normal heartbeat than any database in the world.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  A collection of information that becomes more useful as it grows.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That massive amount of data that gets curated by these  algorithms is really under the control of a machine learned capabil9ty.   And it gets smarter as we put more and more date into the database.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  J.P. Morgan analyst Mike Weinstein says that should lead to  better diagnosis and big business -- a market opportunity of more than 10  million tests for abnormal heartbeat in the U.S. every year, worth more  than a billion dollars.  The Zio costs more than older ones, about $360 for  Medicare, versus $100 to $150 for older monitors.  And it's suitable for  every situtaiton.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's not transmitting in real-time.  If someone has a  worry of passing out, you want to know right away if that happens.</p><p>TIRRELL:  With the hardware getting smaller, as the power of big data  grows, doctors hope for increasing insights into the mysteries of the  heartbeats.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSIENSS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And to read more about the new ways to monitor heart beats, head  to our website, NBR.com.  </p><p>On that note, that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm  Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.  Have a great evening.

It's the worst  day of the year for the market as focus shifts to tighter immigration  policies and away from pro-growth reforms.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What's at stake?  The one state that may have the most on the line when it  comes to President Trump's executive orders.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And modern medicine.  A tiny patch that could have a big impact on  monitoring your heart.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  January 30th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone.  Welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is off  tonight.</p><p>Clouds formed by Washington, hung over Wall Street.  Stocks stumbled  following President Trump's order Friday to tighten immigration from seven  Middle Eastern countries with Muslim majority populations.  The move caused  confusion, legal challenges, criticism and according to some analysts, it  increased uncertainty in the markets.  </p><p>Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 122 points to 19,971.  The  NASDAQ was off 47.  And the S&amp;P 500 dropped 13.  </p><p>The lousy start to the week follows Dow's historic topping of 20,000 just a  few days ago.  The rally since the election was sparked by the expectations  that pro-growth policies like tax cuts would be enacted fairly quickly.  </p><p>But as Bob Pisani reports, there is growing concern among investors that  Washington's focus is shifting.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From Trump bump to  Trump slump?  </p><p>The markets may have blown past its records last week, but stocks took big  hit today as investors digest the key headlines and policy plans coming out  of the new Trump administration.  The problem today is investors are seeing  President Trump straying from themes that initially lifted stocks to new  highs.  </p><p>What moves the market forward?  Well, that's simple.  It's the reflation  theme.  It's tax cuts and infrastructure spending.  What stalls the market  out is any lack of news on these stimulus measures, and when the  administration focuses on more complicated issue like immigration policy  and trade tensions and even Obamacare.  </p><p>When there's talk about changing the H1B visa program, a visa that's very  near and dear to the tech community, as we're hearing this week, you can  see an immediate snapback.  Big tech and software names were all down  because this may directly threaten their ability to bring in talent no  matter where it is.  </p><p>There's also a growing worry that the tax cut issue is more complicated  than it seems.  The market wants a very clean, across-the-board reduction  in taxes, period.  But it's being muddled by things like border  adjustability taxes and caps on deductions.  Beyond foreign policy fears,  traders are more focused on the Fed meeting on Wednesday and the jobs  report on Friday.  </p><p>The Fed has a very delicate task at hand.  They have to strike the perfect  tone of economic bullishness without sending overly hawkish signals that  could hint that they're raising rates more rapidly than the market  anticipates later this year.  After all, Fed chair Janet Yellen still needs  more clarity on Mr. Trump's policies as well.  </p><p>The bottom line, it's going to be a very messy first 100 days.  Earnings  are slowly improving.  But with so much policy uncertainty, CEOs have been  reluctant to boost about 2017 earnings boost from the Trump agenda, at  least so far.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And as Bob just reported, technology stocks fell today over  concerns that the president's immigration order will threaten the tech  industry's ability to bring in talent.  That is a big deal for Silicon  Valley which appears unified in its opposition to this executive order.  </p><p>Josh Lipton has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is a truly amazing  group of people.  </p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It was just last month  that then-President-elect Donald Trump met with tech leaders at Trump Tower  in New York City.  Often at odds on the campaign trail, the two sides tried  to find common ground.  </p><p>So much for that truce.  Now, tech has come out swinging against Trump's  executive order on immigration.  CEOs and executives for most of the major  tech companies voiced their concerns over the weekend, including those from  Facebook, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix.  </p><p>There is no issue more critical or personal in Silicon Valley than  immigration.  By one estimate, immigrants started more than half of the  U.S. start-ups valued at $1 billion or more.  And immigrants like Sundar  Pichai run some of the most iconic tech companies like Google.  </p><p>In response to that executive order, Pichai said, \"It's painful to see the  personal costs of this executive order on our colleagues.  We've always  made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do  so.\"</p><p>But it is not just talk.  Tech executives are also now taking action.   Google co-founder Sergey Brin who emigrated to the U.S. from the Soviet  Union, joined protesters at San Francisco International Airport.  </p><p>Start-ups are also responding.  Lyft cofounders John Zimmer and Logan Green  saying they will donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years to  defend the Constitution, they said.  And Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is also  being vocal on the issue, creating a $3 million defense fund for drivers  who may be impacted by the ban.  </p><p>But it is important that these tech leaders still maintain a relationship  with the White House, given the range of issues in front of them, from tax  reform and encryption, to anti-trust issues and trade.  </p><p>It's not yet clear what the impact of this action will be on these tech  businesses because the issue is not being litigated.  What is clear is that  the show creates uncertainty for the sector, which sold off in today's  trading.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Other companies like Walmart, Coke and Procter and Gamble have  also made statements on the immigration order.  J.P. Morgan issued a memo  to its employees, while Goldman Sachs CEO told his workers that his company  does not support the president's policy.  </p><p>So, what will President Donald Trump's tighter immigration policies mean  for some of his other business friendly proposals?  </p><p>Ed Mills joins us.  He's senior financial policy analyst at FBR Capital  Markets to discuss all of this.  </p><p>Welcome back, Ed.  Nice to see you.  </p><p>ED MILLS, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS SR. FINANCIAL POLICY ANALYST:  Great to be  here.  </p><p>HERERA:  Do you get the sense that some of the initiative that are  important to the stock market like tax reform are being pushed to the side?   Or is it simply that the more emotional issues are being tackled first?  </p><p>MILLS:  Well, what I think the markets saw when Donald Trump was elected  was a kind of three-pronged, kind of reason why people were optimists.   Less regulation, lower taxes, some level of fiscal stimulus.  Two of those  three need Congress to pass.  </p><p>And what they see is that over the weekend, the administration gets off to  a pretty rough start.  Seeing members of his own party coming out opposed  to it.  And the majority in the House are pretty big, but in the Senate,  you're only with a two-person majority, so you lose two or three senators  and you can't get those tax cuts done.  You can't get that infrastructure  spending done.  You cannot enact the Trump agenda which is really behind a  lot of the run-off in the market since the election.  </p><p>HERERA:  Do you anticipate that things might calm down a little bit as the  president works his way through some of these initiatives?  </p><p>MILLS:  I do, I do.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HERERA:  Go ahead.  </p><p>MILLS:  Now, I do.  I think what we're seeing here was part of the reason  why some of the other leaders in Congress have been pretty muted in  response to things they had otherwise been opposed to during election, is  that they see probably a once in a lifetime opportunity to get some of  these things done.  Paul Ryan has spent his adult life trying to do tax  reform.  We haven't had a major tax reform bill in a generation.  </p><p>So, once things settle down, the Republican are really going to try to  drive through their agenda.  And most of it can be done without the  filibuster in the Senate.  That's what we see first with the Affordable  Care Act.  That's what we'll see next with tax cuts.  </p><p>And more importantly, most of the regulatory things are all done through  executive agencies.</p><p>HERERA:  Right.</p><p>MILLS:  Or folks that President Trump will ultimately get to put in the key  personnel there, and they will run their course with or without Congress.  </p><p>HERERA:  But as you point out, the currency of Washington is the ability to  get reelected.  And there's not as much time to do some of these  complicated things like tax reform as perhaps some of the members of  Congress would like.  </p><p>MILLS:  Yes, I mean, it's kind of -- what I said at the election,  everything is in play.  Not everything is going to get done.  And when you  want to talk about timing, assume it takes longer.  D.C. is set-up to go  very slowly.  </p><p>These members of Congress look at the next election.  It might be an eon  away from the next voter but it's right around the corner.  And they face  voters and they don't want to be on the wrong side of these policies.  </p><p>So, Trump needs steady the course or pretty soon some members of his own  party will abandon him and decide that they can't go along with these  policies.  That's where the policy agenda really gets threatened at that  point.  </p><p>HERERA:  Which means we'll be talking to you a lot, Ed.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>MILLS:  It's going to be interesting.  </p><p>HERERA:  It is.  </p><p>Ed Mills with FBR Capital Markets.</p><p>So, as an investor in this politically charged environment, where should  you be focused in the market?  </p><p>Let's turn to Mark Luschini.  He is the chief investment strategist at  Janney Montgomery Scott.  He has some answers for us I bet.</p><p>Good to see you again, Mark.  Welcome back.</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  First of all, let's talk about what happened specifically today.   Is it political jitters or is it simply a mix of that and earnings?  What  did you make of it?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  I took it as more the former than the latter, Sue.  I mean, I  think it was a little of the aftermath of what we saw, across the  television over the weekend.  And, obviously, it stirred some geopolitical  tensions as well, as leaders around the world sort of weighing in and what  it means to them and how to interact with the new Trump administration,  given the executive orders in, the general flurry of activity in its first  week in office.  </p><p>At the moment, though, I think markets are going to sort of begin to  refocus on earnings as we get deeper into earnings season, a more bigger,  more market important companies begin to report.  And that should drive the  attention back to the fundamentals, which on balance at least early on this  reporting season seemed to be pretty good.  </p><p>HERERA:  Is it possible for an investor at this point in the administration  to separate out the politics from the fundamentals of the market?  Or are  they going to be intertwined for some time?  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  I think they're going to be intertwined for some time.  As the  previous guest was speaking, as it related to some of these market friendly  reforms that the market has already bought.  I mean, that was attributed to  the rally that we've seen since November 9, namely, of course, corporate  tax reform and deregulation, to the extent things get in the way of action  on those two fronts, particularly, I think it will serve as a source of  distress for equity investors who again can focus on the underlying  economic fundamentals.  </p><p>But when prices are trading at 17 times even a little over, forward  earnings estimates and a lot of expectations, in fact, almost unbridled  enthusiasm for these policies to become reality get delayed, that will  weigh on equity prices.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, I would assume you would agree with those a say this is the  time you need to look at your financial plan.  Take a look at your  investment plan.  Try on filter out some of the noise if you can.  And  stick with that.  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  Most definitely.  I think we're going to be dealing with this  bouts of volatility, these bouts of market distress, if you will, until  one, we get a full cabinet in place around Donald Trump.  But as well, we  start to see actual legislation be put down on paper relative to converting  some of these campaign policies into more than promises.  And I think at  that point, which is probably more deeper into the year second, third  quarter phenomenon, will market stabilize, and I begin to rally around the  expectations that these will fulfill the obligation of being very market- friendly and boost corporate earnings and therefore, prices commensurate.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that note, Mark, thank you.  </p><p>LUSCHINI:  Thank you, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  Mark Luschini with Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at cutting regulations on  business.  And he said that agencies should eliminate two regulations for  every new one.  The White House later added that any new regulation should  be offset by eliminating regulations with the same costs to business.  It  excludes regulations related to the military.  He signed the order  surrounded by small business owners who have often complained about their  regulatory burden.  </p><p>The president also said that Lockheed Martin will cut $600 million off the  cost of the F-35 fighter jet program.  The president said that applies to  the next 90 planes.  The total cost of the program is roughly $400 billion.   President Trump has repeatedly criticized for costs overruns and delays.  </p><p>Still ahead, across America.  </p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Scott Cohn.   Arguably, one state has the most on the line when it comes to Donald  Trump's executive orders.  We will take you there, coming up, on NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Volkswagen is once again the world's largest automaker, selling  more than 10 million cars last year.  Toyota is number two.  </p><p>V.W. can attribute the increase in sales to demand from China.  The title  comes as the automaker tries to distance itself from its global diesel  emissions scandal.  Volkswagen recently agreed to pay about $22 billion in  settlements and plead guilty to criminal charges in the U.S. </p><p>General Motors and Honda have agreed to invest $85 million to join a joint  venture that will produce hydrogen fuel cells system.  The project will  create 100 jobs.  Production is expected to begin in 2020, at an existing  GM plant that makes battery packs for hybrids.</p><p>The auto industry is the part of the heart and soul of the Michigan and no  state has more at stake in President Trump's executive orders, whether on  immigration or trade.  The Wolverine State voted for Donald Trump narrowly  last fall.  And as Scott Cohn reports from Detroit, that choice is coming  into sharp focus.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good afternoon.  Welcome.  </p><p>COHN:  Donald Trump won Michigan by just 11,000 votes.  His first ten days  in office are putting that slim support to the test.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Could this have been rolled out better without  entrapping people with green cards?  Those with H1B visas who work with GM  and other companies?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Obviously, obviously, it could have been done better.   But it is what it is.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are too many people coming to this country that  we know nothing about.  </p><p>COHN:  More than just a blue collar state, Michigan is a state of  immigrants.  Only California took in more Syrian refugees last year.  So,  in Detroit, the new immigration restrictions hit home.  </p><p>WALA ZEIN, SYRIAN AMERICAN:  I came here seven years ago.  I got married  and I moved here, and is my mother, she moved here one year after the war,  I applied for her.  She has a green card and my father also has green card.   He is actually outside of the U.S. right now.</p><p>COHN:  Protests and vigils sprang up statewide over the weekend while  business leaders in Michigan's increasingly high-tech economy weighed the  impact.  </p><p>Michigan was already in the crosshairs of the Trump agenda on the issue of  trade.  No state has more on the line when it comes to the North American  Free Trade agreement than this one.</p><p>Detroit is the busiest truck crossing between the U.S. and Canada, but  Mexico is also a key link in the auto industry supply chain.  By the  numbers, Michigan's economy depends on NAFTA in a way no other state does  and economists here worry about upsetting a delicate balance.  </p><p>DONALD GRIMES, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ECONOMIST:  Be a bit of chaos at the  beginning as they're renegotiating because they might be confused over  where the parts are going to come from for cars, or cars themselves.  </p><p>COHN:  The president claims he is already bringing jobs back.  </p><p>TRUMP:  They're coming back by big numbers.  Bigger number than people have  seen.  We saw Ford is announcing and has announced big plans coming back  into Michigan and Ohio and different places.  </p><p>COHN:  Michigan bet on Trump to do just that.  Now, it will learn if that  bet pays off.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Scott Cohn in Detroit.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Some shareholders of Tempur Sealy might lose some sleep tonight  and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>Shares of the mattress maker were hammered after it cut ties with its  largest customer, Mattress Firm, after the two companies failed to reach a  contract agreement.  Last year, Mattress Firm made up about 21 percent of  Tempur Sealy's worldwide sales.  Tempur Sealy's shares plunged 28 percent  on the news to $45.49.  </p><p>In an effort to obtain U.S. anti-trust approval, the drugstore chain  Walgreens said it would reduce its acquisition offer for rival Rite Aid by  at least $2 billion and divest even more stores.  The companies also said  they will push back the deadline for the deal to July.  Following the news,  Rite Aid shares fell more than 17 percent to $5.72.  While shares of  Walgreens were off 2 cents to $81.48.</p><p>Fitbit warned it wouldn't meet its sales guidance for the latest quarter,  due to weaker than expected demand during the holiday period.  The fitness  device maker also said it would slash about 6 percent of its global  workforce, as that company works to reorganize its business.  The cuts are  expect to impact 110 jobs.  Fitbit shares dropped about 16 percent to  $6.06.  </p><p>Software and equipment maker Keysight Technology said that it would take  over data technology company Ixia for more than $1.5 billion.  The merger  is expected to expand Keysight's global reach and add to its software  portfolio.  Keysight was off 2 cents to $36.99.  But Ixia rose nearly 7  percent to $19.45.  </p><p>And biotech company FibroGen and its China-based subsidiary said their  experimental anemia drug performed well during two clinical trials.   FibroGen said it plans to use the data from the testing when it files for a  new drug application in China this year.  Still, shares fell more than 6  percent to $21.80.  </p><p>And a warning from Sony, the company plans to take a nearly $1 billion  charge on its struggling music business.  Sony said that decision was made  after evaluating the future profitability of that unit which has lagged its  competitors.  And two weeks ago, the head of Sony Pictures Entertainment  stepped down from his job after 13 years.  </p><p>Apple reports its first quarter earnings tomorrow and investors will be  paying close attention to the company guidance on iPhone sales, which  continues to be that company's biggest profit driver.  </p><p>Brian White is the global head of technology at Drexel Hamilton and joins  us now to discuss what he is expecting from Apple's earning.  </p><p>Good to see you.  Welcome, Brian.</p><p>BRIAN WHITE, DREXEL HAMILTON GLOBAL HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY:  Hey.  Thanks, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  What you're looking for, you think, is for Tim Cook to boost  growth, specifically with sales, correct?  </p><p>WHITE:  Yes, we've had three consecutive quarters of iPhone declining year  over year, and total sales declining.  So, I think this is the quarter  Apple will finally return to growth.  </p><p>HERERA:  And why will it be this quarter?  What dynamic, if anything, has  changed?  </p><p>WHITE:  Well, a couple of things.  Number one, the negative comps start to  go away.  So, if you remember, when the iPhone 6 came out, it drove units  up 37 percent in fiscal '15.  That really hurt their fiscal '16.  </p><p>So, now, we start on anniversary that.  And the iPhone 7 got off to a  strong start.  So, if you combine both of those, I think you're going to  see 2 percent sales growth and I think you'll see 2 percent unit growth in  iPhones. </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  What are the expectations for the up coming iPhone X?  </p><p>WHITE:  You know, so, I think -- you know, this will be a September launch  of 2017 is what we're anticipating.  You're going to have a larger screen  but the actual form factor won't be bigger.  And the way they're going to  do that is decrease the bezel on the screen.</p><p>So, it will be more glass, less metal.  You have a lot of glass in the  back.  And I think because it is the tenth anniversary and it is going to  be a form factor change, I think that will drive a nice upgrade.  </p><p>So, you're going start to see iPhone actually accelerate in fiscal '18  versus '17.  But you'll have growth in '17.  </p><p>HERERA:  You'll have growth.  What about the Macs sales?  What are your  expectations there and how key are they to this quarter's results?</p><p>WHITE:  So, you're going on see a year over year decline in Macs for sure.   But I do think you're going to see better numbers than we're projecting in  the quarter.  The simple reason being the Mac Book Pro I think did very  well in the holidays.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, you have a buy rating on the stock.  Is the target still  $185?  </p><p>WHITE:  Yes, $185.  And that's based on '17 times -- our 2017 numbers plus  the net cash per share.  So -- </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Go ahead, Brian.  Finish.</p><p>WHITE:  Yes.  So, it is our top pick and I think it is one of the most  underappreciated stocks in the world right now.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note -- Brian, thank you very much.  </p><p>WHITE:  Thanks.</p><p>HERERA:  Brian White with Drexel Hamilton.</p><p>Coming up, modern medicine.  A tiny patch that powers big data and it's  changing the way we monitor our hearts.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  More Americans signed contracts to buy homes last month.  Pending  home sales rose more than 1.5 percent, increasing the most in the western  and southern parts of the country.  The move higher may reflect an urgency  among potential buyers to lock in a mortgage rate and they've been rising  lately.  Pending sales are considered a barometer of future purchases.  A  sale is usually completed after few months after a contract is signed.  </p><p>Citigroup says it plans to exit the mortgage servicing business and turn  its attention to making new loans.  The bank will sell its servicing rights  on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-backed loans, with $97 billion of outstanding  balances to new Residential Investment Corp.Citi says that move will help  cut expenses and improve shareholder returns.  The deal is subject to  regulatory approval.  </p><p>And now to your health -- irregular heart rhythms are more common than some  may think and affected as many as 6 million Americans.  In serious cases,  it can lead to stroke or heart failure.  But our methods of monitoring  heart rhythms are pretty antiquated, and that's where small companies are  trying to make some big changes.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell has our latest \"Modern Medicine\" report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Gabriel Sarah's heart  is a mystery.  </p><p>GABRIEL SARAH, UCSF PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIOLOGIST:  It can cause sinkable  episodes which are at times when I lose consciousness.  I can't see, I  can't hear.  The room goes black and I can collapse.  </p><p>TIRELL:  Since 2012, he's had ventricular tachycardia, causing the lower  chamber of his heart to beat too fast.  </p><p>His doctors don't know why.  </p><p>SARAH:  I've had a bunch of studies, genetic studies, imaging studies,  including an MRI of my heart and echo cardiograms, and everything has been  negative, which is good and bad.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Sarah a pediatric anetheslogist at the University of California- San Francisco is one of millions with cardiac arrhythmia or abnormal  heartbeat.  He says his condition, though, mysterious is well-managed.  And  with advancements in miniaturization and data storage, doctors say the way  they monitor heart rhythms is changing, from cumbersome to convenient.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What I first saw it, my first reaction was, why didn't  I think of this?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Sarah's cardiologist fit him with his Zio patch from young San  Francisco company iRhythm Technologies.  </p><p>SARAH:  I was worried that the picture that we were trying to paint with  the monitor was not going to be complete, because the monitor was so small.   But I found that in reality, the information we gathered from the Zio patch  was just as comprehensive as any other monitor that I've ever won.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Worn continuously for 14 days, the patch generates 30,000 pages  of data on millions of heartbeats.  </p><p>MIKE WEINSTEIN, JPM MANAGING DIRECTOR:  They have more information about a  normal heartbeat than any database in the world.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  A collection of information that becomes more useful as it grows.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That massive amount of data that gets curated by these  algorithms is really under the control of a machine learned capabil9ty.   And it gets smarter as we put more and more date into the database.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  J.P. Morgan analyst Mike Weinstein says that should lead to  better diagnosis and big business -- a market opportunity of more than 10  million tests for abnormal heartbeat in the U.S. every year, worth more  than a billion dollars.  The Zio costs more than older ones, about $360 for  Medicare, versus $100 to $150 for older monitors.  And it's suitable for  every situtaiton.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's not transmitting in real-time.  If someone has a  worry of passing out, you want to know right away if that happens.</p><p>TIRRELL:  With the hardware getting smaller, as the power of big data  grows, doctors hope for increasing insights into the mysteries of the  heartbeats.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSIENSS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And to read more about the new ways to monitor heart beats, head  to our website, NBR.com.  </p><p>On that note, that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm  Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.  Have a great evening.

Sue is off tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You know, believe it or not, we are halfway through 2019, so we`re going to spend this evening looking at the outlook for the second half of the year, for everything from the markets, to the Fed, to housing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we begin tonight with stocks and the economy. This year, performance has been a bit bumpy. Stock rallies have given way to new highs, but there have been some sharp and severe slumps as well. And at the center of most of those moves has been the Federal Reserve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have two reports on that tonight. To start with, we have Steve Liesman who will tell us what is ahead for the central bank, but first, Dominic Chu has the outlook for stocks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: After a blistering run for stocks in the first half of the year, here are three things to watch as the markets head into the back half of 2019.</p><p>First, trade. Deal or no deal? Despite the fits and starts over trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, investors have largely been optimistic that a resolution will come to pass, but what happens if things drag out? And we`re not even getting into what happens if America decides to stir things up with other trading partners around the globe.</p><p>Second, the Fed. To cut or not to cut? That is the question. At this point, markets are largely expecting that the economic data will lead the Federal Reserve to ease financial conditions by cutting benchmark interest rates. Will it push the stock market to record highs or signal weakness ahead?</p><p>And third, mega cap stocks, specifically those in tech, communication services and retail like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Facebook just to name a few. They`ve had a lot of influence on the market rally, but will the threat of increased government scrutiny derail that trait?</p><p>Just three of the big market themes to watch in the second half.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For the second half of the year, the Federal Reserve will be focused on when to make a move on rates and how big a move to make.</p><p>Here is what to watch. First, gauge the economy ahead of the meeting in July. Unless the strength measurably from the 2 percent growth now forecast, cut interest rates.</p><p>Second, how much to cut? Perhaps a quarter point, but a few more in the months ahead or perhaps a more muscular 50 points basis cut. The Fed could pause for taking stock and for inflation to hit its 2 percent target.</p><p>Third, when to stop. The Fed will be reluctant to do more than a few cuts. It holds exactly nine quarter point rate moves in its arsenal before the powder runs dry and it is back to zero. The Fed will want to avoid another long spell at zero rate and won`t want quantitative easing, that is expanding the balance sheet to drive down rates unless it has to.</p><p>So, look for some near-term rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, but it will be limited unless the economy gets measurably worse.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Let`s turn to a couple of guests for their outlooks on the economy in the second half.</p><p>Kristina Hooper is chief global market strategist at Invesco. Jim O`Sullivan is chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics.</p><p>Good to see you both. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>JIM O`SULLIVAN, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY ECONOMICS: Thanks, Bill.</p><p>KRISTINA HOPPER,L CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, INVESCO: Great. Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: First, Kristina, on the markets themselves, you expect some more volatility, don`t you?</p><p>HOOPER: Absolutely. We have the potential for more in the way of trade disruption in the back half of this year. It doesn`t look like the U.S. is going to change or stand-down in terms of its trade aggressiveness.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And, Jim, you see a lower growth economy. How much slower?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN: Well, Bill, that`s the question, and obviously there is a lot of uncertainty related to the trade battle in particular. Over the last four quarters, real GDP is up 3.2 percent, which is a pretty good number in comparison with the cycle to date. But certainly, there are reasons to expect slowing. So I`ve got it down to basically 2 percent in the second half of the year and 2 percent into 2020.</p><p>But, again, there`s clearly a lot of uncertainty with the trade negotiations.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And with the Fed -- and I want to address the fed to both of you because what the fed does will have an impact on both of your forecasts. Kristina -- I mean, both of you do expect the Fed to cut rates at some point.</p><p>Kristina, what are your expectations there?</p><p>HOOPER: My expectation is that the Fed will cut rates at least once in the back half of this year, and I do believe that`s a game-changer. If we didn`t have the Fed take a more dovish turn, I don`t think we would have such a rosy outlook for stocks. But given that the fed has made every indication that it is willing to get more accommodative, I think that`s going to provide a put under stocks that should help them counter the kind of headwinds created by the ongoing trade conflicts.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And, Jim, you see two cuts coming, don`t you?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN: Yes. I mean, certainly, at the last FOMC meeting that the Fed pretty much told us that unless the uncertainties as they call them related to trade developments disappear by the July meeting, at the end of July meeting, that they`ll be easing.</p><p>Now how much remains to be seen. It depends on what the data do, what markets do, what happens on the trade front, et cetera. But I am assuming a quarter point in July, another quarter point in September, and then assuming the economy is not weakening dramatically, the Fed stops there. Again, obviously, it will depend on the data and backdrop in general.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Jim, is this because inflation is not getting up to the target that the Fed wants, around 2 percent? Why would they want to cut a couple of times do you think?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN: Well, the immediate trigger recently has been to offset the potential drag, the downside risks as Fed officials put it from the trade side, from trade negotiations weighing on business confidence, and the slowing in global growth in exports that we`ve already seen. So, that`s been the big change in the last couple of months, but there`s no question inflation is part of the story, to the extent inflation numbers have been weaker than expected, to the extent the Fed is changing its strategy on inflation, from what used to be called a bygones are bygones approach --</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>O`SULLIVAN: -- where they want to get inflation back to 2 percent, the goal. Now, they really want to make up for missed inflation in the past and go above 2 percent. So, when you put the two together, it`s really made the Fed much more dovish here.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And, briefly, Kristina, on trade the longer it goes the tougher it gets for companies to deal with the higher tariffs. What are your expectations on that?</p><p>HOOPER: My expectations are that companies are going to pull back in terms of cap spending, in terms of business investment. I think we have already seen that and certainly the Fed has alluded to that. And that could continue and get worse as time goes on.</p><p>That`s what happens with economic policy uncertainty. When it goes up, business investment goes down. And, of course, we have added economic policy on certainty next year, given we are heading into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>Kristina Hooper with Invesco, Jim O`Sullivan with High Frequency -- good to see you both. Thank you for joining us tonight.</p><p>O`SULLIVAN: Thank you.</p><p>HOOPER: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, movement in the U.S. market can sometimes be driven by what happens overseas.</p><p>So, we asked Seema Mody to look at the key issues ahead for the global market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Elections, geopolitics and trade will keep global investors on edge in the second half of the year. First, the volatile and drawn-out trade discussion between the U.S. and China will push even more American companies to shift production out of China, with countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and India becoming bigger destinations for manufacturers, retailers and technology companies.</p><p>Second, expect Iran to become a bigger geopolitical risk. Further conflict between the U.S. and Iran could raise tensions in the Middle East, which accounts for 20 percent of the world`s oil output. Any disruption to oil shipments could send prices at the pump much higher.</p><p>To lessen the blow, U.S. energy companies will likely continue to build out infrastructure here to become less dependent on the Middle East for oil. Plenty of elections and changes to leadership expected in countries like the U.K., Canada, and Argentina, but financial markets will focus on the race for Mario Draghi`s job as president of the European Central Bank, perhaps the most powerful job in Europe. Any departure from Draghi`s whatever it takes approach to save the Europe form recession could disappoint investors.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now, the two biggest sectors of the market are technology and the banks, and the first half was a volatile one for tech. That group either led the market higher or dragged it lower, while the financials, they just continued to struggle along.</p><p>In a moment, Wilfred Frost will give us a break down at the banks, but first, Josh Lipton takes a look at what`s next for big tech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Even with the looming threat of a trade war, tech is the top performing sector so far this year. Here is what else to watch for in the rest of 2019.</p><p>First, new iPhones. Tim Cook tells CNBC that the iPhone XR has consistently been his top seller, which is least expensive of the phones launched last fall. That means this fall when cook introduces his new line-up, he might focus more on mid tier phones with new features, capabilities and marketing dollars.</p><p>Two, Jedi. The U.S. Department of Defense is deciding which company will win a big cloud computing contract known as Jedi, worth up to $10 billion. The winner could be announced as soon as August. Amazon and Microsoft are in the running. The winner could use the deal as a selling point, convincing companies and other data-sensitive industries from finance to health care to entrust it with their information, too.</p><p>Three, regulation. State, federal and international regulators all have tech in their sights, including Alphabet`s Google, and Apple, Amazon and Facebook. And that means there`s little likelihood of approval for any big acquisitions. That could be a challenge as these companies hunt for growth, and one their Chinese rivals don`t face.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILFRED FROST, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Interest rates, credit quality and whether the IPO bonanza can continue are the key things to watch for banks in the second half of the year.</p><p>First up, yields. Banks typically like high rates and a steeply-rising yield curve. That lets them borrow money at lower rates and lend at higher rates. They`ve got neither of those things at the moment. That means even if a Fed rate cut does come, it might not be so bad as it will at least steepen the curve even as it lower rates and it should boost the economy which will help the banks.</p><p>Second, credit quality. Banks` own credit quality has remained robust despite fears of a slowing economy. There are also growing fears out there though about the huge rise in leverage loans and direct lending, but this is not so much an issue specifically for the banks as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently stated, the Fed feels banks are in a good place and are concerned about the nonbanks that made those sorts of loans.</p><p>Third, the IPO bonanza. Q2 was very strong for IPOs, which boosted the investment banks. M&amp;A also picked up towards the end of the quarter. Can that continue and help the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Wilfred Frost, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The health care sector as it happens was the best performing group in the stock market in 2018, but things reversed in first half of 2019. So, now, investors want to know if the sector is ready to rebound.</p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Regulatory pressure from Washington will continue to loom large with the health care sector with the Trump administration now taking up transparency on hospital prices. In the next few months, analysts say watch for the administration to finalize its drug price blueprint policies, including a ban on pharmacy benefit rebates from Medicare drug plans and potentially pegging drug prices to international rates.</p><p>The policies proposed in the last year just after drugmakers raised list prices.</p><p>CHRIS MEEKINS, RAYMOND JAMES HEALTHCARE POLICY RESEARCH ANALYST: If you assume that drug companies are going to raise list prices again the beginning of July this year, then we can assume the administration is going to do what it did last two times which is issue additional regulations immediately thereafter.</p><p>COOMBS: Outrage over drug prices hit pharmaceutical stock hard in the last presidential cycle in 2015. This time around, health insurers have been hit hard following Senator Bernie Sanders campaign launch in February and again in April after the senator reintroduced his Medicare-for-All bill which was endorsed by presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and others.</p><p>Analysts at Nephron Research say stocks found their footing after Joe Biden entered the race. The front-runner is not seen endorsing single-payer health care.</p><p>MEEKINS: If you were to see one of the candidates like Bernie who believes in Medicare-for-All and believes in getting aggressive on drug pricing take the lead, at that point I think you would see negative impact on health care stocks going forward.</p><p>COOMBS: On the fundamental side, the major insurers have all forecast stronger earnings in the second half, which also helped stabilize their stocks over the last month, but it may be tougher for them to move higher amid the regulatory and political pressure they will face this election cycle.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And still ahead, will the second half be a turning point for the housing, retail and airline industries?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now, to a few consumer-related sectors.</p><p>First, retail. It is not secret the industry has been struggling to keep shoppers happy and compete with online competition. While some achieved the right combination of brick and mortar and online, many others have not. As a result, the outlook overall is still a rocky one.</p><p>Here is Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The first half of 2019 has been rough for retail, but with back to school and the holidays, the second half matters more and the unknowns are piling up.</p><p>First, tariffs and trade. Many retailers have been working for years to move manufacturing out of China, but it still is the number one sourcing location for U.S.-bound clothing and shoes. If a new round of tariffs hits shows categories, shoppers may face higher prices at places like Macy`s, American Eagle, and Steve Madden, just in time for Christmas.</p><p>Second, shipping wars. Walmart, Amazon and Target are all racing to deliver faster. Amazon is spending $800 million in just one quarter to get closer to one-day shipping for prime members. Walmart is expanding one-day free shipping without a membership to more city as the year goes on, and Target is offering same-day shipping for $10.</p><p>Third, store closure. Around 7,000 store closures have already been announced this year, outpacing all of 2018. Core site research projects total closures could hit 12,000 by end of the year, opening up opportunity for those left.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: For many, buying a home is the largest financial transaction they will make in their lifetime, and that`s why so much attention is paid to the health of the housing market. But this year, the typically hot spring market was cool and homeowners want to know if that will be the case for the rest of the year.</p><p>Diana Olick takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mortgage rates, home prices and supply could all make for a meaningful change in the pace of home sales in second half. Mortgage rates have been falling steadily since the start of the year. The 30-year fixed was just about 5 percent last fall, now it is below 4 percent.</p><p>Lower rates are already bringing out buyers and increasing competition. If rates stay this low or lower, we could see a big sales boost in the second half. But that will juice prices again. The big gains in home prices were shrinking dramatically in the first half but made a U-turn in May, suddenly gaining again. That thanks to lower rates that helped buyers afford more.</p><p>At some point though, affordability kicks in and even lower rates won`t help buyers, especially first timers. That`s what happened in the spring of last year. The only thing that could help would be more supply. Housing starts have been very weak so far this year, but builders say they are starting to pivot to cheaper entry level homes, exactly what the market needs.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Cheryl Young joins us to talk about her outlook for the housing market the rest of the year. She is senior economist at Trulia.</p><p>Cheryl, good to see you again. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>CHERYL YOUNG, TRULIA SENIOR ECONOMIST: Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Home prices have been going up but you are sensing a slow down in that price increase, yes?</p><p>YOUNG: That`s right. Since the beginning of the year, and I think what we`re going to see through the rest of this year, is that continued slowdown in price appreciation. We`re not talking about price dropping yet, but we are seeing a slowdown and possibly a flattening through the rest of the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Even with interest rates going lower -- mortgage rates are, what, two-year lows at this point. Is it because demand is going to go down or what is going on there?</p><p>YOUNG: No, that`s right. So, mortgage rates are low and that`s going to help drive demand. It is going to bring more people back into the market as mortgage rates go down and stay down, but what we`re seeing is that we`ve really hit sort of an affordability ceiling. Price growth has far outstripped wage growth over the past several years and that`s simply not sustainable in the market right now.</p><p>So, people have been very hesitant to come back in, but with the softening of prices and also low interest rates, hopefully we`ll see more people, especially those first-time home buyers, coming back into the market.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And it is well-documented that homebuilders aren`t keeping pace with demand because it is just too expensive. The supplies surprises are up and labor is tough to find these days, right?</p><p>YOUNG: That`s true. Labor costs are really high. There`s a shortage of labor in the construction field, and right now it is very difficult to build housing.</p><p>So while demand is there, it doesn`t really make sense for a lot of builders especially to build that sort of affordable housing, which is what we`re looking for. And it is going to be tough to get that supply up for all of the demand that`s been pent up over the past few years.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You know, we talk about how tough it is for home buyers even with these low interest rates, but it is not a picnic either for home sellers these days, is it?</p><p>YOUNG: It isn`t quite what it has been for home sellers. Home sellers have really had the upper handy would say I would say in the fast few years just because of the low supply and the appreciation. They`re not quite in the driver`s seat anymore and that`s not necessarily a bad thing because there are still a lot of people out there looking for housing, but they certainly shouldn`t expect quite the market conditions that they`re used to.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Will it take longer to sell a home do you think as a result?</p><p>YOUNG: Yes, we`ve actually seen that homes have been sitting on the market a little bit longer and that`s going to probably continue as we`ve seen some supply coming back on to the market, and that`s going to be a little tougher for sellers who have really seen homes fly off the shelf. But, like I said, I think we still have a lot of pent-up demand, especially among the first-time home buyers. It is still a healthy market out there. It is just slowing down a little bit.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Cheryl Young with Trulia -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>YOUNG: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, a record-breaking number of Americans are traveling over the 4th of July holiday. Nearly 49 million are planning a getaway. According to AAA, the majority will travel by car while many others travel by plane.</p><p>Tonight, Phil LeBeau tells us what is in store for both of those sectors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In the second half of this year, airlines and investors will be focused on international markets, keeping up with demand, and the return of the MAX. Boeing 737 MAX is expected to be flying by the end of the summer, but that`s not a sure thing and any further delays could have a ripple effect on the entire industry. With so many MAX planes grounded, airlines are pushing hard to keep up with demand.</p><p>One area where some airlines are seeing softness? International routes. That will be a focus for large, international carriers in the second half of this year.</p><p>For the auto industry and investors, the second half of the year is about tariffs, sales and potential merger deals. On tariffs, the big question is if the U.S. puts a tax on vehicles imported from Europe. If that happens, it could impact sales which slowed slightly in the first half of this year.</p><p>And don`t be surprised if Nissan, Renault, Fiat Chrysler and other automakers revive the idea of potential merging operations. That could rev up auto stocks in the second half of the year.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And another consumer sector is entertainment. That industry is undergoing some very big changes.</p><p>And as Julia Boorstin reports, there could be more to come.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: As we enter the second half of this year, three things for media investors to watch are consolidation, streaming wars and box office.</p><p>First, consolidation. More media deals are expected ahead with a focus on Viacom and CBS. Sources tell us they`re in talks not and Lionsgate`s Starz is also on the block, as that studio and other smaller players feel pressure to compete with the recently merged giants.</p><p>Second, the streaming wars will get their biggest new entrance in years. Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus and a beta version of AT&amp;T`s Warner Media service, all set to launch before the end of the year, putting pressure on consumers to choose and putting pressure on the cable giants to find ways to hold on to their customers.</p><p>Third, the theatrical movie business will be put to the test. The domestic box office is down nearly 9 percent from last year. The question is whether huge franchises hitting theaters, Spider-Man, Lion King, Frozen 2 and a new \"Star Wars\" film turns it around, or whether franchise fatigue and the option to stream at home weighs on results.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, now that you have an idea what is ahead in the second half, what should you do with your money? Some advice coming up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now that the first half of the year is behind us, how should investors prepare themselves for the remainder of the year?</p><p>Joining us tonight to talk about that, Diahann Lassus. She`s cofounder of the wealth management firm Lassus Wherley.</p><p>Always great to see you.</p><p>DIAHANN LASSUS, LASSUS WHERLEY CO-FOUNDER: Great to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>Where do we begin? I mean, I`m thinking of a lot of our viewers want income from their investments.</p><p>LASSUS: Right.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Depending on where rates are going, it gets tougher and tougher to try and find income, isn`t it?</p><p>LASSUS: You really have to look for total return, which means you have to have that equity exposure in order to get any kind of real long-term return to generate that income and cash flow.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And cash flow is one thing you should try and keep tabs on and see if -- make sure it is aligned with your investments as we go into the second half of the year, right?</p><p>LASSUS: Absolutely. You need to look and see what your needs are going to be over the next six to twelve months and make sure you have cash available, especially for emergency needs.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The risk level in your portfolio, how do you assess that?</p><p>LASSUS: You really look at your allocation based on how much exposure you have to the equity markets, because that`s going to drive risk, volatility, and, obviously, long-term return.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And then we often talk about rebalancing, you do that periodically. You know, trim some of the losses or gains at this point. Is this a good time to be doing that?</p><p>LASSUS: Absolutely. Rebalancing is very important right now because we want to stick to that buy low, sell high adage. Now is a great time to be taking some profits in that equity market and not leaving that money out on the table.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Does it matter to you as a financial adviser what the Fed is going to do? I mean, we just had a couple of analysts on here who see at least one, maybe two interest rate cuts before the end of this year. What does that do to the people looking for that income still?</p><p>LASSUS: It doesn`t help them an awful lot because that means the bond side of the portfolio is going to have lower flow in terms of interest payments. That also means they need to look at their overall portfolio and figure out what kind of return they need over the long-term in order to meet their cash flow needs.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You know, when I began my career, people were desperate to try and stay ahead of the rate of inflation with their investments. That`s not so hard to do these days. Is that still a bogey for you to try to stay ahead of inflation with your portfolio?</p><p>LASSUS: Absolutely. It is still important and we don`t know that inflation has disappeared for the long term. We could still see it raise its ugly head down the road, but for right now, it`s more about risk management in terms of your overall portfolio.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Diahann Lassus with Lassus Wherley, thanks for stopping by.</p><p>LASSUS: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Appreciate it.</p><p>And thank you for stopping by and watching this special edition of NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening. See you tomorrow night and Happy 4th.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Sue is off  tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You know, believe it or not, we are halfway through 2019, so we`re going to  spend this evening looking at the outlook for the second half of the year,  for everything from the markets, to the Fed, to housing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we begin tonight with stocks and the economy.  This year, performance  has been a bit bumpy.  Stock rallies have given way to new highs, but there  have been some sharp and severe slumps as well.  And at the center of most  of those moves has been the Federal Reserve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have two reports on that tonight.  To start with, we have Steve Liesman  who will tell us what is ahead for the central bank, but first, Dominic Chu  has the outlook for stocks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After a blistering run  for stocks in the first half of the year, here are three things to watch as  the markets head into the back half of 2019.</p><p>First, trade.  Deal or no deal?  Despite the fits and starts over trade  negotiations between the U.S. and China, investors have largely been  optimistic that a resolution will come to pass, but what happens if things  drag out?  And we`re not even getting into what happens if America decides  to stir things up with other trading partners around the globe.</p><p>Second, the Fed.  To cut or not to cut?  That is the question.  At this  point, markets are largely expecting that the economic data will lead the  Federal Reserve to ease financial conditions by cutting benchmark interest  rates.  Will it push the stock market to record highs or signal weakness  ahead?</p><p>And third, mega cap stocks, specifically those in tech, communication  services and retail like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Facebook just to name  a few.  They`ve had a lot of influence on the market rally, but will the  threat of increased government scrutiny derail that trait?</p><p>Just three of the big market themes to watch in the second half.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For the second half  of the year, the Federal Reserve will be focused on when to make a move on  rates and how big a move to make.</p><p>Here is what to watch.  First, gauge the economy ahead of the meeting in  July.  Unless the strength measurably from the 2 percent growth now  forecast, cut interest rates.</p><p>Second, how much to cut?  Perhaps a quarter point, but a few more in the  months ahead or perhaps a more muscular 50 points basis cut.  The Fed could  pause for taking stock and for inflation to hit its 2 percent target.</p><p>Third, when to stop.  The Fed will be reluctant to do more than a few cuts.   It holds exactly nine quarter point rate moves in its arsenal before the  powder runs dry and it is back to zero.  The Fed will want to avoid another  long spell at zero rate and won`t want quantitative easing, that is  expanding the balance sheet to drive down rates unless it has to.</p><p>So, look for some near-term rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, but it will  be limited unless the economy gets measurably worse.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Let`s turn to a couple of guests for their outlooks on the  economy in the second half.</p><p>Kristina Hooper is chief global market strategist at Invesco.  Jim  O`Sullivan is chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics.</p><p>Good to see you both.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>JIM O`SULLIVAN, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY ECONOMICS:  Thanks,  Bill.</p><p>KRISTINA HOPPER,L CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, INVESCO:  Great.  Thank  you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  First, Kristina, on the markets themselves, you expect some more  volatility, don`t you?</p><p>HOOPER:  Absolutely.  We have the potential for more in the way of trade  disruption in the back half of this year.  It doesn`t look like the U.S. is  going to change or stand-down in terms of its trade aggressiveness.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And, Jim, you see a lower growth economy.  How much slower?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN:  Well, Bill, that`s the question, and obviously there is a lot  of uncertainty related to the trade battle in particular.  Over the last  four quarters, real GDP is up 3.2 percent, which is a pretty good number in  comparison with the cycle to date.  But certainly, there are reasons to  expect slowing.  So I`ve got it down to basically 2 percent in the second  half of the year and 2 percent into 2020.</p><p>But, again, there`s clearly a lot of uncertainty with the trade  negotiations.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And with the Fed -- and I want to address the fed to both of you  because what the fed does will have an impact on both of your forecasts.   Kristina -- I mean, both of you do expect the Fed to cut rates at some  point.</p><p>Kristina, what are your expectations there?</p><p>HOOPER:  My expectation is that the Fed will cut rates at least once in the  back half of this year, and I do believe that`s a game-changer.  If we  didn`t have the Fed take a more dovish turn, I don`t think we would have  such a rosy outlook for stocks.  But given that the fed has made every  indication that it is willing to get more accommodative, I think that`s  going to provide a put under stocks that should help them counter the kind  of headwinds created by the ongoing trade conflicts.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And, Jim, you see two cuts coming, don`t you?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN:  Yes.  I mean, certainly, at the last FOMC meeting that the Fed  pretty much told us that unless the uncertainties as they call them related  to trade developments disappear by the July meeting, at the end of July  meeting, that they`ll be easing.</p><p>Now how much remains to be seen.  It depends on what the data do, what  markets do, what happens on the trade front, et cetera.  But I am assuming  a quarter point in July, another quarter point in September, and then  assuming the economy is not weakening dramatically, the Fed stops there.   Again, obviously, it will depend on the data and backdrop in general.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Jim, is this because inflation is not getting up to the target  that the Fed wants, around 2 percent?  Why would they want to cut a couple  of times do you think?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN:  Well, the immediate trigger recently has been to offset the  potential drag, the downside risks as Fed officials put it from the trade  side, from trade negotiations weighing on business confidence, and the  slowing in global growth in exports that we`ve already seen.  So, that`s  been the big change in the last couple of months, but there`s no question  inflation is part of the story, to the extent inflation numbers have been  weaker than expected, to the extent the Fed is changing its strategy on  inflation, from what used to be called a bygones are bygones approach --</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>O`SULLIVAN:  -- where they want to get inflation back to 2 percent, the  goal.  Now, they really want to make up for missed inflation in the past  and go above 2 percent.  So, when you put the two together, it`s really  made the Fed much more dovish here.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And, briefly, Kristina, on trade the longer it goes the tougher  it gets for companies to deal with the higher tariffs.  What are your  expectations on that?</p><p>HOOPER:  My expectations are that companies are going to pull back in terms  of cap spending, in terms of business investment.  I think we have already  seen that and certainly the Fed has alluded to that.  And that could  continue and get worse as time goes on.</p><p>That`s what happens with economic policy uncertainty.  When it goes up,  business investment goes down.  And, of course, we have added economic  policy on certainty next year, given we are heading into the 2020  presidential election.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>Kristina Hooper with Invesco, Jim O`Sullivan with High Frequency -- good to  see you both.  Thank you for joining us tonight.</p><p>O`SULLIVAN:  Thank you.</p><p>HOOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, movement in the U.S. market can sometimes be driven  by what happens overseas.</p><p>So, we asked Seema Mody to look at the key issues ahead for the global  market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Elections, geopolitics  and trade will keep global investors on edge in the second half of the  year.  First, the volatile and drawn-out trade discussion between the U.S.  and China will push even more American companies to shift production out of  China, with countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and India becoming bigger  destinations for manufacturers, retailers and technology companies.</p><p>Second, expect Iran to become a bigger geopolitical risk.  Further conflict  between the U.S. and Iran could raise tensions in the Middle East, which  accounts for 20 percent of the world`s oil output.  Any disruption to oil  shipments could send prices at the pump much higher.</p><p>To lessen the blow, U.S. energy companies will likely continue to build out  infrastructure here to become less dependent on the Middle East for oil.   Plenty of elections and changes to leadership expected in countries like  the U.K., Canada, and Argentina, but financial markets will focus on the  race for Mario Draghi`s job as president of the European Central Bank,  perhaps the most powerful job in Europe.  Any departure from Draghi`s  whatever it takes approach to save the Europe form recession could  disappoint investors.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, the two biggest sectors of the market are technology and  the banks, and the first half was a volatile one for tech.  That group  either led the market higher or dragged it lower, while the financials,  they just continued to struggle along.</p><p>In a moment, Wilfred Frost will give us a break down at the banks, but  first, Josh Lipton takes a look at what`s next for big tech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Even with the looming  threat of a trade war, tech is the top performing sector so far this year.   Here is what else to watch for in the rest of 2019.</p><p>First, new iPhones.  Tim Cook tells CNBC that the iPhone XR has  consistently been his top seller, which is least expensive of the phones  launched last fall.  That means this fall when cook introduces his new  line-up, he might focus more on mid tier phones with new features,  capabilities and marketing dollars.</p><p>Two, Jedi.  The U.S. Department of Defense is deciding which company will  win a big cloud computing contract known as Jedi, worth up to $10 billion.   The winner could be announced as soon as August.  Amazon and Microsoft are  in the running.  The winner could use the deal as a selling point,  convincing companies and other data-sensitive industries from finance to  health care to entrust it with their information, too.</p><p>Three, regulation.  State, federal and international regulators all have  tech in their sights, including Alphabet`s Google, and Apple, Amazon and  Facebook.  And that means there`s little likelihood of approval for any big  acquisitions.  That could be a challenge as these companies hunt for  growth, and one their Chinese rivals don`t face.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILFRED FROST, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Interest rates,  credit quality and whether the IPO bonanza can continue are the key things  to watch for banks in the second half of the year.</p><p>First up, yields.  Banks typically like high rates and a steeply-rising  yield curve.  That lets them borrow money at lower rates and lend at higher  rates.  They`ve got neither of those things at the moment.  That means even  if a Fed rate cut does come, it might not be so bad as it will at least  steepen the curve even as it lower rates and it should boost the economy  which will help the banks.</p><p>Second, credit quality.  Banks` own credit quality has remained robust  despite fears of a slowing economy.  There are also growing fears out there  though about the huge rise in leverage loans and direct lending, but this  is not so much an issue specifically for the banks as Federal Reserve Chair  Jerome Powell recently stated, the Fed feels banks are in a good place and  are concerned about the nonbanks that made those sorts of loans.</p><p>Third, the IPO bonanza.  Q2 was very strong for IPOs, which boosted the  investment banks.  M&amp;A also picked up towards the end of the quarter.  Can  that continue and help the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Wilfred Frost, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The health care sector as it happens was the best performing  group in the stock market in 2018, but things reversed in first half of  2019.  So, now, investors want to know if the sector is ready to rebound.</p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Regulatory pressure  from Washington will continue to loom large with the health care sector  with the Trump administration now taking up transparency on hospital  prices.  In the next few months, analysts say watch for the administration  to finalize its drug price blueprint policies, including a ban on pharmacy  benefit rebates from Medicare drug plans and potentially pegging drug  prices to international rates.</p><p>The policies proposed in the last year just after drugmakers raised list  prices.</p><p>CHRIS MEEKINS, RAYMOND JAMES HEALTHCARE POLICY RESEARCH ANALYST:  If you  assume that drug companies are going to raise list prices again the  beginning of July this year, then we can assume the administration is going  to do what it did last two times which is issue additional regulations  immediately thereafter.</p><p>COOMBS:  Outrage over drug prices hit pharmaceutical stock hard in the last  presidential cycle in 2015.  This time around, health insurers have been  hit hard following Senator Bernie Sanders campaign launch in February and  again in April after the senator reintroduced his Medicare-for-All bill  which was endorsed by presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and  others.</p><p>Analysts at Nephron Research say stocks found their footing after Joe Biden  entered the race.  The front-runner is not seen endorsing single-payer  health care.</p><p>MEEKINS:  If you were to see one of the candidates like Bernie who believes  in Medicare-for-All and believes in getting aggressive on drug pricing take  the lead, at that point I think you would see negative impact on health  care stocks going forward.</p><p>COOMBS:  On the fundamental side, the major insurers have all forecast  stronger earnings in the second half, which also helped stabilize their  stocks over the last month, but it may be tougher for them to move higher  amid the regulatory and political pressure they will face this election  cycle.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, will the second half be a turning point for the  housing, retail and airline industries?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, to a few consumer-related sectors.</p><p>First, retail.  It is not secret the industry has been struggling to keep  shoppers happy and compete with online competition.  While some achieved  the right combination of brick and mortar and online, many others have not.   As a result, the outlook overall is still a rocky one.</p><p>Here is Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The first half of  2019 has been rough for retail, but with back to school and the holidays,  the second half matters more and the unknowns are piling up.</p><p>First, tariffs and trade.  Many retailers have been working for years to  move manufacturing out of China, but it still is the number one sourcing  location for U.S.-bound clothing and shoes.  If a new round of tariffs hits  shows categories, shoppers may face higher prices at places like Macy`s,  American Eagle, and Steve Madden, just in time for Christmas.</p><p>Second, shipping wars.  Walmart, Amazon and Target are all racing to  deliver faster.  Amazon is spending $800 million in just one quarter to get  closer to one-day shipping for prime members.  Walmart is expanding one-day  free shipping without a membership to more city as the year goes on, and  Target is offering same-day shipping for $10.</p><p>Third, store closure.  Around 7,000 store closures have already been  announced this year, outpacing all of 2018.  Core site research projects  total closures could hit 12,000 by end of the year, opening up opportunity  for those left.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  For many, buying a home is the largest financial transaction  they will make in their lifetime, and that`s why so much attention is paid  to the health of the housing market.  But this year, the typically hot  spring market was cool and homeowners want to know if that will be the case  for the rest of the year.</p><p>Diana Olick takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mortgage rates, home  prices and supply could all make for a meaningful change in the pace of  home sales in second half.  Mortgage rates have been falling steadily since  the start of the year.  The 30-year fixed was just about 5 percent last  fall, now it is below 4 percent.</p><p>Lower rates are already bringing out buyers and increasing competition.  If  rates stay this low or lower, we could see a big sales boost in the second  half.  But that will juice prices again.  The big gains in home prices were  shrinking dramatically in the first half but made a U-turn in May, suddenly  gaining again.  That thanks to lower rates that helped buyers afford more.</p><p>At some point though, affordability kicks in and even lower rates won`t  help buyers, especially first timers.  That`s what happened in the spring  of last year.  The only thing that could help would be more supply.   Housing starts have been very weak so far this year, but builders say they  are starting to pivot to cheaper entry level homes, exactly what the market  needs.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Cheryl Young joins us to talk about her outlook for the housing  market the rest of the year.  She is senior economist at Trulia.</p><p>Cheryl, good to see you again.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>CHERYL YOUNG, TRULIA SENIOR ECONOMIST:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Home prices have been going up but you are sensing a slow down  in that price increase, yes?</p><p>YOUNG:  That`s right.  Since the beginning of the year, and I think what  we`re going to see through the rest of this year, is that continued  slowdown in price appreciation.  We`re not talking about price dropping  yet, but we are seeing a slowdown and possibly a flattening through the  rest of the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Even with interest rates going lower -- mortgage rates are,  what, two-year lows at this point.  Is it because demand is going to go  down or what is going on there?</p><p>YOUNG:  No, that`s right.  So, mortgage rates are low and that`s going to  help drive demand.  It is going to bring more people back into the market  as mortgage rates go down and stay down, but what we`re seeing is that  we`ve really hit sort of an affordability ceiling.  Price growth has far  outstripped wage growth over the past several years and that`s simply not  sustainable in the market right now.</p><p>So, people have been very hesitant to come back in, but with the softening  of prices and also low interest rates, hopefully we`ll see more people,  especially those first-time home buyers, coming back into the market.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And it is well-documented that homebuilders aren`t keeping pace  with demand because it is just too expensive.  The supplies surprises are  up and labor is tough to find these days, right?</p><p>YOUNG:  That`s true.  Labor costs are really high.  There`s a shortage of  labor in the construction field, and right now it is very difficult to  build housing.</p><p>So while demand is there, it doesn`t really make sense for a lot of  builders especially to build that sort of affordable housing, which is what  we`re looking for.  And it is going to be tough to get that supply up for  all of the demand that`s been pent up over the past few years.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You know, we talk about how tough it is for home buyers even  with these low interest rates, but it is not a picnic either for home  sellers these days, is it?</p><p>YOUNG:  It isn`t quite what it has been for home sellers.  Home sellers  have really had the upper handy would say I would say in the fast few years  just because of the low supply and the appreciation.  They`re not quite in  the driver`s seat anymore and that`s not necessarily a bad thing because  there are still a lot of people out there looking for housing, but they  certainly shouldn`t expect quite the market conditions that they`re used  to.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Will it take longer to sell a home do you think as a result?</p><p>YOUNG:  Yes, we`ve actually seen that homes have been sitting on the market  a little bit longer and that`s going to probably continue as we`ve seen  some supply coming back on to the market, and that`s going to be a little  tougher for sellers who have really seen homes fly off the shelf.  But,  like I said, I think we still have a lot of pent-up demand, especially  among the first-time home buyers.  It is still a healthy market out there.   It is just slowing down a little bit.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Cheryl Young with Trulia -- again, thanks for joining us  tonight.</p><p>YOUNG:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, a record-breaking number of Americans are traveling  over the 4th of July holiday.  Nearly 49 million are planning a getaway.   According to AAA, the majority will travel by car while many others travel  by plane.</p><p>Tonight, Phil LeBeau tells us what is in store for both of those sectors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  In the second half of  this year, airlines and investors will be focused on international markets,  keeping up with demand, and the return of the MAX.  Boeing 737 MAX is  expected to be flying by the end of the summer, but that`s not a sure thing  and any further delays could have a ripple effect on the entire industry.   With so many MAX planes grounded, airlines are pushing hard to keep up with  demand.</p><p>One area where some airlines are seeing softness?  International routes.   That will be a focus for large, international carriers in the second half  of this year.</p><p>For the auto industry and investors, the second half of the year is about  tariffs, sales and potential merger deals.  On tariffs, the big question is  if the U.S. puts a tax on vehicles imported from Europe.  If that happens,  it could impact sales which slowed slightly in the first half of this year.</p><p>And don`t be surprised if Nissan, Renault, Fiat Chrysler and other  automakers revive the idea of potential merging operations.  That could rev  up auto stocks in the second half of the year.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And another consumer sector is entertainment.  That industry is  undergoing some very big changes.</p><p>And as Julia Boorstin reports, there could be more to come.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As we enter the  second half of this year, three things for media investors to watch are  consolidation, streaming wars and box office.</p><p>First, consolidation.  More media deals are expected ahead with a focus on  Viacom and CBS.  Sources tell us they`re in talks not and Lionsgate`s Starz  is also on the block, as that studio and other smaller players feel  pressure to compete with the recently merged giants.</p><p>Second, the streaming wars will get their biggest new entrance in years.   Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus and a beta version of AT&amp;T`s Warner Media  service, all set to launch before the end of the year, putting pressure on  consumers to choose and putting pressure on the cable giants to find ways  to hold on to their customers.</p><p>Third, the theatrical movie business will be put to the test.  The domestic  box office is down nearly 9 percent from last year.  The question is  whether huge franchises hitting theaters, Spider-Man, Lion King, Frozen 2  and a new \"Star Wars\" film turns it around, or whether franchise fatigue  and the option to stream at home weighs on results.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, now that you have an idea what is ahead in the  second half, what should you do with your money?  Some advice coming up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now that the first half of the year is behind us, how should  investors prepare themselves for the remainder of the year?</p><p>Joining us tonight to talk about that, Diahann Lassus.  She`s cofounder of  the wealth management firm Lassus Wherley.</p><p>Always great to see you.</p><p>DIAHANN LASSUS, LASSUS WHERLEY CO-FOUNDER:  Great to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>Where do we begin?  I mean, I`m thinking of a lot of our viewers want  income from their investments.</p><p>LASSUS:  Right.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Depending on where rates are going, it gets tougher and tougher  to try and find income, isn`t it?</p><p>LASSUS:  You really have to look for total return, which means you have to  have that equity exposure in order to get any kind of real long-term return  to generate that income and cash flow.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And cash flow is one thing you should try and keep tabs on and  see if -- make sure it is aligned with your investments as we go into the  second half of the year, right?</p><p>LASSUS:  Absolutely.  You need to look and see what your needs are going to  be over the next six to twelve months and make sure you have cash  available, especially for emergency needs.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The risk level in your portfolio, how do you assess that?</p><p>LASSUS:  You really look at your allocation based on how much exposure you  have to the equity markets, because that`s going to drive risk, volatility,  and, obviously, long-term return.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And then we often talk about rebalancing, you do that  periodically.  You know, trim some of the losses or gains at this point.   Is this a good time to be doing that?</p><p>LASSUS:  Absolutely.  Rebalancing is very important right now because we  want to stick to that buy low, sell high adage.  Now is a great time to be  taking some profits in that equity market and not leaving that money out on  the table.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Does it matter to you as a financial adviser what the Fed is  going to do?  I mean, we just had a couple of analysts on here who see at  least one, maybe two interest rate cuts before the end of this year.  What  does that do to the people looking for that income still?</p><p>LASSUS:  It doesn`t help them an awful lot because that means the bond side  of the portfolio is going to have lower flow in terms of interest payments.   That also means they need to look at their overall portfolio and figure out  what kind of return they need over the long-term in order to meet their  cash flow needs.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You know, when I began my career, people were desperate to try  and stay ahead of the rate of inflation with their investments.  That`s not  so hard to do these days.  Is that still a bogey for you to try to stay  ahead of inflation with your portfolio?</p><p>LASSUS:  Absolutely.  It is still important and we don`t know that  inflation has disappeared for the long term.  We could still see it raise  its ugly head down the road, but for right now, it`s more about risk  management in terms of your overall portfolio.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Diahann Lassus with Lassus Wherley, thanks for stopping by.</p><p>LASSUS:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Appreciate it.</p><p>And thank you for stopping by and watching this special edition of NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT.  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  See you  tomorrow night and Happy 4th.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

American  businesses ramped up hiring, alleviating fears the economy is sagging and  sending the S&amp;P 500 just shy of a record close.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Goldilocks market?  Job  growth is back.  Fed is on hold.  Volatility collapsing.  Is this the  perfect scenario for investor?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  The results are in.  And tonight, you'll meet the entrepreneurs  who are using social media to spur political discussions, a different kind  of bright idea, tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, July 8th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Stocks touch all time highs and for that, you can thank a blowout jobs  report.  The employment numbers for June came in much stronger than  expected, showing that one of the best performing part of the economy is  still humming along after sputtering earlier this year in the spring, and  the buyers came out in force today.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 250 points to 18,146.  NASDAQ climbed  79 and the S&amp;P 500 added 32 to close just shy of a record.  But the index  did nip above its all time closing high during the session today.</p><p>And the rally was sparked by the creation of 287,000 new jobs in June, big  increase over the revised gains of just 11,000 in May.  The rate did edge  up to 4.9 percent.  Average hourly earnings rose modestly.  </p><p>Hampton Pearson has more on the job market rebound and what it may mean for  Wall Street and Main Street and the Fed.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The June jobs  surge showed employers recovering from two months of hiring, with the job  growth on a roller coaster, adding just 11,000 new workers to payrolls in  May, compared to today's blockbuster of 287,000.</p><p>THOMAS PEREZ, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SECRETARY:  It's really important when  you have a lower than expected month as we had last month not to -- you  know, jump to conclusion.  </p><p>PEARSON:  The leisure and hospitality sectors led the way in June adding  59,000 new hires.  With health care close behind, hiring 58,000 new  workers.</p><p>But the unemployment rose to 4.9 percent, with little growth in wages.  And  the three-month average is just 147,000 per month.  </p><p>JAN HATZIUS, GOLDMAN SACHS CHIEF ECONOMIST:  The story from the economy is  pretty, we're moving towards full employment.  We're probably very close  and we are starting to see some clearer signs of stronger wage growth.  </p><p>PEARSON:  Data for that June jobs report was collected before Great Britain  voted to leave the European Union last month.  So economists don't have a  gauge of the impact on the American job market, but they point to the 2.6  percent year over year gain in wages as the sign of an economy moving  closer to full employment.  Reasons enough economists say for the Federal  Reserve to stay on the sidelines when it comes to interest rate policy.</p><p>ANASTASIA AMOROSO, J.P. MORGAN GLOBAL STRATEGIST:  This is a really  important for the Fed.  This the exact number the Fed wants to see, right?   They want to see us recover and this really supports the notion that Janet  Yellen had last week or last month that this is an aberration.  </p><p>PEARSON:  Wall Street Fed watchers say the combination of the slowdown in  job growth plus the economic uncertainty from the Brexit vote are  increasing the odds of no Fed rate hike this year.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Now to Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  What happened?  Two  days ago, we were talking about a trading range for the S&amp;P 500 between the  old high of 2,130 and the February lows of roughly 1,800 or so.  We came  very close to those historic highs today, closing just shy of the 2,130  level.  Regardless, it's been a remarkable rally.  </p><p>All right.  So, what happened?  The bulls are arguing that the strong June  jobs report had created a Goldilocks scenario, but the Fed is still on  hold.  The bears are insisting this has nothing to do with fundamentals or  even with the idea that there are some dramatic improvement they say the  rally the is due to unusually heavy demand for both U.S. stocks and bond,  partly due to foreign demand and partly because investors are forced into  U.S. stocks because of a lack of alternative investments, and because  Europe and China stocks are problematic right now.  </p><p>You know what's amazing?  Either interpretation means stocks rally.   They're both could be right and it was a broad-based rally.  Nine stocks  advancing for every one declining and new highs kept expanding throughout  the day.  So, we had industrial names like General Electric (NYSE:GE) and  UPS suddenly on the new high list.</p><p>All right.  Where do we go from here?  We go to earnings, which start on  Monday with Alcoa (NYSE:AA) and we find out how much this whole Brexit  thing might impact the second half of the year.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, we got a robust jobs report for June that has stocked touching  new highs.  But what are the numbers telling us about the health of the  economy?  </p><p>Let's turn to Josh Feinman, global chief economist with Deutsche Asset  Management, and Stephen Wood, chief market strategist with Russell  Investments, for more analysis on today's jobs report.  </p><p>Josh, I'll start with you.  I mean, it looked good on the surface.  When  you dug deeper, were you equally as satisfied with the report?  </p><p>JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Yes.  I  mean, I think the report was reassuring.  It certainly helped to allay some  of the fears we got from the previous reports.  </p><p>You had to smooth through the volatility, though.  And we do -- you see job  growth running about 150,000 over the last three, four months.  That's a  healthy clip.  It's enough to continue gradual progress and healing labor  markets and edging back towards full employment, but it's not as strong as  we were seeing, you know, the past couple of years.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Josh, why did May lay such an egg?  </p><p>FEINMAN:  You know, the numbers bounce around from month to month.  This is  why you never hang your hat on anyone particular month.  You got to smooth  it through.  </p><p>And look at the, you know, the broader picture.  As I said, that broader  picture suggests that labor market is healthy, it is improving.  I don't  think that's quite back to full payment.  I think there's still residual  pool of folks who could be drawn back in.  Some folks working part time who  would like to work fulltime.  </p><p>So, I don't think we're all the way back, but we made a lot of progress.   We are starting to see wages pick up a little bit, but still not terribly - - </p><p>HERERA:  Stephen, weigh in on what impressed you and what did not about  this report.  And what position does it put the Fed in?  </p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENT CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  I think what  impressed me most is there's not radical information that's going to  deviate the Fed's course.  So, the numbers as smooth as Josh mentioned in  that 150 clip, which means the Fed is not going to deviate from their  policy.  We think that they're going to be one and done in December.   That's predominantly because of international events, Brexit, what's  happening in Europe.</p><p>I think the Federal Reserve is inclined to raise rates.  They want to be in  what they consider a normal policy environment.  But the economy is doing  OK.  Earnings starting next week look to be improving into the end of the  year.</p><p>So don't think it's going to be an okay economy.  It's going to be an okay  environment for the Federal Reserve.  I don't think they're very, very  aggressive.  </p><p>We just think that the valuations in U.S. equities are getting very rich.   So, perhaps, globally, we want to have a multi-asset strategy where we can  underweight valuations that are expensive and look at areas where  valuations are a little bit more attractive.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, Steve, a couple of weeks ago, maybe even more recently  than that, an awful lot of guys who are market strategists like you, and  stop picking, do stock picking, said, oh, I see the S&amp;P 500 ending the year  maybe getting back right around 2,100.  That's my number, 2,100.  Well,  now, we're now at 2,130 or thereabouts.  </p><p>So, what's the rest of the year look like from where you sit?  </p><p>WOOD:  I think there's going to be chopped -- I think it's going to be  bookended.  Kind of flat-ish.  We think it will be a positive number, U.S.  equities for 2016, but it's looking a lot like 2015 as well.  A lot of  volatility, flat-ish, a slight upward bias in U.S. equities.  </p><p>But we would be inclined to look at valuations getting rich and richer.   Trim that position.  You don't want to do anything dramatic but trim that  position so that you can fund overweight, the European cycle which is  beginning.  The European Central Bank is going to get very aggressive as  our Fed is kind of stable in their policy path.  So, just be a very -- I  think tactically lean into it.  Stay on your toes and be actively managed.</p><p>HERERA:  Josh, why don't you follow on that, because one of the things that  Tyler and I were talking about right before the show is, you have stocks  rallying, but you also have bonds rallying, and you have gold rallying.   You know, a lot of the normal relationships in the stock markets are not  gelling at this point.</p><p>So, how do you see things playing out, along with the fact that we have an  election that's coming up in November?</p><p>FEINMAN:  Yes, I think they are sending somewhat confusing signals.  I  think one way to maybe reconcile them is to stock market and risk assets,  you're saying, hey, the economy is looking okay, not great, but it's  looking okay.  Interest rate markets are saying maybe it's looking okay,  but monetary policy is going to be an easing mode.  Other parts of the  world in a big way and Fed certainly been pushed out, so that's what's  helping to hold interest rates down.</p><p>So, it's a little bit of the best of both worlds.  But I do think if the  economy, you know, continues on a pretty good track, we get a sense the  Brexit situation is not impeding activity meaningfully in the U.S., then I  think the Fed will be back maybe by the end of the year.  </p><p>HERERA:  Thank you, gentlemen.  Have a great weekend.</p><p>FEINMAN:  You too.</p><p>WOOD:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Stephen Wood with  Russell Investments.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Potential risk for the market we've been following is the  fallout from the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union, but a new survey  of chief financial officers shows only a small portion of those business  executives think the vote to leave will have a negative impact on the U.S.  economy.  The bigger impact, according to the CNBC survey, will be, as you  might expect, on the U.K. and E.U. economy.  </p><p>HERERA:  That vote in the United Kingdom, along with global security, were  just some of the topics discussed at the NATO summit where President Obama,  along with British Prime Minister David Cameron, were in attendance.  </p><p>Hadley Gamble reports tonight from Warsaw. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HADLEY GAMBLE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Strength and unity,  that's what NATO secretary general says this organization is going to have  to continue to project even as fears mount over the European Union as well  as governments here trying to decide what Vladimir Putin's next move.  </p><p>JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL:  We will continue the seek  constructive and meaningful dialogue with Russia, to make our intentions  clear, to dispel any misunderstanding, and to reduce the risk of military  incidents or accidents spiraling out of control.</p><p>GAMBLE:  As the largest NATO Summit in history got underway today in  Warsaw, questions continue to be raised over just how far NATO should beef  Eastern Europe's security.  A 4,000-strong multinational force will be  deployed in four battalions, ranging from Poland to the Baltic State.   Several smaller NATO outposts will be created, as well as the rapid  response force that can be deployed if needed.  </p><p>Now, while the troop buildup is aimed at deterring Russia from further  aggression along NATO's eastern plank, officials here are working a fine  line between antagonizing the Kremlin and reassuring ex-Soviet member  states concern that they can be Mr. Putin's next target.  </p><p>STOLTENBERG:  We have tripled the size of the NATO response force.  We have  established new headquarters in the east, and the further developed key  capabilities like ballistic missile defense against threats from outside  the Euro Atlantic area.  </p><p>GAMBLE:  Another potential game changer for NATO is just how much Brexit  could impact the North Atlantic alliance.  The U.K. was a major force  behind E.U. sanctions on Russia.  And despite mounting pressure from other  E.U. nations to roll them back has held firm.  They were also a major  contributor to overall NATO spending and with Washington keen to see more  commitment from E.U. countries, it remains to be seen just how ready Europe  is to foot the bill for their own security.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The vote in the United  Kingdom to leave the E.U. has created uncertainty about the future of  European integration.  And, unfortunately, this has led some to suggest  that the entire edifice of European security and prosperity is crumbling.   For those who have been questioning what does this mean for the  transatlantic relationship, let me just say it is often the case in moments  of change, that this kinds of hyperbole is misplaced.  </p><p>GAMBLE:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT in Warsaw, Poland, I'm Hadley Gamble.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  At the New York Stock Exchange this morning, the moment of  silence was observed for the victims of the Dallas sniper attack which  occurred overnight, following a peaceful rally.  The moment of silence took  place just before today's opening bell.  </p><p>Still ahead, looking for double digit returns, how about 40 percent  returns?  Our market monitor tonight has some names she says will deliver.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  A major setback for the blood-testing startup Theranos.  Its  founder and CEO has been banned from owning or running a medical lab for  two years.  The move comes after a months-long investigation where  inspectors found a number of violations of federal testing standards.   Theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes, says she's disappointed by the  decision.  The company was founded as a way to deliver cheaper blood test  and was valued at $9 billion just two years ago.  </p><p>HERERA:  Twitter reportedly wants to stream more live events.  As first  reported by Re/code, the company is in talks with the NBA, Major League  Soccer and turner broadcasting to buy the digital streaming rights.  The  move is seen as a way for Twitter to attract users and that helped send the  stock higher.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is in Sun Valley along with many of the  big names in technology and media, and as Julia Boorstin reports, there's  growing concern about Silicon Valley's sky high stock valuations.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From Warren Buffett  to Marc Andreessen, a range of big name investors here in Sun Valley,  meeting with media and tech CEOs at the Allen &amp; Co. Conference.  With the  stock market still trading near all time highs, there are big questions  about whether companies like Pinterest, the CEO Ben Silbermann is here,  will be able to hold on to their sky-high valuations.  Airbnb is now around  $30 billion.  </p><p>But Kleiner Perkins partner Bing Gordon says going public isn't top of mind  for many of these companies.  </p><p>BING GORDON, KLEINER PERKINS PARTNER:  It's curious on IPOs.  This  generation of founders, they think IPOs kind of a bucket list, a thing to  check off to put on their mantle.  Sense the late '90s and some of the new  regulatory regime, the IPOs are put off until companies are extremely  healthy and extremely established.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Those successful startups Gordon is talking about maybe staying  private, but they're raising more capital than ever.  Unicorn, a private  company, is valued at $1 billion or more, raised nearly 40 percent of all  venture capital in the first quarter.  Nearly $9 billion according to a new  report from Pitch Book.  </p><p>But as more cash comes pouring in, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo says the  sky high valuations for big tech companies could be at risk.  </p><p>DICK COSTOLO, TWITTER CEO:  I think there is a sense that the valuations of  the public companies and the valuations of public tech companies are still  pretty high and likely to come down.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  And valuations coming down may make some of these companies more  attractive as acquisition targets as LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) was to Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), which last month, snapped up the public business network for  $26 billion. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) walks away from one deal, but strikes  another.  And that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) ended its merger agreement with my tech company Mitel  networks.  The video conferencing technology maker will now be bought by  private equity firm Sirius Capital for about $2 billion, an offer that  Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) says is superior to Mitel.  Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) is  expected to pay Mitel a $60 million termination fee.  </p><p>Shares of Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) up nearly 13 percent to $12.27.  Meanwhile,  Mitel shares surged more than 19 percent to $7.21.  </p><p>McDonald says it will take a $235 million charge in the second quarter  because of refranchising thousands of restaurants and relocating company  headquarters to Chicago.  The change is expected to lower profit by 20  cents a share.  Shares were up fractionally to $121.31.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Gap (NYSE:GPS) sees same story sales rise for the first time  since early last year.  The retailer said the better than expected results  were driven by strong sales in the company's Old Navy brand.  Investors  seemingly please with the news, Gap (NYSE:GPS) shares up nearly 5 percent  at $22.68.  </p><p>Meantime, shares of Barracuda Networks took off today after the provider of  cloud security products reported a rise in both profit and revenue.  The  results were sharply ahead of analyst estimates.  Shares of Barracuda up  more than 18 1/2 percent.  They finished at $18.43.  </p><p>HERERA:  Our market monitor guest likes growth stocks she says could see  double digit gains over the next 12 months.  The last time she was on more  than a year ago, she recommended Cray (NASDAQ:CRAY), which is up 8 percent,  Priceline, which is up 17 percent, and Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Foods, which is  also up 35 percent.  </p><p>She is Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst with Gradient  Investments.</p><p>Welcome back Mariann.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>MARIANN MONTAGNE, GRADIENT INVESTMENTS SR. INVESTMENT ANALYST:  Thank you,  Sue.  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Let's start with your pick, because I know people are anxious to  hear you did well with the last time you were here.  </p><p>Air Lease is currently on the top of the list tonight.  Why?  </p><p>MONTAGNE:  Right.  Well, Air Lease is specialty financing company.  And  their specialty is leasing airplanes to the carriers.  They just match up  the orders with the manufacturers and these airlines who prefer to lease  and they make a spread.  They make a small spread on every deal.  But they  sign these deals for about seven years and they have a high level of  recurring revenue.  It plays of the long term trend of more people around  the globe having access to air travel.  </p><p>And people have been very concerned about rising interest rates.  But  they've shown over and over again, that they can weather through that.  We  think the valuation is extremely cheap.  They had about a 35 percent  discount from the P/E versus the growth rate into the mid-teens.  </p><p>HERERA:  You're looking for a potential 40 percent upside.</p><p>MONTAGNE:  Right.  We think that this should trade in a premium to the  market.  It is really a growth stock.  And as we've seen year to date, the  growth stocks, you know, as shown by the NASDAQ, are down slightly, while  the rest of the market is up 4 percent or better.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Your second one is another one, whose P/E ratio is below its  growth rate, always a good sign.  And that's Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE).  </p><p>MONTAGNE:  Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE).  So, we all use the PDFs most every  day, but they're very much involved in digital marketing and cloud  cooperating software.  They have 80 percent of their revenues recurring, so  this isn't the type of thing that's going to go up and down in terms of  revenues and earnings, and yet, you know, people really haven't latched on  to the software names this year.  And so, it's selling at probably a 20  percent discount from where we think fair value is.  </p><p>HERERA:  And Skyworks is your last pick.  It's currently in the low 60s, 30  to 40 percent potential upside.  We have about a minute left.</p><p>MONTAGNE:  OK.  Skyworks is a component manufacturer for companies like  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  But also many other companies like General Motors  (NYSE:GM) and Ford.  So, as we have the Internet of things, we need more  components, they're putting together more systems so they can be a one-stop  shop for those manufacturers and again, you know, discounted at 35 percent  versus its growth rate, so we think that's very attractive.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Mariann, thank you so much.  Have a great weekend.  </p><p>MONTAGNE:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Mariann Montagne with Gradient Investments.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, a different kind of bright idea, one that hopes to  disrupt our political system and change American democracy for the better.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Most of the time, our bright ideas stories are about companies  with real revenues and profits.  Tonight, though, a different take.  A look  at a company still in an early stage.  Not bringing any money in just yet,  but, of course, hopes to one day.  It's a company that's trying to tap into  this country's current fascination, interest in politics.  It's run by a  pair of San Francisco entrepreneurs, who got what they hope will be the  bright idea to start an online forum for real people having constructed  political discussions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here's one on whether or not the president should use  the term radical Islam.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Matt Mahan and James Windon call their site Brigade.  They also  say it's the world's first network for voters.  Users share opinions and  discuss hot button issues like the presidential race, funding education or  gun control.  </p><p>In a little more than a year, users have shared more than six million  opinions.  Those users come from all 50 states.  The hope is that  discussions can help people to find out that Holy Grail, common ground,  from which to develop real solutions to pressing problems.  </p><p>JAMES WINDON, BRIGADE CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT:  What this is about is  trying to enable people to self-organize, leverage relationships and get  things done.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Signing up is free.  You merely provide your home address to  help brigade verify you.  Users can see how their views stack up nationally  and locally.</p><p>MATT MAHAN, BRIGADE CO-FOUNDER AND CEO:  I just felt like if anything was  going to make our politics work better, it would be social media.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Mahan first got the idea as a student at Harvard back in 2004.   He lived down the hall from Mark Zuckerberg.  Yes, that Mark Zuckerberg.   Mahan used the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) still in its infancy to find other  students likely to join a protest aimed at ending Harvard's investments  into Chinese oil companies operating in Sudan during a genocide there.</p><p>In April 2005, Harvard divested.  </p><p>MAHAN:  So, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) became a very efficient tool for figuring  out who was best connected, who was likely aligned with me, and then as a  tool to mobilize them to get behind a campaign.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  In 2007, Mahan went to work for a company called Causes, a  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) app that helped people connect with non-profits.   That's where he met Windon.  At Causes, they saw 186 million people raise  $48 million for various organizations.  Windon was sold on the power of the  digital platform.  </p><p>WINDON:  When we saw that compare sort of impact you could have through  technology in a matter of months or years, that's changed my perspective.</p><p>MATHISEN:  By 2013, though, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was moving away from third  party apps.  Determined to make another go of it, Mahan and Windon teamed  with tech investors, big ones.  Shawn Parker, Ron Conway and Mark Benioff  in 2014, betting Brigade could be both useful and profitable, but how?  </p><p>Paul Rieckhoff runs the non-profit site Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of  America.  The IAVA test-partnered with Brigade last year.  He thinks non- profits will pay Brigade some day the same way recruiters pay to find  prospective employees on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).  </p><p>PAUL RIECKHOFF, IAVA CO-FOUNDER AND CEO:  Brigade gives us an opportunity  to connect with someone who might be interested in gun rights or they might  be interested in immigration, or they might be interested in baseball.  And  if we can inject veterans issues into that conversation, then we can expand  our market.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  For now, though, Brigade focuses on individual users like  Stephan Nicoleau, an infrastructure investor.  Nicoleau thinks Brigade  might make money selling its data.  </p><p>STEPHAN NICOLEAU, LAGUARDIA DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:  There stands to be an  opportunity to package that and make it available to folks who would have  an interest in using that data.  So, think campaigns, think pundits, think  networks.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Profit isn't the driver just yet.  Mahan and Windon believe  though that that path to the profit will become clear if they just stay on  point.</p><p>WINDON:  At the core of politics, at the core of social change our  relationships and the technology layer that we're seeking to build here is  simply meant to allow individuals to leverage those relationships more  efficiently, more effectively and ultimately, create more rapid change.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, for years, investors fretted over just how Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) could make money.  It sure does now and just a few weeks, of  course, LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) sold for about $26 billion.</p><p>So, with these guys, who knows?  And they have some very, very substantial  investors behind them.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, and a lot of advice.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  A lot of advice, and nice offices.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>That does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks  for watching.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  weekend, everybody, and we'll see you back here on Monday night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

American  businesses ramped up hiring, alleviating fears the economy is sagging and  sending the S&amp;P 500 just shy of a record close.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Goldilocks market?  Job  growth is back.  Fed is on hold.  Volatility collapsing.  Is this the  perfect scenario for investor?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  The results are in.  And tonight, you'll meet the entrepreneurs  who are using social media to spur political discussions, a different kind  of bright idea, tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, July 8th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> Stocks touch all time highs and for that, you can thank a blowout jobs  report.  The employment numbers for June came in much stronger than  expected, showing that one of the best performing part of the economy is  still humming along after sputtering earlier this year in the spring, and  the buyers came out in force today.</p><p> The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 250 points to 18,146.  NASDAQ climbed  79 and the S&amp;P 500 added 32 to close just shy of a record.  But the index  did nip above its all time closing high during the session today.</p><p> And the rally was sparked by the creation of 287,000 new jobs in June, big  increase over the revised gains of just 11,000 in May.  The rate did edge  up to 4.9 percent.  Average hourly earnings rose modestly.  </p><p> Hampton Pearson has more on the job market rebound and what it may mean for  Wall Street and Main Street and the Fed.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The June jobs  surge showed employers recovering from two months of hiring, with the job  growth on a roller coaster, adding just 11,000 new workers to payrolls in  May, compared to today's blockbuster of 287,000.</p><p> THOMAS PEREZ, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SECRETARY:  It's really important when  you have a lower than expected month as we had last month not to -- you  know, jump to conclusion.  </p><p> PEARSON:  The leisure and hospitality sectors led the way in June adding  59,000 new hires.  With health care close behind, hiring 58,000 new  workers.</p><p> But the unemployment rose to 4.9 percent, with little growth in wages.  And  the three-month average is just 147,000 per month.  </p><p> JAN HATZIUS, GOLDMAN SACHS CHIEF ECONOMIST:  The story from the economy is  pretty, we're moving towards full employment.  We're probably very close  and we are starting to see some clearer signs of stronger wage growth.  </p><p> PEARSON:  Data for that June jobs report was collected before Great Britain  voted to leave the European Union last month.  So economists don't have a  gauge of the impact on the American job market, but they point to the 2.6  percent year over year gain in wages as the sign of an economy moving  closer to full employment.  Reasons enough economists say for the Federal  Reserve to stay on the sidelines when it comes to interest rate policy.</p><p> ANASTASIA AMOROSO, J.P. MORGAN GLOBAL STRATEGIST:  This is a really  important for the Fed.  This the exact number the Fed wants to see, right?   They want to see us recover and this really supports the notion that Janet  Yellen had last week or last month that this is an aberration.  </p><p> PEARSON:  Wall Street Fed watchers say the combination of the slowdown in  job growth plus the economic uncertainty from the Brexit vote are  increasing the odds of no Fed rate hike this year.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Now to Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  What happened?  Two  days ago, we were talking about a trading range for the S&amp;P 500 between the  old high of 2,130 and the February lows of roughly 1,800 or so.  We came  very close to those historic highs today, closing just shy of the 2,130  level.  Regardless, it's been a remarkable rally.  </p><p> All right.  So, what happened?  The bulls are arguing that the strong June  jobs report had created a Goldilocks scenario, but the Fed is still on  hold.  The bears are insisting this has nothing to do with fundamentals or  even with the idea that there are some dramatic improvement they say the  rally the is due to unusually heavy demand for both U.S. stocks and bond,  partly due to foreign demand and partly because investors are forced into  U.S. stocks because of a lack of alternative investments, and because  Europe and China stocks are problematic right now.  </p><p> You know what's amazing?  Either interpretation means stocks rally.   They're both could be right and it was a broad-based rally.  Nine stocks  advancing for every one declining and new highs kept expanding throughout  the day.  So, we had industrial names like General Electric (NYSE:GE) and  UPS suddenly on the new high list.</p><p> All right.  Where do we go from here?  We go to earnings, which start on  Monday with Alcoa (NYSE:AA) and we find out how much this whole Brexit  thing might impact the second half of the year.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  So, we got a robust jobs report for June that has stocked touching  new highs.  But what are the numbers telling us about the health of the  economy?  </p><p> Let's turn to Josh Feinman, global chief economist with Deutsche Asset  Management, and Stephen Wood, chief market strategist with Russell  Investments, for more analysis on today's jobs report.  </p><p> Josh, I'll start with you.  I mean, it looked good on the surface.  When  you dug deeper, were you equally as satisfied with the report?  </p><p> JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Yes.  I  mean, I think the report was reassuring.  It certainly helped to allay some  of the fears we got from the previous reports.  </p><p> You had to smooth through the volatility, though.  And we do -- you see job  growth running about 150,000 over the last three, four months.  That's a  healthy clip.  It's enough to continue gradual progress and healing labor  markets and edging back towards full employment, but it's not as strong as  we were seeing, you know, the past couple of years.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Josh, why did May lay such an egg?  </p><p> FEINMAN:  You know, the numbers bounce around from month to month.  This is  why you never hang your hat on anyone particular month.  You got to smooth  it through.  </p><p> And look at the, you know, the broader picture.  As I said, that broader  picture suggests that labor market is healthy, it is improving.  I don't  think that's quite back to full payment.  I think there's still residual  pool of folks who could be drawn back in.  Some folks working part time who  would like to work fulltime.  </p><p> So, I don't think we're all the way back, but we made a lot of progress.   We are starting to see wages pick up a little bit, but still not terribly - - </p><p> HERERA:  Stephen, weigh in on what impressed you and what did not about  this report.  And what position does it put the Fed in?  </p><p> STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENT CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  I think what  impressed me most is there's not radical information that's going to  deviate the Fed's course.  So, the numbers as smooth as Josh mentioned in  that 150 clip, which means the Fed is not going to deviate from their  policy.  We think that they're going to be one and done in December.   That's predominantly because of international events, Brexit, what's  happening in Europe.</p><p> I think the Federal Reserve is inclined to raise rates.  They want to be in  what they consider a normal policy environment.  But the economy is doing  OK.  Earnings starting next week look to be improving into the end of the  year.</p><p> So don't think it's going to be an okay economy.  It's going to be an okay  environment for the Federal Reserve.  I don't think they're very, very  aggressive.  </p><p> We just think that the valuations in U.S. equities are getting very rich.   So, perhaps, globally, we want to have a multi-asset strategy where we can  underweight valuations that are expensive and look at areas where  valuations are a little bit more attractive.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  You know, Steve, a couple of weeks ago, maybe even more recently  than that, an awful lot of guys who are market strategists like you, and  stop picking, do stock picking, said, oh, I see the S&amp;P 500 ending the year  maybe getting back right around 2,100.  That's my number, 2,100.  Well,  now, we're now at 2,130 or thereabouts.  </p><p> So, what's the rest of the year look like from where you sit?  </p><p> WOOD:  I think there's going to be chopped -- I think it's going to be  bookended.  Kind of flat-ish.  We think it will be a positive number, U.S.  equities for 2016, but it's looking a lot like 2015 as well.  A lot of  volatility, flat-ish, a slight upward bias in U.S. equities.  </p><p> But we would be inclined to look at valuations getting rich and richer.   Trim that position.  You don't want to do anything dramatic but trim that  position so that you can fund overweight, the European cycle which is  beginning.  The European Central Bank is going to get very aggressive as  our Fed is kind of stable in their policy path.  So, just be a very -- I  think tactically lean into it.  Stay on your toes and be actively managed.</p><p> HERERA:  Josh, why don't you follow on that, because one of the things that  Tyler and I were talking about right before the show is, you have stocks  rallying, but you also have bonds rallying, and you have gold rallying.   You know, a lot of the normal relationships in the stock markets are not  gelling at this point.</p><p> So, how do you see things playing out, along with the fact that we have an  election that's coming up in November?</p><p> FEINMAN:  Yes, I think they are sending somewhat confusing signals.  I  think one way to maybe reconcile them is to stock market and risk assets,  you're saying, hey, the economy is looking okay, not great, but it's  looking okay.  Interest rate markets are saying maybe it's looking okay,  but monetary policy is going to be an easing mode.  Other parts of the  world in a big way and Fed certainly been pushed out, so that's what's  helping to hold interest rates down.</p><p> So, it's a little bit of the best of both worlds.  But I do think if the  economy, you know, continues on a pretty good track, we get a sense the  Brexit situation is not impeding activity meaningfully in the U.S., then I  think the Fed will be back maybe by the end of the year.  </p><p> HERERA:  Thank you, gentlemen.  Have a great weekend.</p><p> FEINMAN:  You too.</p><p> WOOD:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Stephen Wood with  Russell Investments.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Potential risk for the market we've been following is the  fallout from the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union, but a new survey  of chief financial officers shows only a small portion of those business  executives think the vote to leave will have a negative impact on the U.S.  economy.  The bigger impact, according to the CNBC survey, will be, as you  might expect, on the U.K. and E.U. economy.  </p><p> HERERA:  That vote in the United Kingdom, along with global security, were  just some of the topics discussed at the NATO summit where President Obama,  along with British Prime Minister David Cameron, were in attendance.  </p><p> Hadley Gamble reports tonight from Warsaw. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HADLEY GAMBLE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Strength and unity,  that's what NATO secretary general says this organization is going to have  to continue to project even as fears mount over the European Union as well  as governments here trying to decide what Vladimir Putin's next move.  </p><p> JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL:  We will continue the seek  constructive and meaningful dialogue with Russia, to make our intentions  clear, to dispel any misunderstanding, and to reduce the risk of military  incidents or accidents spiraling out of control.</p><p> GAMBLE:  As the largest NATO Summit in history got underway today in  Warsaw, questions continue to be raised over just how far NATO should beef  Eastern Europe's security.  A 4,000-strong multinational force will be  deployed in four battalions, ranging from Poland to the Baltic State.   Several smaller NATO outposts will be created, as well as the rapid  response force that can be deployed if needed.  </p><p> Now, while the troop buildup is aimed at deterring Russia from further  aggression along NATO's eastern plank, officials here are working a fine  line between antagonizing the Kremlin and reassuring ex-Soviet member  states concern that they can be Mr. Putin's next target.  </p><p> STOLTENBERG:  We have tripled the size of the NATO response force.  We have  established new headquarters in the east, and the further developed key  capabilities like ballistic missile defense against threats from outside  the Euro Atlantic area.  </p><p> GAMBLE:  Another potential game changer for NATO is just how much Brexit  could impact the North Atlantic alliance.  The U.K. was a major force  behind E.U. sanctions on Russia.  And despite mounting pressure from other  E.U. nations to roll them back has held firm.  They were also a major  contributor to overall NATO spending and with Washington keen to see more  commitment from E.U. countries, it remains to be seen just how ready Europe  is to foot the bill for their own security.  </p><p> BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The vote in the United  Kingdom to leave the E.U. has created uncertainty about the future of  European integration.  And, unfortunately, this has led some to suggest  that the entire edifice of European security and prosperity is crumbling.   For those who have been questioning what does this mean for the  transatlantic relationship, let me just say it is often the case in moments  of change, that this kinds of hyperbole is misplaced.  </p><p> GAMBLE:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT in Warsaw, Poland, I'm Hadley Gamble.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  At the New York Stock Exchange this morning, the moment of  silence was observed for the victims of the Dallas sniper attack which  occurred overnight, following a peaceful rally.  The moment of silence took  place just before today's opening bell.  </p><p> Still ahead, looking for double digit returns, how about 40 percent  returns?  Our market monitor tonight has some names she says will deliver.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  A major setback for the blood-testing startup Theranos.  Its  founder and CEO has been banned from owning or running a medical lab for  two years.  The move comes after a months-long investigation where  inspectors found a number of violations of federal testing standards.   Theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes, says she's disappointed by the  decision.  The company was founded as a way to deliver cheaper blood test  and was valued at $9 billion just two years ago.  </p><p> HERERA:  Twitter reportedly wants to stream more live events.  As first  reported by Re/code, the company is in talks with the NBA, Major League  Soccer and turner broadcasting to buy the digital streaming rights.  The  move is seen as a way for Twitter to attract users and that helped send the  stock higher.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is in Sun Valley along with many of the  big names in technology and media, and as Julia Boorstin reports, there's  growing concern about Silicon Valley's sky high stock valuations.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From Warren Buffett  to Marc Andreessen, a range of big name investors here in Sun Valley,  meeting with media and tech CEOs at the Allen &amp; Co. Conference.  With the  stock market still trading near all time highs, there are big questions  about whether companies like Pinterest, the CEO Ben Silbermann is here,  will be able to hold on to their sky-high valuations.  Airbnb is now around  $30 billion.  </p><p> But Kleiner Perkins partner Bing Gordon says going public isn't top of mind  for many of these companies.  </p><p> BING GORDON, KLEINER PERKINS PARTNER:  It's curious on IPOs.  This  generation of founders, they think IPOs kind of a bucket list, a thing to  check off to put on their mantle.  Sense the late '90s and some of the new  regulatory regime, the IPOs are put off until companies are extremely  healthy and extremely established.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Those successful startups Gordon is talking about maybe staying  private, but they're raising more capital than ever.  Unicorn, a private  company, is valued at $1 billion or more, raised nearly 40 percent of all  venture capital in the first quarter.  Nearly $9 billion according to a new  report from Pitch Book.  </p><p> But as more cash comes pouring in, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo says the  sky high valuations for big tech companies could be at risk.  </p><p> DICK COSTOLO, TWITTER CEO:  I think there is a sense that the valuations of  the public companies and the valuations of public tech companies are still  pretty high and likely to come down.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  And valuations coming down may make some of these companies more  attractive as acquisition targets as LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) was to Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), which last month, snapped up the public business network for  $26 billion. </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) walks away from one deal, but strikes  another.  And that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p> Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) ended its merger agreement with my tech company Mitel  networks.  The video conferencing technology maker will now be bought by  private equity firm Sirius Capital for about $2 billion, an offer that  Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) says is superior to Mitel.  Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) is  expected to pay Mitel a $60 million termination fee.  </p><p> Shares of Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) up nearly 13 percent to $12.27.  Meanwhile,  Mitel shares surged more than 19 percent to $7.21.  </p><p> McDonald says it will take a $235 million charge in the second quarter  because of refranchising thousands of restaurants and relocating company  headquarters to Chicago.  The change is expected to lower profit by 20  cents a share.  Shares were up fractionally to $121.31.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Gap (NYSE:GPS) sees same story sales rise for the first time  since early last year.  The retailer said the better than expected results  were driven by strong sales in the company's Old Navy brand.  Investors  seemingly please with the news, Gap (NYSE:GPS) shares up nearly 5 percent  at $22.68.  </p><p> Meantime, shares of Barracuda Networks took off today after the provider of  cloud security products reported a rise in both profit and revenue.  The  results were sharply ahead of analyst estimates.  Shares of Barracuda up  more than 18 1/2 percent.  They finished at $18.43.  </p><p> HERERA:  Our market monitor guest likes growth stocks she says could see  double digit gains over the next 12 months.  The last time she was on more  than a year ago, she recommended Cray (NASDAQ:CRAY), which is up 8 percent,  Priceline, which is up 17 percent, and Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Foods, which is  also up 35 percent.  </p><p> She is Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst with Gradient  Investments.</p><p> Welcome back Mariann.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p> MARIANN MONTAGNE, GRADIENT INVESTMENTS SR. INVESTMENT ANALYST:  Thank you,  Sue.  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  Let's start with your pick, because I know people are anxious to  hear you did well with the last time you were here.  </p><p> Air Lease is currently on the top of the list tonight.  Why?  </p><p> MONTAGNE:  Right.  Well, Air Lease is specialty financing company.  And  their specialty is leasing airplanes to the carriers.  They just match up  the orders with the manufacturers and these airlines who prefer to lease  and they make a spread.  They make a small spread on every deal.  But they  sign these deals for about seven years and they have a high level of  recurring revenue.  It plays of the long term trend of more people around  the globe having access to air travel.  </p><p> And people have been very concerned about rising interest rates.  But  they've shown over and over again, that they can weather through that.  We  think the valuation is extremely cheap.  They had about a 35 percent  discount from the P/E versus the growth rate into the mid-teens.  </p><p> HERERA:  You're looking for a potential 40 percent upside.</p><p> MONTAGNE:  Right.  We think that this should trade in a premium to the  market.  It is really a growth stock.  And as we've seen year to date, the  growth stocks, you know, as shown by the NASDAQ, are down slightly, while  the rest of the market is up 4 percent or better.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Your second one is another one, whose P/E ratio is below its  growth rate, always a good sign.  And that's Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE).  </p><p> MONTAGNE:  Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE).  So, we all use the PDFs most every  day, but they're very much involved in digital marketing and cloud  cooperating software.  They have 80 percent of their revenues recurring, so  this isn't the type of thing that's going to go up and down in terms of  revenues and earnings, and yet, you know, people really haven't latched on  to the software names this year.  And so, it's selling at probably a 20  percent discount from where we think fair value is.  </p><p> HERERA:  And Skyworks is your last pick.  It's currently in the low 60s, 30  to 40 percent potential upside.  We have about a minute left.</p><p> MONTAGNE:  OK.  Skyworks is a component manufacturer for companies like  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  But also many other companies like General Motors  (NYSE:GM) and Ford.  So, as we have the Internet of things, we need more  components, they're putting together more systems so they can be a one-stop  shop for those manufacturers and again, you know, discounted at 35 percent  versus its growth rate, so we think that's very attractive.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  Mariann, thank you so much.  Have a great weekend.  </p><p> MONTAGNE:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  Mariann Montagne with Gradient Investments.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Coming up, a different kind of bright idea, one that hopes to  disrupt our political system and change American democracy for the better.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Most of the time, our bright ideas stories are about companies  with real revenues and profits.  Tonight, though, a different take.  A look  at a company still in an early stage.  Not bringing any money in just yet,  but, of course, hopes to one day.  It's a company that's trying to tap into  this country's current fascination, interest in politics.  It's run by a  pair of San Francisco entrepreneurs, who got what they hope will be the  bright idea to start an online forum for real people having constructed  political discussions.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here's one on whether or not the president should use  the term radical Islam.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Matt Mahan and James Windon call their site Brigade.  They also  say it's the world's first network for voters.  Users share opinions and  discuss hot button issues like the presidential race, funding education or  gun control.  </p><p> In a little more than a year, users have shared more than six million  opinions.  Those users come from all 50 states.  The hope is that  discussions can help people to find out that Holy Grail, common ground,  from which to develop real solutions to pressing problems.  </p><p> JAMES WINDON, BRIGADE CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT:  What this is about is  trying to enable people to self-organize, leverage relationships and get  things done.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Signing up is free.  You merely provide your home address to  help brigade verify you.  Users can see how their views stack up nationally  and locally.</p><p> MATT MAHAN, BRIGADE CO-FOUNDER AND CEO:  I just felt like if anything was  going to make our politics work better, it would be social media.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Mahan first got the idea as a student at Harvard back in 2004.   He lived down the hall from Mark Zuckerberg.  Yes, that Mark Zuckerberg.   Mahan used the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) still in its infancy to find other  students likely to join a protest aimed at ending Harvard's investments  into Chinese oil companies operating in Sudan during a genocide there.</p><p> In April 2005, Harvard divested.  </p><p> MAHAN:  So, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) became a very efficient tool for figuring  out who was best connected, who was likely aligned with me, and then as a  tool to mobilize them to get behind a campaign.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  In 2007, Mahan went to work for a company called Causes, a  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) app that helped people connect with non-profits.   That's where he met Windon.  At Causes, they saw 186 million people raise  $48 million for various organizations.  Windon was sold on the power of the  digital platform.  </p><p> WINDON:  When we saw that compare sort of impact you could have through  technology in a matter of months or years, that's changed my perspective.</p><p> MATHISEN:  By 2013, though, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was moving away from third  party apps.  Determined to make another go of it, Mahan and Windon teamed  with tech investors, big ones.  Shawn Parker, Ron Conway and Mark Benioff  in 2014, betting Brigade could be both useful and profitable, but how?  </p><p> Paul Rieckhoff runs the non-profit site Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of  America.  The IAVA test-partnered with Brigade last year.  He thinks non- profits will pay Brigade some day the same way recruiters pay to find  prospective employees on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).  </p><p> PAUL RIECKHOFF, IAVA CO-FOUNDER AND CEO:  Brigade gives us an opportunity  to connect with someone who might be interested in gun rights or they might  be interested in immigration, or they might be interested in baseball.  And  if we can inject veterans issues into that conversation, then we can expand  our market.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  For now, though, Brigade focuses on individual users like  Stephan Nicoleau, an infrastructure investor.  Nicoleau thinks Brigade  might make money selling its data.  </p><p> STEPHAN NICOLEAU, LAGUARDIA DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:  There stands to be an  opportunity to package that and make it available to folks who would have  an interest in using that data.  So, think campaigns, think pundits, think  networks.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Profit isn't the driver just yet.  Mahan and Windon believe  though that that path to the profit will become clear if they just stay on  point.</p><p> WINDON:  At the core of politics, at the core of social change our  relationships and the technology layer that we're seeking to build here is  simply meant to allow individuals to leverage those relationships more  efficiently, more effectively and ultimately, create more rapid change.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  You know, for years, investors fretted over just how Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) could make money.  It sure does now and just a few weeks, of  course, LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) sold for about $26 billion.</p><p> So, with these guys, who knows?  And they have some very, very substantial  investors behind them.  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes, and a lot of advice.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  A lot of advice, and nice offices.  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p> That does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks  for watching.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  weekend, everybody, and we'll see you back here on Monday night.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The employment numbers for June came in much stronger than expected, showing that one of the best performing part of the economy is still humming along after sputtering earlier this year in the spring, and the buyers came out in force today.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 250 points to 18,146. NASDAQ climbed 79 and the S&amp;P 500 added 32 to close just shy of a record. But the index did nip above its all time closing high during the session today.</p><p>And the rally was sparked by the creation of 287,000 new jobs in June, big increase over the revised gains of just 11,000 in May. The rate did edge up to 4.9 percent. Average hourly earnings rose modestly.</p><p>Hampton Pearson has more on the job market rebound and what it may mean for Wall Street and Main Street and the Fed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The June jobs surge showed employers recovering from two months of hiring, with the job growth on a roller coaster, adding just 11,000 new workers to payrolls in May, compared to today`s blockbuster of 287,000.</p><p>THOMAS PEREZ, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SECRETARY: It`s really important when you have a lower than expected month as we had last month not to -- you know, jump to conclusion.</p><p>PEARSON: The leisure and hospitality sectors led the way in June adding 59,000 new hires. With health care close behind, hiring 58,000 new workers.</p><p>But the unemployment rose to 4.9 percent, with little growth in wages. And the three-month average is just 147,000 per month.</p><p>JAN HATZIUS, GOLDMAN SACHS CHIEF ECONOMIST: The story from the economy is pretty, we`re moving towards full employment. We`re probably very close and we are starting to see some clearer signs of stronger wage growth.</p><p>PEARSON: Data for that June jobs report was collected before Great Britain voted to leave the European Union last month. So economists don`t have a gauge of the impact on the American job market, but they point to the 2.6 percent year over year gain in wages as the sign of an economy moving closer to full employment. Reasons enough economists say for the Federal Reserve to stay on the sidelines when it comes to interest rate policy.</p><p>ANASTASIA AMOROSO, J.P. MORGAN GLOBAL STRATEGIST: This is a really important for the Fed. This the exact number the Fed wants to see, right? They want to see us recover and this really supports the notion that Janet Yellen had last week or last month that this is an aberration.</p><p>PEARSON: Wall Street Fed watchers say the combination of the slowdown in job growth plus the economic uncertainty from the Brexit vote are increasing the odds of no Fed rate hike this year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Hampton Pearson in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Now to Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: What happened? Two days ago, we were talking about a trading range for the S&amp;P 500 between the old high of 2,130 and the February lows of roughly 1,800 or so. We came very close to those historic highs today, closing just shy of the 2,130 level. Regardless, it`s been a remarkable rally.</p><p>All right. So, what happened? The bulls are arguing that the strong June jobs report had created a Goldilocks scenario, but the Fed is still on hold. The bears are insisting this has nothing to do with fundamentals or even with the idea that there are some dramatic improvement they say the rally the is due to unusually heavy demand for both U.S. stocks and bond, partly due to foreign demand and partly because investors are forced into U.S. stocks because of a lack of alternative investments, and because Europe and China stocks are problematic right now.</p><p>You know what`s amazing? Either interpretation means stocks rally. They`re both could be right and it was a broad-based rally. Nine stocks advancing for every one declining and new highs kept expanding throughout the day. So, we had industrial names like General Electric (NYSE:GE) and UPS suddenly on the new high list.</p><p>All right. Where do we go from here? We go to earnings, which start on Monday with Alcoa (NYSE:AA) and we find out how much this whole Brexit thing might impact the second half of the year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, we got a robust jobs report for June that has stocked touching new highs. But what are the numbers telling us about the health of the economy?</p><p>Let`s turn to Josh Feinman, global chief economist with Deutsche Asset Management, and Stephen Wood, chief market strategist with Russell Investments, for more analysis on today`s jobs report.</p><p>Josh, I`ll start with you. I mean, it looked good on the surface. When you dug deeper, were you equally as satisfied with the report?</p><p>JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT GLOBAL CHIEF ECONOMIST: Yes. I mean, I think the report was reassuring. It certainly helped to allay some of the fears we got from the previous reports.</p><p>You had to smooth through the volatility, though. And we do -- you see job growth running about 150,000 over the last three, four months. That`s a healthy clip. It`s enough to continue gradual progress and healing labor markets and edging back towards full employment, but it`s not as strong as we were seeing, you know, the past couple of years.</p><p>MATHISEN: Josh, why did May lay such an egg?</p><p>FEINMAN: You know, the numbers bounce around from month to month. This is why you never hang your hat on anyone particular month. You got to smooth it through.</p><p>And look at the, you know, the broader picture. As I said, that broader picture suggests that labor market is healthy, it is improving. I don`t think that`s quite back to full payment. I think there`s still residual pool of folks who could be drawn back in. Some folks working part time who would like to work fulltime.</p><p>So, I don`t think we`re all the way back, but we made a lot of progress. We are starting to see wages pick up a little bit, but still not terribly - -</p><p>HERERA: Stephen, weigh in on what impressed you and what did not about this report. And what position does it put the Fed in?</p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENT CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: I think what impressed me most is there`s not radical information that`s going to deviate the Fed`s course. So, the numbers as smooth as Josh mentioned in that 150 clip, which means the Fed is not going to deviate from their policy. We think that they`re going to be one and done in December. That`s predominantly because of international events, Brexit, what`s happening in Europe.</p><p>I think the Federal Reserve is inclined to raise rates. They want to be in what they consider a normal policy environment. But the economy is doing OK. Earnings starting next week look to be improving into the end of the year.</p><p>So don`t think it`s going to be an okay economy. It`s going to be an okay environment for the Federal Reserve. I don`t think they`re very, very aggressive.</p><p>We just think that the valuations in U.S. equities are getting very rich. So, perhaps, globally, we want to have a multi-asset strategy where we can underweight valuations that are expensive and look at areas where valuations are a little bit more attractive.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, Steve, a couple of weeks ago, maybe even more recently than that, an awful lot of guys who are market strategists like you, and stop picking, do stock picking, said, oh, I see the S&amp;P 500 ending the year maybe getting back right around 2,100. That`s my number, 2,100. Well, now, we`re now at 2,130 or thereabouts.</p><p>So, what`s the rest of the year look like from where you sit?</p><p>WOOD: I think there`s going to be chopped -- I think it`s going to be bookended. Kind of flat-ish. We think it will be a positive number, U.S. equities for 2016, but it`s looking a lot like 2015 as well. A lot of volatility, flat-ish, a slight upward bias in U.S. equities.</p><p>But we would be inclined to look at valuations getting rich and richer. Trim that position. You don`t want to do anything dramatic but trim that position so that you can fund overweight, the European cycle which is beginning. The European Central Bank is going to get very aggressive as our Fed is kind of stable in their policy path. So, just be a very -- I think tactically lean into it. Stay on your toes and be actively managed.</p><p>HERERA: Josh, why don`t you follow on that, because one of the things that Tyler and I were talking about right before the show is, you have stocks rallying, but you also have bonds rallying, and you have gold rallying. You know, a lot of the normal relationships in the stock markets are not gelling at this point.</p><p>So, how do you see things playing out, along with the fact that we have an election that`s coming up in November?</p><p>FEINMAN: Yes, I think they are sending somewhat confusing signals. I think one way to maybe reconcile them is to stock market and risk assets, you`re saying, hey, the economy is looking okay, not great, but it`s looking okay. Interest rate markets are saying maybe it`s looking okay, but monetary policy is going to be an easing mode. Other parts of the world in a big way and Fed certainly been pushed out, so that`s what`s helping to hold interest rates down.</p><p>So, it`s a little bit of the best of both worlds. But I do think if the economy, you know, continues on a pretty good track, we get a sense the Brexit situation is not impeding activity meaningfully in the U.S., then I think the Fed will be back maybe by the end of the year.</p><p>HERERA: Thank you, gentlemen. Have a great weekend.</p><p>FEINMAN: You too.</p><p>WOOD: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Josh Feinman with Deutsche Asset Management, Stephen Wood with Russell Investments.</p><p>MATHISEN: Potential risk for the market we`ve been following is the fallout from the U.K.`s vote to leave the European Union, but a new survey of chief financial officers shows only a small portion of those business executives think the vote to leave will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. The bigger impact, according to the CNBC survey, will be, as you might expect, on the U.K. and E.U. economy.</p><p>HERERA: That vote in the United Kingdom, along with global security, were just some of the topics discussed at the NATO summit where President Obama, along with British Prime Minister David Cameron, were in attendance.</p><p>Hadley Gamble reports tonight from Warsaw.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HADLEY GAMBLE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Strength and unity, that`s what NATO secretary general says this organization is going to have to continue to project even as fears mount over the European Union as well as governments here trying to decide what Vladimir Putin`s next move.</p><p>JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: We will continue the seek constructive and meaningful dialogue with Russia, to make our intentions clear, to dispel any misunderstanding, and to reduce the risk of military incidents or accidents spiraling out of control.</p><p>GAMBLE: As the largest NATO Summit in history got underway today in Warsaw, questions continue to be raised over just how far NATO should beef Eastern Europe`s security. A 4,000-strong multinational force will be deployed in four battalions, ranging from Poland to the Baltic State. Several smaller NATO outposts will be created, as well as the rapid response force that can be deployed if needed.</p><p>Now, while the troop buildup is aimed at deterring Russia from further aggression along NATO`s eastern plank, officials here are working a fine line between antagonizing the Kremlin and reassuring ex-Soviet member states concern that they can be Mr. Putin`s next target.</p><p>STOLTENBERG: We have tripled the size of the NATO response force. We have established new headquarters in the east, and the further developed key capabilities like ballistic missile defense against threats from outside the Euro Atlantic area.</p><p>GAMBLE: Another potential game changer for NATO is just how much Brexit could impact the North Atlantic alliance. The U.K. was a major force behind E.U. sanctions on Russia. And despite mounting pressure from other E.U. nations to roll them back has held firm. They were also a major contributor to overall NATO spending and with Washington keen to see more commitment from E.U. countries, it remains to be seen just how ready Europe is to foot the bill for their own security.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The vote in the United Kingdom to leave the E.U. has created uncertainty about the future of European integration. And, unfortunately, this has led some to suggest that the entire edifice of European security and prosperity is crumbling. For those who have been questioning what does this mean for the transatlantic relationship, let me just say it is often the case in moments of change, that this kinds of hyperbole is misplaced.</p><p>GAMBLE: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT in Warsaw, Poland, I`m Hadley Gamble.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: At the New York Stock Exchange this morning, the moment of silence was observed for the victims of the Dallas sniper attack which occurred overnight, following a peaceful rally. The moment of silence took place just before today`s opening bell.</p><p>Still ahead, looking for double digit returns, how about 40 percent returns? Our market monitor tonight has some names she says will deliver.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: A major setback for the blood-testing startup Theranos. Its founder and CEO has been banned from owning or running a medical lab for two years. The move comes after a months-long investigation where inspectors found a number of violations of federal testing standards. Theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes, says she`s disappointed by the decision. The company was founded as a way to deliver cheaper blood test and was valued at $9 billion just two years ago.</p><p>HERERA: Twitter reportedly wants to stream more live events. As first reported by Re/code, the company is in talks with the NBA, Major League Soccer and turner broadcasting to buy the digital streaming rights. The move is seen as a way for Twitter to attract users and that helped send the stock higher.</p><p>MATHISEN: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is in Sun Valley along with many of the big names in technology and media, and as Julia Boorstin reports, there`s growing concern about Silicon Valley`s sky high stock valuations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: From Warren Buffett to Marc Andreessen, a range of big name investors here in Sun Valley, meeting with media and tech CEOs at the Allen &amp; Co. Conference. With the stock market still trading near all time highs, there are big questions about whether companies like Pinterest, the CEO Ben Silbermann is here, will be able to hold on to their sky-high valuations. Airbnb is now around $30 billion.</p><p>But Kleiner Perkins partner Bing Gordon says going public isn`t top of mind for many of these companies.</p><p>BING GORDON, KLEINER PERKINS PARTNER: It`s curious on IPOs. This generation of founders, they think IPOs kind of a bucket list, a thing to check off to put on their mantle. Sense the late `90s and some of the new regulatory regime, the IPOs are put off until companies are extremely healthy and extremely established.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Those successful startups Gordon is talking about maybe staying private, but they`re raising more capital than ever. Unicorn, a private company, is valued at $1 billion or more, raised nearly 40 percent of all venture capital in the first quarter. Nearly $9 billion according to a new report from Pitch Book.</p><p>But as more cash comes pouring in, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo says the sky high valuations for big tech companies could be at risk.</p><p>DICK COSTOLO, TWITTER CEO: I think there is a sense that the valuations of the public companies and the valuations of public tech companies are still pretty high and likely to come down.</p><p>BOORSTIN: And valuations coming down may make some of these companies more attractive as acquisition targets as LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) was to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which last month, snapped up the public business network for $26 billion.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) walks away from one deal, but strikes another. And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) ended its merger agreement with my tech company Mitel networks. The video conferencing technology maker will now be bought by private equity firm Sirius Capital for about $2 billion, an offer that Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) says is superior to Mitel. Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) is expected to pay Mitel a $60 million termination fee.</p><p>Shares of Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) up nearly 13 percent to $12.27. Meanwhile, Mitel shares surged more than 19 percent to $7.21.</p><p>McDonald says it will take a $235 million charge in the second quarter because of refranchising thousands of restaurants and relocating company headquarters to Chicago. The change is expected to lower profit by 20 cents a share. Shares were up fractionally to $121.31.</p><p>MATHISEN: Gap (NYSE:GPS) sees same story sales rise for the first time since early last year. The retailer said the better than expected results were driven by strong sales in the company`s Old Navy brand. Investors seemingly please with the news, Gap (NYSE:GPS) shares up nearly 5 percent at $22.68.</p><p>Meantime, shares of Barracuda Networks took off today after the provider of cloud security products reported a rise in both profit and revenue. The results were sharply ahead of analyst estimates. Shares of Barracuda up more than 18 1/2 percent. They finished at $18.43.</p><p>HERERA: Our market monitor guest likes growth stocks she says could see double digit gains over the next 12 months. The last time she was on more than a year ago, she recommended Cray (NASDAQ:CRAY), which is up 8 percent, Priceline, which is up 17 percent, and Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Foods, which is also up 35 percent.</p><p>She is Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst with Gradient Investments.</p><p>Welcome back Mariann. Nice to have you here.</p><p>MARIANN MONTAGNE, GRADIENT INVESTMENTS SR. INVESTMENT ANALYST: Thank you, Sue. Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Let`s start with your pick, because I know people are anxious to hear you did well with the last time you were here.</p><p>Air Lease is currently on the top of the list tonight. Why?</p><p>MONTAGNE: Right. Well, Air Lease is specialty financing company. And their specialty is leasing airplanes to the carriers. They just match up the orders with the manufacturers and these airlines who prefer to lease and they make a spread. They make a small spread on every deal. But they sign these deals for about seven years and they have a high level of recurring revenue. It plays of the long term trend of more people around the globe having access to air travel.</p><p>And people have been very concerned about rising interest rates. But they`ve shown over and over again, that they can weather through that. We think the valuation is extremely cheap. They had about a 35 percent discount from the P/E versus the growth rate into the mid-teens.</p><p>HERERA: You`re looking for a potential 40 percent upside.</p><p>MONTAGNE: Right. We think that this should trade in a premium to the market. It is really a growth stock. And as we`ve seen year to date, the growth stocks, you know, as shown by the NASDAQ, are down slightly, while the rest of the market is up 4 percent or better.</p><p>MATHISEN: Your second one is another one, whose P/E ratio is below its growth rate, always a good sign. And that`s Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE).</p><p>MONTAGNE: Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). So, we all use the PDFs most every day, but they`re very much involved in digital marketing and cloud cooperating software. They have 80 percent of their revenues recurring, so this isn`t the type of thing that`s going to go up and down in terms of revenues and earnings, and yet, you know, people really haven`t latched on to the software names this year. And so, it`s selling at probably a 20 percent discount from where we think fair value is.</p><p>HERERA: And Skyworks is your last pick. It`s currently in the low 60s, 30 to 40 percent potential upside. We have about a minute left.</p><p>MONTAGNE: OK. Skyworks is a component manufacturer for companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But also many other companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford. So, as we have the Internet of things, we need more components, they`re putting together more systems so they can be a one-stop shop for those manufacturers and again, you know, discounted at 35 percent versus its growth rate, so we think that`s very attractive.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Mariann, thank you so much. Have a great weekend.</p><p>MONTAGNE: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Mariann Montagne with Gradient Investments.</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, a different kind of bright idea, one that hopes to disrupt our political system and change American democracy for the better.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Most of the time, our bright ideas stories are about companies with real revenues and profits. Tonight, though, a different take. A look at a company still in an early stage. Not bringing any money in just yet, but, of course, hopes to one day. It`s a company that`s trying to tap into this country`s current fascination, interest in politics. It`s run by a pair of San Francisco entrepreneurs, who got what they hope will be the bright idea to start an online forum for real people having constructed political discussions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here`s one on whether or not the president should use the term radical Islam.</p><p>MATHISEN: Matt Mahan and James Windon call their site Brigade. They also say it`s the world`s first network for voters. Users share opinions and discuss hot button issues like the presidential race, funding education or gun control.</p><p>In a little more than a year, users have shared more than six million opinions. Those users come from all 50 states. The hope is that discussions can help people to find out that Holy Grail, common ground, from which to develop real solutions to pressing problems.</p><p>JAMES WINDON, BRIGADE CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT: What this is about is trying to enable people to self-organize, leverage relationships and get things done.</p><p>MATHISEN: Signing up is free. You merely provide your home address to help brigade verify you. Users can see how their views stack up nationally and locally.</p><p>MATT MAHAN, BRIGADE CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: I just felt like if anything was going to make our politics work better, it would be social media.</p><p>MATHISEN: Mahan first got the idea as a student at Harvard back in 2004. He lived down the hall from Mark Zuckerberg. Yes, that Mark Zuckerberg. Mahan used the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) still in its infancy to find other students likely to join a protest aimed at ending Harvard`s investments into Chinese oil companies operating in Sudan during a genocide there.</p><p>In April 2005, Harvard divested.</p><p>MAHAN: So, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) became a very efficient tool for figuring out who was best connected, who was likely aligned with me, and then as a tool to mobilize them to get behind a campaign.</p><p>MATHISEN: In 2007, Mahan went to work for a company called Causes, a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) app that helped people connect with non-profits. That`s where he met Windon. At Causes, they saw 186 million people raise $48 million for various organizations. Windon was sold on the power of the digital platform.</p><p>WINDON: When we saw that compare sort of impact you could have through technology in a matter of months or years, that`s changed my perspective.</p><p>MATHISEN: By 2013, though, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was moving away from third party apps. Determined to make another go of it, Mahan and Windon teamed with tech investors, big ones. Shawn Parker, Ron Conway and Mark Benioff in 2014, betting Brigade could be both useful and profitable, but how?</p><p>Paul Rieckhoff runs the non-profit site Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. The IAVA test-partnered with Brigade last year. He thinks non- profits will pay Brigade some day the same way recruiters pay to find prospective employees on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).</p><p>PAUL RIECKHOFF, IAVA CO-FOUNDER AND CEO: Brigade gives us an opportunity to connect with someone who might be interested in gun rights or they might be interested in immigration, or they might be interested in baseball. And if we can inject veterans issues into that conversation, then we can expand our market.</p><p>MATHISEN: For now, though, Brigade focuses on individual users like Stephan Nicoleau, an infrastructure investor. Nicoleau thinks Brigade might make money selling its data.</p><p>STEPHAN NICOLEAU, LAGUARDIA DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS: There stands to be an opportunity to package that and make it available to folks who would have an interest in using that data. So, think campaigns, think pundits, think networks.</p><p>MATHISEN: Profit isn`t the driver just yet. Mahan and Windon believe though that that path to the profit will become clear if they just stay on point.</p><p>WINDON: At the core of politics, at the core of social change our relationships and the technology layer that we`re seeking to build here is simply meant to allow individuals to leverage those relationships more efficiently, more effectively and ultimately, create more rapid change.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, for years, investors fretted over just how Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could make money. It sure does now and just a few weeks, of course, LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) sold for about $26 billion.</p><p>So, with these guys, who knows? And they have some very, very substantial investors behind them.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, and a lot of advice.</p><p>MATHISEN: A lot of advice, and nice offices.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, exactly.</p><p>That does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And thanks from me as well. I`m Tyler Mathisen. Have a great weekend, everybody, and we`ll see you back here on Monday night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The S&amp;P breaks through 3,000 for the first time ever and the Nasdaq closes at a record.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Battle for content. Major media players are in Sun Valley as the industry enters a new era and competition among streaming services intensifies.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The top state for business. Why Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had it right when it chose Virginia for its second headquarters.</p><p>Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, July 10th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Well, the stage is set and investors cheered. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell bolstered the case for a possible interest rate cut when policymakers meet at the end of the month. He suggested that lowering the benchmark rate would bolster growth and cited a number of uncertainties here and around the globe.</p><p>That lifted optimism on Wall Street, sending the Nasdaq to new highs and the S&amp;P 500 briefly through the 3,000 mark before it pulled back. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 76 points to 26,860. The Nasdaq was up 60 and the S&amp;P 500 gained 13.</p><p>We have two reports tonight. Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange, but we begin with Steve Liesman and the Fed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell all but guaranteed the Federal Reserve will be cutting rates probably as soon as this month, that`s from a semiannual testimony in the House today. While he said the U.S. economy is in a good place, he emphasized trade uncertainty, global economic weakness and low inflation as the more important factors guiding Fed policy.</p><p>REP. ANTHONY GONZALEZ (R-OH): Would it be fair to characterize based on what we are seeing on those two factors specifically that a strong case could be made for lowering?</p><p>POWELL: So, yes. As I mentioned, we think that uncertainty around -- around trade policy and also global growth, it`s not -- it is not all down to trade policy.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Right.</p><p>POWELL: There`s something going on with growth around the world, particularly around manufacturing and investment and trade. And so, that uncertainty is we think weighing on the domestic economy.</p><p>LIESMAN: Powell said he was not swayed by the strong jobs report this past Friday and, in fact, said the economic data had continued to disappoint. That leaves the most important question. How many rate cuts after July?</p><p>Fed funds futures are pricing in a 100 percent rate cut in July. Markets see a 56 percent chance of yet a third rate cut in December for 75-basis point or three-quarters of a point of rate cut this year.</p><p>MICHELLE MEYER, BANK OF AMERICA: A 25-basis point cut, it seems very likely. In fact, there`s a decent possibility they could consider a 50- basis point cut. They want to be aggressive, they want to be early, and they want to ensure that this rate cut (ph) can continue and they`re not waiting to see evidence of slowing in the data.</p><p>LIESMAN: On a separate note, Powell was asked by Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, if he thought President Trump could fire him.</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA (NASDAQ:CA)): Mr. Chairman, if you got a call from the president today or today and tomorrow and he said, I`m firing you, pack up, it is time to go, what would you do?</p><p>POWELL: Well, of course, I would not do that.</p><p>WATERS: I can`t hear you.</p><p>POWELL: Well, my answer would be no.</p><p>WATERS: And you would not pack up and you would not leave?</p><p>POWELL: No, ma`am.</p><p>WATERS: Because you think the president doesn`t have the authority, is that why you would not leave?</p><p>POWELL: I have -- I`ve kind of said what I -- what I`ve intended to say on the subject, and what I have said is that the law clearly gives me a four- year term and I fully intend to serve it.</p><p>LIESMAN: Stocks and bonds both liked the message from Powell on the outlook for interest rates. We`ll see if he continues that message in testimony before the Senate tomorrow.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And as Sue mentioned, investors did indeed like the Fed chief`s message, especially early in the trading day when all three major indexes hit intraday highs.</p><p>Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks marched higher, pushing the S&amp;P 500 beyond 3,000 early on though we did end well off the levels. Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell testified before the House Financial Services today, reassuring the markets there`s a case to be made for a rate cut later this month.</p><p>In particular, Powell`s comments that uncertainties have increased pushed the S&amp;P into record highs, but we came off those highs fairly quickly. We didn`t end above 3,000.</p><p>Right now, there`s a clear consensus in the markets around a 25-basis point insurance cut for July, some are calling it. Some investors likely would be surprised now if there was no rate cut, but others would be surprised if there was a 50-basis point rate cut. So, the consensus is just 25.</p><p>Sector winners today, big tech names like Micron, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). They`re the same stocks that power us to 3,000 from 2,000. Energy was another bright spot. Crude oil prices are knocking on the door at $60 a barrel here. Crude inventory showed a much bigger drawdown than expected. That helped the big oil names Exxon, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Hess (NYSE:HES).</p><p>One group left out of today`s rally, bank stocks. J.P. Morgan, Fifth Third, all down as bond yields continue to drift lower.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The minutes of the Fed`s last meeting were also released today. They show officials growing more concerned about the economic outlook and many backed a move if the economy continued to struggle. Economists say that the minutes add to the sense that the Central Bank is prepared to lower rates when they meet at the end of the month.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Let`s turn now to Brian Nick to talk more about the Fed and the markets. He`s chief investment strategy at Nuveen.</p><p>Brian, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>BRIAN NICK, NUVEEN CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: As you heard, the guessing game has hit a new level today, the - - it is either 25 or 50-basis points according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) or Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), but everybody seems to feel rates will be 75-basis point lower than they are today. What`s your guess?</p><p>NICK: I don`t think it is going to be necessary for the fed to go three times with rate hikes this year. I think what has been priced in --</p><p>GRIFFETH: Rate cuts you mean?</p><p>NICK: Rate cuts. I`m sorry.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We`re used to that.</p><p>NICK: We`re only six months removed from rate hikes, so I`m still adjusting to new reality.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes.</p><p>NICK: So, we do think they will go at the end of this month. If Chair Powell wasn`t intending to cut rates at the end of this month, he would have had to say so today and he obviously did, and then the very high likelihood that they will go again in September and probably pause.</p><p>And the hope I think on the Fed`s part and on our part is that by the end of the year some of the risks that the Fed is concerned about will have dissipated, that global growth will be showing signs of being on the upswing and at least of these sources of policy uncertainty, whether it`s the debt ceiling, or Brexit or even a potential deal on the U.S. and China on trade, at least those risks will not have gotten worse and that they`ll feel comfortable that they`ve done enough.</p><p>HERERA: So -- but the equity markets, the rally in the equity markets have been to a certain extent built on the expectation of the rate cuts. What`s your outlook of equities if indeed we do get that cut in July?</p><p>NICK: Yes, so the stock market in the U.S. is up about 20 percent year-to- date. Our midyear outlook is to expect a tougher climb. That`s particularly true when we think of U.S. stocks which we don`t think are poised to give nearly the returns they did in the first half of the year, because once these rate cuts are sort of priced in, that`s the market basically saying, look, we need some help from the Fed, we think we`re going to get the help.</p><p>Even if the Fed follows through and cuts rates two or even three times, it`s going to be hard for the markets to rally further, especially given the fact what we`re concerned about in the next couple of quarters is a very soft period for corporate profits. At the end of the day, if corporate profits aren`t growing, there`s only so far the markets can travel upwards.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And then there`s the story, the bond market seems to be telling as we continue to see yields go lower there, in some cases to three-year lows. How do we reconcile that with what the equity market has been doing?</p><p>NICK: It`s not typical that you have a prolonged period when bonds and stocks are rallying at the same time, and that is again another reason why we`re very cautious about the second half of the year for both fixed income and for equities, because this correlation probably isn`t going to last. It is going to resolve in some way, probably with interest rates rising moderately. Again, keeping that optimism alive for the end of the year with growth looking to be a bit better by Q4, which means the interest rate should go up a bit.</p><p>But also the reality of corporate profits and where valuations are, probably limiting the degree to which stocks continue to move up. So we`re looking at flattish returns for the rest of the year in stocks, flattish for bonds as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>NICK: Unfortunately, for investors, the first half of the year was very good.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Indeed. Brian Nick with Nuveen -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>NICK: Thanks very much.</p><p>HERERA: Those comments from the Fed chair rippled through the housing sector, the idea being if the fed cuts interest rates, mortgage rates will dip, making home purchases more affordable. Lower rates would offer relief for homebuilders who have seen higher labor and land costs, giving that sector a lift today.</p><p>But there is another shift underway in the housing market and the change may be bad for buyers.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s all about supply. We have been in a pretty severe housing shortage for the past several years which meant as demand rose, prices did as well. But this year, we started to see more listings and prices easing, but that may be short lived. Supply is expected to drop again this fall and potentially hit a new low according to realtor.com.</p><p>Inventory gains began to slow this year from 6.4 percent growth in January to 5.8 percent in February. Gains continued to slow throughout the spring and supply was up just 2.8 percent annually in June. It`s now expected to flatten over the next three months and could hit its first decline in October of this year.</p><p>Of course, all real estate is local. The housing shortage is worsening in smaller, more affordable markets like Oklahoma City, Memphis, Raleigh, Richmond and Pittsburgh, according to Redfin. But in pricier markets where demand has fallen off like Seattle, San Jose, Denver, Chicago and Boston, the supply of homes for sale is increasing.</p><p>A looming shortage could help homebuilders but they still need to either lower prices or build more entry-level homes because that`s where demand is strongest and supply is leanest.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: More now on oil prices which, as you heard, settled at a seven- week high today.</p><p>Two things drove the rally. First, the government confirmed a larger than expected draw down in oil supply and second is that storm taking shape along the Gulf Coast. Forecasters warn that it could turn into a hurricane by the end of the week, and that has prompted the oil industry to shut in production and evacuate rigs ahead of time. So, domestic crude settled 4.5 percent higher today above $60 a barrel.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) was upgraded to buy from neutral and it was added to the conviction buy list at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The analysts cited the company`s strong fundamentals. The price target is $54. The stock hit a new high during the trading session to close at $43.79. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent company of CNBC which produces this program.</p><p>HCA Healthcare was upgraded to buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The analyst cites the health care services company`s bargaining power at the local level. The price target is $160. The shares rose 1 percent to $136.68.</p><p>Deere was downgraded to neutral from buy at UBS. The analyst says demand will likely weaken in the next one to two quarters as farmers hold back on purchases. The price target is $167. The shares fell 1.5 percent to $160.81.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We don`t often report from beautiful Sun Valley, Idaho, but once a year it becomes the center of the media world when Allen and Company hosts its annual conference. Over the years, the seeds of some of the biggest deals in history have been planted there. There was Jeff Bezos purchase of \"The Washington Post (NYSE:WPO)\", Verizon`s acquisition of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), and most famously, Disney`s merger with ABC back in 1995.</p><p>But this year, the focus may be less on mergers and more on content. Julia Boorstin is there for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With media moguls such as Brian Roberts, John Malone and Greg Maffei arriving here in Sun Valley, one of the big topics is how the media and tech giants are battling with content, with a number of new streaming services set to launch from Disney (NYSE:DIS), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AT&amp;T`s Warner Media and NBCUniversal.</p><p>BARRY DILLER, IAC AND EXPEDIA CHAIRMAN: No one is going to compete with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in gross subscribers. I believe they`ve won the game and I think there`s nothing that I can see that`s going to dislodge them. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in a completely different business in that it`s selling Prime which gives you all sorts of services, just among them video and television. Disney (NYSE:DIS) has the best chance because of its very, very popular content.</p><p>BOORSTIN: With so many media and tech companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) competing for premium shows and movies which Barry Diller calls an arms race, some of the companies here are looking for value elsewhere like Discovery`s David Zaslav which is building on his company`s strength with unscripted content around food, the home and science.</p><p>DAVID ZASLAV, DISCOVERY CEO: They`ve all kind of looked the same. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is doing it -- scripted series, scripted movies. Great companies can be fighting over that market share, price of content going up. It`s great to watch. I think it`s great for consumers, but it is incredibly crowded.</p><p>BOORSTIN: With CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom (NYSE:VIA) controlling shareholders, Sherri Redstone here, along with former 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch, industry veteran Michael Ovitz says it is way to soon to determine which of the tech and media giants will come out on top.</p><p>MICHAEL OVITZ, CAA FOUNDER: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has the most extraordinary install base, an amazing head start. Disney (NYSE:DIS) has put together a phenomenal group of brands, and Warner, you know, has some track record over the years, plus HBO. And you`ve got Hulu out there, too. So, I think it`s just going to be a competitive environment.</p><p>BOORSTIN: And now, everyone is watching to see how consumers will respond to Warner Media`s upcoming HBO Max launching next spring, as well as Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV Plus, launching this fall.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, wages are ticking higher after being stagnant for years. But there is some concern that higher pay will threaten profit margins.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The White House is ordering an investigation into France`s plan to tax technology companies. The probe is going to examine whether France`s digital tax plan would hurt U.S. tech firms and unfairly target them. According to reports, the investigation could potentially lead to the U.S. imposing new tariffs or other trade restrictions.</p><p>HERERA: A new Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) report says higher wages is putting pressure on corporate profit margins, and that S&amp;P 500 companies could be affected the most by higher costs from a less competitive labor market.</p><p>So, how much of a threat could that be?</p><p>Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, joins us to talk about that.</p><p>Matt, great to have you here. Welcome.</p><p>MATT MALEY, MILLER TABAK EQUITY STRATEGIST: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA: So, tell me -- you think it will have an impact on profit margins but maybe not right away?</p><p>MALEY: Yes, it is kind of interesting. It is definitely having a little bit of an impact. One of the one, of course, the concerns is that it is the boy that cried wolf. We heard for so many years that wages have to increase, wages have to increase, and they never have.</p><p>So, people have gotten to the point where they kind of dismiss it and have not built it into any of their assumptions. Now that we`re trying to -- finally starting to see a little bit of that, it is going to affect not only earnings overall but a miss of earning expectations which is tough for stocks.</p><p>But there`s also a hidden danger that you alluded to, Sue. It is just that, you know, a lot of the companies out there, you get to a certain point and they`re not going to be willing to pay above that level and they have a lot of technology already in place to replace those workers.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right. Yes, I mean it is -- it depends on the sector of the economy we`re talking about. Technology, wages are going up. There`s no question about that. Health care, wages are still going up because demand is there.</p><p>But when you get into industries like, for example, food service where margins are slim to begin with, when wages go up -- which they have been doing -- that will cut into profit margins right away, won`t they?</p><p>MALEY: And there`s no question. At some point, there is a level where they will just change. I mean a great example is what happens with McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD). I mean, they`ve had the technology in place for several years that can replace a lot of the people that work in their restaurants, whether it be making -- cooking the food, at the cash registers, et cetera.</p><p>The one thing though is that all of their studies over the years told them, hey, it is good for us both economically and for public relations to hire people in the neighborhood. We want to be a good neighbor, we want to be a good partner within the neighborhood.</p><p>But there comes a level where it gets too expensive. It used to be at $15 an hour, now it is a little higher than that. But like I said, this technology is already in place, so it is not something that will take three years to implement.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>MALEY: It will take a very short time. And that will get people suddenly with unemployment at a low level, it could start to creep up.</p><p>HERERA: And you mentioned the $15 mark, and a number of companies are phasing in that $15 mark. But at what point do you think we really start to see the impact? Is it at 15 or is it below 15?</p><p>MALEY: Well, I think 15 -- it is depending on the company and obviously the industry. It depends on the area, too. A lot of people will say $15 in New York City doesn`t get you very far, so it is kind of a roving number or a wide range.</p><p>But I think anything, when you start to creep above $15, it definitely has an impact. Of course, a lot of the service jobs are ones that people don`t have the qualifications to do other things. If the unemployment rate goes up, it has an impact on earnings of other companies as it spreads through the system.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Matt Maley with Miller Tabak -- Matt, thanks so much.</p><p>MALEY: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: American airlines raises its revenue forecast, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\" with the airline saying it has seen fuller flights and as a result, it anticipates up to 4 percent increase in its unit revenue. However, the carrier also did say its pretax profit would take about $185 million hit due to that prolonged grounding of Boeing`s 737 MAX planes. The stock today rose nearly 2 percent to $32.94.</p><p>Elsewhere, Amneal pharmaceuticals is looking to reduce its annual expenses through a newly-announced restructuring plan. The drugmaker has been dealing with supply issues for its epinephrine auto injectors, which are used to combat life-threatening allergic reactions. Shares lost more than a third of their value today falling 36 percent to $4.36.</p><p>And Chinese electric carmaker NIO today reported more deliveries than expected. The company said it delivered more than 1,300 vehicles in June. Just last week, recall that its U.S. rival Tesla exceeded its own delivery estimates. In fact, NIO was often called the Tesla of China. NIO was off a fraction today to $3.68.</p><p>HERERA: Vishay Intertechnology (NYSE:VSH) is cutting its quarterly outlook. Late today, the chipmaker said it is seeing weaker than expected demand from its distribution operations. Shares initially dropped in after-hours trading but closed the regular session up a fraction to $16.08.</p><p>And after the bell, Bed Bath and Beyond posted mixed results as it topped earnings expectations but fell short on revenue. The home goods retailer also saw a drop in same-store sales. Shares initially rose in after-hours trading. They closed the regular session up a fraction at $11.52.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Here we are in July. The start of the new school year may seem far away, but already retailers are gearing up for back-to-school sales. And this year, gadgets may take a bigger bite out of parents` budgets.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For millions of children in the U.S., school just let out for the summer, but back-to- school shopping is starting soon and expected to peak later this month and in early August. That`s when more than half of annual school-related spending happens and a new survey from Deloitte forecasts the total spent, nearly $28 billion, will be on par with last year.</p><p>It doesn`t mean the consumer isn`t healthy, but rather the back-to-school supplies are largely commodity type items. A pencil is a pencil for the most part. That ups the ante for retailers.</p><p>ROD SIDES, DELOITTE: You have to be sharper in terms of what the proposition is for the consumer. One of the questions we always ask is tell us what is important to you in terms of picking either the venue or the specific brand that you`re shopping. We hear over and over, it`s price, it`s product, it`s convenient.</p><p>REAGAN: Nearly 90 percent of shoppers say mass merchants, retailers like Walmart and Target (NYSE:TGT), are the top destination for back-to-school. Online retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are now the second shopping preference for back-to-school. Some retail experts say Amazon`s prime day shopping holiday has helped it grab more school supply share.</p><p>JAN KNIFFEN, J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WWE CEO: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is basically taking over along with Walmart and Target (NYSE:TGT) back-to-school, and electronics are an online business. Now, electronics is going to be the big growth area.</p><p>REAGAN: Deloitte says spending on electronics will surge nearly 30 percent with the growth coming from mobile devices. And the smartest shoppers, Deloitte survey says don`t procrastinate.</p><p>SIDES: Those who wait until the last minute spend more money than those who start in the middle of the peak.</p><p>REAGAN: About $370 more on average. Buyer beware.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And still ahead, the top state for business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: When Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was choosing its top state for its $5 billion HQ2 project, it came here to Virginia. But how does Virginia stack up by the numbers?</p><p>I`m Scott Cohn. We`ll have this year`s rankings coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: The District of Columbia is suing Marriott over what it calls deceptive fees. The attorney general says the hotel did not disclose the additional mandatory costs up front to its customers in rates displayed online. The lawsuit alleges that Marriott made millions of dollars by violating consumer protection laws for at least a decade. It was filed after an investigation conducted by all 50 state attorneys general. Marriott says it does not comment on pending litigation.</p><p>GRIFFETH: CNBC is out with its annual list of the top states for business. All 50 states are graded on more than 60 measures of competitiveness including infrastructure, workforce and the cost of doing business.</p><p>This year, North Carolina came in at number three thanks to a strong state balance sheet and steady economic growth. At number two, Texas with a high growth rate and low unemployment. And, as you heard, topping the list, Virginia, thanks to its workforce and strong education system.</p><p>Scott Cohn has the story behind this year`s top state for business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COHN: From the mountains to the sea, an American original and a business powerhouse.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tonight, the celebrations have begun.</p><p>GOV. RALPH NORTHAM (D), VIRGINIA: -- that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has found its next home.</p><p>COHN: Virginia was already a winner, beating out more than 200 bidders for Amazon`s HQ2 project.</p><p>BRIAN HUSEMAN, AMAZON VP PUBLIC POLICY: We were really excited by Virginia, what it had to offer. Probably the most important thing was the attraction of this place to talent, and particularly tech talent.</p><p>COHN: The numbers bear that out. Virginia has America`s top workforce, smart and tech savvy, tied for the top in education, and number three for business friendliness with a bipartisan program to cut regulations.</p><p>MATT KELLY, JBG SMITH CEO: What functions very well in this state is government officials, business officials, local citizens groups. People talk to each other a lot.</p><p>NORTHAM: When businesses, large and small, want to call Virginia home, that is a one-two punch for our economy.</p><p>COHN: But not all is perfect.</p><p>PROTESTERS: What do we want? Resignation. When do we want it? Now!</p><p>COHN: The governor`s own history helped revive questions about the state`s inclusiveness.</p><p>NORTHAM: We are really focusing on those iniquities and our cabinet members are addressing those, but I want to let this country know and certainly Virginians know that we are an inclusive state.</p><p>COHN: And then there are the costs, an expensive place to live and do business. For now, it`s a price companies are willing to pay.</p><p>It`s no coincidence that the last time Virginia was this strong competitively was in 2011. After that, defense spending started to decline and no state is more dependent on the pentagon. Now, that budget is back and so is Virginia.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Scott Cohn, Bentonville, Virginia.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And before we go, here is another look at the day`s final numbers from Wall Street.</p><p>The Dow rose 76 points to 26,860. The Nasdaq was up 60 to close at a record. And the S&amp;P 500 gained 13.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And I already saw a couple of traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with S&amp;P 3,000 hats there.</p><p>HERERA: Right. I`m sure they will have those on tomorrow.</p><p>That does it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`ll Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

Why Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had it  right when it chose Virginia for its second headquarters.</p><p>Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Wednesday, July 10th.</p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Well, the stage is set and investors cheered.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome  Powell bolstered the case for a possible interest rate cut when  policymakers meet at the end of the month.  He suggested that lowering the  benchmark rate would bolster growth and cited a number of uncertainties  here and around the globe.</p><p>That lifted optimism on Wall Street, sending the Nasdaq to new highs and  the S&amp;P 500 briefly through the 3,000 mark before it pulled back.  The Dow  Jones Industrial Average rose 76 points to 26,860.  The Nasdaq was up 60  and the S&amp;P 500 gained 13.</p><p>We have two reports tonight.  Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange,  but we begin with Steve Liesman and the Fed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Fed Chairman Jerome  Powell all but guaranteed the Federal Reserve will be cutting rates  probably as soon as this month, that`s from a semiannual testimony in the  House today.  While he said the U.S. economy is in a good place, he  emphasized trade uncertainty, global economic weakness and low inflation as  the more important factors guiding Fed policy.</p><p>REP. ANTHONY GONZALEZ (R-OH):  Would it be fair to characterize based on  what we are seeing on those two factors specifically that a strong case  could be made for lowering?</p><p>POWELL:  So, yes.  As I mentioned, we think that uncertainty around --  around trade policy and also global growth, it`s not -- it is not all down  to trade policy.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Right.</p><p>POWELL:  There`s something going on with growth around the world,  particularly around manufacturing and investment and trade.  And so, that  uncertainty is we think weighing on the domestic economy.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Powell said he was not swayed by the strong jobs report this past  Friday and, in fact, said the economic data had continued to disappoint.   That leaves the most important question.  How many rate cuts after July?</p><p>Fed funds futures are pricing in a 100 percent rate cut in July.  Markets  see a 56 percent chance of yet a third rate cut in December for 75-basis  point or three-quarters of a point of rate cut this year.</p><p>MICHELLE MEYER, BANK OF AMERICA:  A 25-basis point cut, it seems very  likely.  In fact, there`s a decent possibility they could consider a 50- basis point cut.  They want to be aggressive, they want to be early, and  they want to ensure that this rate cut (ph) can continue and they`re not  waiting to see evidence of slowing in the data.</p><p>LIESMAN:  On a separate note, Powell was asked by Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT),  chair of the House Financial Services Committee, if he thought President  Trump could fire him.</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA (NASDAQ:CA)):  Mr. Chairman, if you got a call  from the president today or today and tomorrow and he said, I`m firing you,  pack up, it is time to go, what would you do?</p><p>POWELL:  Well, of course, I would not do that.</p><p>WATERS:  I can`t hear you.</p><p>POWELL:  Well, my answer would be no.</p><p>WATERS:  And you would not pack up and you would not leave?</p><p>POWELL:  No, ma`am.</p><p>WATERS:  Because you think the president doesn`t have the authority, is  that why you would not leave?</p><p>POWELL:  I have -- I`ve kind of said what I -- what I`ve intended to say on  the subject, and what I have said is that the law clearly gives me a four- year term and I fully intend to serve it.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Stocks and bonds both liked the message from Powell on the  outlook for interest rates.  We`ll see if he continues that message in  testimony before the Senate tomorrow.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And as Sue mentioned, investors did indeed like the Fed chief`s  message, especially early in the trading day when all three major indexes  hit intraday highs.</p><p>Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks marched higher,  pushing the S&amp;P 500 beyond 3,000 early on though we did end well off the  levels.  Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell testified before the House  Financial Services today, reassuring the markets there`s a case to be made  for a rate cut later this month.</p><p>In particular, Powell`s comments that uncertainties have increased pushed  the S&amp;P into record highs, but we came off those highs fairly quickly.  We  didn`t end above 3,000.</p><p>Right now, there`s a clear consensus in the markets around a 25-basis point  insurance cut for July, some are calling it.  Some investors likely would  be surprised now if there was no rate cut, but others would be surprised if  there was a 50-basis point rate cut.  So, the consensus is just 25.</p><p>Sector winners today, big tech names like Micron, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO),  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  They`re the same stocks  that power us to 3,000 from 2,000.  Energy was another bright spot.  Crude  oil prices are knocking on the door at $60 a barrel here.  Crude inventory  showed a much bigger drawdown than expected.  That helped the big oil names  Exxon, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Hess (NYSE:HES).</p><p>One group left out of today`s rally, bank stocks.  J.P. Morgan, Fifth  Third, all down as bond yields continue to drift lower.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The minutes of the Fed`s last meeting were also released today.   They show officials growing more concerned about the economic outlook and  many backed a move if the economy continued to struggle.  Economists say  that the minutes add to the sense that the Central Bank is prepared to  lower rates when they meet at the end of the month.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Let`s turn now to Brian Nick to talk more about the Fed and the  markets.  He`s chief investment strategy at Nuveen.</p><p>Brian, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>BRIAN NICK, NUVEEN CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As you heard, the guessing game has hit a new level today, the - - it is either 25 or 50-basis points according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)  or Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), but everybody seems to feel rates will be  75-basis point lower than they are today.  What`s your guess?</p><p>NICK:  I don`t think it is going to be necessary for the fed to go three  times with rate hikes this year.  I think what has been priced in --</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Rate cuts you mean?</p><p>NICK:  Rate cuts.  I`m sorry.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We`re used to that.</p><p>NICK:  We`re only six months removed from rate hikes, so I`m still  adjusting to new reality.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.</p><p>NICK:  So, we do think they will go at the end of this month.  If Chair  Powell wasn`t intending to cut rates at the end of this month, he would  have had to say so today and he obviously did, and then the very high  likelihood that they will go again in September and probably pause.</p><p>And the hope I think on the Fed`s part and on our part is that by the end  of the year some of the risks that the Fed is concerned about will have  dissipated, that global growth will be showing signs of being on the  upswing and at least of these sources of policy uncertainty, whether it`s  the debt ceiling, or Brexit or even a potential deal on the U.S. and China  on trade, at least those risks will not have gotten worse and that they`ll  feel comfortable that they`ve done enough.</p><p>HERERA:  So -- but the equity markets, the rally in the equity markets have  been to a certain extent built on the expectation of the rate cuts.  What`s  your outlook of equities if indeed we do get that cut in July?</p><p>NICK:  Yes, so the stock market in the U.S. is up about 20 percent year-to- date.  Our midyear outlook is to expect a tougher climb.  That`s  particularly true when we think of U.S. stocks which we don`t think are  poised to give nearly the returns they did in the first half of the year,  because once these rate cuts are sort of priced in, that`s the market  basically saying, look, we need some help from the Fed, we think we`re  going to get the help.</p><p>Even if the Fed follows through and cuts rates two or even three times,  it`s going to be hard for the markets to rally further, especially given  the fact what we`re concerned about in the next couple of quarters is a  very soft period for corporate profits.  At the end of the day, if  corporate profits aren`t growing, there`s only so far the markets can  travel upwards.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And then there`s the story, the bond market seems to be telling  as we continue to see yields go lower there, in some cases to three-year  lows.  How do we reconcile that with what the equity market has been doing?</p><p>NICK:  It`s not typical that you have a prolonged period when bonds and  stocks are rallying at the same time, and that is again another reason why  we`re very cautious about the second half of the year for both fixed income  and for equities, because this correlation probably isn`t going to last.   It is going to resolve in some way, probably with interest rates rising  moderately.  Again, keeping that optimism alive for the end of the year  with growth looking to be a bit better by Q4, which means the interest rate  should go up a bit.</p><p>But also the reality of corporate profits and where valuations are,  probably limiting the degree to which stocks continue to move up.  So we`re  looking at flattish returns for the rest of the year in stocks, flattish  for bonds as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>NICK:  Unfortunately, for investors, the first half of the year was very  good.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  Brian Nick with Nuveen -- again, thanks for joining us  tonight.</p><p>NICK:  Thanks very much.</p><p>HERERA:  Those comments from the Fed chair rippled through the housing  sector, the idea being if the fed cuts interest rates, mortgage rates will  dip, making home purchases more affordable.  Lower rates would offer relief  for homebuilders who have seen higher labor and land costs, giving that  sector a lift today.</p><p>But there is another shift underway in the housing market and the change  may be bad for buyers.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It`s all about supply.   We have been in a pretty severe housing shortage for the past several years  which meant as demand rose, prices did as well.  But this year, we started  to see more listings and prices easing, but that may be short lived.   Supply is expected to drop again this fall and potentially hit a new low  according to realtor.com.</p><p>Inventory gains began to slow this year from 6.4 percent growth in January  to 5.8 percent in February.  Gains continued to slow throughout the spring  and supply was up just 2.8 percent annually in June.  It`s now expected to  flatten over the next three months and could hit its first decline in  October of this year.</p><p>Of course, all real estate is local.  The housing shortage is worsening in  smaller, more affordable markets like Oklahoma City, Memphis, Raleigh,  Richmond and Pittsburgh, according to Redfin.  But in pricier markets where  demand has fallen off like Seattle, San Jose, Denver, Chicago and Boston,  the supply of homes for sale is increasing.</p><p>A looming shortage could help homebuilders but they still need to either  lower prices or build more entry-level homes because that`s where demand is  strongest and supply is leanest.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  More now on oil prices which, as you heard, settled at a seven- week high today.</p><p>Two things drove the rally.  First, the government confirmed a larger than  expected draw down in oil supply and second is that storm taking shape  along the Gulf Coast.  Forecasters warn that it could turn into a hurricane  by the end of the week, and that has prompted the oil industry to shut in  production and evacuate rigs ahead of time.  So, domestic crude settled 4.5  percent higher today above $60 a barrel.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and  Downgrades\".</p><p>Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) was upgraded to buy from neutral and it  was added to the conviction buy list at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).  The  analysts cited the company`s strong fundamentals.  The price target is $54.   The stock hit a new high during the trading session to close at $43.79.   Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent company of CNBC which  produces this program.</p><p>HCA Healthcare was upgraded to buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).   The analyst cites the health care services company`s bargaining power at  the local level.  The price target is $160.  The shares rose 1 percent to  $136.68.</p><p>Deere was downgraded to neutral from buy at UBS.  The analyst says demand  will likely weaken in the next one to two quarters as farmers hold back on  purchases.  The price target is $167.  The shares fell 1.5 percent to  $160.81.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We don`t often report from beautiful Sun Valley, Idaho, but once  a year it becomes the center of the media world when Allen and Company  hosts its annual conference.  Over the years, the seeds of some of the  biggest deals in history have been planted there.  There was Jeff Bezos  purchase of \"The Washington Post (NYSE:WPO)\", Verizon`s acquisition of  Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), and most famously, Disney`s merger with ABC back in  1995.</p><p>But this year, the focus may be less on mergers and more on content.  Julia  Boorstin is there for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With media moguls  such as Brian Roberts, John Malone and Greg Maffei arriving here in Sun  Valley, one of the big topics is how the media and tech giants are battling  with content, with a number of new streaming services set to launch from  Disney (NYSE:DIS), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AT&amp;T`s Warner Media and  NBCUniversal.</p><p>BARRY DILLER, IAC AND EXPEDIA CHAIRMAN:  No one is going to compete with  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in gross subscribers.  I believe they`ve won the game  and I think there`s nothing that I can see that`s going to dislodge them.   Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in a completely different business in that it`s  selling Prime which gives you all sorts of services, just among them video  and television.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) has the best chance because of its very,  very popular content.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  With so many media and tech companies such as Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) competing for premium shows and  movies which Barry Diller calls an arms race, some of the companies here  are looking for value elsewhere like Discovery`s David Zaslav which is  building on his company`s strength with unscripted content around food, the  home and science.</p><p>DAVID ZASLAV, DISCOVERY CEO:  They`ve all kind of looked the same.  Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) is doing it -- scripted series, scripted movies.  Great  companies can be fighting over that market share, price of content going  up.  It`s great to watch.  I think it`s great for consumers, but it is  incredibly crowded.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  With CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom (NYSE:VIA) controlling  shareholders, Sherri Redstone here, along with former 21st Century Fox CEO  James Murdoch, industry veteran Michael Ovitz says it is way to soon to  determine which of the tech and media giants will come out on top.</p><p>MICHAEL OVITZ, CAA FOUNDER:  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has the most  extraordinary install base, an amazing head start.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) has  put together a phenomenal group of brands, and Warner, you know, has some  track record over the years, plus HBO.  And you`ve got Hulu out there, too.   So, I think it`s just going to be a competitive environment.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  And now, everyone is watching to see how consumers will respond  to Warner Media`s upcoming HBO Max launching next spring, as well as Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Plus and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV Plus, launching this fall.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, wages are ticking higher after being stagnant for  years.  But there is some concern that higher pay will threaten profit  margins.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The White House is ordering an investigation into France`s plan  to tax technology companies.  The probe is going to examine whether  France`s digital tax plan would hurt U.S. tech firms and unfairly target  them.  According to reports, the investigation could potentially lead to  the U.S. imposing new tariffs or other trade restrictions.</p><p>HERERA:  A new Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) report says higher wages is putting  pressure on corporate profit margins, and that S&amp;P 500 companies could be  affected the most by higher costs from a less competitive labor market.</p><p>So, how much of a threat could that be?</p><p>Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, joins us to talk about that.</p><p>Matt, great to have you here.  Welcome.</p><p>MATT MALEY, MILLER TABAK EQUITY STRATEGIST:  Thank you.  Thanks for having  me.</p><p>HERERA:  So, tell me -- you think it will have an impact on profit margins  but maybe not right away?</p><p>MALEY:  Yes, it is kind of interesting.  It is definitely having a little  bit of an impact.  One of the one, of course, the concerns is that it is  the boy that cried wolf.  We heard for so many years that wages have to  increase, wages have to increase, and they never have.</p><p>So, people have gotten to the point where they kind of dismiss it and have  not built it into any of their assumptions.  Now that we`re trying to --  finally starting to see a little bit of that, it is going to affect not  only earnings overall but a miss of earning expectations which is tough for  stocks.</p><p>But there`s also a hidden danger that you alluded to, Sue.  It is just  that, you know, a lot of the companies out there, you get to a certain  point and they`re not going to be willing to pay above that level and they  have a lot of technology already in place to replace those workers.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.  Yes, I mean it is -- it depends on the sector of the  economy we`re talking about.  Technology, wages are going up.  There`s no  question about that.  Health care, wages are still going up because demand  is there.</p><p>But when you get into industries like, for example, food service where  margins are slim to begin with, when wages go up -- which they have been  doing -- that will cut into profit margins right away, won`t they?</p><p>MALEY:  And there`s no question.  At some point, there is a level where  they will just change.  I mean a great example is what happens with  McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD).  I mean, they`ve had the technology in place for  several years that can replace a lot of the people that work in their  restaurants, whether it be making -- cooking the food, at the cash  registers, et cetera.</p><p>The one thing though is that all of their studies over the years told them,  hey, it is good for us both economically and for public relations to hire  people in the neighborhood.  We want to be a good neighbor, we want to be a  good partner within the neighborhood.</p><p>But there comes a level where it gets too expensive.  It used to be at $15  an hour, now it is a little higher than that.  But like I said, this  technology is already in place, so it is not something that will take three  years to implement.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>MALEY:  It will take a very short time.  And that will get people suddenly  with unemployment at a low level, it could start to creep up.</p><p>HERERA:  And you mentioned the $15 mark, and a number of companies are  phasing in that $15 mark.  But at what point do you think we really start  to see the impact?  Is it at 15 or is it below 15?</p><p>MALEY:  Well, I think 15 -- it is depending on the company and obviously  the industry.  It depends on the area, too.  A lot of people will say $15  in New York City doesn`t get you very far, so it is kind of a roving number  or a wide range.</p><p>But I think anything, when you start to creep above $15, it definitely has  an impact.  Of course, a lot of the service jobs are ones that people don`t  have the qualifications to do other things.  If the unemployment rate goes  up, it has an impact on earnings of other companies as it spreads through  the system.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Matt Maley with Miller Tabak -- Matt, thanks so  much.</p><p>MALEY:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  American airlines raises its revenue forecast, and that`s where  we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\" with the airline saying it has seen  fuller flights and as a result, it anticipates up to 4 percent increase in  its unit revenue.  However, the carrier also did say its pretax profit  would take about $185 million hit due to that prolonged grounding of  Boeing`s 737 MAX planes.  The stock today rose nearly 2 percent to $32.94.</p><p>Elsewhere, Amneal pharmaceuticals is looking to reduce its annual expenses  through a newly-announced restructuring plan.  The drugmaker has been  dealing with supply issues for its epinephrine auto injectors, which are  used to combat life-threatening allergic reactions.  Shares lost more than  a third of their value today falling 36 percent to $4.36.</p><p>And Chinese electric carmaker NIO today reported more deliveries than  expected.  The company said it delivered more than 1,300 vehicles in June.   Just last week, recall that its U.S. rival Tesla exceeded its own delivery  estimates.  In fact, NIO was often called the Tesla of China.  NIO was off  a fraction today to $3.68.</p><p>HERERA:  Vishay Intertechnology (NYSE:VSH) is cutting its quarterly  outlook.  Late today, the chipmaker said it is seeing weaker than expected  demand from its distribution operations.  Shares initially dropped in  after-hours trading but closed the regular session up a fraction to $16.08.</p><p>And after the bell, Bed Bath and Beyond posted mixed results as it topped  earnings expectations but fell short on revenue.  The home goods retailer  also saw a drop in same-store sales.  Shares initially rose in after-hours  trading.  They closed the regular session up a fraction at $11.52.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Here we are in July.  The start of the new school year may seem  far away, but already retailers are gearing up for back-to-school sales.   And this year, gadgets may take a bigger bite out of parents` budgets.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For millions of  children in the U.S., school just let out for the summer, but back-to- school shopping is starting soon and expected to peak later this month and  in early August.  That`s when more than half of annual school-related  spending happens and a new survey from Deloitte forecasts the total spent,  nearly $28 billion, will be on par with last year.</p><p>It doesn`t mean the consumer isn`t healthy, but rather the back-to-school  supplies are largely commodity type items.  A pencil is a pencil for the  most part.  That ups the ante for retailers.</p><p>ROD SIDES, DELOITTE:  You have to be sharper in terms of what the  proposition is for the consumer.  One of the questions we always ask is  tell us what is important to you in terms of picking either the venue or  the specific brand that you`re shopping.  We hear over and over, it`s  price, it`s product, it`s convenient.</p><p>REAGAN:  Nearly 90 percent of shoppers say mass merchants, retailers like  Walmart and Target (NYSE:TGT), are the top destination for back-to-school.   Online retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are now the second shopping  preference for back-to-school.  Some retail experts say Amazon`s prime day  shopping holiday has helped it grab more school supply share.</p><p>JAN KNIFFEN, J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WWE CEO:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is basically  taking over along with Walmart and Target (NYSE:TGT) back-to-school, and  electronics are an online business.  Now, electronics is going to be the  big growth area.</p><p>REAGAN:  Deloitte says spending on electronics will surge nearly 30 percent  with the growth coming from mobile devices.  And the smartest shoppers,  Deloitte survey says don`t procrastinate.</p><p>SIDES:  Those who wait until the last minute spend more money than those  who start in the middle of the peak.</p><p>REAGAN:  About $370 more on average.  Buyer beware.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, the top state for business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  When Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) was choosing its top state for its $5 billion HQ2 project, it  came here to Virginia.

We`ll have this year`s rankings coming up on NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The District of Columbia is suing Marriott over what it calls  deceptive fees.  The attorney general says the hotel did not disclose the  additional mandatory costs up front to its customers in rates displayed  online.  The lawsuit alleges that Marriott made millions of dollars by  violating consumer protection laws for at least a decade.  It was filed  after an investigation conducted by all 50 state attorneys general.   Marriott says it does not comment on pending litigation.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  CNBC is out with its annual list of the top states for business.   All 50 states are graded on more than 60 measures of competitiveness  including infrastructure, workforce and the cost of doing business.</p><p>This year, North Carolina came in at number three thanks to a strong state  balance sheet and steady economic growth.  At number two, Texas with a high  growth rate and low unemployment.  And, as you heard, topping the list,  Virginia, thanks to its workforce and strong education system.</p><p>Scott Cohn has the story behind this year`s top state for business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COHN:  From the mountains to the sea, an American original and a business  powerhouse.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tonight, the celebrations have begun.</p><p>GOV. RALPH NORTHAM (D), VIRGINIA:  -- that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has found  its next home.</p><p>COHN:  Virginia was already a winner, beating out more than 200 bidders for  Amazon`s HQ2 project.</p><p>BRIAN HUSEMAN, AMAZON VP PUBLIC POLICY:  We were really excited by  Virginia, what it had to offer.  Probably the most important thing was the  attraction of this place to talent, and particularly tech talent.</p><p>COHN:  The numbers bear that out.  Virginia has America`s top workforce,  smart and tech savvy, tied for the top in education, and number three for  business friendliness with a bipartisan program to cut regulations.</p><p>MATT KELLY, JBG SMITH CEO:  What functions very well in this state is  government officials, business officials, local citizens groups.  People  talk to each other a lot.</p><p>NORTHAM:  When businesses, large and small, want to call Virginia home,  that is a one-two punch for our economy.</p><p>COHN:  But not all is perfect.</p><p>PROTESTERS:  What do we want?  Resignation.  When do we want it?  Now!</p><p>COHN:  The governor`s own history helped revive questions about the state`s  inclusiveness.</p><p>NORTHAM:  We are really focusing on those iniquities and our cabinet  members are addressing those, but I want to let this country know and  certainly Virginians know that we are an inclusive state.</p><p>COHN:  And then there are the costs, an expensive place to live and do  business.  For now, it`s a price companies are willing to pay.</p><p>It`s no coincidence that the last time Virginia was this strong  competitively was in 2011.  After that, defense spending started to decline  and no state is more dependent on the pentagon.

The market hits a  new milestone on optimism over an interest rate cut, making it even  trickier to invest at these lofty levels.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  New prognosis.  The White  House kills its prescription drug rebate rule, sending insurance stocks  higher.  But will big pharma be the next target?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  The real world.  Inflation is more than just numbers.  It could  mean paying more for your coffee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  July 11th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>Well, the Dow and the S&amp;P both closed at record highs today.  In fact, the  blue chip average, as you heard, rallied past 27,000 for the first time  ever.  Investors cheered a second day of Capitol Hill testimony from Fed  Chair Jerome Powell where he signaled a potential cut in interest rates  later this month.  Health care stocks also contributed to the rise.  We  will explain why in a moment.</p><p>But first, the closing numbers for this Thursday with the industrial  average gaining 227 points to 27,088.  The Nasdaq was down six, the S&amp;P  added six.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more on the record-setting day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Another day, another  market milestone.  Investors cheered comments from the Federal Reserve  signaling that a rate cut is likely just around the corner.</p><p>The Dow crossed about 27,000 for the first time today and the S&amp;P 500 moved  just to the edge of 3,000, a fraction of a point below it.  Close enough.   What a difference five years makes.  The S&amp;P has moved 50 percent in less  than five years from 2000 in August of 2014, to 3,000 essentially this  week.</p><p>But the market today is different than it was in 2014.  Investors have  played favorites in a very big way, big tech and FANG names dominate among  the winners, including Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple.  Amazon  and Netflix are up almost 500 points each since the S&amp;P crossed 2,000 five  years ago.  Chip stocks have also skyrocketed, Nvidia and AMD both up more  than 700 percent in the last five years.  We have seen big games from  Broadcom and Xilinx as well.</p><p>The bigger companies get bigger and bigger, particularly tech-related  companies.  Visa and MasterCard, those are fin tech companies.  Cisco is  another example.  There are a few non-tech outliers like United Health and  Home Depot that have been big performers but not many of them.</p><p>And then there are the outright losers.  Energy stock down big, which is no  surprise.  Oil was $100 five years ago and it`s $60 today.  The other big  losing sector is retailers which includes stock`s like Macy`s and Gap down  big.</p><p>So, what does it mean that a handful of tech titans have come to dominate  the market?  It is about growth.  Technology is where the growth is, and  growth is hard to find globally so investors are willing to pay up almost  anything for growth wherever they can find it.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So with the market at new highs, what should you do right now?</p><p>Joining us to talk about that is Patrick Chovanec.  He is the chief  strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management.</p><p>Welcome, Patrick.  Nice to see you again.</p><p>PATRICK CHOVANEC, CHIEF STRATEGIST, SILVERCREST ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Hello.</p><p>HERERA:  Is it decidedly more difficult to navigate the market at new  highs?</p><p>CHOVANEC:  Well, right now, the economy is a lot more wobbly than the  market seems to be.  You know, that`s why the Fed is talking about cutting  rates, which is something that the market is excited about, but the economy  is slowing and it could slow further.</p><p>Now, you know, it could pull through.  So I wouldn`t go so far as to say  that the market`s riding for a fall, but there could be bumpier days ahead.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes, I mean, that`s the big conundrum we`re facing right now.   Jerome Powell just told us that the global economy is slowing down and it  is taking our economy with it.  Earnings will be coming out starting next  week, and certainly expectations are not very high for those, yet here we  sit at all-time highs today.</p><p>Is this simply a stock market that`s on a sugar high because of the lower  rates?</p><p>CHOVANEC:  No, because, ironically, this is not a market that is gorging on  risk.  When you look at what`s really expensive in the market today, it is  actually your safe harbors.  Treasuries are -- you know, are returning 2  percent, which is barely above inflation.</p><p>So the problem is that while, you know, if you look and you don`t like the  risk that you see out there, if you want to take money off the table, where  do you put it?  It is actually more expensive to try to hide from risk than  it is to actually ride it out right now.</p><p>HERERA:  So if you are a longer term investor, do you just kind of stay put  in this market but expect some volatility?</p><p>CHOVANEC:  I think that`s really the best choice that you have.  I do think  that you need to realistically assess how much risk you can afford.  You  know, if the market were down 30 percent in a year because there was a  recession, how would you cope?</p><p>You should always be thinking about that, but you should also be thinking  about what you are giving up by simply going and hiding under a rock for a  year or two.  I think you are giving up quite a bit, both in terms of short  term and long-term gains if you go and do that.</p><p>HERERA:  Patrick, thank you so much.</p><p>CHOVANEC:  You`re welcome.</p><p>HERERA:  Patrick Chovanec with Silvercrest Asset Management.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We mentioned that rally in health care stocks that helped lift  the Dow above 27,000.  Here`s why: The Trump administration today withdrew  the proposal that would have eliminated rebates from government drug plans.   That boosted the shares of insurers like UnitedHealthcare, Cigna and CVS.   But it also raised the possibility of new restrictions on drugmakers, which  pressured that group today.</p><p>Meg Tirrell has details for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Trump  administration claimed its rule on drug rebates had the potential to be the  most sweeping change to how Americans` drugs are priced at the pharmacy  counter ever.  Today, they abandoned the plan.</p><p>Here is what it was aiming to do.  For Medicare insurance plans,  beneficiaries pay both a monthly premium and when they get a prescription,  they pay an out-of-pocket cost at the pharmacy counter.  So, how is it  determined how much they pay for the medicines?  Well, the drug company  sets a list price and pharmacy benefits managers then negotiate a rebate on  that drug.</p><p>But insurance co-pays for drugs are often based on the list price, not the  price after the rebate.  Right now, the PBMs and insurance companies take  that rebate and spread it across their plan beneficiaries to lower premiums  for everyone.</p><p>What the Trump administration rule sought to do is instead apply the  rebates directly to the price of drugs at the pharmacy counter, so the  patient being prescribed the drug could pay a lower price at the pharmacy.   But because the rebates wouldn`t be spread across the beneficiaries,  premiums for everyone could go up.</p><p>And that according to Capital Street`s Ipsita Smolinski presented a  political problem.</p><p>IPSITA SMOLINSKI, CAPITAL STREET MANAGING DIRECTOR:  The concern was  premiums going up for Medicare beneficiaries -- these are those over 65 and  who vote -- would probably not like to see their premiums go up for 2020 or  2021.</p><p>TIRRELL:  While the Trump administration rule would have applied to  Medicare, there was concern it could lead to changes in rebates provided by  employers as well, Smolinski says.  And those commercial plans, rebates  contribute hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to pharmacy benefits  managers, according to Leerink.  That`s why those stocks soared today.</p><p>But drug company stocks sank.  That`s because Trump is not expected to give  up on the issue of drug prices and may, in fact, double down on effort that  could pharma`s bottom line.  Investors are trying to parse comments the  president made last week about a most-favored nation clause.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For years and years, other  nations paid less for drugs than we do, sometimes by 60 percent, 70  percent.  We`re going to be and we`re working on it right now, we are  working on a favored nation clause where we pay whatever the lowest  nation`s price is.  Why should other nations -- like Canada -- but why  should other nations pay much less than us?</p><p>TIRRELL:  A source close to the administration tells me that`s how the  White House refers to a rule it has already proposed, tying the prices of  some Medicare drugs to an international average.  Trump said yesterday  another announcement on drug prices is expected this week.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The Fed chair was back on Capitol Hill where he sent strong  signals that the central bank is ready and able to cut interest rates this  month.</p><p>Steve Liesman has more from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Fed Chairman Jay  Powell`s visit to Capitol Hill on day two was a lot like day one where he  affirmed the market`s view that rate cuts are likely coming at the end of  July.  But he also provided maybe a little context for how much the Fed  might cut July or even beyond.</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN:  We don`t want to get behind the  curve and let inflation drop well below 2 percent, because what happens is  you get into this unhealthy dynamic potentially where lower expected  inflation gets baked into interest rates, which means lower interest rates,  which means less room for the central bank to react.  And that becomes a  self-reinforcing thing.</p><p>We have seen it in Japan.  We are now seeing it in Europe.  And that`s why  we think it is so important we defend our 2 percent inflation goal here in  the United States.</p><p>LIESMAN:  A Federal Reserve that`s concerned about being behind the curve  like Europe and Japan might be one that cuts more deeply than it otherwise  might, trying to use what bullets it has to reduce rates more effectively.</p><p>Stocks liked what Powell said today, in part because it removed any  potential risk he might reverse himself from day one.  Also, Powell tended  to ignore stronger economic data, both the inflation and stronger jobless  claims numbers which fell by 13,000.</p><p>That means the economic data may not matter all that much if the concerns  are trade uncertainties, global economic weakness and inflation running  persistently below the Fed`s 2 percent market, then the data may not deter  the Federal reserve from what looks like an inevitable rate cut at the end  of this month.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And Steve just mentioned today`s inflation data where consumer  prices posted their biggest gain in nearly one and a half years in June.   According to the Labor Department, the so-called core consumer price index,  which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.3 percent.  That was more than  expected and it followed four straight monthly gains.</p><p>Now, food and energy are often excluded because those prices are considered  volatile on a month-to-month basis but it`s also the stuff we pay for every  day, including things like coffee.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It`s increasing like everything is increasing because  salaries are increasing but it goes with the -- it is like gas.  You need  it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  As a college student, I think it is a little bit  like, yikes, when you realize shall oh, it`s like 5 bucks for like this  much coffee.  So, it`s a little like, you have to cut back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, price went up significantly.  I remember when  coffee was 50 cents a cup.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A medium at Dunkin` Donuts is $2.85.  If that goes to  like $4 and something, I don`t think I would do it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I haven`t paid attention to the pricing.  It is kind of  a necessary evil.  I love coffee and whatever goes up, I`m just going to  deal with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So some people are seeing inflated prices at their local coffee  shops, but the government data and the Fed say that inflation remains tame.   So who has it right?</p><p>Bob Brusca is with us tonight.  He`s chief economist at Fact and Opinion  Economics.</p><p>Bob, first of all, welcome.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>BOB BRUSCA, FACT &amp; OPINION ECONOMICS CHIEF:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You know, there`s that old saying people will always complain  about the price of bread and gasoline and in this case coffee, but is there  an especially glaring disconnect these days between what we are paying on  an everyday basis and this tame inflation data reports that we get from the  government and Fed?</p><p>BRUSCA:  I don`t think so.  I think the problem is that the people tend to  focus on prices when they go up, and I think the other problem is that it  is a low inflation environment.  People`s incomes don`t go up very much.   When your income isn`t going up very much and prices start going up, you  really begin to notice it and it hurts.</p><p>HERERA:  So, Bob, what impact do you think it will have?  I mean, we heard  some people say that if prices went up too much, that they would stop  buying.  Other people said they need their coffee, they`re going to keep  buying.</p><p>So if, indeed, it is more noticeable because wages are not going up as fast  as they used to, what impact might that have?</p><p>BRUSCA:  Well, people can buy beans, grind them at home and make coffee and  carry it to work.  It will be a lot cheaper.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A very practical advice there from Bob Brusca.  At this point  why is inflation statistically speaking from the Federal Reserve and the  government, as tame as it is right now?  You know, Jerome Powell made a  rather profound statement today when he said that low unemployment no  longer leads to high inflation, which is what we were taught in economics  schools.  Why is that the case now?</p><p>BRUSCA:  Yes, this -- this unemployment inflation trade I`ve noticed in  Phillips Curve is pretty flat.  Usually the Phillips Curve is dead.  You  have low inflation in Japan, you have low inflation in Europe, and we have  low prices being generated every day out of China and we have a lot of  technology and we all carry around cellphones that help us to check prices.</p><p>All of this tends to keep prices very low.  There`s a lot of competition.   There`s low prices elsewhere in the world, low inflation elsewhere in the  world, and incomes aren`t going up.  So, people check their phones a lot to  double check prices when they spend money and that keeps prices in line.</p><p>HERERA:  So, after Mr. Powell`s testimony today, do you think they cut by  25 or 50?</p><p>BRUSCA:  I would be surprised if they did 50, Sue.  I think you`re going to  get 25 and I think they`re going to try to keep the other 25 in their  pocket.  I don`t see the case for 50.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Bob Brusca with Fact and Opinion Economics -- good to see you,  Robert.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>BRUSCA:  Good to see you too.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Thanks.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to look at today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Goldman Sachs launched coverage of the retail sector which included a buy  rating on Walmart.  The analyst cites the retailer`s aggressive strategy  that could drive strong sales growth.  The price target is $123.  The stock  rose a fraction to 113.92.</p><p>Weightwatchers was upgraded to neutral from underweight at J.P. Morgan.   The firm cites stabilizing subscriber growth trends.  The price target is  $22.  The stock gained 8 percent to $23.67.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Discount retailer Dillard`s was upgraded to neutral from  underperforming at Wedbush Securities.  The analyst cited stabilizing  promotions at the company.  Price target, $62.  The stock rose 4 percent to  $62.85.</p><p>Allstate was downgraded to underperform from neutral at Credit Suisse with  the analyst saying that the insurer`s margins are under pressure due to  weather and competition.  Price target, $94.  That stock fell 1 percent  today to $103.15.</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, tech titans may face a future with new rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I`m Julia Boorstin  in Sun Valley, Idaho, where a range of tech CEOs are at the Allen &amp; Co  Conference, and regulation of those tech giants is in focus.  That`s coming  up on the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We got a report today that said the federal budget deficit  widened by more than 20 percent in the first nine months of the fiscal  year.  Federal spending outpaced government tax receipts, due in part to  higher spending on military and interest on the debt, coupled with the tax  cuts for corporations.</p><p>HERERA:  The International Monetary Fund is forecasting more economic pain  for the Eurozone.  The organization says the region faces anemic growth  stemming from trade tensions, Brexit and Italy`s high debt levels.  The IMF  also backed the European Central Bank`s plans for fresh stimulus.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We told you last night that the White House was planning to  launch an investigation into attacks on technology companies imposed by the  French government and, in fact, earlier today, French lawmakers did approve  the so-called digital tax, setting up a fight with Washington.</p><p>Kayla Tausche has our details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The White House is  fighting back as France moved closer to a new tax on tech companies.  The  U.S. trade representative launching a representation that could result in  new tariffs on France for the fees it says unfairly target U.S. companies  for being global leaders.</p><p>The proposal is named for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple and would see  about 30 digital services companies pay an extra 3 percent on their revenue  in France.  It is retroactive to cover this year.</p><p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire defended the move and challenged the  U.S. treasury secretary, G7 and OECD countries to reach an agreement.</p><p>BRUNO LE MAIRE, FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER:  The sooner there will be  international solution at the OECD level, France will withdraw its national  taxation.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  Experts say this fight is just beginning.</p><p>LILIAN FAULHABER, GEORGETOWN LAW PROFESSOR:  The bigger question is what  will happen in the next several months, how other countries outside of the  U.S. will react to this, whether or not it will inspire them to implement  their own digital taxes or whether or not it will be a warning not to  implement these types of taxes until more international measures have moved  forward.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  The White House is counterpunch has been praised in Washington,  from leading Republican lawmakers and business groups traditionally  critical of tariffs, to both hawks and doves advising the president.  The  irony, even as they hit back against new fees on tech overseas, regulators  are ramping up their own scrutiny here at home.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Delta is seeing some tailwinds.  And that`s where we begin  tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The airline raised its 2019 profit outlook, thanks to strong demand.  The  carrier posted record revenue and raised its dividend and unlike its  competitors, Delta does not operate the Boeing 737 MAX.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED BASTIAN, DELTA CEO:  We do not fly the MAX, and clearly, there was a  benefit for the airline in the quarter.  I don`t think there was a  significant benefit.  Certainly, it is not explaining the results we are  seeing.</p><p>You know, I don`t know when the plane is going to come back.  As we`ve  seen, it has taken longer than any of us expected to see it return to  service.  It is not going to be in place for the third quarter, maybe  sometime into the fourth quarter.  We don`t have a crystal ball on that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The stock rose more than 1 percent to $60.16.</p><p>T-Mobile and Sprint are reportedly expected to extend their July 29th  deadline for their $26 billion merger.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports  both wireless carriers discuss ownership issues related to Dish Network.   This would be the second deadline extension.  T-Mobile shares dropped a  fraction to $78.26.  Sprint shares fell near 3.5 percent to $6.91.</p><p>And shares of Fastenal missed both earnings and revenue estimates.  The  wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies says the  trade war with China impacted its numbers, specifically higher tariffs on  imported goods that were produced in China.  The stock fell nearly 3  percent to $30.36.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Shares of Grubhub fell today on fears of new regulations.  \"The  New York Post\" says that New York state is reportedly looking to limit the  fees that food delivery companies can charge and require them to be listed  on liquor licenses when they deliver for restaurants that do serve alcohol.   Grubhub shares fell nearly 4 percent as a result today to $74 even.</p><p>Ford and Volkswagen reportedly planned to announce a new joint venture on  electric and autonomous vehicles.  That deal would allow both companies to  share intellectual property and hardware.  A formal announcement is  expected tomorrow.  Volkswagen does not trade here in the U.S., but Ford  shares were up a fraction to $10.19.</p><p>And Boeing announced its 737 program manager Eric Lindblad is retiring  after serving in that post for less than a year.  He was, however, a 35- year veteran at the company.  Mark Jenks will now be taking over the reins  of that troubled program which has suffered from the grounding of the 737  MAX aircraft.  The stock was up 3 percent to $359 even.</p><p>And after the bell, genetics company Illumina warned that its fiscal second  quarter revenue is going to be weaker than expected.  The company cited  weakness in its direct-to-consumer market among other things.  Shares  initially dropped in afterhours tonight.  They closed the regular session  today down more than 2 percent at $363.66.</p><p>HERERA:  A bit earlier in our program, we mentioned Washington`s increased  scrutiny of the tech sector.  The potential wave of regulation was top of  mind in Sun Valley, Idaho, where tech titans are meeting.</p><p>Julia Boorstin spoke to them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOORSTIN:  With Apple`s Tim Cook, Facebook`s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter  CFO Ned Segal walking the paths here in Sun Valley, along with former Yahoo  CEO Jerry Yang, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, big tech is out in force,  and so is talk of regulating the giants, ahead of antitrust hearings on  Capitol Hill next week.</p><p>Sam Altman, who founded Y-Combinator, which funds and advises early stage  startups, says he thinks there`s no question that tech regulation is  needed, but that breaking up the likes of Facebook or Google would be much  harder.</p><p>SAM ALTMAN, Y-COMBINATOR FOUNDER:  The companies are so big and so powerful  and so intertwined but I think when I talk to most of them, they sort of  actively want regulation.  We`re in uncharted territory.  I think either we  figure out how to regulate more quickly and effectively than we have in the  past, or we end up in a world where at some point we have to do it in a  clumsy way.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo says antitrust and privacy  issues shouldn`t be conflated.</p><p>DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO:  It is not just the fact that companies  are big that should cause them to be regulated.  The size of the company  doesn`t have really any impact on the kinds of things it might be doing.   It`s those specific things that companies are doing with data, the way  they`re managing it or mismanaging it.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  The question is what laws would best protect consumers without  giving an unfair advantage to the giants that can better afford regulation?   And Verizon CEO Hans Vesterberg notes how hard it is for regulation to keep  up with innovation.</p><p>HANS VESTERBERG, VERIZON CEO:  I think the technology is moving so fast, so  if you do regulation, it`s just moving so fast it is hard.  So I think it  is up to responsible leaders.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  While Mark Zuckerberg, who`s tried to dodge the cameras here,  says he does not want to regulate Facebook himself, we will see how much  the tech companies here enforce changes around the likes of privacy to  avoid drastic government action.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, the smallest state in the country is facing some  big economic challenges.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Here is what we`re watching tomorrow.  The producer price index  will be providing investors with additional information on inflation  pressures within the economy.  We will see if the trade war with China is  having an impact on its economy when Beijing releases import and export  numbers for the month of June.  And the president of the Chicago Fed speaks  on economic conditions and monetary policy.</p><p>That`s what we`re watching for Friday.</p><p>HERERA:  Wall Street banks are lending less money to farmers.  According to  \"Reuters, which cites FDIC data, agricultural loans at the nation`s top 30  banks fell about 17 percent between the peak in 2015 and March of this  year.  Banks have increased their exposure to the rural Midwest following  the financial crisis in part because farmers had plenty of income and  collateral, but the retreat in lending comes as farmer`s incomes decline.</p><p>We told you yesterday that Virginia was ranked the top state for business  in CNBC`s annual survey due to the quality of its workforce and educational  system.  But there are 50 states.  That means somebody had to come in last.</p><p>So, tonight, Scott Cohn takes us to the survey`s worst state for business,  Rhode Island.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For a little state,  Rhode Island has big problems, but to hear the governor tell it the worst  is over.</p><p>GOV. GINA RAIMONDO (D), RHODE ISLAND:  We have stopped the decline.  We  have stopped the decline, and working together, we have ignited a comeback  of this great state and our economy.</p><p>COHN:  The comeback has yet to show up in the numbers, near the bottom for  business friendliness, cost of doing business, economy, and still at the  bottom for infrastructure.  Fixing that has been a priority for Governor  Gina Raimondo.</p><p>RAIMONDO:  There`s more road work going on in this state than at any time  in our lifetime.</p><p>COHN:  Funded by a controversial program to charge tolls on trucks, not  surprisingly unpopular with truckers like Michael Collins.</p><p>MICHAEL COLLINS, M&amp;D TRANSPORTATION:  We need to kill this cancer in this  state because it is going to spread like wildfire to other states.</p><p>RAIMONDO:  Thank you.</p><p>COHN:  The governor rode her plan to reelection last year, but it still  faces some skepticism.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Got to do something, as long as the money actually  does go to the roads.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The issue isn`t going to tap into consumers, you know.   Somebody has to pay for it.</p><p>COHN:  The administration says in its first three years there`s been $1.5  billion worth of new road construction, 100 miles of roads paved, and  nearly 200 bridges repaired.  Unemployment is now in line with the national  average, and 30 businesses have moved to the state.  But school test scores  are low and economic growth is among the lowest in the country, more proof  that a comeback, no matter how hard you try, doesn`t happen overnight.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Scott Cohn.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here is a look at the day`s final numbers on Wall  Street.  The Dow gained 227 points to close above 27,000.  The Nasdaq was  down six and the S&amp;P 500 added six to finish at a record.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for  joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Have great evening.

The market hits a new milestone on optimism over an interest rate cut, making it even trickier to invest at these lofty levels.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: New prognosis. The White House kills its prescription drug rebate rule, sending insurance stocks higher. But will big pharma be the next target?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: The real world. Inflation is more than just numbers. It could mean paying more for your coffee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, July 11th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>Well, the Dow and the S&amp;P both closed at record highs today. In fact, the blue chip average, as you heard, rallied past 27,000 for the first time ever. Investors cheered a second day of Capitol Hill testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell where he signaled a potential cut in interest rates later this month. Health care stocks also contributed to the rise. We will explain why in a moment.</p><p>But first, the closing numbers for this Thursday with the industrial average gaining 227 points to 27,088. The Nasdaq was down six, the S&amp;P added six.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more on the record-setting day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Another day, another market milestone. Investors cheered comments from the Federal Reserve signaling that a rate cut is likely just around the corner.</p><p>The Dow crossed about 27,000 for the first time today and the S&amp;P 500 moved just to the edge of 3,000, a fraction of a point below it. Close enough. What a difference five years makes. The S&amp;P has moved 50 percent in less than five years from 2000 in August of 2014, to 3,000 essentially this week.</p><p>But the market today is different than it was in 2014. Investors have played favorites in a very big way, big tech and FANG names dominate among the winners, including Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple. Amazon and Netflix are up almost 500 points each since the S&amp;P crossed 2,000 five years ago. Chip stocks have also skyrocketed, Nvidia and AMD both up more than 700 percent in the last five years. We have seen big games from Broadcom and Xilinx as well.</p><p>The bigger companies get bigger and bigger, particularly tech-related companies. Visa and MasterCard, those are fin tech companies. Cisco is another example. There are a few non-tech outliers like United Health and Home Depot that have been big performers but not many of them.</p><p>And then there are the outright losers. Energy stock down big, which is no surprise. Oil was $100 five years ago and it`s $60 today. The other big losing sector is retailers which includes stock`s like Macy`s and Gap down big.</p><p>So, what does it mean that a handful of tech titans have come to dominate the market? It is about growth. Technology is where the growth is, and growth is hard to find globally so investors are willing to pay up almost anything for growth wherever they can find it.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So with the market at new highs, what should you do right now?</p><p>Joining us to talk about that is Patrick Chovanec. He is the chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management.</p><p>Welcome, Patrick. Nice to see you again.</p><p>PATRICK CHOVANEC, CHIEF STRATEGIST, SILVERCREST ASSET MANAGEMENT: Hello.</p><p>HERERA: Is it decidedly more difficult to navigate the market at new highs?</p><p>CHOVANEC: Well, right now, the economy is a lot more wobbly than the market seems to be. You know, that`s why the Fed is talking about cutting rates, which is something that the market is excited about, but the economy is slowing and it could slow further.</p><p>Now, you know, it could pull through. So I wouldn`t go so far as to say that the market`s riding for a fall, but there could be bumpier days ahead.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes, I mean, that`s the big conundrum we`re facing right now. Jerome Powell just told us that the global economy is slowing down and it is taking our economy with it. Earnings will be coming out starting next week, and certainly expectations are not very high for those, yet here we sit at all-time highs today.</p><p>Is this simply a stock market that`s on a sugar high because of the lower rates?</p><p>CHOVANEC: No, because, ironically, this is not a market that is gorging on risk. When you look at what`s really expensive in the market today, it is actually your safe harbors. Treasuries are -- you know, are returning 2 percent, which is barely above inflation.</p><p>So the problem is that while, you know, if you look and you don`t like the risk that you see out there, if you want to take money off the table, where do you put it? It is actually more expensive to try to hide from risk than it is to actually ride it out right now.</p><p>HERERA: So if you are a longer term investor, do you just kind of stay put in this market but expect some volatility?</p><p>CHOVANEC: I think that`s really the best choice that you have. I do think that you need to realistically assess how much risk you can afford. You know, if the market were down 30 percent in a year because there was a recession, how would you cope?</p><p>You should always be thinking about that, but you should also be thinking about what you are giving up by simply going and hiding under a rock for a year or two. I think you are giving up quite a bit, both in terms of short term and long-term gains if you go and do that.</p><p>HERERA: Patrick, thank you so much.</p><p>CHOVANEC: You`re welcome.</p><p>HERERA: Patrick Chovanec with Silvercrest Asset Management.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We mentioned that rally in health care stocks that helped lift the Dow above 27,000. Here`s why: The Trump administration today withdrew the proposal that would have eliminated rebates from government drug plans. That boosted the shares of insurers like UnitedHealthcare, Cigna and CVS. But it also raised the possibility of new restrictions on drugmakers, which pressured that group today.</p><p>Meg Tirrell has details for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Trump administration claimed its rule on drug rebates had the potential to be the most sweeping change to how Americans` drugs are priced at the pharmacy counter ever. Today, they abandoned the plan.</p><p>Here is what it was aiming to do. For Medicare insurance plans, beneficiaries pay both a monthly premium and when they get a prescription, they pay an out-of-pocket cost at the pharmacy counter. So, how is it determined how much they pay for the medicines? Well, the drug company sets a list price and pharmacy benefits managers then negotiate a rebate on that drug.</p><p>But insurance co-pays for drugs are often based on the list price, not the price after the rebate. Right now, the PBMs and insurance companies take that rebate and spread it across their plan beneficiaries to lower premiums for everyone.</p><p>What the Trump administration rule sought to do is instead apply the rebates directly to the price of drugs at the pharmacy counter, so the patient being prescribed the drug could pay a lower price at the pharmacy. But because the rebates wouldn`t be spread across the beneficiaries, premiums for everyone could go up.</p><p>And that according to Capital Street`s Ipsita Smolinski presented a political problem.</p><p>IPSITA SMOLINSKI, CAPITAL STREET MANAGING DIRECTOR: The concern was premiums going up for Medicare beneficiaries -- these are those over 65 and who vote -- would probably not like to see their premiums go up for 2020 or 2021.</p><p>TIRRELL: While the Trump administration rule would have applied to Medicare, there was concern it could lead to changes in rebates provided by employers as well, Smolinski says. And those commercial plans, rebates contribute hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to pharmacy benefits managers, according to Leerink. That`s why those stocks soared today.</p><p>But drug company stocks sank. That`s because Trump is not expected to give up on the issue of drug prices and may, in fact, double down on effort that could pharma`s bottom line. Investors are trying to parse comments the president made last week about a most-favored nation clause.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For years and years, other nations paid less for drugs than we do, sometimes by 60 percent, 70 percent. We`re going to be and we`re working on it right now, we are working on a favored nation clause where we pay whatever the lowest nation`s price is. Why should other nations -- like Canada -- but why should other nations pay much less than us?</p><p>TIRRELL: A source close to the administration tells me that`s how the White House refers to a rule it has already proposed, tying the prices of some Medicare drugs to an international average. Trump said yesterday another announcement on drug prices is expected this week.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The Fed chair was back on Capitol Hill where he sent strong signals that the central bank is ready and able to cut interest rates this month.</p><p>Steve Liesman has more from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Fed Chairman Jay Powell`s visit to Capitol Hill on day two was a lot like day one where he affirmed the market`s view that rate cuts are likely coming at the end of July. But he also provided maybe a little context for how much the Fed might cut July or even beyond.</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: We don`t want to get behind the curve and let inflation drop well below 2 percent, because what happens is you get into this unhealthy dynamic potentially where lower expected inflation gets baked into interest rates, which means lower interest rates, which means less room for the central bank to react. And that becomes a self-reinforcing thing.</p><p>We have seen it in Japan. We are now seeing it in Europe. And that`s why we think it is so important we defend our 2 percent inflation goal here in the United States.</p><p>LIESMAN: A Federal Reserve that`s concerned about being behind the curve like Europe and Japan might be one that cuts more deeply than it otherwise might, trying to use what bullets it has to reduce rates more effectively.</p><p>Stocks liked what Powell said today, in part because it removed any potential risk he might reverse himself from day one. Also, Powell tended to ignore stronger economic data, both the inflation and stronger jobless claims numbers which fell by 13,000.</p><p>That means the economic data may not matter all that much if the concerns are trade uncertainties, global economic weakness and inflation running persistently below the Fed`s 2 percent market, then the data may not deter the Federal reserve from what looks like an inevitable rate cut at the end of this month.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And Steve just mentioned today`s inflation data where consumer prices posted their biggest gain in nearly one and a half years in June. According to the Labor Department, the so-called core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.3 percent. That was more than expected and it followed four straight monthly gains.</p><p>Now, food and energy are often excluded because those prices are considered volatile on a month-to-month basis but it`s also the stuff we pay for every day, including things like coffee.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s increasing like everything is increasing because salaries are increasing but it goes with the -- it is like gas. You need it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As a college student, I think it is a little bit like, yikes, when you realize shall oh, it`s like 5 bucks for like this much coffee. So, it`s a little like, you have to cut back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, price went up significantly. I remember when coffee was 50 cents a cup.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A medium at Dunkin` Donuts is $2.85. If that goes to like $4 and something, I don`t think I would do it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I haven`t paid attention to the pricing. It is kind of a necessary evil. I love coffee and whatever goes up, I`m just going to deal with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: So some people are seeing inflated prices at their local coffee shops, but the government data and the Fed say that inflation remains tame. So who has it right?</p><p>Bob Brusca is with us tonight. He`s chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics.</p><p>Bob, first of all, welcome. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>BOB BRUSCA, FACT &amp; OPINION ECONOMICS CHIEF: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You know, there`s that old saying people will always complain about the price of bread and gasoline and in this case coffee, but is there an especially glaring disconnect these days between what we are paying on an everyday basis and this tame inflation data reports that we get from the government and Fed?</p><p>BRUSCA: I don`t think so. I think the problem is that the people tend to focus on prices when they go up, and I think the other problem is that it is a low inflation environment. People`s incomes don`t go up very much. When your income isn`t going up very much and prices start going up, you really begin to notice it and it hurts.</p><p>HERERA: So, Bob, what impact do you think it will have? I mean, we heard some people say that if prices went up too much, that they would stop buying. Other people said they need their coffee, they`re going to keep buying.</p><p>So if, indeed, it is more noticeable because wages are not going up as fast as they used to, what impact might that have?</p><p>BRUSCA: Well, people can buy beans, grind them at home and make coffee and carry it to work. It will be a lot cheaper.</p><p>GRIFFETH: A very practical advice there from Bob Brusca. At this point why is inflation statistically speaking from the Federal Reserve and the government, as tame as it is right now? You know, Jerome Powell made a rather profound statement today when he said that low unemployment no longer leads to high inflation, which is what we were taught in economics schools. Why is that the case now?</p><p>BRUSCA: Yes, this -- this unemployment inflation trade I`ve noticed in Phillips Curve is pretty flat. Usually the Phillips Curve is dead. You have low inflation in Japan, you have low inflation in Europe, and we have low prices being generated every day out of China and we have a lot of technology and we all carry around cellphones that help us to check prices.</p><p>All of this tends to keep prices very low. There`s a lot of competition. There`s low prices elsewhere in the world, low inflation elsewhere in the world, and incomes aren`t going up. So, people check their phones a lot to double check prices when they spend money and that keeps prices in line.</p><p>HERERA: So, after Mr. Powell`s testimony today, do you think they cut by 25 or 50?</p><p>BRUSCA: I would be surprised if they did 50, Sue. I think you`re going to get 25 and I think they`re going to try to keep the other 25 in their pocket. I don`t see the case for 50.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Bob Brusca with Fact and Opinion Economics -- good to see you, Robert. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>BRUSCA: Good to see you too.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Thanks.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to look at today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Goldman Sachs launched coverage of the retail sector which included a buy rating on Walmart. The analyst cites the retailer`s aggressive strategy that could drive strong sales growth. The price target is $123. The stock rose a fraction to 113.92.</p><p>Weightwatchers was upgraded to neutral from underweight at J.P. Morgan. The firm cites stabilizing subscriber growth trends. The price target is $22. The stock gained 8 percent to $23.67.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Discount retailer Dillard`s was upgraded to neutral from underperforming at Wedbush Securities. The analyst cited stabilizing promotions at the company. Price target, $62. The stock rose 4 percent to $62.85.</p><p>Allstate was downgraded to underperform from neutral at Credit Suisse with the analyst saying that the insurer`s margins are under pressure due to weather and competition. Price target, $94. That stock fell 1 percent today to $103.15.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, tech titans may face a future with new rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Julia Boorstin in Sun Valley, Idaho, where a range of tech CEOs are at the Allen &amp; Co Conference, and regulation of those tech giants is in focus. That`s coming up on the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: We got a report today that said the federal budget deficit widened by more than 20 percent in the first nine months of the fiscal year. Federal spending outpaced government tax receipts, due in part to higher spending on military and interest on the debt, coupled with the tax cuts for corporations.</p><p>HERERA: The International Monetary Fund is forecasting more economic pain for the Eurozone. The organization says the region faces anemic growth stemming from trade tensions, Brexit and Italy`s high debt levels. The IMF also backed the European Central Bank`s plans for fresh stimulus.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We told you last night that the White House was planning to launch an investigation into attacks on technology companies imposed by the French government and, in fact, earlier today, French lawmakers did approve the so-called digital tax, setting up a fight with Washington.</p><p>Kayla Tausche has our details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The White House is fighting back as France moved closer to a new tax on tech companies. The U.S. trade representative launching a representation that could result in new tariffs on France for the fees it says unfairly target U.S. companies for being global leaders.</p><p>The proposal is named for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple and would see about 30 digital services companies pay an extra 3 percent on their revenue in France. It is retroactive to cover this year.</p><p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire defended the move and challenged the U.S. treasury secretary, G7 and OECD countries to reach an agreement.</p><p>BRUNO LE MAIRE, FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER: The sooner there will be international solution at the OECD level, France will withdraw its national taxation.</p><p>TAUSCHE: Experts say this fight is just beginning.</p><p>LILIAN FAULHABER, GEORGETOWN LAW PROFESSOR: The bigger question is what will happen in the next several months, how other countries outside of the U.S. will react to this, whether or not it will inspire them to implement their own digital taxes or whether or not it will be a warning not to implement these types of taxes until more international measures have moved forward.</p><p>TAUSCHE: The White House is counterpunch has been praised in Washington, from leading Republican lawmakers and business groups traditionally critical of tariffs, to both hawks and doves advising the president. The irony, even as they hit back against new fees on tech overseas, regulators are ramping up their own scrutiny here at home.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Delta is seeing some tailwinds. And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The airline raised its 2019 profit outlook, thanks to strong demand. The carrier posted record revenue and raised its dividend and unlike its competitors, Delta does not operate the Boeing 737 MAX.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED BASTIAN, DELTA CEO: We do not fly the MAX, and clearly, there was a benefit for the airline in the quarter. I don`t think there was a significant benefit. Certainly, it is not explaining the results we are seeing.</p><p>You know, I don`t know when the plane is going to come back. As we`ve seen, it has taken longer than any of us expected to see it return to service. It is not going to be in place for the third quarter, maybe sometime into the fourth quarter. We don`t have a crystal ball on that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The stock rose more than 1 percent to $60.16.</p><p>T-Mobile and Sprint are reportedly expected to extend their July 29th deadline for their $26 billion merger. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports both wireless carriers discuss ownership issues related to Dish Network. This would be the second deadline extension. T-Mobile shares dropped a fraction to $78.26. Sprint shares fell near 3.5 percent to $6.91.</p><p>And shares of Fastenal missed both earnings and revenue estimates. The wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies says the trade war with China impacted its numbers, specifically higher tariffs on imported goods that were produced in China. The stock fell nearly 3 percent to $30.36.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Shares of Grubhub fell today on fears of new regulations. \"The New York Post\" says that New York state is reportedly looking to limit the fees that food delivery companies can charge and require them to be listed on liquor licenses when they deliver for restaurants that do serve alcohol. Grubhub shares fell nearly 4 percent as a result today to $74 even.</p><p>Ford and Volkswagen reportedly planned to announce a new joint venture on electric and autonomous vehicles. That deal would allow both companies to share intellectual property and hardware. A formal announcement is expected tomorrow. Volkswagen does not trade here in the U.S., but Ford shares were up a fraction to $10.19.</p><p>And Boeing announced its 737 program manager Eric Lindblad is retiring after serving in that post for less than a year. He was, however, a 35- year veteran at the company. Mark Jenks will now be taking over the reins of that troubled program which has suffered from the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft. The stock was up 3 percent to $359 even.</p><p>And after the bell, genetics company Illumina warned that its fiscal second quarter revenue is going to be weaker than expected. The company cited weakness in its direct-to-consumer market among other things. Shares initially dropped in afterhours tonight. They closed the regular session today down more than 2 percent at $363.66.</p><p>HERERA: A bit earlier in our program, we mentioned Washington`s increased scrutiny of the tech sector. The potential wave of regulation was top of mind in Sun Valley, Idaho, where tech titans are meeting.</p><p>Julia Boorstin spoke to them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOORSTIN: With Apple`s Tim Cook, Facebook`s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CFO Ned Segal walking the paths here in Sun Valley, along with former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, big tech is out in force, and so is talk of regulating the giants, ahead of antitrust hearings on Capitol Hill next week.</p><p>Sam Altman, who founded Y-Combinator, which funds and advises early stage startups, says he thinks there`s no question that tech regulation is needed, but that breaking up the likes of Facebook or Google would be much harder.</p><p>SAM ALTMAN, Y-COMBINATOR FOUNDER: The companies are so big and so powerful and so intertwined but I think when I talk to most of them, they sort of actively want regulation. We`re in uncharted territory. I think either we figure out how to regulate more quickly and effectively than we have in the past, or we end up in a world where at some point we have to do it in a clumsy way.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo says antitrust and privacy issues shouldn`t be conflated.</p><p>DICK COSTOLO, FORMER TWITTER CEO: It is not just the fact that companies are big that should cause them to be regulated. The size of the company doesn`t have really any impact on the kinds of things it might be doing. It`s those specific things that companies are doing with data, the way they`re managing it or mismanaging it.</p><p>BOORSTIN: The question is what laws would best protect consumers without giving an unfair advantage to the giants that can better afford regulation? And Verizon CEO Hans Vesterberg notes how hard it is for regulation to keep up with innovation.</p><p>HANS VESTERBERG, VERIZON CEO: I think the technology is moving so fast, so if you do regulation, it`s just moving so fast it is hard. So I think it is up to responsible leaders.</p><p>BOORSTIN: While Mark Zuckerberg, who`s tried to dodge the cameras here, says he does not want to regulate Facebook himself, we will see how much the tech companies here enforce changes around the likes of privacy to avoid drastic government action.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, the smallest state in the country is facing some big economic challenges.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Here is what we`re watching tomorrow. The producer price index will be providing investors with additional information on inflation pressures within the economy. We will see if the trade war with China is having an impact on its economy when Beijing releases import and export numbers for the month of June. And the president of the Chicago Fed speaks on economic conditions and monetary policy.</p><p>That`s what we`re watching for Friday.</p><p>HERERA: Wall Street banks are lending less money to farmers. According to \"Reuters, which cites FDIC data, agricultural loans at the nation`s top 30 banks fell about 17 percent between the peak in 2015 and March of this year. Banks have increased their exposure to the rural Midwest following the financial crisis in part because farmers had plenty of income and collateral, but the retreat in lending comes as farmer`s incomes decline.</p><p>We told you yesterday that Virginia was ranked the top state for business in CNBC`s annual survey due to the quality of its workforce and educational system. But there are 50 states. That means somebody had to come in last.</p><p>So, tonight, Scott Cohn takes us to the survey`s worst state for business, Rhode Island.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For a little state, Rhode Island has big problems, but to hear the governor tell it the worst is over.</p><p>GOV. GINA RAIMONDO (D), RHODE ISLAND: We have stopped the decline. We have stopped the decline, and working together, we have ignited a comeback of this great state and our economy.</p><p>COHN: The comeback has yet to show up in the numbers, near the bottom for business friendliness, cost of doing business, economy, and still at the bottom for infrastructure. Fixing that has been a priority for Governor Gina Raimondo.</p><p>RAIMONDO: There`s more road work going on in this state than at any time in our lifetime.</p><p>COHN: Funded by a controversial program to charge tolls on trucks, not surprisingly unpopular with truckers like Michael Collins.</p><p>MICHAEL COLLINS, M&amp;D TRANSPORTATION: We need to kill this cancer in this state because it is going to spread like wildfire to other states.</p><p>RAIMONDO: Thank you.</p><p>COHN: The governor rode her plan to reelection last year, but it still faces some skepticism.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Got to do something, as long as the money actually does go to the roads.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The issue isn`t going to tap into consumers, you know. Somebody has to pay for it.</p><p>COHN: The administration says in its first three years there`s been $1.5 billion worth of new road construction, 100 miles of roads paved, and nearly 200 bridges repaired. Unemployment is now in line with the national average, and 30 businesses have moved to the state. But school test scores are low and economic growth is among the lowest in the country, more proof that a comeback, no matter how hard you try, doesn`t happen overnight.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Scott Cohn.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Before we go, here is a look at the day`s final numbers on Wall Street. The Dow gained 227 points to close above 27,000. The Nasdaq was down six and the S&amp;P 500 added six to finish at a record.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera.

I`m Rahel Solomon, in tonight for  Sue Herera.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And I`m Bill Griffeth.  We certainly welcome you aboard.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Let`s get to this tonight, shall we?</p><p>You know, for a while the stock and bond markets have been focused on three  things, trade, the Fed and corporate earnings.  And today, all three issues  collided.</p><p>First, President Trump revealed that the U.S. and China still have a long  way to go before the two countries reach a trade deal, and he warned once  again that he`s ready to slap tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese  goods.  Second, a new report said that retail sales increased more than  expected in June, an indication that the consumer is strong.  That could  change the calculus for the Fed and the likelihood of rate cuts this year.   And third, earnings reports released so far have shown that consumer  spending is strong, but business spending is slowing down.</p><p>New reports like these can often change a long-held outlook for growth, so  we asked Steve Liesman to put together a real-time assessment of the  economy.  And that`s where we start tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  While everyone seems  to be expecting the economic party to wind down or even end, no one seems  to have the told the U.S. consumer.  The government reported June retail  sales today up a strong 0.4 percent, beating expectations on the street.   Consumers spent less money on gasoline but plowed the savings into clothing  and furniture purchases.  Auto sales also did well and Internet sellers did  a brisk business, seemingly at the expense of department stores.</p><p>All of this shored up views on the second quarter with the CNBC rapid  update with the median of tracking estimates for GDP on Wall Street,  running at 1.8 percent, a slowdown from 3 percent of the first quarter but  well above the worst fears that accompanied the beginning of the quarter  and right about trend growth.</p><p>Still Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in a speech Tuesday continued to telegraph  a rate cut coming from the Fed, as did Chicago Fed President Charlie Evans.   In a CNBC interview, Evans said he was concerned about slowing global  growth, the trade war and inflation running below the Fed`s 2 percent  target.</p><p>CHARLES EVANS, CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT:  With the most recent nervousness,  I`ll just say, you know, I think that a little more accommodation would be  more helpful for ensuring that we confidently get to and above 2 percent.   I really think 2.25 or a little more would be appropriate for our economy  and monetary policy.  At this point into the economic cycle, we are, you  know, 10 years into an expansion, and if we are going to be above 2 percent  during this cycle, you think this be about right.</p><p>LIESMAN:  So, consumers have enjoyed strong job growth and decent wage  growth.  And now, they are likely to get a cut soon from the Fed.  It  doesn`t seem like the party, that is the economic expansion, is ending any  time soon.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOLOMON:  So what happens when consumer spending is strong and business  spending starts to soften?</p><p>Mark Zandi is the chief economist at Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.</p><p>Mark, thanks for being with us this evening.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`S ANALYTICS:  Good to be here.</p><p>SOLOMON:  How -- how do you explain the disconnect between the strong  retail spending and the consumer spending -- and the business spending,  excuse me?</p><p>ZANDI:  Right.  Well, businesses are nervous.  Business sentiment is way  off from where it was this time last year and that`s because of the  president`s trade war.  That has made -- it has unnerved businesses around  the world.</p><p>You know, pick your survey.  The Duke University runs a survey of CFOs here  in the United States.  Two-thirds of those survey respondents say we`re  going to have a recession by the end of 2020.</p><p>So businesses are just very nervous about the trade war, but as a result of  that, they`re pulling back on their investment but they have not pulled  back on their -- their payrolls, their hiring.  They`re still adding to  jobs.  Unemployment is still low, and that`s what consumers care about,  that they have a job and unemployment is low.  So, consumers are fine just  as long as businesses don`t cut hiring.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.  I mean, we see here that you call the economy fragile,  but it depends on which sector of the economy you are looking at.  So,  again, what`s the Fed going to do with this?  Does this mean fewer rate  cuts if we`re going to get any this year?</p><p>ZANDI:  I think the Fed will cut rates.  I think the economy broadly, you  add it all up, the positives and the negatives, it is still fragile.  I  mean, Steve was talking about 1.8 percent GDP growth.  That`s probably  below the economy`s potential.</p><p>So, what that means if we stay here very long, job growth will slow to the  point unemployment will start to rise and unnerve consumers and that will  be the fodder for recession.  So, I think the Federal Reserve desperately  wants to avoid that, once you get growth back up above 2 percent.  So, that  means that they`re going to cut interest rates and they`re going to keep  cutting rates as long as this trade war is going on and as long as growth  is below potential.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Mark, is it possible to know what is a better indicator of the  economy?  Is the consumer right or are businesses right?</p><p>ZANDI:  Well, generally, business confidence, if you go back and look at  history and look at recessions over the last, say, since World War II, the  last ten recessions, a business confidence tends to lead consumer  confidence.</p><p>So businesses, you know, they`re much more sensitive.  They`re on the  ground.  They`re buying and selling.  You know, they`re changing their  prices.  They have a real feel for what is happening.</p><p>And so, business -- once business sentiment starts to go and they start to  pull back, if they ultimately curtail their hiring and unemployment starts  to rise, then consumers follow.  Actually, the most interesting is it is  investors that go first, then businesses and finally the consumer.  The  consumer is last to figure it out and lose faith in the economy and the  recession ensues.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Until then, the consumer continues to spend.</p><p>All right.  Mark Zandi with Moody`s Analytics, thank you.  We appreciate  it.</p><p>ZANDI:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  To Wall Street now where stocks pulled back from those record  levels we saw yesterday in part because of those trade comments from  President Trump that we told you about earlier in the program.  The Dow  Industrial Average fell just 23 points.  We`re at 27,335.  Nasdaq was down  35.  The S&amp;P was lower by 10.</p><p>The push and pull in the market today was driven largely by earnings.   Three of the nations biggest banks topped profit expectations, but investor  reaction to those results from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P. Morgan and  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was mixed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) shares were up because its growing loan  business pushed net interest income up by almost 40 percent.  That business  however is threatened by trade tensions and the possibility of interest  rate cuts.  Goldman`s profits and revenue both topped estimates, but both  down from a year ago.  Profits fell by 6 percent.</p><p>Consumer businesses were relatively strong at J.P. Morgan Chase, too.   Profits from loans, up 7 percent, were a big reason the bank`s overall  second quarter profit jumped by 16 percent, but -- and it is a big but --  interest race were on hold, which means loan growth slowed and any interest  rate cut by the Fed will put even more pressure on the bank`s loan  portfolio.</p><p>Wells Fargo`s profit was up even more, about 20 percent from a year ago,  but revenue was flat and like J.P. Morgan Chase, net interest margins fell.   That`s the difference between the amount of the loan and the amount of  interest that the loan brings in.  Margins are down, in part because  homeowners are refinancing again, making their mortgages less profitable  for banks.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And tomorrow, we`ll get quarterly results from Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and PNC Financial Services.</p><p>SOLOMON:  The grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX did not have a big  impact on United`s bottom line.  The carrier reported better than expected  profit and revenue, that was thanks to stronger travel demand and higher  fares.  It also raised the low end of its profit forecast for the year.   Taking a look at the stock, it rose slightly in initial after hours  trading.</p><p>Phil LeBeau joins us from Chicago.</p><p>Phil, good to have you.</p><p>So, the grounding of the 737 MAX did not affect the carrier in the most  recent quarter, but what about looking forward?  What about future  quarters?</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Great question, Rahel.   We don`t know.  And we don`t know the exact impact of not having the max in  the second quarter had on the results for United Airlines.  They`re not  breaking those out, nor will they say the expected impact for all of 2019.</p><p>But one interesting note did come out in the earnings release.  The company  has agreed to buy 19 used Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-700 airplanes with some of  the deliveries starting in December.  Why is this important?  It is  important because they may not have the MAX back until the end of this  year, and even then some people are saying, look, it may not be until early  next year, but they have capacity growth planned.  They want to make sure  they have the seats in place for that</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I like to see them kicking the tires on those things.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  United is seeing strong demand here in the U.S.  What about  international routes right now, Phil?</p><p>LEBEAU:  That`s a good question.  They don`t talk about it specifically in  the earnings release.  We`ll have a chance to talk with CEO Oscar Munoz  tomorrow morning and that`s going to be one of the primary questions.  We  heard from other airline executives that they have seen what they term as  softness, particularly in Asia or around China with all of the trade  tensions that have been developed.</p><p>Now, that doesn`t mean that it is falling off of a cliff in terms of  demand, but it is an area that`s going to get a lot of question not only  from us in the media but also from analysts when they talk with CEO Oscar  Munoz tomorrow.</p><p>SOLOMON:  OK, Phil.  We know you certainly will ask.  Thank you.</p><p>Phil LeBeau in Chicago for us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, Dow component Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported  better than expected earnings and increased its guidance, but that wasn`t  enough to push the stock higher.</p><p>Meg Tirrell explains why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Johnson &amp; Johnson  (NYSE:JNJ) is the world`s largest health care company.  It sells everything  from prescription drugs to bandage, to tools for hip and knee replacement.   And in the second quarter, its profit and sales beat Wall Street`s  expectations.</p><p>The stock fell.  That may be because investor`s focus is elsewhere, legal  battles around baby powder and opioid pain killers.</p><p>JARED HOLZ, JEFFERIES HEALTH-CARE STRATEGIST:  It is still pretty difficult  for investors to understand the implications of some of the legal  liabilities that they may face with respect to talc and also with opioids.</p><p>TIRRELL:  Closing arguments took place yesterday in a case in Oklahoma  where state attorneys claim Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) contributed to the  opioid crisis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The defense blamed everyone, everyone except themselves  for causing this crisis.</p><p>TIRRELL:  A decision from the judge is expected later this summer.</p><p>In an interview this morning, J&amp;J`s chief financial officer disputed the  claims.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON CFO:  We readily admit there`s an opioid  epidemic that needs to be solved by many parties and has to be multi-factor  in terms of the solution set.  But here, the facts don`t align to these  claims that the state is making.</p><p>TIRRELL:  J&amp;J`s stock fell on a report the Justice Department has opened a  criminal investigation into whether the company lied to the public about  the risk of asbestos in its talcum products, going back to the 1970s.</p><p>WOLK:  We are complying fully and cooperating fully with the Department of  Justice.  It is an astute organization.  I`m sure once they go through the  facts, they will come to the same conclusions that the company acted  responsibly and the product is safe.</p><p>TIRRELL:  But the uncertainty leaves investors unsure, said Jefferies  healthcare strategist Jared Holz.  That makes the stock that once  considered a defensive, steady investment less so.</p><p>HOLZ:  The quarter netting everything out, very much in line.  I think the  legal overhang is the conversation in terms of buying or selling the stock  into the second half.</p><p>TIRRELL:  Today anyway, investors sold.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOLOMON:  As we`ve been reporting, one of the biggest concerns for the  market is the slowing global economy and that`s starting to show up in the  results from industrial companies.</p><p>Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Earnings season is  officially under way and while still in the early innings, there are some  signs that the global industrial economy is a big slower.</p><p>Just look at harmful of companies who reported in the last few days.  So,  tonight, Arrow Electronics (NYSE:ARW) which makes electronic components and  semiconductors, they preannounced weaker earnings for the second quarter.   They cited deteriorating demand conditions, particularly from Asia, and an  inventory correction.</p><p>We heard similar sentiments from companies last week.  Another  semiconductor company, Vishay, pre-announced June sales well below  expectations.  They also noted an inventory corrections and pricing  pressure.  Also Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST), which makes tools, motors,  fasteners, they sell to a number of big multinational companies around the  globe.  They also reported lower revenues and lower gross margins last  week.  They blamed higher costs largely related to trade wars and tariffs.</p><p>Finally, BASF.  This is the world`s biggest chemical company.  They also  lowered guidance last week.  They cited the trade conflicts, weak global  industrial production growth and a broader downturn in the global  automotive industry.</p><p>So, beyond just the corporate speak, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell also  echoed global growth concerns.  Today in a speech, he acknowledged weakness  in the manufacturing sector.</p><p>He said: The manufacturing sector has been weak since the beginning of the  year, in part weighed down by the softer business spending, weaker growth  in global economy and concern about trade tensions.</p><p>Now, we`ll see whether the story remains the same for other semiconductors  and industrial names, including manufacturing giant Honeywell and chip  maker Taiwan Semiconductor.  Both of those will report results on Thursday.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Oil prices fell today after President Trump signaled progress  with Iran and said that he was not looking for regime change in that  country.  During a meeting of his cabinet at the White House, Secretary of  State Mike Pompeo said that Tehran was prepared to negotiate on its missile  program, and those comments pointed to an easing of tensions which then  sent oil prices down by about 3 percent in today`s session.</p><p>SOLOMON:  And time now to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and  Downgrades\".</p><p>Dow component Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was downgraded to hold from buy at  Gabelli.  The analyst cites the stock`s valuation.  The firm also notes  that the current stock price reflects above market growth over the next  three years.  The stock fell a fraction to $217.26.</p><p>Parker Hannifin meantime was downgraded from sell to neutral at Goldman  Sachs (NYSE:GS).  The analyst cites a slowdown in the industrial sector,  and also a constrained balance sheet.  The price target is $150.  Now,  despite the downgrade, the stock rose about 2 percent to $171.04.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, in the hot seat.  Lawmakers come down hard on a  sector that has helped drive this market higher.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>SOLOMON:  And it was a rough day for big tech on Capitol Hill.  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) all found themes the target of lawmakers who, as you know,  are increasing the pressure on some of the nation`s most prominent  companies.</p><p>Ylan Mui was there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  First up was Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) testifying before the Senate Banking Committee on its new  cryptocurrency called Libra.  Senators on both sides of the aisle pressed  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on exactly how it would work, who would regulate it  and how Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) plans to make money from it.</p><p>Republican Senator John Kennedy accused Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of trying to  control the money supply while Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown compared  the company to a toddler playing with matches.  But ultimately, lawmakers  said their concerns come down to trust.</p><p>SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ):  Trust is something you earn and Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) certainly hasn`t earned it.</p><p>SEN. JON TESTER (D-MT):  What -- what kind of faith do we have in Libra?</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA):  Can we agree that a banker should be  trustworthy?</p><p>SEN. MARTHA MCSALLY (R-AZ):  I don`t want to get into the technical stuff.   I am talking about the trust issue.</p><p>SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH):  Mr. Chairman, I wish we could trust Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB).  It is pretty clear there`s almost nobody in this committee  that does.</p><p>MUI:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) executive David Marcus (NYSE:MCS) defended his  company`s record.  He said Libra will not compete with retail banks or  central banks and that it would not share information with Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB).  Instead, he pledged to work hand in hand with authorities.</p><p>DAVID MARCUS, FACEBOOK VP MESSAGING PRODUCTS:  Getting this right means  addressing these concerns in full and ensuring that there`s proper  regulatory oversight for this project.</p><p>MUI:  Over in the House, the spotlight was not just on Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), but also Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) as officials from all four companies testified before the  House Judiciary Committee.  The focus of that hearing was on innovation and  entrepreneurship, and whether big tech companies are not only squashing the  competition but keeping new players from getting into the market all  together.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI):  In other words, this hearing isn`t just about  the companies before us today.  It is about ensuring that we have the  conditions for the next Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), the next Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN), the next Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and the next Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) to grow and prosper.</p><p>MUI:  The companies argue that they actually encourage innovation, not  stifle it.  And they say they face intense competition for their products  here at home and around the world.  The one thing these hearings made clear  is that the battle between big tech and Washington is far from over.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So when all is said and done, what kind of regulations and/or  restrictions are we likely to see imposed on these tech giants?</p><p>Joining us is John Freeman.  He`s technology analyst at CFRA Research.</p><p>John, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>JOHN FREEMAN, CFRA RESEARCH TECH ANALYST:  Bill, thank you for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You think it will be modest to use that term.  What do you think  is going to happen?  Describe it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think the first sort of effort will be modest.  There  will be some sort of oversight I think is the most likely outcome.</p><p>But the scary thing is that they are writing legislation -- or, you know,  they`re considering writing new legislation specifically for social  networks.  So, this is not as much an antitrust issue, a classic sort of  antitrust issue as it is, you know, curtailing the political power and  influence that particularly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has, because I think that  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) really has kind of, you know, separated from the pack  in terms of the scrutiny that legislators have on them.</p><p>SOLOMON:  And would you say that other players in this space are watching  sort of how Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reacts?  Because as you said, it does seem  like regulators are honing in on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) specifically.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think they`re watching, but I think the thing about  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is it is relatively new to the lobbying game.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), apple, even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been doing it a little  bit longer, and I think they`re a little bit better at it.</p><p>I think the Libra announcement, just the timing of it, you know, now you`re  going to give, you know, nefarious actors the ability to manipulate the  next election anonymously with money that, you know, they don`t have to  launder.  You can see the political engine getting under there that way.</p><p>So, I think that`s one of the reasons why Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has sort of  more scrutiny on it.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, we all know that these kinds of companies -- you know, the  companies that have been at the forefront of technology, cutting-edge  technology for the last several years, have been leading this market  higher.  Now they`re getting this scrutiny from Washington.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Does that cap that growth do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think every -- I think for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), I think  it is built in or, you know, the light -- some sort of light regulation is  built in.  I think it is maybe even built in a little bit for Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) as well, but perhaps not the more disastrous outcome for,  say, example rewriting the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which means  that both Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would actually have  to be responsible.</p><p>They could be liable for, you know -- they could be liable for libel.  They  would have to be responsible for their content, which wouldn`t be  practical.  But, you know, that`s kind of he sort of worst case scenario.   Most of the investors I talk with have kind of built that in, but they are  concerned about regulations.  That`s the questions that come out, is mostly  about regulation with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) right  now.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  John Freeman with CFRA Research -- again, thanks for  joining us tonight.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Bill, thank you.  Take care.</p><p>SOLOMON:  Charles Schwab beats the street and that`s where we begin  tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The discount broker was helped by nearly 400,000 new customer accounts last  quarter.  The firm now has now 12 million active accounts.  The rose up  more than 3 percent to $41.63.</p><p>And in an SEC filing, KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) said it discovered fraud that  could cost it $90 million.  The bank said the fraudulent activity involved  one of its business customers and it happened at the start of the third  quarter.  The company believes it was an isolated incident and says it`s  working with law enforcement.  KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) fell more than 1 percent  to $17.38.</p><p>CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom (NYSE:VIA) reportedly set a deadline to agree on  a merger.  CNBC says the media companies have settled on August 8th, also  on that day, both CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom (NYSE:VIA) will report second  quarter earnings.  CBS (NYSE:CBS) rose a fraction to $53.51.  Viacom  (NYSE:VIA) fell more than 1 percent to $35.72.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Canadian Specific topped analyst estimates. thanks to an  increase in oil, chemicals and plastic shipments.  The railroad operator  also lowered its costs for the quarter.  The stock rose nearly 4 percent  today to $246.27.</p><p>Domino`s reported the slowest same-store sales they`ve seen in three years  as it expands its store base and faces increased competition from food  delivery services.  The company has increased the number of locations as a  way to compete with those companies.  But analysts say the expansion may be  cannibalizing sales at existing locations, so shares fell more than 8  percent today to $246.54.</p><p>And after the bell, CSX (NYSE:CSX) reported lower than expected earnings  and revenue.  The company saw an increase in its merchandise shipments like  vehicles and apparel, but that was offset by declines in its container  shipments.  Shares initially dropped in after hours trading tonight, but  they did close the regular session up more than 1 percent to $79.55.</p><p>And late today, the Department of Justice asked an appeals court to pause  its antitrust ruling against Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).  About one month ago,  you might recall a judge ruled that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) illegally  suppressed competition in the market for smartphone chips.  Shares rose in  initial after hours trading on news.  It closed the regulation session at  $75.67.</p><p>SOLOMON:  And coming up, no ads, no problem.  Companies are using a  different marketing strategy to target binge watchers.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>SOLOMON:  IKEA is shutting down its one American factory.  The company  plans to move operations to Europe due to raw material costs that it says  are higher here in the U.S.  IKEA says shifting the work to Europe and  importing the goods will make its furniture in North America more  affordable.  The Danville, Virginia plant employs 300 workers.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reports earnings tomorrow, but tonight,  we`re going to take a look at how this company has changed the way we watch  TV and the way companies advertise.</p><p>Here is Julia Boorstin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Netflix`s roughly  150 million subscribers bingeing with no commercial breaks has pushed  advertisers to find new ways to reach viewers glued to ad-free platforms.   One example is new Coke.  Its featured in Netflix`s original series  \"Stranger Things\".  With Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) bringing back limited edition  Coke cans for sale, turning the company`s infamous failure into a new  marketing opportunity.</p><p>The streamer says none of the many brands mentioned in \"Stranger Things\"  are paid for but they offer Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) valuable promotion.</p><p>TOM MEYER, THE MARKETING ARM PRESIDENT OF ENTERTAINMENT:  In today`s world,  the streamers have adopted the old movie, you know, technique and are  working directly with brands who get product placement integration, but  then they also promote the show in advertising, on digital, on their social  channels, et cetera.  So that`s building an audience for the show and  that`s what the streamers want.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Promotional partnerships also happen off screen.  For \"Stranger  Things\", Baskin Robbins created eight flavors and collectible containers  tied to the show, for its largest partnership and its first with the  streaming platform.</p><p>And it`s not just Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).  Hulu is paid to feature Miller  Coors beer in 10 episodes of its \"Into the Dark\" series.  Hulu says brand  integrations work better than 30-second spots in the platform, delivering a  nearly 90 percent increase in purchase intent among viewers and a 75  percent increase in brand awareness.</p><p>And to break through the clutter, some big brands are returning to the  original TV ad model, paying to produce shows and documentaries in an  effort to reach consumers with content rather than the ads that interrupt  it.  Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is sponsoring a National Geographic TV  series on efforts to combat extreme poverty, looking to align its products  with efforts for good.</p><p>NANCY SMITH, ANALYTIC PARTNERS CEO:  Brands like P&amp;G and others are going  to benefit from having those.  It is expensive, and that`s really where the  challenge comes in is, is the expense not too high, such that the return is  achievable?</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) financed a documentary about nurses  in the early days of the AIDS epidemic.  The brand hoping for a halo effect  from the film`s message of compassion and rave reviews.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOLOMON:  And before we go, let`s take a final look at the day on Wall  Street.  The Dow fell 23 points, the Nasdaq was down 35, and the S&amp;P 500  was lower by 10.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I`m Rahel Solomon.   Thanks for watching.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.  See you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I`m Rahel Solomon, in tonight for Sue Herera.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And I`m Bill Griffeth. We certainly welcome you aboard.</p><p>SOLOMON: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Let`s get to this tonight, shall we?</p><p>You know, for a while the stock and bond markets have been focused on three things, trade, the Fed and corporate earnings. And today, all three issues collided.</p><p>First, President Trump revealed that the U.S. and China still have a long way to go before the two countries reach a trade deal, and he warned once again that he`s ready to slap tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods. Second, a new report said that retail sales increased more than expected in June, an indication that the consumer is strong. That could change the calculus for the Fed and the likelihood of rate cuts this year. And third, earnings reports released so far have shown that consumer spending is strong, but business spending is slowing down.</p><p>New reports like these can often change a long-held outlook for growth, so we asked Steve Liesman to put together a real-time assessment of the economy. And that`s where we start tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: While everyone seems to be expecting the economic party to wind down or even end, no one seems to have the told the U.S. consumer. The government reported June retail sales today up a strong 0.4 percent, beating expectations on the street. Consumers spent less money on gasoline but plowed the savings into clothing and furniture purchases. Auto sales also did well and Internet sellers did a brisk business, seemingly at the expense of department stores.</p><p>All of this shored up views on the second quarter with the CNBC rapid update with the median of tracking estimates for GDP on Wall Street, running at 1.8 percent, a slowdown from 3 percent of the first quarter but well above the worst fears that accompanied the beginning of the quarter and right about trend growth.</p><p>Still Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in a speech Tuesday continued to telegraph a rate cut coming from the Fed, as did Chicago Fed President Charlie Evans. In a CNBC interview, Evans said he was concerned about slowing global growth, the trade war and inflation running below the Fed`s 2 percent target.</p><p>CHARLES EVANS, CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT: With the most recent nervousness, I`ll just say, you know, I think that a little more accommodation would be more helpful for ensuring that we confidently get to and above 2 percent. I really think 2.25 or a little more would be appropriate for our economy and monetary policy. At this point into the economic cycle, we are, you know, 10 years into an expansion, and if we are going to be above 2 percent during this cycle, you think this be about right.</p><p>LIESMAN: So, consumers have enjoyed strong job growth and decent wage growth. And now, they are likely to get a cut soon from the Fed. It doesn`t seem like the party, that is the economic expansion, is ending any time soon.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOLOMON: So what happens when consumer spending is strong and business spending starts to soften?</p><p>Mark Zandi is the chief economist at Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.</p><p>Mark, thanks for being with us this evening.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY`S ANALYTICS: Good to be here.</p><p>SOLOMON: How -- how do you explain the disconnect between the strong retail spending and the consumer spending -- and the business spending, excuse me?</p><p>ZANDI: Right. Well, businesses are nervous. Business sentiment is way off from where it was this time last year and that`s because of the president`s trade war. That has made -- it has unnerved businesses around the world.</p><p>You know, pick your survey. The Duke University runs a survey of CFOs here in the United States. Two-thirds of those survey respondents say we`re going to have a recession by the end of 2020.</p><p>So businesses are just very nervous about the trade war, but as a result of that, they`re pulling back on their investment but they have not pulled back on their -- their payrolls, their hiring. They`re still adding to jobs. Unemployment is still low, and that`s what consumers care about, that they have a job and unemployment is low. So, consumers are fine just as long as businesses don`t cut hiring.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right. I mean, we see here that you call the economy fragile, but it depends on which sector of the economy you are looking at. So, again, what`s the Fed going to do with this? Does this mean fewer rate cuts if we`re going to get any this year?</p><p>ZANDI: I think the Fed will cut rates. I think the economy broadly, you add it all up, the positives and the negatives, it is still fragile. I mean, Steve was talking about 1.8 percent GDP growth. That`s probably below the economy`s potential.</p><p>So, what that means if we stay here very long, job growth will slow to the point unemployment will start to rise and unnerve consumers and that will be the fodder for recession. So, I think the Federal Reserve desperately wants to avoid that, once you get growth back up above 2 percent. So, that means that they`re going to cut interest rates and they`re going to keep cutting rates as long as this trade war is going on and as long as growth is below potential.</p><p>SOLOMON: Mark, is it possible to know what is a better indicator of the economy? Is the consumer right or are businesses right?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, generally, business confidence, if you go back and look at history and look at recessions over the last, say, since World War II, the last ten recessions, a business confidence tends to lead consumer confidence.</p><p>So businesses, you know, they`re much more sensitive. They`re on the ground. They`re buying and selling. You know, they`re changing their prices. They have a real feel for what is happening.</p><p>And so, business -- once business sentiment starts to go and they start to pull back, if they ultimately curtail their hiring and unemployment starts to rise, then consumers follow. Actually, the most interesting is it is investors that go first, then businesses and finally the consumer. The consumer is last to figure it out and lose faith in the economy and the recession ensues.</p><p>SOLOMON: Until then, the consumer continues to spend.</p><p>All right. Mark Zandi with Moody`s Analytics, thank you. We appreciate it.</p><p>ZANDI: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: To Wall Street now where stocks pulled back from those record levels we saw yesterday in part because of those trade comments from President Trump that we told you about earlier in the program. The Dow Industrial Average fell just 23 points. We`re at 27,335. Nasdaq was down 35. The S&amp;P was lower by 10.</p><p>The push and pull in the market today was driven largely by earnings. Three of the nations biggest banks topped profit expectations, but investor reaction to those results from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was mixed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) shares were up because its growing loan business pushed net interest income up by almost 40 percent. That business however is threatened by trade tensions and the possibility of interest rate cuts. Goldman`s profits and revenue both topped estimates, but both down from a year ago. Profits fell by 6 percent.</p><p>Consumer businesses were relatively strong at J.P. Morgan Chase, too. Profits from loans, up 7 percent, were a big reason the bank`s overall second quarter profit jumped by 16 percent, but -- and it is a big but -- interest race were on hold, which means loan growth slowed and any interest rate cut by the Fed will put even more pressure on the bank`s loan portfolio.</p><p>Wells Fargo`s profit was up even more, about 20 percent from a year ago, but revenue was flat and like J.P. Morgan Chase, net interest margins fell. That`s the difference between the amount of the loan and the amount of interest that the loan brings in. Margins are down, in part because homeowners are refinancing again, making their mortgages less profitable for banks.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And tomorrow, we`ll get quarterly results from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and PNC Financial Services.</p><p>SOLOMON: The grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX did not have a big impact on United`s bottom line. The carrier reported better than expected profit and revenue, that was thanks to stronger travel demand and higher fares. It also raised the low end of its profit forecast for the year. Taking a look at the stock, it rose slightly in initial after hours trading.</p><p>Phil LeBeau joins us from Chicago.</p><p>Phil, good to have you.</p><p>So, the grounding of the 737 MAX did not affect the carrier in the most recent quarter, but what about looking forward? What about future quarters?</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Great question, Rahel. We don`t know. And we don`t know the exact impact of not having the max in the second quarter had on the results for United Airlines. They`re not breaking those out, nor will they say the expected impact for all of 2019.</p><p>But one interesting note did come out in the earnings release. The company has agreed to buy 19 used Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-700 airplanes with some of the deliveries starting in December. Why is this important? It is important because they may not have the MAX back until the end of this year, and even then some people are saying, look, it may not be until early next year, but they have capacity growth planned. They want to make sure they have the seats in place for that</p><p>GRIFFETH: I like to see them kicking the tires on those things.</p><p>LEBEAU: Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH: United is seeing strong demand here in the U.S. What about international routes right now, Phil?</p><p>LEBEAU: That`s a good question. They don`t talk about it specifically in the earnings release. We`ll have a chance to talk with CEO Oscar Munoz tomorrow morning and that`s going to be one of the primary questions. We heard from other airline executives that they have seen what they term as softness, particularly in Asia or around China with all of the trade tensions that have been developed.</p><p>Now, that doesn`t mean that it is falling off of a cliff in terms of demand, but it is an area that`s going to get a lot of question not only from us in the media but also from analysts when they talk with CEO Oscar Munoz tomorrow.</p><p>SOLOMON: OK, Phil. We know you certainly will ask. Thank you.</p><p>Phil LeBeau in Chicago for us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, Dow component Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported better than expected earnings and increased its guidance, but that wasn`t enough to push the stock higher.</p><p>Meg Tirrell explains why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the world`s largest health care company. It sells everything from prescription drugs to bandage, to tools for hip and knee replacement. And in the second quarter, its profit and sales beat Wall Street`s expectations.</p><p>The stock fell. That may be because investor`s focus is elsewhere, legal battles around baby powder and opioid pain killers.</p><p>JARED HOLZ, JEFFERIES HEALTH-CARE STRATEGIST: It is still pretty difficult for investors to understand the implications of some of the legal liabilities that they may face with respect to talc and also with opioids.</p><p>TIRRELL: Closing arguments took place yesterday in a case in Oklahoma where state attorneys claim Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) contributed to the opioid crisis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The defense blamed everyone, everyone except themselves for causing this crisis.</p><p>TIRRELL: A decision from the judge is expected later this summer.</p><p>In an interview this morning, J&amp;J`s chief financial officer disputed the claims.</p><p>JOSEPH WOLK, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON CFO: We readily admit there`s an opioid epidemic that needs to be solved by many parties and has to be multi-factor in terms of the solution set. But here, the facts don`t align to these claims that the state is making.</p><p>TIRRELL: J&amp;J`s stock fell on a report the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into whether the company lied to the public about the risk of asbestos in its talcum products, going back to the 1970s.</p><p>WOLK: We are complying fully and cooperating fully with the Department of Justice. It is an astute organization. I`m sure once they go through the facts, they will come to the same conclusions that the company acted responsibly and the product is safe.</p><p>TIRRELL: But the uncertainty leaves investors unsure, said Jefferies healthcare strategist Jared Holz. That makes the stock that once considered a defensive, steady investment less so.</p><p>HOLZ: The quarter netting everything out, very much in line. I think the legal overhang is the conversation in terms of buying or selling the stock into the second half.</p><p>TIRRELL: Today anyway, investors sold.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOLOMON: As we`ve been reporting, one of the biggest concerns for the market is the slowing global economy and that`s starting to show up in the results from industrial companies.</p><p>Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Earnings season is officially under way and while still in the early innings, there are some signs that the global industrial economy is a big slower.</p><p>Just look at harmful of companies who reported in the last few days. So, tonight, Arrow Electronics (NYSE:ARW) which makes electronic components and semiconductors, they preannounced weaker earnings for the second quarter. They cited deteriorating demand conditions, particularly from Asia, and an inventory correction.</p><p>We heard similar sentiments from companies last week. Another semiconductor company, Vishay, pre-announced June sales well below expectations. They also noted an inventory corrections and pricing pressure. Also Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST), which makes tools, motors, fasteners, they sell to a number of big multinational companies around the globe. They also reported lower revenues and lower gross margins last week. They blamed higher costs largely related to trade wars and tariffs.</p><p>Finally, BASF. This is the world`s biggest chemical company. They also lowered guidance last week. They cited the trade conflicts, weak global industrial production growth and a broader downturn in the global automotive industry.</p><p>So, beyond just the corporate speak, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell also echoed global growth concerns. Today in a speech, he acknowledged weakness in the manufacturing sector.</p><p>He said: The manufacturing sector has been weak since the beginning of the year, in part weighed down by the softer business spending, weaker growth in global economy and concern about trade tensions.</p><p>Now, we`ll see whether the story remains the same for other semiconductors and industrial names, including manufacturing giant Honeywell and chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor. Both of those will report results on Thursday.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Oil prices fell today after President Trump signaled progress with Iran and said that he was not looking for regime change in that country. During a meeting of his cabinet at the White House, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Tehran was prepared to negotiate on its missile program, and those comments pointed to an easing of tensions which then sent oil prices down by about 3 percent in today`s session.</p><p>SOLOMON: And time now to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Dow component Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was downgraded to hold from buy at Gabelli. The analyst cites the stock`s valuation. The firm also notes that the current stock price reflects above market growth over the next three years. The stock fell a fraction to $217.26.</p><p>Parker Hannifin meantime was downgraded from sell to neutral at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The analyst cites a slowdown in the industrial sector, and also a constrained balance sheet. The price target is $150. Now, despite the downgrade, the stock rose about 2 percent to $171.04.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And still ahead, in the hot seat. Lawmakers come down hard on a sector that has helped drive this market higher.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>SOLOMON: And it was a rough day for big tech on Capitol Hill. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) all found themes the target of lawmakers who, as you know, are increasing the pressure on some of the nation`s most prominent companies.</p><p>Ylan Mui was there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: First up was Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) testifying before the Senate Banking Committee on its new cryptocurrency called Libra. Senators on both sides of the aisle pressed Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on exactly how it would work, who would regulate it and how Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) plans to make money from it.</p><p>Republican Senator John Kennedy accused Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of trying to control the money supply while Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown compared the company to a toddler playing with matches. But ultimately, lawmakers said their concerns come down to trust.</p><p>SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): Trust is something you earn and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) certainly hasn`t earned it.</p><p>SEN. JON TESTER (D-MT): What -- what kind of faith do we have in Libra?</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): Can we agree that a banker should be trustworthy?</p><p>SEN. MARTHA MCSALLY (R-AZ): I don`t want to get into the technical stuff. I am talking about the trust issue.</p><p>SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH): Mr. Chairman, I wish we could trust Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). It is pretty clear there`s almost nobody in this committee that does.</p><p>MUI: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) executive David Marcus (NYSE:MCS) defended his company`s record. He said Libra will not compete with retail banks or central banks and that it would not share information with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Instead, he pledged to work hand in hand with authorities.</p><p>DAVID MARCUS, FACEBOOK VP MESSAGING PRODUCTS: Getting this right means addressing these concerns in full and ensuring that there`s proper regulatory oversight for this project.</p><p>MUI: Over in the House, the spotlight was not just on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), but also Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as officials from all four companies testified before the House Judiciary Committee. The focus of that hearing was on innovation and entrepreneurship, and whether big tech companies are not only squashing the competition but keeping new players from getting into the market all together.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): In other words, this hearing isn`t just about the companies before us today. It is about ensuring that we have the conditions for the next Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), the next Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the next Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to grow and prosper.</p><p>MUI: The companies argue that they actually encourage innovation, not stifle it. And they say they face intense competition for their products here at home and around the world. The one thing these hearings made clear is that the battle between big tech and Washington is far from over.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: So when all is said and done, what kind of regulations and/or restrictions are we likely to see imposed on these tech giants?</p><p>Joining us is John Freeman. He`s technology analyst at CFRA Research.</p><p>John, good to see you. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>JOHN FREEMAN, CFRA RESEARCH TECH ANALYST: Bill, thank you for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You think it will be modest to use that term. What do you think is going to happen? Describe it.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I think the first sort of effort will be modest. There will be some sort of oversight I think is the most likely outcome.</p><p>But the scary thing is that they are writing legislation -- or, you know, they`re considering writing new legislation specifically for social networks. So, this is not as much an antitrust issue, a classic sort of antitrust issue as it is, you know, curtailing the political power and influence that particularly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has, because I think that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) really has kind of, you know, separated from the pack in terms of the scrutiny that legislators have on them.</p><p>SOLOMON: And would you say that other players in this space are watching sort of how Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reacts? Because as you said, it does seem like regulators are honing in on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) specifically.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think they`re watching, but I think the thing about Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is it is relatively new to the lobbying game. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), apple, even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been doing it a little bit longer, and I think they`re a little bit better at it.</p><p>I think the Libra announcement, just the timing of it, you know, now you`re going to give, you know, nefarious actors the ability to manipulate the next election anonymously with money that, you know, they don`t have to launder. You can see the political engine getting under there that way.</p><p>So, I think that`s one of the reasons why Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has sort of more scrutiny on it.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now, we all know that these kinds of companies -- you know, the companies that have been at the forefront of technology, cutting-edge technology for the last several years, have been leading this market higher. Now they`re getting this scrutiny from Washington.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Does that cap that growth do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I think every -- I think for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), I think it is built in or, you know, the light -- some sort of light regulation is built in. I think it is maybe even built in a little bit for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) as well, but perhaps not the more disastrous outcome for, say, example rewriting the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which means that both Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would actually have to be responsible.</p><p>They could be liable for, you know -- they could be liable for libel. They would have to be responsible for their content, which wouldn`t be practical. But, you know, that`s kind of he sort of worst case scenario. Most of the investors I talk with have kind of built that in, but they are concerned about regulations. That`s the questions that come out, is mostly about regulation with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) right now.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Indeed. John Freeman with CFRA Research -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>FREEMAN: Bill, thank you. Take care.</p><p>SOLOMON: Charles Schwab beats the street and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The discount broker was helped by nearly 400,000 new customer accounts last quarter. The firm now has now 12 million active accounts. The rose up more than 3 percent to $41.63.</p><p>And in an SEC filing, KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) said it discovered fraud that could cost it $90 million. The bank said the fraudulent activity involved one of its business customers and it happened at the start of the third quarter. The company believes it was an isolated incident and says it`s working with law enforcement. KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) fell more than 1 percent to $17.38.</p><p>CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom (NYSE:VIA) reportedly set a deadline to agree on a merger. CNBC says the media companies have settled on August 8th, also on that day, both CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom (NYSE:VIA) will report second quarter earnings. CBS (NYSE:CBS) rose a fraction to $53.51. Viacom (NYSE:VIA) fell more than 1 percent to $35.72.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Canadian Specific topped analyst estimates. thanks to an increase in oil, chemicals and plastic shipments. The railroad operator also lowered its costs for the quarter. The stock rose nearly 4 percent today to $246.27.</p><p>Domino`s reported the slowest same-store sales they`ve seen in three years as it expands its store base and faces increased competition from food delivery services. The company has increased the number of locations as a way to compete with those companies. But analysts say the expansion may be cannibalizing sales at existing locations, so shares fell more than 8 percent today to $246.54.</p><p>And after the bell, CSX (NYSE:CSX) reported lower than expected earnings and revenue. The company saw an increase in its merchandise shipments like vehicles and apparel, but that was offset by declines in its container shipments. Shares initially dropped in after hours trading tonight, but they did close the regular session up more than 1 percent to $79.55.</p><p>And late today, the Department of Justice asked an appeals court to pause its antitrust ruling against Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). About one month ago, you might recall a judge ruled that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) illegally suppressed competition in the market for smartphone chips. Shares rose in initial after hours trading on news. It closed the regulation session at $75.67.</p><p>SOLOMON: And coming up, no ads, no problem. Companies are using a different marketing strategy to target binge watchers.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>SOLOMON: IKEA is shutting down its one American factory. The company plans to move operations to Europe due to raw material costs that it says are higher here in the U.S. IKEA says shifting the work to Europe and importing the goods will make its furniture in North America more affordable. The Danville, Virginia plant employs 300 workers.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reports earnings tomorrow, but tonight, we`re going to take a look at how this company has changed the way we watch TV and the way companies advertise.</p><p>Here is Julia Boorstin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Netflix`s roughly 150 million subscribers bingeing with no commercial breaks has pushed advertisers to find new ways to reach viewers glued to ad-free platforms. One example is new Coke. Its featured in Netflix`s original series \"Stranger Things\". With Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) bringing back limited edition Coke cans for sale, turning the company`s infamous failure into a new marketing opportunity.</p><p>The streamer says none of the many brands mentioned in \"Stranger Things\" are paid for but they offer Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) valuable promotion.</p><p>TOM MEYER, THE MARKETING ARM PRESIDENT OF ENTERTAINMENT: In today`s world, the streamers have adopted the old movie, you know, technique and are working directly with brands who get product placement integration, but then they also promote the show in advertising, on digital, on their social channels, et cetera. So that`s building an audience for the show and that`s what the streamers want.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Promotional partnerships also happen off screen. For \"Stranger Things\", Baskin Robbins created eight flavors and collectible containers tied to the show, for its largest partnership and its first with the streaming platform.</p><p>And it`s not just Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Hulu is paid to feature Miller Coors beer in 10 episodes of its \"Into the Dark\" series. Hulu says brand integrations work better than 30-second spots in the platform, delivering a nearly 90 percent increase in purchase intent among viewers and a 75 percent increase in brand awareness.</p><p>And to break through the clutter, some big brands are returning to the original TV ad model, paying to produce shows and documentaries in an effort to reach consumers with content rather than the ads that interrupt it. Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is sponsoring a National Geographic TV series on efforts to combat extreme poverty, looking to align its products with efforts for good.</p><p>NANCY SMITH, ANALYTIC PARTNERS CEO: Brands like P&amp;G and others are going to benefit from having those. It is expensive, and that`s really where the challenge comes in is, is the expense not too high, such that the return is achievable?</p><p>BOORSTIN: Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) financed a documentary about nurses in the early days of the AIDS epidemic. The brand hoping for a halo effect from the film`s message of compassion and rave reviews.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOLOMON: And before we go, let`s take a final look at the day on Wall Street. The Dow fell 23 points, the Nasdaq was down 35, and the S&amp;P 500 was lower by 10.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Rahel Solomon. Thanks for watching.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) misses big, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls short -- but are tech stocks still worth owning as the Dow and S&amp;P are at historic highs?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Detroit bankrupt. The city filed for Chapter 9 protection, making it the largest city in U.S. history to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And, Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) drama. Today was supposed to be the day Dell`s future was decided but a key shareholder vote was delayed. So, what happens next?</p><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, July 18th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Welcome, everyone. And good evening.</p><p>It is the heart of earning season and tonight, we heard from two of the biggest names in technology. That would be Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>Seema Mody is here to break down numbers for us, which weren`t so hot.</p><p>Let`s start with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Let`s start with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: Oh, all right. Great.</p><p>MODY: It`s reported (INAUDIBLE) -- it`s reported a huge miss on the bottom line with fourth quarter earnings with 66 cents a share, versus an analyst estimate of 75 cents. Revenues also came in weak. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been hurt by ongoing weakness in the P.C. market and the ongoing consumer shift to tablets.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO (ph) Amy Hood says, \"While our fourth quarter results were impacted by the decline in the P.C. market, we continue to see strong demand for our enterprise and Cloud offerings.\"</p><p>One bright spot, Microsoft`s entertainment and device business, which includes Xbox game console. That business saw a 7.5 percent jump in sales. Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) while down after hours still up about 30 percent year-to-date.</p><p>Now, Tyler, on to that tech giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which reported a huge miss, posting a quarterly profit of $3.2 billion up from $2.8 million. Total revenue grew 19 percent to $14.1 billion, but that did not satisfy Wall Street.</p><p>Another key number analysts looked for, cost per click, that`s the average price that charges advertisers every time someone clicks on their ad on a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) web search engine. That dropped year over year.</p><p>On the conference call, CEO Larry Page talked about how when Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) started, they were just dealing one ecosystem, the P.C. Now, there are many devices, platforms and spaces to really penetrate and how that`s not only a challenge but also an opportunity for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Seema, thank you very much.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it doesn`t matter which one you begin with. Thanks very much, Seema Mody.</p><p>All right. Joining us now to react to the numbers, Skip Aylesworth. He`s co-portfolio manager of the Hennessey Technology Fund.</p><p>Mr. Aylesworth, welcome.</p><p>Take your choice, which one do you want to start with here, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and what did you think?</p><p>SKIP AYLESWORTH, HENNESSY TECHNOLOGY FUND: Well, on the big picture, probably a little disappointed in both. Let`s look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), though, because I think when you peel back the numbers here, there were some positive things for the future. One of those is research and development are Cap X, which is an expense, which kept revenues down or profits down. For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), up about 30 percent this quarter. So, an additional $400 million spend on R&amp;D and Cap X.</p><p>Second major issue of a positive nature is the head count shrunk, almost 9,000 employees.</p><p>These are two positive elements for the future.</p><p>On the negative side --</p><p>GHARIB: I --</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Go ahead.</p><p>GHARIB: I was going to jump in, Skip, and ask you about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). What happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and especially just coming off of this massive reorganization that they announced last week, they have all of these product offerings.</p><p>Do you see anything here that says that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a vision for where they are going for growth?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Well, I think as the CEO said, it`s in these new services, Cloud-based organizations -- Cloud-based offerings. What`s really hurting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), of course, is it`s relying on the PC and windows environment -- much like the story of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) to a certain extent and HP. So they hurt on that but are trying to turn the ship around and go down these other paths to generate new sources of revenues.</p><p>MATHISEN: Skip, both of the stocks have had pretty nice runs so far this year. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at one point was one of the leading stocks in the Dow so far this year.</p><p>Would you buy either of these stocks at today`s prices?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: I think that -- well, from an individual standpoint, it`s really -- your focus on the future, and I would be more positive on the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) side than I would be on the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) side.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. --</p><p>AYLESWORTH: So I would buy the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>GHARIB: You would buy Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and I know you have Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in your portfolio.</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Yes.</p><p>GHARIB: Would you buy it at $873? Do they buy more?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: I would -- any time you have a price decline like there was aftermarket, it`s a good time to add to positions, as long as you have a long-term outlook.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Real quickly, we`ve seen the stock market hitting all these new highs, but the technology stocks have been holding back a bit. Just, generally, on tech stocks, you run a tech fund. What is your view what`s going on with tech overall?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Well, on the big tech names, it`s very hard to see this consistent growth just because the numbers are so large for both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). A little shift of, quote, \"a billion dollars\" is just a small percentage.</p><p>I think the opportunities and the small cap sector will provide and might be more rewarding from an appreciation standing.</p><p>The overall environment, you know, technology is the key for productivity increases and everybody likes the greatest and best new widgets. So, we`re all awaiting Apple`s next product.</p><p>MATHISEN: Mr. Aylesworth, thank you very much.</p><p>Skip Aylesworth runs the Hennessy Technology Fund.</p><p>GHARIB: New records on Wall Street today. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 posted fresh all time highs, thanks to another batch of positive news on earnings and a drop in jobless claims. Investors were also encouraged by more reassuring words from Ben Bernanke. In day two his testimony on Capitol Hill, the Federal Reserve chairman told Senate lawmakers that the Fed will continue stimulating the U.S. economy as long as necessary.</p><p>By the closing bell, the Dow rose 78 points to 15,549. That`s the new record. The NASDAQ added about a point, and the S&amp;P was up 8 1/2 points to 16.89.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, Susie, the city of Detroit has just become the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy. The city`s state-appointed emergency manager, Kevin Orr, asked a federal judge for permission to place the insolvent city in Chapter 9 protection.</p><p>Scott Cohn is with us with more on what that bankruptcy filing means for the city and its residents and for its creditors.</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: And for the nation, Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: Right.</p><p>COHN: This is a major event.</p><p>Detroit, you know, once had 1.8 million residents. Now, it has less than half that. It was the cradle of American manufacturing. Today, a shell of its former self, with vacant homes, blighted neighborhood, and an unemployment rate in the metropolitan area of 9 percent, much higher in the city proper.</p><p>Kevin Orr is the emergency manager appointed by the state to handle Detroit`s long festering fiscal woes. He had tried to reach an agreement with creditors to stave off this bankruptcy. He could not.</p><p>Michigan Governor Rick Snyder who appointed Orr called this decision painful but says there was no other valuable option.</p><p>Detroit, as you heard, is the largest American city ever to file for bankruptcy -- in fact, by far the largest. Its long-term debt as high as $20 billion and not a lot of --</p><p>(CROSSDTASLK)</p><p>MATHISEN: So what do the creditors stand to lose on this? Often there is a restructuring. They get paid off at pennies on the dollar. Do we have any idea?</p><p>COHN: We don`t. A federal judge first has to approve this. This was a request to go into the Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which is the municipal branch, just to speak of --</p><p>MATHISEN: A corporate bankruptcy.</p><p>COHN: Right.</p><p>So the judge has to go throw a three-month process in approving this, and then there`s a whole reorganization plan they will have to work out agreements that they couldn`t up to now with all the creditors including the pensioners.</p><p>GHARIB: This is just so shocking, that something like that is happening in the United States. And, you know, we`ve heard about state finances in trouble, city`s finances in trouble. Is Detroit a one-time unique situation, or will we be hearing this about another major cities.</p><p>COHN: Well, you know, there has been a lot of talk about that for a while, since the financial crisis. Detroit for 40 years has been a place of extremes. Extreme racial strife, white flight, decline of the manufacturing base.</p><p>So, in a lot of ways, it isn`t extreme, but maybe a cautionary tale. You know, this city that has had all of the issues that any municipality has had in terms of dealing with labor cost, dealing with pension cost, dealing with the decline in housing base. And so, other cities have to take a look at this.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, it`s very interesting two of the largest bankruptcies we`ve had in the corporate world in recent years were in Detroit, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler. Those companies came out on the other side much, much stronger.</p><p>Can that happen for Detroit?</p><p>COHN: That certainly is the hope. And all the comments you`re hearing now as this long-feared bankruptcy filing has finally happened are -- you know, Detroit will come out of this. Maybe this is -- this is something that even the people who were opposing this for the longest time seem to be conceding that it was necessary, that this was a necessary step.</p><p>Now, under bankruptcy, the whole purpose of the bankruptcy law is to allow the city to get out from under its debts, meet obligations with its creditors, reorganize and move on. And that`s the goal here.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Scott Cohn, thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s hope that happens.</p><p>Meanwhile, some wind was taken out of the sails of the Windy City today, too. Ratings agency Moody`s Investors Services lowered Chicago`s general obligation bond and sales tax ratings by three notches, citing the city`s large and growing pension liabilities and budget pressures. The credit downgrade affects $8.2 billion of Chicago`s bonds and sales stocks debt. Moody also says the outlook on the city is negative.</p><p>MATHISEN: Another twist in the long battle to take over Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), where shareholders were scheduled to vote today on the future of the company. But that didn`t happen. So, what do shareholders think and what is next for the world`s number three PC maker?</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has more from Dell`s headquarters in Round Rock, Texas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINES REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A vote on Michael Dell`s $24.4 billion deal with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners to take Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) private at $13.65 a share adjourned until next Wednesday. This as investor Carl Icahn and Southeastern Asset Management have put forth a competing proposal, one that keeps Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) public and values the company at $15.50 to $18 a share.</p><p>The pros for the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal, if the founder and CEO is the right person to lead the turnout, privately, without Wall Street scrutiny.</p><p>But Icahn`s camp says that Dell`s offer undervalues the company, and analysts wonder if the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) offer isn`t opportunistic.</p><p>BRENT WILSEY, WILSEY ASSET MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Carl Icahn says, no, we can turn this company around publicly and shareholders will win from this. So I like Carl Icahn`s plan much better than do Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) because Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is just -- yes, the company will turn around, he`ll be well off from two years from now, but why can`t the shareholders benefit from that?</p><p>DEANGELIS: Roughly 300-plus investors attended the meeting today at Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) headquarters in Round Rock, Texas. Some concerned about the adjournment and that it could send shares tumbling.</p><p>NORM PETERS, DELL SHAREHOLDER: I`m now worried and concerned, and realistically concerned. Yes, it`s going to have an impact that there are thousands of us out there waiting to see what`s going to happen because there is an option for us to make more money than the $13.65 that he`s offering us at this point.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Carl Icahn and Southeastern taking their own view on today`s development, saying in a statement, \"We believe that this delay reflects the unhappiness of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) stockholders with the Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)/Silver Lake offer, which we believe substantially undervalues the company. This is not time to delay but the time to move Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) forward.\"</p><p>(on camera): Investors came here today looking for a decision. But all they got was more uncertainty. Will Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) sweeten his offer and get his deal passed next week or will shareholders be reviewing Carl Icahn`s offer at the annual meeting?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: A sigh of relief for Boeing (NYSE:BA) in the wake of a fire on board one of its 787 Dreamliners last week in London. Now, British aviation investigators are recommending that an emergency locating transmitter found on those aircraft made by Honeywell, not Boeing (NYSE:BA), be disabled.</p><p>MATHISEN: Earnings dominate tonight`s \"Market Focus\" and we begin with United Healthcare. The Dow component and the nation`s largest health insurers signed up almost 10 million new members and fewer people filed claims. That`s a good recipe and that boosted quarterly revenues and profits. They beat analysts` estimates.</p><p>The company also increased its outlook for the year. Let`s take a look at UNH shares, biggest gainers in the Dow, surging 6.5 percent today.</p><p>Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) reported a billion-dollar profit and said it plans to buyback 500 million shares, first since 2008. Revenue grew in all major businesses, trading in particular. The stock finished the day up 4 percent to $27.70.</p><p>And it was a case of good news/bad news for Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the nation`s largest wireless carrier. First, let`s give you the good news. It activated more iPhones than expected in the last quarter. And now the bad -- the company saw some weakness in it`s traditional wire line unit, which pressured overall revenue. And separately, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is joining rivals AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile instituting an installment plan for customers who want to update their devices every year instead of current plan of every two years.</p><p>The stock finishing today lower by 1 1/2 percent. It closed at $49.97.</p><p>GHARIB: It was a tough day for Sherwin Williams. The paint maker reported disappointing second quarter results, issued a weak outlook for the current quarter and said that Mexican regulators rejected the bid to buy a paint company in that country. The stock plunged 8 percent to $167.94.</p><p>And earnings at Scholastic (NASDAQ:SCHL) tumbled 62 percent. This publisher of children`s book is blaming weak sales of \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy and lower book club revenue per order. Next year, the company plans to focus on new educational technology program for the iPad, which it hopes will increase revenue.</p><p>Meanwhile, the stock was off by more than 8 percent today, to $29 and change.</p><p>MATHISEN: And still ahead, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) facing a record fine - - the allegation it manipulated energy markets, but it is the only firm accused recently of wrongdoing. Is there any way to stop businesses from behaving badly?</p><p>But, first, a look at how the international markets closed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase now faces what could be the biggest fine ever to settle allegations that it manipulated electricity markets in the Midwest and California. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is close to an agreement with the New York bank. That could mean a fine of nearly a half billion. But remember, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) made $6 billion in profit last quarter. So, a half billion-dollar fine would be less than 10 percent of one quarter`s profits.</p><p>Some legal experts say fines for misconduct need to get a lot bigger to deter corporate misbehavior, of which there has seemingly been a lot lately.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): What`s a $500 million fine or settlement to a company the size of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase? Not so much says attorney Melissa Maxman.</p><p>MELISSA MAXMAN, ATTORNEY: If the fines are astronomical at this point, on the other hand, the companies better being find astronomical amounts can afford it.</p><p>MATHISEN: Maxman has seen both sides. Once a federal prosecutor, she now defends companies accused of behaving badly.</p><p>MAXMAN: Sometimes companies do decide, make a financial decision to disregard a law or break a law, because it`s in their financial interest to do it, and sometimes just as we all have done in the past, maybe in school or otherwise, you know, we think we won`t get caught.</p><p>MATHISEN: But increasingly, they are, all around the globe.</p><p>Last year, British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty and agreed to U.S. civil and criminal penalties for $3 billion for unlawfully promoting prescription drugs among other offenses. It was the largest healthcare fraud settlement in history.</p><p>That was 1/3 of the record $9 billion in settlements negotiated by the federal government in 2012, nearly triple the recoveries in 2011, and 50 percent more than the previous record hold back in 2006.</p><p>Just this year, BP was sentenced in January to pay $4 billion, a record for an environmental crime stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf.</p><p>RBS Securities Japan agreed to pay $50 million fine in connection with the rigging of LIBOR rates, bringing the RBS and RBS Japan totals in that case alone to $612 million.</p><p>And in May, Walmart pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and was sentenced to pay a fine of more than $81 million.</p><p>Fines for antitrust and price-fixing allegations like the one JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase faces have grown the most in resent years, topping $5 billion in 2012.</p><p>And still says University of Baltimore law professor, Bob Lande, companies are willing to take the risk. Lande, along with co-author John Connor from Perdue, says we only catch about 25 percent of the market manipulators and at that rate, he says fines need to be five times what they have been. Lande also says people tied to fix pricing and other violations should be banned from their industries for life. That might be a deterrent.</p><p>But attorney Maxman figures her practice will stay busy no matter what.</p><p>MAXMAN; As long as profit maximization is going to be a primary motivator of a corporation, there will be incentives to bend the rules, cut corners.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Lawmakers are close to a deal that would lower the rate on new subsidized student loans just weeks after allowing them to double to 6.8 percent. A bipartisan would reverse that rate hike on new Stafford loans that went into effect on July 1st. So, if it passes, undergraduates will be able to borrow at a rate of 3.9 percent, graduate students at 4.9 percent, and parents can borrow at 6.4 percent.</p><p>And coming up on the program, hedge fund manager John Paulson famously bet against housing before the bust. Now, he`s calling it the best investment anyone can make. But is it?</p><p>But, first, let`s take a look at home commodities, treasuries and currencies performed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: The housing market has been red hot lately, and that may be why a California builder decided to go public on Wall Street. UCP began selling stock to the public for the first time today on the New York Stock Exchange. It`s the fourth home builder to go public this year.</p><p>But UCP is off to a disappointing start. Its shares tumbled nearly 7 percent.</p><p>Looking at the three other homebuilders that also went public this year, William Lyon and Tri Pointe are trading below their IPO prices. But Taylor Morrison up about 14 percent.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, despite those disappointing IPOs, many investors are still bullish on housing. And one of them is the hedge fund manager John Paulson, who made more than a billion betting against the housing industry just before it collapsed, but it`s now talking up housing in a big way. Listen to what he said yesterday about individual investment in housing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN PAULSON, PAULSON &amp; CO: I still feel buying a home is the best investment any individual can make. Affordability is still at an all-time high. It still costs less to own a home after tax than it does to rent.</p><p>So, if anyone bought a home last year, let`s say for $100, you put down $20. Today, that home is worth $112. So you made $12 on a $20 investment, 60 percent return.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB: So, is John Paulson right on housing?</p><p>Our next guest disagrees. He`s Yale`s economics professor Robert Shiller, who is also the co-founder of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index.</p><p>Professor Shiller, so nice to have you on the program again. And really want to get your point of view of why you disagree with John Paulson.</p><p>ROBERT SHILLER, CASE-SHILLER INDEX CO-FOUNDER: I don`t totally disagree. I think that home prices are moving up and they might for someone with a flipping plan whose going to get out, it might -- it might be an attractive investment.</p><p>But I think most people are not in that category. Most people are thinking of buy and hold. And for the longer run, I don`t -- I don`t think housing is a good investment, unless you want the house.</p><p>MATHISEN: So you think that in the short-term, if I`m going to flip the house, it`s a better deal than in the long term if I`m going to stay there and own the house.</p><p>Without wading too deeply into the numbers, explain why.</p><p>SHILLER: Well, professional investors like John Paulson are very aware of anomalies in markets. One of them is momentum. It`s been remarked in the stock market, I`m sure he knows that very well. It`s also in the housing market.</p><p>And it has been much stronger in the housing market than in the stock market. So when home prices start going up, they will probably go -- I wrote a paper about this 20 years ago. It`s really true. Home prices move in the same direction.</p><p>They`re up 12 percent nationally in the last year. And so, they`ll probably do something like that again for a year or so.</p><p>GHARIB: We`ve been raised to believe that, you know, our parents did this and the parents before them did this, that you buy a home, and you hold on to it and you`re set for retirement.</p><p>SHILLER: Right.</p><p>GHARIB: And then we had the housing crisis. So, I get that.</p><p>But are you saying that going forward that that rule of thumb no longer exists? I mean, what really changed here?</p><p>SHILLER: Well, it -- it -- if you want a home and you want to live there, fine. It`s -- you know, Paulson is right. There is a tax advantage to homeownership.</p><p>But the question in my mind is are you going to buy a bigger home than you need as an investment or are you going to buy a second home and there - - I think that it`s not a good long-run prospect because historically, housing has not increased above the inflation rate. Home prices are down - - now, there`s a big misperception that houses are cheap now. They`re not generally cheap. They`re just kind of back to an average level.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, your argument, basically, if I`m understanding you correctly, is after inflation basis, you`re not going to make money owning a home?</p><p>SHILLER: The dividend comes in the form of a nice place to sleep, a family room, you know, a place --</p><p>MATHISEN: You get value from that. Yes, right.</p><p>SHILLER: That`s it. Don`t expect capital gain.</p><p>Now, it is true that mortgage rates are still very low and I think of it more as a mortgage market play that might be enticing people in for the longer term.</p><p>If you really plan to stay in a house for 30 years, you can get a 30- year mortgage rate that`s still a little over 4 percent. That`s very good by historical standards.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Interesting conversation, thank you so much Professor Shiller.</p><p>SHILLER: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: Robert Shiller of Yale University.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, television history was made today at the Emmy nominations. The political thriller \"House of Cards\" produced by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was nominated for best drama series, the first time a program that`s only available through an online streaming service was recognized by the television industry`s leading awards organization. \"House of Cards\" received nine nominations in all.</p><p>Also getting nominated, another popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) show, the situation comedy \"Arrested Development\" got three nods, including for series co-star Jason Bateman as best actor.</p><p>And before we go, which stocks would you like our market monitor guest to discuss tomorrow? You can let us know by logging on to our Web site, NBR.com and don`t forget to include where you are from.</p><p>GHARIB: And next week, we also begin a five-part series on how to not outlive your money. So please join us for that and I guess you can`t count on your home --</p><p>MATHISEN: To bail you out.</p><p>GHARIB: Yes, to bail you out according to Professor Shiller.</p><p>MATHISEN: You`re going to be off tomorrow. Have a nice day off.</p><p>GHARIB: Thanks.</p><p>MATHISEN: Nice long weekend. Survive the heat.</p><p>GHARIB: And I`ll be back on Monday.</p><p>But that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me as well. Have a great evening. Stay cool, everybody.

Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) misses big, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls short -- but are tech  stocks still worth owning as the Dow and S&amp;P are at historic highs?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Detroit bankrupt.   The city filed for Chapter 9 protection, making it the largest city in U.S.  history to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GHARIB:  And, Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) drama.  Today was supposed to be the  day Dell's future was decided but a key shareholder vote was delayed.  So,  what happens next?</p><p>  We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Thursday, July 18th. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Welcome, everyone.  And good evening.</p><p>  It is the heart of earning season and tonight, we heard from two of  the biggest names in technology.  That would be Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). </p><p>  Seema Mody is here to break down numbers for us, which weren't so hot. </p><p>  Let's start with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). </p><p>  SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Let's start with  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tyler. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Oh, all right.  Great. </p><p>  MODY:  It's reported (INAUDIBLE) -- it's reported a huge miss on the  bottom line with fourth quarter earnings with 66 cents a share, versus an  analyst estimate of 75 cents.  Revenues also came in weak.  Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been hurt by ongoing weakness in the P.C. market and the  ongoing consumer shift to tablets. </p><p>  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO (ph) Amy Hood says, \"While our fourth  quarter results were impacted by the decline in the P.C. market, we  continue to see strong demand for our enterprise and Cloud offerings.\"</p><p>  One bright spot, Microsoft's entertainment and device business, which  includes Xbox game console.  That business saw a 7.5 percent jump in sales.   Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) while down after hours still up about 30  percent year-to-date. </p><p>  Now, Tyler, on to that tech giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which reported  a huge miss, posting a quarterly profit of $3.2 billion up from $2.8  million.  Total revenue grew 19 percent to $14.1 billion, but that did not  satisfy Wall Street. </p><p>  Another key number analysts looked for, cost per click, that's the  average price that charges advertisers every time someone clicks on their  ad on a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) web search engine.  That dropped year over  year. </p><p>  On the conference call, CEO Larry Page talked about how when Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) started, they were just dealing one ecosystem, the P.C.  Now,  there are many devices, platforms and spaces to really penetrate and how  that's not only a challenge but also an opportunity for Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  Seema, thank you very much.</p><p>  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it doesn't matter which  one you begin with.  Thanks very much, Seema Mody.</p><p>  All right.  Joining us now to react to the numbers, Skip Aylesworth.   He's co-portfolio manager of the Hennessey Technology Fund. </p><p>  Mr. Aylesworth, welcome.</p><p>  Take your choice, which one do you want to start with here, Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and what did you think? </p><p>  SKIP AYLESWORTH, HENNESSY TECHNOLOGY FUND:  Well, on the big picture,  probably a little disappointed in both.  Let's look at Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), though, because I think when you peel back the numbers here,  there were some positive things for the future.  One of those is research  and development are Cap X, which is an expense, which kept revenues down or  profits down.  For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), up about 30 percent this quarter.   So, an additional $400 million spend on R&amp;D and Cap X. </p><p>  Second major issue of a positive nature is the head count shrunk,  almost 9,000 employees. </p><p>  These are two positive elements for the future. </p><p>  On the negative side --  </p><p>  GHARIB:  I --  </p><p>  AYLESWORTH:  Go ahead. </p><p>  GHARIB:  I was going to jump in, Skip, and ask you about Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT).  What happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and especially  just coming off of this massive reorganization that they announced last  week, they have all of these product offerings. </p><p>  Do you see anything here that says that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a  vision for where they are going for growth?</p><p>  AYLESWORTH:  Well, I think as the CEO said, it's in these new  services, Cloud-based organizations -- Cloud-based offerings.  What's  really hurting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), of course, is it's relying on the  PC and windows environment -- much like the story of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) to  a certain extent and HP.  So they hurt on that but are trying to turn the  ship around and go down these other paths to generate new sources of  revenues. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Skip, both of the stocks have had pretty nice runs so far  this year.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at one point was one of the leading  stocks in the Dow so far this year. </p><p>  Would you buy either of these stocks at today's prices?</p><p>  AYLESWORTH:  I think that -- well, from an individual standpoint, it's  really -- your focus on the future, and I would be more positive on the  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) side than I would be on the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  side.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  All right.  --  </p><p>  AYLESWORTH:  So I would buy the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). </p><p>  GHARIB:  You would buy Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and I know you have Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) in your portfolio.</p><p>  AYLESWORTH:  Yes.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Would you buy it at $873?  Do they buy more? </p><p>  AYLESWORTH:  I would -- any time you have a price decline like there  was aftermarket, it's a good time to add to positions, as long as you have  a long-term outlook. </p><p>  GHARIB:  All right.  Real quickly, we've seen the stock market hitting  all these new highs, but the technology stocks have been holding back a  bit.  Just, generally, on tech stocks, you run a tech fund.  What is your  view what's going on with tech overall? </p><p>  AYLESWORTH:  Well, on the big tech names, it's very hard to see this  consistent growth just because the numbers are so large for both Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  A little shift of, quote, \"a  billion dollars\" is just a small percentage. </p><p>  I think the opportunities and the small cap sector will provide and  might be more rewarding from an appreciation standing. </p><p>  The overall environment, you know, technology is the key for  productivity increases and everybody likes the greatest and best new  widgets.  So, we're all awaiting Apple's next product.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Mr. Aylesworth, thank you very much.</p><p>  Skip Aylesworth runs the Hennessy Technology Fund.</p><p>  GHARIB:  New records on Wall Street today.  The Dow and S&amp;P 500 posted  fresh all time highs, thanks to another batch of positive news on earnings  and a drop in jobless claims.  Investors were also encouraged by more  reassuring words from Ben Bernanke.  In day two his testimony on Capitol  Hill, the Federal Reserve chairman told Senate lawmakers that the Fed will  continue stimulating the U.S. economy as long as necessary. </p><p>  By the closing bell, the Dow rose 78 points to 15,549.  That's the new  record.  The NASDAQ added about a point, and the S&amp;P was up 8 1/2 points to  16.89. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Well, Susie, the city of Detroit has just become the  largest municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy.  The city's  state-appointed emergency manager, Kevin Orr, asked a federal judge for  permission to place the insolvent city in Chapter 9 protection. </p><p>  Scott Cohn is with us with more on what that bankruptcy filing means  for the city and its residents and for its creditors. </p><p>  SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  And for the  nation, Tyler. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Right.</p><p>  COHN:  This is a major event.</p><p>  Detroit, you know, once had 1.8 million residents.  Now, it has less  than half that.  It was the cradle of American manufacturing.  Today, a  shell of its former self, with vacant homes, blighted neighborhood, and an  unemployment rate in the metropolitan area of 9 percent, much higher in the  city proper. </p><p>  Kevin Orr is the emergency manager appointed by the state to handle  Detroit's long festering fiscal woes.  He had tried to reach an agreement  with creditors to stave off this bankruptcy.  He could not. </p><p>Michigan Governor Rick Snyder who appointed Orr called this decision  painful but says there was no other valuable option. </p><p>  Detroit, as you heard, is the largest American city ever to file for  bankruptcy -- in fact, by far the largest.  Its long-term debt as high as  $20 billion and not a lot of --  </p><p>  (CROSSDTASLK)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  So what do the creditors stand to lose on this?  Often  there is a restructuring.  They get paid off at pennies on the dollar.  Do  we have any idea?</p><p>  COHN:  We don't.  A federal judge first has to approve this.  This was  a request to go into the Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which is the municipal  branch, just to speak of --  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  A corporate bankruptcy.</p><p>  COHN:  Right. </p><p>  So the judge has to go throw a three-month process in approving this,  and then there's a whole reorganization plan they will have to work out  agreements that they couldn't up to now with all the creditors including  the pensioners. </p><p>  GHARIB:  This is just so shocking, that something like that is  happening in the United States.  And, you know, we've heard about state  finances in trouble, city's finances in trouble.  Is Detroit a one-time  unique situation, or will we be hearing this about another major cities.</p><p>  COHN:  Well, you know, there has been a lot of talk about that for a  while, since the financial crisis.  Detroit for 40 years has been a place  of extremes.  Extreme racial strife, white flight, decline of the  manufacturing base. </p><p>  So, in a lot of ways, it isn't extreme, but maybe a cautionary tale.   You know, this city that has had all of the issues that any municipality  has had in terms of dealing with labor cost, dealing with pension cost,  dealing with the decline in housing base.  And so, other cities have to  take a look at this. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  You know, it's very interesting two of the largest  bankruptcies we've had in the corporate world in recent years were in  Detroit, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler.  Those companies came out  on the other side much, much stronger. </p><p>  Can that happen for Detroit?</p><p>  COHN:  That certainly is the hope.  And all the comments you're  hearing now as this long-feared bankruptcy filing has finally happened are  -- you know, Detroit will come out of this.  Maybe this is -- this is  something that even the people who were opposing this for the longest time  seem to be conceding that it was necessary, that this was a necessary step. </p><p>  Now, under bankruptcy, the whole purpose of the bankruptcy law is to  allow the city to get out from under its debts, meet obligations with its  creditors, reorganize and move on.  And that's the goal here. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  Scott Cohn, thank you very much.  Appreciate  it.  </p><p>  GHARIB:  Let's hope that happens.  </p><p>  Meanwhile, some wind was taken out of the sails of the Windy City  today, too.  Ratings agency Moody's Investors Services lowered Chicago's  general obligation bond and sales tax ratings by three notches, citing the  city's large and growing pension liabilities and budget pressures.  The  credit downgrade affects $8.2 billion of Chicago's bonds and sales stocks  debt.  Moody also says the outlook on the city is negative. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Another twist in the long battle to take over Dell  (NASDAQ:DELL), where shareholders were scheduled to vote today on the  future of the company.  But that didn't happen.  So, what do shareholders  think and what is next for the world's number three PC maker? </p><p>  Jackie DeAngelis has more from Dell's headquarters in Round Rock,  Texas.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINES REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   A vote on Michael Dell's $24.4 billion deal with private equity firm Silver  Lake Partners to take Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) private at $13.65 a share  adjourned until next Wednesday.  This as investor Carl Icahn and  Southeastern Asset Management have put forth a competing proposal, one that  keeps Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) public and values the company at $15.50 to $18 a  share. </p><p>  The pros for the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal, if the founder and CEO is  the right person to lead the turnout, privately, without Wall Street  scrutiny.</p><p>  But Icahn's camp says that Dell's offer undervalues the company, and  analysts wonder if the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) offer isn't opportunistic. </p><p>  BRENT WILSEY, WILSEY ASSET MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT:  Carl Icahn says, no,  we can turn this company around publicly and shareholders will win from  this.  So I like Carl Icahn's plan much better than do Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)  because Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is just -- yes, the company will turn  around, he'll be well off from two years from now, but why can't the  shareholders benefit from that?</p><p>  DEANGELIS:  Roughly 300-plus investors attended the meeting today at  Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) headquarters in Round Rock, Texas.  Some concerned about  the adjournment and that it could send shares tumbling.</p><p>  NORM PETERS, DELL SHAREHOLDER:  I'm now worried and concerned, and  realistically concerned.  Yes, it's going to have an impact that there are  thousands of us out there waiting to see what's going to happen because  there is an option for us to make more money than the $13.65 that he's  offering us at this point. </p><p>  DEANGELIS:  Carl Icahn and Southeastern taking their own view on  today's development, saying in a statement, \"We believe that this delay  reflects the unhappiness of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) stockholders with the  Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)/Silver Lake offer, which we believe  substantially undervalues the company.  This is not time to delay but the  time to move Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) forward.\"</p><p>  (on camera):  Investors came here today looking for a decision.  But  all they got was more uncertainty.  Will Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) sweeten  his offer and get his deal passed next week or will shareholders be  reviewing Carl Icahn's offer at the annual meeting? </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  A sigh of relief for Boeing (NYSE:BA) in the wake of a fire  on board one of its 787 Dreamliners last week in London.  Now, British  aviation investigators are recommending that an emergency locating  transmitter found on those aircraft made by Honeywell, not Boeing  (NYSE:BA), be disabled.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Earnings dominate tonight's \"Market Focus\" and we begin  with United Healthcare.  The Dow component and the nation's largest health  insurers signed up almost 10 million new members and fewer people filed  claims.  That's a good recipe and that boosted quarterly revenues and  profits.  They beat analysts' estimates. </p><p>  The company also increased its outlook for the year.  Let's take a  look at UNH shares, biggest gainers in the Dow, surging 6.5 percent today. </p><p>  Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) reported a billion-dollar  profit and said it plans to buyback 500 million shares, first since 2008.   Revenue grew in all major businesses, trading in particular.  The stock  finished the day up 4 percent to $27.70. </p><p>  And it was a case of good news/bad news for Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the  nation's largest wireless carrier.  First, let's give you the good news.   It activated more iPhones than expected in the last quarter.  And now the  bad -- the company saw some weakness in it's traditional wire line unit,  which pressured overall revenue.  And separately, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is  joining rivals AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile instituting an installment plan  for customers who want to update their devices every year instead of  current plan of every two years. </p><p>  The stock finishing today lower by 1 1/2 percent.  It closed at  $49.97.</p><p>  GHARIB:  It was a tough day for Sherwin Williams.  The paint maker  reported disappointing second quarter results, issued a weak outlook for  the current quarter and said that Mexican regulators rejected the bid to  buy a paint company in that country.  The stock plunged 8 percent to  $167.94. </p><p>  And earnings at Scholastic (NASDAQ:SCHL) tumbled 62 percent.  This  publisher of children's book is blaming weak sales of \"The Hunger Games\"  trilogy and lower book club revenue per order.  Next year, the company  plans to focus on new educational technology program for the iPad, which it  hopes will increase revenue. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the stock was off by more than 8 percent today, to $29 and  change. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  And still ahead, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) facing a record fine - - the allegation it manipulated energy markets, but it is the only firm  accused recently of wrongdoing.  Is there any way to stop businesses from  behaving badly?</p><p>  But, first, a look at how the international markets closed today. </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase now faces what could be the  biggest fine ever to settle allegations that it manipulated electricity  markets in the Midwest and California.  The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission is close to an agreement with the New York bank.  That could  mean a fine of nearly a half billion.  But remember, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)  made $6 billion in profit last quarter.  So, a half billion-dollar fine  would be less than 10 percent of one quarter's profits. </p><p>  Some legal experts say fines for misconduct need to get a lot bigger  to deter corporate misbehavior, of which there has seemingly been a lot  lately. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN (voice-over):  What's a $500 million fine or settlement to a  company the size of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase?  Not so much says attorney  Melissa Maxman.</p><p>MELISSA MAXMAN, ATTORNEY:  If the fines are astronomical at this  point, on the other hand, the companies better being find astronomical  amounts can afford it. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Maxman has seen both sides.  Once a federal prosecutor, she  now defends companies accused of behaving badly. </p><p>  MAXMAN:  Sometimes companies do decide, make a financial decision to  disregard a law or break a law, because it's in their financial interest to  do it, and sometimes just as we all have done in the past, maybe in school  or otherwise, you know, we think we won't get caught. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  But increasingly, they are, all around the globe. </p><p>  Last year, British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty and agreed  to U.S. civil and criminal penalties for $3 billion for unlawfully  promoting prescription drugs among other offenses.  It was the largest  healthcare fraud settlement in history. </p><p>  That was 1/3 of the record $9 billion in settlements negotiated by the  federal government in 2012, nearly triple the recoveries in 2011, and 50  percent more than the previous record hold back in 2006. </p><p>  Just this year, BP was sentenced in January to pay $4 billion, a  record for an environmental crime stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon  spill in the Gulf.</p><p>  RBS Securities Japan agreed to pay $50 million fine in connection with  the rigging of LIBOR rates, bringing the RBS and RBS Japan totals in that  case alone to $612 million. </p><p>  And in May, Walmart pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act  and was sentenced to pay a fine of more than $81 million. </p><p>  Fines for antitrust and price-fixing allegations like the one JPMorgan  (NYSE:JPM) Chase faces have grown the most in resent years, topping $5  billion in 2012. </p><p>  And still says University of Baltimore law professor, Bob Lande,  companies are willing to take the risk.  Lande, along with co-author John  Connor from Perdue, says we only catch about 25 percent of the market  manipulators and at that rate, he says fines need to be five times what  they have been.  Lande also says people tied to fix pricing and other  violations should be banned from their industries for life. That might be a  deterrent. </p><p>  But attorney Maxman figures her practice will stay busy no matter  what. </p><p>  MAXMAN;  As long as profit maximization is going to be a primary  motivator of a corporation, there will be incentives to bend the rules, cut  corners. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  Lawmakers are close to a deal that would lower the rate on  new subsidized student loans just weeks after allowing them to double to  6.8 percent.  A bipartisan would reverse that rate hike on new Stafford  loans that went into effect on July 1st.  So, if it passes, undergraduates  will be able to borrow at a rate of 3.9 percent, graduate students at 4.9  percent, and parents can borrow at 6.4 percent.</p><p>  And coming up on the program, hedge fund manager John Paulson famously  bet against housing before the bust.  Now, he's calling it the best  investment anyone can make.  But is it?</p><p>  But, first, let's take a look at home commodities, treasuries and  currencies performed today.</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  GHARIB:  The housing market has been red hot lately, and that may be  why a California builder decided to go public on Wall Street.  UCP began  selling stock to the public for the first time today on the New York Stock  Exchange.  It's the fourth home builder to go public this year. </p><p>  But UCP is off to a disappointing start.  Its shares tumbled nearly 7  percent. </p><p>  Looking at the three other homebuilders that also went public this  year, William Lyon and Tri Pointe are trading below their IPO prices.  But  Taylor Morrison up about 14 percent.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Well, despite those disappointing IPOs, many investors are  still bullish on housing.  And one of them is the hedge fund manager John  Paulson, who made more than a billion betting against the housing industry  just before it collapsed, but it's now talking up housing in a big way.   Listen to what he said yesterday about individual investment in housing. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  JOHN PAULSON, PAULSON &amp; CO:  I still feel buying a home is the best  investment any individual can make.  Affordability is still at an all-time  high.  It still costs less to own a home after tax than it does to rent. </p><p>  So, if anyone bought a home last year, let's say for $100, you put  down $20.  Today, that home is worth $112.  So you made $12 on a $20  investment, 60 percent return. </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  GHARIB:  So, is John Paulson right on housing? </p><p>  Our next guest disagrees.  He's Yale's economics professor Robert  Shiller, who is also the co-founder of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. </p><p>  Professor Shiller, so nice to have you on the program again.  And  really want to get your point of view of why you disagree with John  Paulson. </p><p>  ROBERT SHILLER, CASE-SHILLER INDEX CO-FOUNDER:  I don't totally  disagree.  I think that home prices are moving up and they might for  someone with a flipping plan whose going to get out, it might -- it might  be an attractive investment. </p><p>  But I think most people are not in that category.  Most people are  thinking of buy and hold.  And for the longer run, I don't -- I don't think  housing is a good investment, unless you want the house. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  So you think that in the short-term, if I'm going to flip  the house, it's a better deal than in the long term if I'm going to stay  there and own the house. </p><p>  Without wading too deeply into the numbers, explain why.</p><p>  SHILLER:  Well, professional investors like John Paulson are very  aware of anomalies in markets.  One of them is momentum.  It's been  remarked in the stock market, I'm sure he knows that very well.  It's also  in the housing market.</p><p>  And it has been much stronger in the housing market than in the stock  market.   So when home prices start going up, they will probably go -- I  wrote a paper about this 20 years ago.  It's really true.  Home prices move  in the same direction.</p><p>  They're up 12 percent nationally in the last year.  And so, they'll  probably do something like that again for a year or so. </p><p>  GHARIB:  We've been raised to believe that, you know, our parents did  this and the parents before them did this, that you buy a home, and you  hold on to it and you're set for retirement. </p><p>  SHILLER:  Right. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And then we had the housing crisis.  So, I get that. </p><p>  But are you saying that going forward that that rule of thumb no  longer exists?  I mean, what really changed here? </p><p>  SHILLER:  Well, it -- it -- if you want a home and you want to live  there, fine.  It's -- you know, Paulson is right.  There is a tax advantage  to homeownership. </p><p>  But the question in my mind is are you going to buy a bigger home than  you need as an investment or are you going to buy a second home and there - - I think that it's not a good long-run prospect because historically,  housing has not increased above the inflation rate.  Home prices are down - - now, there's a big misperception that houses are cheap now.  They're not  generally cheap.  They're just kind of back to an average level. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  So, your argument, basically, if I'm understanding you  correctly, is after inflation basis, you're not going to make money owning  a home?</p><p>  SHILLER:  The dividend comes in the form of a nice place to sleep, a  family room, you know, a place --  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  You get value from that.  Yes, right.</p><p>  SHILLER:  That's it.  Don't expect capital gain. </p><p>  Now, it is true that mortgage rates are still very low and I think of  it more as a mortgage market play that might be enticing people in for the  longer term. </p><p>  If you really plan to stay in a house for 30 years, you can get a 30- year mortgage rate that's still a little over 4 percent.  That's very good  by historical standards. </p><p>  GHARIB:  All right.  Interesting conversation, thank you so much  Professor Shiller. </p><p>  SHILLER:  Thank you.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Robert Shiller of Yale University.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Well, television history was made today at the Emmy  nominations.  The political thriller \"House of Cards\" produced by Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) was nominated for best drama series, the first time a program  that's only available through an online streaming service was recognized by  the television industry's leading awards organization.  \"House of Cards\"  received nine nominations in all.</p><p>  Also getting nominated, another popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) show,  the situation comedy \"Arrested Development\" got three nods, including for  series co-star Jason Bateman as best actor. </p><p>  And before we go, which stocks would you like our market monitor guest  to discuss tomorrow?

Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) misses big, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls short -- but are tech  stocks still worth owning as the Dow and S&amp;P are at historic highs?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Detroit bankrupt.   The city filed for Chapter 9 protection, making it the largest city in U.S.  history to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  And, Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) drama.  Today was supposed to be the  day Dell's future was decided but a key shareholder vote was delayed.  So,  what happens next?</p><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Thursday, July 18th. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Welcome, everyone.  And good evening.</p><p>It is the heart of earning season and tonight, we heard from two of  the biggest names in technology.  That would be Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). </p><p>Seema Mody is here to break down numbers for us, which weren't so hot. </p><p>Let's start with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). </p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Let's start with  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tyler. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Oh, all right.  Great. </p><p>MODY:  It's reported (INAUDIBLE) -- it's reported a huge miss on the  bottom line with fourth quarter earnings with 66 cents a share, versus an  analyst estimate of 75 cents.  Revenues also came in weak.  Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been hurt by ongoing weakness in the P.C. market and the  ongoing consumer shift to tablets. </p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO (ph) Amy Hood says, \"While our fourth  quarter results were impacted by the decline in the P.C. market, we  continue to see strong demand for our enterprise and Cloud offerings.\"</p><p>One bright spot, Microsoft's entertainment and device business, which  includes Xbox game console.  That business saw a 7.5 percent jump in sales.   Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) while down after hours still up about 30  percent year-to-date. </p><p>Now, Tyler, on to that tech giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which reported  a huge miss, posting a quarterly profit of $3.2 billion up from $2.8  million.  Total revenue grew 19 percent to $14.1 billion, but that did not  satisfy Wall Street. </p><p>Another key number analysts looked for, cost per click, that's the  average price that charges advertisers every time someone clicks on their  ad on a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) web search engine.  That dropped year over  year. </p><p>On the conference call, CEO Larry Page talked about how when Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) started, they were just dealing one ecosystem, the P.C.  Now,  there are many devices, platforms and spaces to really penetrate and how  that's not only a challenge but also an opportunity for Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Seema, thank you very much.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it doesn't matter which  one you begin with.  Thanks very much, Seema Mody.</p><p>All right.  Joining us now to react to the numbers, Skip Aylesworth.   He's co-portfolio manager of the Hennessey Technology Fund. </p><p>Mr. Aylesworth, welcome.</p><p>Take your choice, which one do you want to start with here, Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and what did you think? </p><p>SKIP AYLESWORTH, HENNESSY TECHNOLOGY FUND:  Well, on the big picture,  probably a little disappointed in both.  Let's look at Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), though, because I think when you peel back the numbers here,  there were some positive things for the future.  One of those is research  and development are Cap X, which is an expense, which kept revenues down or  profits down.  For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), up about 30 percent this quarter.   So, an additional $400 million spend on R&amp;D and Cap X. </p><p>Second major issue of a positive nature is the head count shrunk,  almost 9,000 employees. </p><p>These are two positive elements for the future. </p><p>On the negative side --  </p><p>GHARIB:  I --  </p><p>AYLESWORTH:  Go ahead. </p><p>GHARIB:  I was going to jump in, Skip, and ask you about Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT).  What happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and especially  just coming off of this massive reorganization that they announced last  week, they have all of these product offerings. </p><p>Do you see anything here that says that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a  vision for where they are going for growth?</p><p>AYLESWORTH:  Well, I think as the CEO said, it's in these new  services, Cloud-based organizations -- Cloud-based offerings.  What's  really hurting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), of course, is it's relying on the  PC and windows environment -- much like the story of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) to  a certain extent and HP.  So they hurt on that but are trying to turn the  ship around and go down these other paths to generate new sources of  revenues. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Skip, both of the stocks have had pretty nice runs so far  this year.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at one point was one of the leading  stocks in the Dow so far this year. </p><p>Would you buy either of these stocks at today's prices?</p><p>AYLESWORTH:  I think that -- well, from an individual standpoint, it's  really -- your focus on the future, and I would be more positive on the  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) side than I would be on the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  side.  </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  --  </p><p>AYLESWORTH:  So I would buy the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). </p><p>GHARIB:  You would buy Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and I know you have Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) in your portfolio.</p><p>AYLESWORTH:  Yes.</p><p>GHARIB:  Would you buy it at $873?  Do they buy more? </p><p>AYLESWORTH:  I would -- any time you have a price decline like there  was aftermarket, it's a good time to add to positions, as long as you have  a long-term outlook. </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  Real quickly, we've seen the stock market hitting  all these new highs, but the technology stocks have been holding back a  bit.  Just, generally, on tech stocks, you run a tech fund.  What is your  view what's going on with tech overall? </p><p>AYLESWORTH:  Well, on the big tech names, it's very hard to see this  consistent growth just because the numbers are so large for both Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  A little shift of, quote, \"a  billion dollars\" is just a small percentage. </p><p>I think the opportunities and the small cap sector will provide and  might be more rewarding from an appreciation standing. </p><p>The overall environment, you know, technology is the key for  productivity increases and everybody likes the greatest and best new  widgets.  So, we're all awaiting Apple's next product.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Mr. Aylesworth, thank you very much.</p><p>Skip Aylesworth runs the Hennessy Technology Fund.</p><p>GHARIB:  New records on Wall Street today.  The Dow and S&amp;P 500 posted  fresh all time highs, thanks to another batch of positive news on earnings  and a drop in jobless claims.  Investors were also encouraged by more  reassuring words from Ben Bernanke.  In day two his testimony on Capitol  Hill, the Federal Reserve chairman told Senate lawmakers that the Fed will  continue stimulating the U.S. economy as long as necessary. </p><p>By the closing bell, the Dow rose 78 points to 15,549.  That's the new  record.  The NASDAQ added about a point, and the S&amp;P was up 8 1/2 points to  16.89. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, Susie, the city of Detroit has just become the  largest municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy.  The city's  state-appointed emergency manager, Kevin Orr, asked a federal judge for  permission to place the insolvent city in Chapter 9 protection. </p><p>Scott Cohn is with us with more on what that bankruptcy filing means  for the city and its residents and for its creditors. </p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  And for the  nation, Tyler. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Right.</p><p>COHN:  This is a major event.</p><p>Detroit, you know, once had 1.8 million residents.  Now, it has less  than half that.  It was the cradle of American manufacturing.  Today, a  shell of its former self, with vacant homes, blighted neighborhood, and an  unemployment rate in the metropolitan area of 9 percent, much higher in the  city proper. </p><p>Kevin Orr is the emergency manager appointed by the state to handle  Detroit's long festering fiscal woes.  He had tried to reach an agreement  with creditors to stave off this bankruptcy.  He could not. </p><p>Michigan Governor Rick Snyder who appointed Orr called this decision  painful but says there was no other valuable option. </p><p>Detroit, as you heard, is the largest American city ever to file for  bankruptcy -- in fact, by far the largest.  Its long-term debt as high as  $20 billion and not a lot of --  </p><p>(CROSSDTASLK)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So what do the creditors stand to lose on this?  Often  there is a restructuring.  They get paid off at pennies on the dollar.  Do  we have any idea?</p><p>COHN:  We don't.  A federal judge first has to approve this.  This was  a request to go into the Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which is the municipal  branch, just to speak of --  </p><p>MATHISEN:  A corporate bankruptcy.</p><p>COHN:  Right. </p><p>So the judge has to go throw a three-month process in approving this,  and then there's a whole reorganization plan they will have to work out  agreements that they couldn't up to now with all the creditors including  the pensioners. </p><p>GHARIB:  This is just so shocking, that something like that is  happening in the United States.  And, you know, we've heard about state  finances in trouble, city's finances in trouble.  Is Detroit a one-time  unique situation, or will we be hearing this about another major cities.</p><p>COHN:  Well, you know, there has been a lot of talk about that for a  while, since the financial crisis.  Detroit for 40 years has been a place  of extremes.  Extreme racial strife, white flight, decline of the  manufacturing base. </p><p>So, in a lot of ways, it isn't extreme, but maybe a cautionary tale.   You know, this city that has had all of the issues that any municipality  has had in terms of dealing with labor cost, dealing with pension cost,  dealing with the decline in housing base.  And so, other cities have to  take a look at this. </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, it's very interesting two of the largest  bankruptcies we've had in the corporate world in recent years were in  Detroit, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler.  Those companies came out  on the other side much, much stronger. </p><p>Can that happen for Detroit?</p><p>COHN:  That certainly is the hope.  And all the comments you're  hearing now as this long-feared bankruptcy filing has finally happened are  -- you know, Detroit will come out of this.  Maybe this is -- this is  something that even the people who were opposing this for the longest time  seem to be conceding that it was necessary, that this was a necessary step. </p><p>Now, under bankruptcy, the whole purpose of the bankruptcy law is to  allow the city to get out from under its debts, meet obligations with its  creditors, reorganize and move on.  And that's the goal here. </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Scott Cohn, thank you very much.  Appreciate  it.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Let's hope that happens.  </p><p>Meanwhile, some wind was taken out of the sails of the Windy City  today, too.  Ratings agency Moody's Investors Services lowered Chicago's  general obligation bond and sales tax ratings by three notches, citing the  city's large and growing pension liabilities and budget pressures.  The  credit downgrade affects $8.2 billion of Chicago's bonds and sales stocks  debt.  Moody also says the outlook on the city is negative. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Another twist in the long battle to take over Dell  (NASDAQ:DELL), where shareholders were scheduled to vote today on the  future of the company.  But that didn't happen.  So, what do shareholders  think and what is next for the world's number three PC maker? </p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has more from Dell's headquarters in Round Rock,  Texas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINES REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   A vote on Michael Dell's $24.4 billion deal with private equity firm Silver  Lake Partners to take Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) private at $13.65 a share  adjourned until next Wednesday.  This as investor Carl Icahn and  Southeastern Asset Management have put forth a competing proposal, one that  keeps Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) public and values the company at $15.50 to $18 a  share. </p><p>The pros for the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal, if the founder and CEO is  the right person to lead the turnout, privately, without Wall Street  scrutiny.</p><p>But Icahn's camp says that Dell's offer undervalues the company, and  analysts wonder if the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) offer isn't opportunistic. </p><p>BRENT WILSEY, WILSEY ASSET MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT:  Carl Icahn says, no,  we can turn this company around publicly and shareholders will win from  this.  So I like Carl Icahn's plan much better than do Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)  because Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is just -- yes, the company will turn  around, he'll be well off from two years from now, but why can't the  shareholders benefit from that?</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Roughly 300-plus investors attended the meeting today at  Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) headquarters in Round Rock, Texas.  Some concerned about  the adjournment and that it could send shares tumbling.</p><p>NORM PETERS, DELL SHAREHOLDER:  I'm now worried and concerned, and  realistically concerned.  Yes, it's going to have an impact that there are  thousands of us out there waiting to see what's going to happen because  there is an option for us to make more money than the $13.65 that he's  offering us at this point. </p><p>DEANGELIS:  Carl Icahn and Southeastern taking their own view on  today's development, saying in a statement, \"We believe that this delay  reflects the unhappiness of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) stockholders with the  Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)/Silver Lake offer, which we believe  substantially undervalues the company.  This is not time to delay but the  time to move Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) forward.\"</p><p>(on camera):  Investors came here today looking for a decision.  But  all they got was more uncertainty.  Will Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) sweeten  his offer and get his deal passed next week or will shareholders be  reviewing Carl Icahn's offer at the annual meeting? </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  A sigh of relief for Boeing (NYSE:BA) in the wake of a fire  on board one of its 787 Dreamliners last week in London.  Now, British  aviation investigators are recommending that an emergency locating  transmitter found on those aircraft made by Honeywell, not Boeing  (NYSE:BA), be disabled.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Earnings dominate tonight's \"Market Focus\" and we begin  with United Healthcare.  The Dow component and the nation's largest health  insurers signed up almost 10 million new members and fewer people filed  claims.  That's a good recipe and that boosted quarterly revenues and  profits.  They beat analysts' estimates. </p><p>The company also increased its outlook for the year.  Let's take a  look at UNH shares, biggest gainers in the Dow, surging 6.5 percent today. </p><p>Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) reported a billion-dollar  profit and said it plans to buyback 500 million shares, first since 2008.   Revenue grew in all major businesses, trading in particular.  The stock  finished the day up 4 percent to $27.70. </p><p>And it was a case of good news/bad news for Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the  nation's largest wireless carrier.  First, let's give you the good news.   It activated more iPhones than expected in the last quarter.  And now the  bad -- the company saw some weakness in it's traditional wire line unit,  which pressured overall revenue.  And separately, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is  joining rivals AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile instituting an installment plan  for customers who want to update their devices every year instead of  current plan of every two years. </p><p>The stock finishing today lower by 1 1/2 percent.  It closed at  $49.97.</p><p>GHARIB:  It was a tough day for Sherwin Williams.  The paint maker  reported disappointing second quarter results, issued a weak outlook for  the current quarter and said that Mexican regulators rejected the bid to  buy a paint company in that country.  The stock plunged 8 percent to  $167.94. </p><p>And earnings at Scholastic (NASDAQ:SCHL) tumbled 62 percent.  This  publisher of children's book is blaming weak sales of \"The Hunger Games\"  trilogy and lower book club revenue per order.  Next year, the company  plans to focus on new educational technology program for the iPad, which it  hopes will increase revenue. </p><p>Meanwhile, the stock was off by more than 8 percent today, to $29 and  change. </p><p>MATHISEN:  And still ahead, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) facing a record fine - - the allegation it manipulated energy markets, but it is the only firm  accused recently of wrongdoing.  Is there any way to stop businesses from  behaving badly?</p><p>But, first, a look at how the international markets closed today. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase now faces what could be the  biggest fine ever to settle allegations that it manipulated electricity  markets in the Midwest and California.  The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission is close to an agreement with the New York bank.  That could  mean a fine of nearly a half billion.  But remember, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)  made $6 billion in profit last quarter.  So, a half billion-dollar fine  would be less than 10 percent of one quarter's profits. </p><p>Some legal experts say fines for misconduct need to get a lot bigger  to deter corporate misbehavior, of which there has seemingly been a lot  lately. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over):  What's a $500 million fine or settlement to a  company the size of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase?  Not so much says attorney  Melissa Maxman.</p><p>MELISSA MAXMAN, ATTORNEY:  If the fines are astronomical at this  point, on the other hand, the companies better being find astronomical  amounts can afford it. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Maxman has seen both sides.  Once a federal prosecutor, she  now defends companies accused of behaving badly. </p><p>MAXMAN:  Sometimes companies do decide, make a financial decision to  disregard a law or break a law, because it's in their financial interest to  do it, and sometimes just as we all have done in the past, maybe in school  or otherwise, you know, we think we won't get caught. </p><p>MATHISEN:  But increasingly, they are, all around the globe. </p><p>Last year, British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty and agreed  to U.S. civil and criminal penalties for $3 billion for unlawfully  promoting prescription drugs among other offenses.  It was the largest  healthcare fraud settlement in history. </p><p>That was 1/3 of the record $9 billion in settlements negotiated by the  federal government in 2012, nearly triple the recoveries in 2011, and 50  percent more than the previous record hold back in 2006. </p><p>Just this year, BP was sentenced in January to pay $4 billion, a  record for an environmental crime stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon  spill in the Gulf.</p><p>RBS SecuritiesJapan agreed to pay $50 million fine in connection with  the rigging of LIBOR rates, bringing the RBS and RBS Japan totals in that  case alone to $612 million. </p><p>And in May, Walmart pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act  and was sentenced to pay a fine of more than $81 million. </p><p>Fines for antitrust and price-fixing allegations like the one JPMorgan  (NYSE:JPM) Chase faces have grown the most in resent years, topping $5  billion in 2012. </p><p>And still says University of Baltimore law professor, Bob Lande,  companies are willing to take the risk.  Lande, along with co-author John  Connor from Perdue, says we only catch about 25 percent of the market  manipulators and at that rate, he says fines need to be five times what  they have been.  Lande also says people tied to fix pricing and other  violations should be banned from their industries for life. That might be a  deterrent. </p><p>But attorney Maxman figures her practice will stay busy no matter  what. </p><p>MAXMAN;  As long as profit maximization is going to be a primary  motivator of a corporation, there will be incentives to bend the rules, cut  corners. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Lawmakers are close to a deal that would lower the rate on  new subsidized student loans just weeks after allowing them to double to  6.8 percent.  A bipartisan would reverse that rate hike on new Stafford  loans that went into effect on July 1st.  So, if it passes, undergraduates  will be able to borrow at a rate of 3.9 percent, graduate students at 4.9  percent, and parents can borrow at 6.4 percent.</p><p>And coming up on the program, hedge fund manager John Paulson famously  bet against housing before the bust.  Now, he's calling it the best  investment anyone can make.  But is it?</p><p>But, first, let's take a look at home commodities, treasuries and  currencies performed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB:  The housing market has been red hot lately, and that may be  why a California builder decided to go public on Wall Street.  UCP began  selling stock to the public for the first time today on the New York Stock  Exchange.  It's the fourth home builder to go public this year. </p><p>But UCP is off to a disappointing start.  Its shares tumbled nearly 7  percent. </p><p>Looking at the three other homebuilders that also went public this  year, William Lyon and Tri Pointe are trading below their IPO prices.  But  Taylor Morrison up about 14 percent.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, despite those disappointing IPOs, many investors are  still bullish on housing.  And one of them is the hedge fund manager John  Paulson, who made more than a billion betting against the housing industry  just before it collapsed, but it's now talking up housing in a big way.   Listen to what he said yesterday about individual investment in housing. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN PAULSON, PAULSON &amp; CO:  I still feel buying a home is the best  investment any individual can make.  Affordability is still at an all-time  high.  It still costs less to own a home after tax than it does to rent. </p><p>So, if anyone bought a home last year, let's say for $100, you put  down $20.  Today, that home is worth $112.  So you made $12 on a $20  investment, 60 percent return. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB:  So, is John Paulson right on housing? </p><p>Our next guest disagrees.  He's Yale's economics professor Robert  Shiller, who is also the co-founder of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. </p><p>Professor Shiller, so nice to have you on the program again.  And  really want to get your point of view of why you disagree with John  Paulson. </p><p>ROBERT SHILLER, CASE-SHILLER INDEX CO-FOUNDER:  I don't totally  disagree.  I think that home prices are moving up and they might for  someone with a flipping plan whose going to get out, it might -- it might  be an attractive investment. </p><p>But I think most people are not in that category.  Most people are  thinking of buy and hold.  And for the longer run, I don't -- I don't think  housing is a good investment, unless you want the house. </p><p>MATHISEN:  So you think that in the short-term, if I'm going to flip  the house, it's a better deal than in the long term if I'm going to stay  there and own the house. </p><p>Without wading too deeply into the numbers, explain why.</p><p>SHILLER:  Well, professional investors like John Paulson are very  aware of anomalies in markets.  One of them is momentum.  It's been  remarked in the stock market, I'm sure he knows that very well.  It's also  in the housing market.</p><p>And it has been much stronger in the housing market than in the stock  market.   So when home prices start going up, they will probably go -- I  wrote a paper about this 20 years ago.  It's really true.  Home prices move  in the same direction.</p><p>They're up 12 percent nationally in the last year.  And so, they'll  probably do something like that again for a year or so. </p><p>GHARIB:  We've been raised to believe that, you know, our parents did  this and the parents before them did this, that you buy a home, and you  hold on to it and you're set for retirement. </p><p>SHILLER:  Right. </p><p>GHARIB:  And then we had the housing crisis.  So, I get that. </p><p>But are you saying that going forward that that rule of thumb no  longer exists?  I mean, what really changed here? </p><p>SHILLER:  Well, it -- it -- if you want a home and you want to live  there, fine.  It's -- you know, Paulson is right.  There is a tax advantage  to homeownership. </p><p>But the question in my mind is are you going to buy a bigger home than  you need as an investment or are you going to buy a second home and there - - I think that it's not a good long-run prospect because historically,  housing has not increased above the inflation rate.  Home prices are down - - now, there's a big misperception that houses are cheap now.  They're not  generally cheap.  They're just kind of back to an average level. </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, your argument, basically, if I'm understanding you  correctly, is after inflation basis, you're not going to make money owning  a home?</p><p>SHILLER:  The dividend comes in the form of a nice place to sleep, a  family room, you know, a place --  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You get value from that.  Yes, right.</p><p>SHILLER:  That's it.  Don't expect capital gain. </p><p>Now, it is true that mortgage rates are still very low and I think of  it more as a mortgage market play that might be enticing people in for the  longer term. </p><p>If you really plan to stay in a house for 30 years, you can get a 30- year mortgage rate that's still a little over 4 percent.  That's very good  by historical standards. </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  Interesting conversation, thank you so much  Professor Shiller. </p><p>SHILLER:  Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB:  Robert Shiller of Yale University.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, television history was made today at the Emmy  nominations.  The political thriller \"House of Cards\" produced by Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) was nominated for best drama series, the first time a program  that's only available through an online streaming service was recognized by  the television industry's leading awards organization.  \"House of Cards\"  received nine nominations in all.</p><p>Also getting nominated, another popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) show,  the situation comedy \"Arrested Development\" got three nods, including for  series co-star Jason Bateman as best actor. </p><p>And before we go, which stocks would you like our market monitor guest  to discuss tomorrow?  You can let us know by logging on to our Web site,  NBR.com and don't forget to include where you are from. </p><p>GHARIB: And next week, we also begin a five-part series on how to not  outlive your money.  So please join us for that and I guess you can't count  on your home --  </p><p>MATHISEN:  To bail you out.</p><p>GHARIB:  Yes, to bail you out according to Professor Shiller. </p><p>MATHISEN:  You're going to be off tomorrow.  Have a nice day off. </p><p>GHARIB:  Thanks.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Nice long weekend.  Survive the heat.</p><p>GHARIB:  And I'll be back on Monday. </p><p>But that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie Gharib.   Thanks for being with us.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me as well.  Have a  great evening.  Stay cool, everybody.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) misses big, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls short -- but are tech stocks still worth owning as the Dow and S&amp;P are at historic highs?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Detroit bankrupt. The city filed for Chapter 9 protection, making it the largest city in U.S. history to do so.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And, Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) drama. Today was supposed to be the day Dell's future was decided but a key shareholder vote was delayed. So, what happens next?</p><p/><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, July 18th.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Welcome, everyone. And good evening.</p><p/><p>It is the heart of earning season and tonight, we heard from two of the biggest names in technology. That would be Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p/><p>Seema Mody is here to break down numbers for us, which weren't so hot.</p><p/><p>Let's start with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p/><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Let's start with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tyler.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Oh, all right. Great.</p><p/><p>MODY: It's reported (INAUDIBLE) -- it's reported a huge miss on the bottom line with fourth quarter earnings with 66 cents a share, versus an analyst estimate of 75 cents. Revenues also came in weak. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been hurt by ongoing weakness in the P.C. market and the ongoing consumer shift to tablets.</p><p/><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO (ph) Amy Hood says, \"While our fourth quarter results were impacted by the decline in the P.C. market, we continue to see strong demand for our enterprise and Cloud offerings.\"</p><p/><p>One bright spot, Microsoft's entertainment and device business, which includes Xbox game console. That business saw a 7.5 percent jump in sales. Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) while down after hours still up about 30 percent year-to-date.</p><p/><p>Now, Tyler, on to that tech giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which reported a huge miss, posting a quarterly profit of $3.2 billion up from $2.8 million. Total revenue grew 19 percent to $14.1 billion, but that did not satisfy Wall Street.</p><p/><p>Another key number analysts looked for, cost per click, that's the average price that charges advertisers every time someone clicks on their ad on a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) web search engine. That dropped year over year.</p><p/><p>On the conference call, CEO Larry Page talked about how when Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) started, they were just dealing one ecosystem, the P.C. Now, there are many devices, platforms and spaces to really penetrate and how that's not only a challenge but also an opportunity for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: All right. Seema, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it doesn't matter which one you begin with. Thanks very much, Seema Mody.</p><p/><p>All right. Joining us now to react to the numbers, Skip Aylesworth. He's co-portfolio manager of the Hennessey Technology Fund.</p><p/><p>Mr. Aylesworth, welcome.</p><p/><p>Take your choice, which one do you want to start with here, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and what did you think?</p><p/><p>SKIP AYLESWORTH, HENNESSY TECHNOLOGY FUND: Well, on the big picture, probably a little disappointed in both. Let's look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), though, because I think when you peel back the numbers here, there were some positive things for the future. One of those is research and development are Cap X, which is an expense, which kept revenues down or profits down. For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), up about 30 percent this quarter. So, an additional $400 million spend on R&amp;D and Cap X.</p><p/><p>Second major issue of a positive nature is the head count shrunk, almost 9,000 employees.</p><p/><p>These are two positive elements for the future.</p><p/><p>On the negative side --</p><p/><p>GHARIB: I --</p><p/><p>AYLESWORTH: Go ahead.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: I was going to jump in, Skip, and ask you about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). What happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and especially just coming off of this massive reorganization that they announced last week, they have all of these product offerings.</p><p/><p>Do you see anything here that says that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a vision for where they are going for growth?</p><p/><p>AYLESWORTH: Well, I think as the CEO said, it's in these new services, Cloud-based organizations -- Cloud-based offerings. What's really hurting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), of course, is it's relying on the PC and windows environment -- much like the story of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) to a certain extent and HP. So they hurt on that but are trying to turn the ship around and go down these other paths to generate new sources of revenues.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Skip, both of the stocks have had pretty nice runs so far this year. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at one point was one of the leading stocks in the Dow so far this year.</p><p/><p>Would you buy either of these stocks at today's prices?</p><p/><p>AYLESWORTH: I think that -- well, from an individual standpoint, it's really -- your focus on the future, and I would be more positive on the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) side than I would be on the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) side.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: All right. --</p><p/><p>AYLESWORTH: So I would buy the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p/><p>GHARIB: You would buy Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and I know you have Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in your portfolio.</p><p/><p>AYLESWORTH: Yes.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Would you buy it at $873? Do they buy more?</p><p/><p>AYLESWORTH: I would -- any time you have a price decline like there was aftermarket, it's a good time to add to positions, as long as you have a long-term outlook.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: All right. Real quickly, we've seen the stock market hitting all these new highs, but the technology stocks have been holding back a bit. Just, generally, on tech stocks, you run a tech fund. What is your view what's going on with tech overall?</p><p/><p>AYLESWORTH: Well, on the big tech names, it's very hard to see this consistent growth just because the numbers are so large for both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). A little shift of, quote, \"a billion dollars\" is just a small percentage.</p><p/><p>I think the opportunities and the small cap sector will provide and might be more rewarding from an appreciation standing.</p><p/><p>The overall environment, you know, technology is the key for productivity increases and everybody likes the greatest and best new widgets. So, we're all awaiting Apple's next product.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Mr. Aylesworth, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>Skip Aylesworth runs the Hennessy Technology Fund.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: New records on Wall Street today. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 posted fresh all time highs, thanks to another batch of positive news on earnings and a drop in jobless claims. Investors were also encouraged by more reassuring words from Ben Bernanke. In day two his testimony on Capitol Hill, the Federal Reserve chairman told Senate lawmakers that the Fed will continue stimulating the U.S. economy as long as necessary.</p><p/><p>By the closing bell, the Dow rose 78 points to 15,549. That's the new record. The NASDAQ added about a point, and the S&amp;P was up 8 1/2 points to 16.89.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Well, Susie, the city of Detroit has just become the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy. The city's state-appointed emergency manager, Kevin Orr, asked a federal judge for permission to place the insolvent city in Chapter 9 protection.</p><p/><p>Scott Cohn is with us with more on what that bankruptcy filing means for the city and its residents and for its creditors.</p><p/><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: And for the nation, Tyler.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Right.</p><p/><p>COHN: This is a major event.</p><p/><p>Detroit, you know, once had 1.8 million residents. Now, it has less than half that. It was the cradle of American manufacturing. Today, a shell of its former self, with vacant homes, blighted neighborhood, and an unemployment rate in the metropolitan area of 9 percent, much higher in the city proper.</p><p/><p>Kevin Orr is the emergency manager appointed by the state to handle Detroit's long festering fiscal woes. He had tried to reach an agreement with creditors to stave off this bankruptcy. He could not.</p><p/><p>Michigan Governor Rick Snyder who appointed Orr called this decision painful but says there was no other valuable option.</p><p/><p>Detroit, as you heard, is the largest American city ever to file for bankruptcy -- in fact, by far the largest. Its long-term debt as high as $20 billion and not a lot of --</p><p/><p>(CROSSDTASLK)</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: So what do the creditors stand to lose on this? Often there is a restructuring. They get paid off at pennies on the dollar. Do we have any idea?</p><p/><p>COHN: We don't. A federal judge first has to approve this. This was a request to go into the Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which is the municipal branch, just to speak of --</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: A corporate bankruptcy.</p><p/><p>COHN: Right.</p><p/><p>So the judge has to go throw a three-month process in approving this, and then there's a whole reorganization plan they will have to work out agreements that they couldn't up to now with all the creditors including the pensioners.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: This is just so shocking, that something like that is happening in the United States. And, you know, we've heard about state finances in trouble, city's finances in trouble. Is Detroit a one-time unique situation, or will we be hearing this about another major cities.</p><p/><p>COHN: Well, you know, there has been a lot of talk about that for a while, since the financial crisis. Detroit for 40 years has been a place of extremes. Extreme racial strife, white flight, decline of the manufacturing base.</p><p/><p>So, in a lot of ways, it isn't extreme, but maybe a cautionary tale. You know, this city that has had all of the issues that any municipality has had in terms of dealing with labor cost, dealing with pension cost, dealing with the decline in housing base. And so, other cities have to take a look at this.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: You know, it's very interesting two of the largest bankruptcies we've had in the corporate world in recent years were in Detroit, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler. Those companies came out on the other side much, much stronger.</p><p/><p>Can that happen for Detroit?</p><p/><p>COHN: That certainly is the hope. And all the comments you're hearing now as this long-feared bankruptcy filing has finally happened are -- you know, Detroit will come out of this. Maybe this is -- this is something that even the people who were opposing this for the longest time seem to be conceding that it was necessary, that this was a necessary step.</p><p/><p>Now, under bankruptcy, the whole purpose of the bankruptcy law is to allow the city to get out from under its debts, meet obligations with its creditors, reorganize and move on. And that's the goal here.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: All right. Scott Cohn, thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Let's hope that happens.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, some wind was taken out of the sails of the Windy City today, too. Ratings agency Moody's Investors Services lowered Chicago's general obligation bond and sales tax ratings by three notches, citing the city's large and growing pension liabilities and budget pressures. The credit downgrade affects $8.2 billion of Chicago's bonds and sales stocks debt. Moody also says the outlook on the city is negative.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Another twist in the long battle to take over Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), where shareholders were scheduled to vote today on the future of the company. But that didn't happen. So, what do shareholders think and what is next for the world's number three PC maker?</p><p/><p>Jackie DeAngelis has more from Dell's headquarters in Round Rock, Texas.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINES REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A vote on Michael Dell's $24.4 billion deal with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners to take Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) private at $13.65 a share adjourned until next Wednesday. This as investor Carl Icahn and Southeastern Asset Management have put forth a competing proposal, one that keeps Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) public and values the company at $15.50 to $18 a share.</p><p/><p>The pros for the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal, if the founder and CEO is the right person to lead the turnout, privately, without Wall Street scrutiny.</p><p/><p>But Icahn's camp says that Dell's offer undervalues the company, and analysts wonder if the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) offer isn't opportunistic.</p><p/><p>BRENT WILSEY, WILSEY ASSET MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Carl Icahn says, no, we can turn this company around publicly and shareholders will win from this. So I like Carl Icahn's plan much better than do Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) because Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is just -- yes, the company will turn around, he'll be well off from two years from now, but why can't the shareholders benefit from that?</p><p/><p>DEANGELIS: Roughly 300-plus investors attended the meeting today at Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) headquarters in Round Rock, Texas. Some concerned about the adjournment and that it could send shares tumbling.</p><p/><p>NORM PETERS, DELL SHAREHOLDER: I'm now worried and concerned, and realistically concerned. Yes, it's going to have an impact that there are thousands of us out there waiting to see what's going to happen because there is an option for us to make more money than the $13.65 that he's offering us at this point.</p><p/><p>DEANGELIS: Carl Icahn and Southeastern taking their own view on today's development, saying in a statement, \"We believe that this delay reflects the unhappiness of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) stockholders with the Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)/Silver Lake offer, which we believe substantially undervalues the company. This is not time to delay but the time to move Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) forward.\"</p><p/><p>(on camera): Investors came here today looking for a decision. But all they got was more uncertainty. Will Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) sweeten his offer and get his deal passed next week or will shareholders be reviewing Carl Icahn's offer at the annual meeting?</p><p/><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: A sigh of relief for Boeing (NYSE:BA) in the wake of a fire on board one of its 787 Dreamliners last week in London. Now, British aviation investigators are recommending that an emergency locating transmitter found on those aircraft made by Honeywell, not Boeing (NYSE:BA), be disabled.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Earnings dominate tonight's \"Market Focus\" and we begin with United Healthcare. The Dow component and the nation's largest health insurers signed up almost 10 million new members and fewer people filed claims. That's a good recipe and that boosted quarterly revenues and profits. They beat analysts' estimates.</p><p/><p>The company also increased its outlook for the year. Let's take a look at UNH shares, biggest gainers in the Dow, surging 6.5 percent today.</p><p/><p>Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) reported a billion-dollar profit and said it plans to buyback 500 million shares, first since 2008. Revenue grew in all major businesses, trading in particular. The stock finished the day up 4 percent to $27.70.</p><p/><p>And it was a case of good news/bad news for Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the nation's largest wireless carrier. First, let's give you the good news. It activated more iPhones than expected in the last quarter. And now the bad -- the company saw some weakness in it's traditional wire line unit, which pressured overall revenue. And separately, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is joining rivals AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile instituting an installment plan for customers who want to update their devices every year instead of current plan of every two years.</p><p/><p>The stock finishing today lower by 1 1/2 percent. It closed at $49.97.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: It was a tough day for Sherwin Williams. The paint maker reported disappointing second quarter results, issued a weak outlook for the current quarter and said that Mexican regulators rejected the bid to buy a paint company in that country. The stock plunged 8 percent to $167.94.</p><p/><p>And earnings at Scholastic (NASDAQ:SCHL) tumbled 62 percent. This publisher of children's book is blaming weak sales of \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy and lower book club revenue per order. Next year, the company plans to focus on new educational technology program for the iPad, which it hopes will increase revenue.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, the stock was off by more than 8 percent today, to $29 and change.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: And still ahead, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) facing a record fine - - the allegation it manipulated energy markets, but it is the only firm accused recently of wrongdoing. Is there any way to stop businesses from behaving badly?</p><p/><p>But, first, a look at how the international markets closed today.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase now faces what could be the biggest fine ever to settle allegations that it manipulated electricity markets in the Midwest and California. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is close to an agreement with the New York bank. That could mean a fine of nearly a half billion. But remember, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) made $6 billion in profit last quarter. So, a half billion-dollar fine would be less than 10 percent of one quarter's profits.</p><p/><p>Some legal experts say fines for misconduct need to get a lot bigger to deter corporate misbehavior, of which there has seemingly been a lot lately.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): What's a $500 million fine or settlement to a company the size of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase? Not so much says attorney Melissa Maxman.</p><p/><p>MELISSA MAXMAN, ATTORNEY: If the fines are astronomical at this point, on the other hand, the companies better being find astronomical amounts can afford it.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Maxman has seen both sides. Once a federal prosecutor, she now defends companies accused of behaving badly.</p><p/><p>MAXMAN: Sometimes companies do decide, make a financial decision to disregard a law or break a law, because it's in their financial interest to do it, and sometimes just as we all have done in the past, maybe in school or otherwise, you know, we think we won't get caught.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: But increasingly, they are, all around the globe.</p><p/><p>Last year, British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty and agreed to U.S. civil and criminal penalties for $3 billion for unlawfully promoting prescription drugs among other offenses. It was the largest healthcare fraud settlement in history.</p><p/><p>That was 1/3 of the record $9 billion in settlements negotiated by the federal government in 2012, nearly triple the recoveries in 2011, and 50 percent more than the previous record hold back in 2006.</p><p/><p>Just this year, BP was sentenced in January to pay $4 billion, a record for an environmental crime stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf.</p><p/><p>RBS Securities Japan agreed to pay $50 million fine in connection with the rigging of LIBOR rates, bringing the RBS and RBS Japan totals in that case alone to $612 million.</p><p/><p>And in May, Walmart pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and was sentenced to pay a fine of more than $81 million.</p><p/><p>Fines for antitrust and price-fixing allegations like the one JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase faces have grown the most in resent years, topping $5 billion in 2012.</p><p/><p>And still says University of Baltimore law professor, Bob Lande, companies are willing to take the risk. Lande, along with co-author John Connor from Perdue, says we only catch about 25 percent of the market manipulators and at that rate, he says fines need to be five times what they have been. Lande also says people tied to fix pricing and other violations should be banned from their industries for life. That might be a deterrent.</p><p/><p>But attorney Maxman figures her practice will stay busy no matter what.</p><p/><p>MAXMAN; As long as profit maximization is going to be a primary motivator of a corporation, there will be incentives to bend the rules, cut corners.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Lawmakers are close to a deal that would lower the rate on new subsidized student loans just weeks after allowing them to double to 6.8 percent. A bipartisan would reverse that rate hike on new Stafford loans that went into effect on July 1st. So, if it passes, undergraduates will be able to borrow at a rate of 3.9 percent, graduate students at 4.9 percent, and parents can borrow at 6.4 percent.</p><p/><p>And coming up on the program, hedge fund manager John Paulson famously bet against housing before the bust. Now, he's calling it the best investment anyone can make. But is it?</p><p/><p>But, first, let's take a look at home commodities, treasuries and currencies performed today.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: The housing market has been red hot lately, and that may be why a California builder decided to go public on Wall Street. UCP began selling stock to the public for the first time today on the New York Stock Exchange. It's the fourth home builder to go public this year.</p><p/><p>But UCP is off to a disappointing start. Its shares tumbled nearly 7 percent.</p><p/><p>Looking at the three other homebuilders that also went public this year, William Lyon and Tri Pointe are trading below their IPO prices. But Taylor Morrison up about 14 percent.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Well, despite those disappointing IPOs, many investors are still bullish on housing. And one of them is the hedge fund manager John Paulson, who made more than a billion betting against the housing industry just before it collapsed, but it's now talking up housing in a big way. Listen to what he said yesterday about individual investment in housing.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JOHN PAULSON, PAULSON &amp; CO: I still feel buying a home is the best investment any individual can make. Affordability is still at an all-time high. It still costs less to own a home after tax than it does to rent.</p><p/><p>So, if anyone bought a home last year, let's say for $100, you put down $20. Today, that home is worth $112. So you made $12 on a $20 investment, 60 percent return.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>GHARIB: So, is John Paulson right on housing?</p><p/><p>Our next guest disagrees. He's Yale's economics professor Robert Shiller, who is also the co-founder of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index.</p><p/><p>Professor Shiller, so nice to have you on the program again. And really want to get your point of view of why you disagree with John Paulson.</p><p/><p>ROBERT SHILLER, CASE-SHILLER INDEX CO-FOUNDER: I don't totally disagree. I think that home prices are moving up and they might for someone with a flipping plan whose going to get out, it might -- it might be an attractive investment.</p><p/><p>But I think most people are not in that category. Most people are thinking of buy and hold. And for the longer run, I don't -- I don't think housing is a good investment, unless you want the house.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: So you think that in the short-term, if I'm going to flip the house, it's a better deal than in the long term if I'm going to stay there and own the house.</p><p/><p>Without wading too deeply into the numbers, explain why.</p><p/><p>SHILLER: Well, professional investors like John Paulson are very aware of anomalies in markets. One of them is momentum. It's been remarked in the stock market, I'm sure he knows that very well. It's also in the housing market.</p><p/><p>And it has been much stronger in the housing market than in the stock market. So when home prices start going up, they will probably go -- I wrote a paper about this 20 years ago. It's really true. Home prices move in the same direction.</p><p/><p>They're up 12 percent nationally in the last year. And so, they'll probably do something like that again for a year or so.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: We've been raised to believe that, you know, our parents did this and the parents before them did this, that you buy a home, and you hold on to it and you're set for retirement.</p><p/><p>SHILLER: Right.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And then we had the housing crisis. So, I get that.</p><p/><p>But are you saying that going forward that that rule of thumb no longer exists? I mean, what really changed here?</p><p/><p>SHILLER: Well, it -- it -- if you want a home and you want to live there, fine. It's -- you know, Paulson is right. There is a tax advantage to homeownership.</p><p/><p>But the question in my mind is are you going to buy a bigger home than you need as an investment or are you going to buy a second home and there - - I think that it's not a good long-run prospect because historically, housing has not increased above the inflation rate. Home prices are down - - now, there's a big misperception that houses are cheap now. They're not generally cheap. They're just kind of back to an average level.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: So, your argument, basically, if I'm understanding you correctly, is after inflation basis, you're not going to make money owning a home?</p><p/><p>SHILLER: The dividend comes in the form of a nice place to sleep, a family room, you know, a place --</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: You get value from that. Yes, right.</p><p/><p>SHILLER: That's it. Don't expect capital gain.</p><p/><p>Now, it is true that mortgage rates are still very low and I think of it more as a mortgage market play that might be enticing people in for the longer term.</p><p/><p>If you really plan to stay in a house for 30 years, you can get a 30- year mortgage rate that's still a little over 4 percent. That's very good by historical standards.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: All right. Interesting conversation, thank you so much Professor Shiller.</p><p/><p>SHILLER: Thank you.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Robert Shiller of Yale University.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Well, television history was made today at the Emmy nominations. The political thriller \"House of Cards\" produced by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was nominated for best drama series, the first time a program that's only available through an online streaming service was recognized by the television industry's leading awards organization. \"House of Cards\" received nine nominations in all.</p><p/><p>Also getting nominated, another popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) show, the situation comedy \"Arrested Development\" got three nods, including for series co-star Jason Bateman as best actor.</p><p/><p>And before we go, which stocks would you like our market monitor guest to discuss tomorrow? You can let us know by logging on to our Web site, NBR.com and don't forget to include where you are from.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And next week, we also begin a five-part series on how to not outlive your money. So please join us for that and I guess you can't count on your home --</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: To bail you out.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Yes, to bail you out according to Professor Shiller.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: You're going to be off tomorrow. Have a nice day off.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: Thanks.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: Nice long weekend. Survive the heat.</p><p/><p>GHARIB: And I'll be back on Monday.</p><p/><p>But that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks for being with us.</p><p/><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me as well. Have a great evening. Stay cool, everybody.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) misses big, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls short -- but are tech stocks still worth owning as the Dow and S&amp;P are at historic highs?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Detroit bankrupt. The city filed for Chapter 9 protection, making it the largest city in U.S. history to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And, Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) drama. Today was supposed to be the day Dell's future was decided but a key shareholder vote was delayed. So, what happens next?</p><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, July 18th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Welcome, everyone. And good evening.</p><p>It is the heart of earning season and tonight, we heard from two of the biggest names in technology. That would be Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>Seema Mody is here to break down numbers for us, which weren't so hot.</p><p>Let's start with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Let's start with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: Oh, all right. Great.</p><p>MODY: It's reported (INAUDIBLE) -- it's reported a huge miss on the bottom line with fourth quarter earnings with 66 cents a share, versus an analyst estimate of 75 cents. Revenues also came in weak. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been hurt by ongoing weakness in the P.C. market and the ongoing consumer shift to tablets.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO (ph) Amy Hood says, \"While our fourth quarter results were impacted by the decline in the P.C. market, we continue to see strong demand for our enterprise and Cloud offerings.\"</p><p>One bright spot, Microsoft's entertainment and device business, which includes Xbox game console. That business saw a 7.5 percent jump in sales. Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) while down after hours still up about 30 percent year-to-date.</p><p>Now, Tyler, on to that tech giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which reported a huge miss, posting a quarterly profit of $3.2 billion up from $2.8 million. Total revenue grew 19 percent to $14.1 billion, but that did not satisfy Wall Street.</p><p>Another key number analysts looked for, cost per click, that's the average price that charges advertisers every time someone clicks on their ad on a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) web search engine. That dropped year over year.</p><p>On the conference call, CEO Larry Page talked about how when Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) started, they were just dealing one ecosystem, the P.C. Now, there are many devices, platforms and spaces to really penetrate and how that's not only a challenge but also an opportunity for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Seema, thank you very much.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it doesn't matter which one you begin with. Thanks very much, Seema Mody.</p><p>All right. Joining us now to react to the numbers, Skip Aylesworth. He's co-portfolio manager of the Hennessey Technology Fund.</p><p>Mr. Aylesworth, welcome.</p><p>Take your choice, which one do you want to start with here, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and what did you think?</p><p>SKIP AYLESWORTH, HENNESSY TECHNOLOGY FUND: Well, on the big picture, probably a little disappointed in both. Let's look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), though, because I think when you peel back the numbers here, there were some positive things for the future. One of those is research and development are Cap X, which is an expense, which kept revenues down or profits down. For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), up about 30 percent this quarter. So, an additional $400 million spend on R&amp;D and Cap X.</p><p>Second major issue of a positive nature is the head count shrunk, almost 9,000 employees.</p><p>These are two positive elements for the future.</p><p>On the negative side --</p><p>GHARIB: I --</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Go ahead.</p><p>GHARIB: I was going to jump in, Skip, and ask you about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). What happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and especially just coming off of this massive reorganization that they announced last week, they have all of these product offerings.</p><p>Do you see anything here that says that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a vision for where they are going for growth?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Well, I think as the CEO said, it's in these new services, Cloud-based organizations -- Cloud-based offerings. What's really hurting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), of course, is it's relying on the PC and windows environment -- much like the story of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) to a certain extent and HP. So they hurt on that but are trying to turn the ship around and go down these other paths to generate new sources of revenues.</p><p>MATHISEN: Skip, both of the stocks have had pretty nice runs so far this year. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at one point was one of the leading stocks in the Dow so far this year.</p><p>Would you buy either of these stocks at today's prices?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: I think that -- well, from an individual standpoint, it's really -- your focus on the future, and I would be more positive on the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) side than I would be on the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) side.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. --</p><p>AYLESWORTH: So I would buy the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>GHARIB: You would buy Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and I know you have Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in your portfolio.</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Yes.</p><p>GHARIB: Would you buy it at $873? Do they buy more?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: I would -- any time you have a price decline like there was aftermarket, it's a good time to add to positions, as long as you have a long-term outlook.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Real quickly, we've seen the stock market hitting all these new highs, but the technology stocks have been holding back a bit. Just, generally, on tech stocks, you run a tech fund. What is your view what's going on with tech overall?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Well, on the big tech names, it's very hard to see this consistent growth just because the numbers are so large for both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). A little shift of, quote, \"a billion dollars\" is just a small percentage.</p><p>I think the opportunities and the small cap sector will provide and might be more rewarding from an appreciation standing.</p><p>The overall environment, you know, technology is the key for productivity increases and everybody likes the greatest and best new widgets. So, we're all awaiting Apple's next product.</p><p>MATHISEN: Mr. Aylesworth, thank you very much.</p><p>Skip Aylesworth runs the Hennessy Technology Fund.</p><p>GHARIB: New records on Wall Street today. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 posted fresh all time highs, thanks to another batch of positive news on earnings and a drop in jobless claims. Investors were also encouraged by more reassuring words from Ben Bernanke. In day two his testimony on Capitol Hill, the Federal Reserve chairman told Senate lawmakers that the Fed will continue stimulating the U.S. economy as long as necessary.</p><p>By the closing bell, the Dow rose 78 points to 15,549. That's the new record. The NASDAQ added about a point, and the S&amp;P was up 8 1/2 points to 16.89.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, Susie, the city of Detroit has just become the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy. The city's state-appointed emergency manager, Kevin Orr, asked a federal judge for permission to place the insolvent city in Chapter 9 protection.</p><p>Scott Cohn is with us with more on what that bankruptcy filing means for the city and its residents and for its creditors.</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: And for the nation, Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: Right.</p><p>COHN: This is a major event.</p><p>Detroit, you know, once had 1.8 million residents. Now, it has less than half that. It was the cradle of American manufacturing. Today, a shell of its former self, with vacant homes, blighted neighborhood, and an unemployment rate in the metropolitan area of 9 percent, much higher in the city proper.</p><p>Kevin Orr is the emergency manager appointed by the state to handle Detroit's long festering fiscal woes. He had tried to reach an agreement with creditors to stave off this bankruptcy. He could not.</p><p>Michigan Governor Rick Snyder who appointed Orr called this decision painful but says there was no other valuable option.</p><p>Detroit, as you heard, is the largest American city ever to file for bankruptcy -- in fact, by far the largest. Its long-term debt as high as $20 billion and not a lot of --</p><p>(CROSSDTASLK)</p><p>MATHISEN: So what do the creditors stand to lose on this? Often there is a restructuring. They get paid off at pennies on the dollar. Do we have any idea?</p><p>COHN: We don't. A federal judge first has to approve this. This was a request to go into the Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which is the municipal branch, just to speak of --</p><p>MATHISEN: A corporate bankruptcy.</p><p>COHN: Right.</p><p>So the judge has to go throw a three-month process in approving this, and then there's a whole reorganization plan they will have to work out agreements that they couldn't up to now with all the creditors including the pensioners.</p><p>GHARIB: This is just so shocking, that something like that is happening in the United States. And, you know, we've heard about state finances in trouble, city's finances in trouble. Is Detroit a one-time unique situation, or will we be hearing this about another major cities.</p><p>COHN: Well, you know, there has been a lot of talk about that for a while, since the financial crisis. Detroit for 40 years has been a place of extremes. Extreme racial strife, white flight, decline of the manufacturing base.</p><p>So, in a lot of ways, it isn't extreme, but maybe a cautionary tale. You know, this city that has had all of the issues that any municipality has had in terms of dealing with labor cost, dealing with pension cost, dealing with the decline in housing base. And so, other cities have to take a look at this.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, it's very interesting two of the largest bankruptcies we've had in the corporate world in recent years were in Detroit, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler. Those companies came out on the other side much, much stronger.</p><p>Can that happen for Detroit?</p><p>COHN: That certainly is the hope. And all the comments you're hearing now as this long-feared bankruptcy filing has finally happened are -- you know, Detroit will come out of this. Maybe this is -- this is something that even the people who were opposing this for the longest time seem to be conceding that it was necessary, that this was a necessary step.</p><p>Now, under bankruptcy, the whole purpose of the bankruptcy law is to allow the city to get out from under its debts, meet obligations with its creditors, reorganize and move on. And that's the goal here.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Scott Cohn, thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>GHARIB: Let's hope that happens.</p><p>Meanwhile, some wind was taken out of the sails of the Windy City today, too. Ratings agency Moody's Investors Services lowered Chicago's general obligation bond and sales tax ratings by three notches, citing the city's large and growing pension liabilities and budget pressures. The credit downgrade affects $8.2 billion of Chicago's bonds and sales stocks debt. Moody also says the outlook on the city is negative.</p><p>MATHISEN: Another twist in the long battle to take over Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), where shareholders were scheduled to vote today on the future of the company. But that didn't happen. So, what do shareholders think and what is next for the world's number three PC maker?</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has more from Dell's headquarters in Round Rock, Texas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINES REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A vote on Michael Dell's $24.4 billion deal with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners to take Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) private at $13.65 a share adjourned until next Wednesday. This as investor Carl Icahn and Southeastern Asset Management have put forth a competing proposal, one that keeps Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) public and values the company at $15.50 to $18 a share.</p><p>The pros for the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal, if the founder and CEO is the right person to lead the turnout, privately, without Wall Street scrutiny.</p><p>But Icahn's camp says that Dell's offer undervalues the company, and analysts wonder if the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) offer isn't opportunistic.</p><p>BRENT WILSEY, WILSEY ASSET MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Carl Icahn says, no, we can turn this company around publicly and shareholders will win from this. So I like Carl Icahn's plan much better than do Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) because Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is just -- yes, the company will turn around, he'll be well off from two years from now, but why can't the shareholders benefit from that?</p><p>DEANGELIS: Roughly 300-plus investors attended the meeting today at Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) headquarters in Round Rock, Texas. Some concerned about the adjournment and that it could send shares tumbling.</p><p>NORM PETERS, DELL SHAREHOLDER: I'm now worried and concerned, and realistically concerned. Yes, it's going to have an impact that there are thousands of us out there waiting to see what's going to happen because there is an option for us to make more money than the $13.65 that he's offering us at this point.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Carl Icahn and Southeastern taking their own view on today's development, saying in a statement, \"We believe that this delay reflects the unhappiness of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) stockholders with the Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)/Silver Lake offer, which we believe substantially undervalues the company. This is not time to delay but the time to move Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) forward.\"</p><p>(on camera): Investors came here today looking for a decision. But all they got was more uncertainty. Will Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) sweeten his offer and get his deal passed next week or will shareholders be reviewing Carl Icahn's offer at the annual meeting?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: A sigh of relief for Boeing (NYSE:BA) in the wake of a fire on board one of its 787 Dreamliners last week in London. Now, British aviation investigators are recommending that an emergency locating transmitter found on those aircraft made by Honeywell, not Boeing (NYSE:BA), be disabled.</p><p>MATHISEN: Earnings dominate tonight's \"Market Focus\" and we begin with United Healthcare. The Dow component and the nation's largest health insurers signed up almost 10 million new members and fewer people filed claims. That's a good recipe and that boosted quarterly revenues and profits. They beat analysts' estimates.</p><p>The company also increased its outlook for the year. Let's take a look at UNH shares, biggest gainers in the Dow, surging 6.5 percent today.</p><p>Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) reported a billion-dollar profit and said it plans to buyback 500 million shares, first since 2008. Revenue grew in all major businesses, trading in particular. The stock finished the day up 4 percent to $27.70.</p><p>And it was a case of good news/bad news for Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the nation's largest wireless carrier. First, let's give you the good news. It activated more iPhones than expected in the last quarter. And now the bad -- the company saw some weakness in it's traditional wire line unit, which pressured overall revenue. And separately, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is joining rivals AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile instituting an installment plan for customers who want to update their devices every year instead of current plan of every two years.</p><p>The stock finishing today lower by 1 1/2 percent. It closed at $49.97.</p><p>GHARIB: It was a tough day for Sherwin Williams. The paint maker reported disappointing second quarter results, issued a weak outlook for the current quarter and said that Mexican regulators rejected the bid to buy a paint company in that country. The stock plunged 8 percent to $167.94.</p><p>And earnings at Scholastic (NASDAQ:SCHL) tumbled 62 percent. This publisher of children's book is blaming weak sales of \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy and lower book club revenue per order. Next year, the company plans to focus on new educational technology program for the iPad, which it hopes will increase revenue.</p><p>Meanwhile, the stock was off by more than 8 percent today, to $29 and change.</p><p>MATHISEN: And still ahead, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) facing a record fine - - the allegation it manipulated energy markets, but it is the only firm accused recently of wrongdoing. Is there any way to stop businesses from behaving badly?</p><p>But, first, a look at how the international markets closed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase now faces what could be the biggest fine ever to settle allegations that it manipulated electricity markets in the Midwest and California. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is close to an agreement with the New York bank. That could mean a fine of nearly a half billion. But remember, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) made $6 billion in profit last quarter. So, a half billion-dollar fine would be less than 10 percent of one quarter's profits.</p><p>Some legal experts say fines for misconduct need to get a lot bigger to deter corporate misbehavior, of which there has seemingly been a lot lately.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): What's a $500 million fine or settlement to a company the size of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase? Not so much says attorney Melissa Maxman.</p><p>MELISSA MAXMAN, ATTORNEY: If the fines are astronomical at this point, on the other hand, the companies better being find astronomical amounts can afford it.</p><p>MATHISEN: Maxman has seen both sides. Once a federal prosecutor, she now defends companies accused of behaving badly.</p><p>MAXMAN: Sometimes companies do decide, make a financial decision to disregard a law or break a law, because it's in their financial interest to do it, and sometimes just as we all have done in the past, maybe in school or otherwise, you know, we think we won't get caught.</p><p>MATHISEN: But increasingly, they are, all around the globe.</p><p>Last year, British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty and agreed to U.S. civil and criminal penalties for $3 billion for unlawfully promoting prescription drugs among other offenses. It was the largest healthcare fraud settlement in history.</p><p>That was 1/3 of the record $9 billion in settlements negotiated by the federal government in 2012, nearly triple the recoveries in 2011, and 50 percent more than the previous record hold back in 2006.</p><p>Just this year, BP was sentenced in January to pay $4 billion, a record for an environmental crime stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf.</p><p>RBS Securities Japan agreed to pay $50 million fine in connection with the rigging of LIBOR rates, bringing the RBS and RBS Japan totals in that case alone to $612 million.</p><p>And in May, Walmart pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and was sentenced to pay a fine of more than $81 million.</p><p>Fines for antitrust and price-fixing allegations like the one JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase faces have grown the most in resent years, topping $5 billion in 2012.</p><p>And still says University of Baltimore law professor, Bob Lande, companies are willing to take the risk. Lande, along with co-author John Connor from Perdue, says we only catch about 25 percent of the market manipulators and at that rate, he says fines need to be five times what they have been. Lande also says people tied to fix pricing and other violations should be banned from their industries for life. That might be a deterrent.</p><p>But attorney Maxman figures her practice will stay busy no matter what.</p><p>MAXMAN; As long as profit maximization is going to be a primary motivator of a corporation, there will be incentives to bend the rules, cut corners.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Lawmakers are close to a deal that would lower the rate on new subsidized student loans just weeks after allowing them to double to 6.8 percent. A bipartisan would reverse that rate hike on new Stafford loans that went into effect on July 1st. So, if it passes, undergraduates will be able to borrow at a rate of 3.9 percent, graduate students at 4.9 percent, and parents can borrow at 6.4 percent.</p><p>And coming up on the program, hedge fund manager John Paulson famously bet against housing before the bust. Now, he's calling it the best investment anyone can make. But is it?</p><p>But, first, let's take a look at home commodities, treasuries and currencies performed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: The housing market has been red hot lately, and that may be why a California builder decided to go public on Wall Street. UCP began selling stock to the public for the first time today on the New York Stock Exchange. It's the fourth home builder to go public this year.</p><p>But UCP is off to a disappointing start. Its shares tumbled nearly 7 percent.</p><p>Looking at the three other homebuilders that also went public this year, William Lyon and Tri Pointe are trading below their IPO prices. But Taylor Morrison up about 14 percent.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, despite those disappointing IPOs, many investors are still bullish on housing. And one of them is the hedge fund manager John Paulson, who made more than a billion betting against the housing industry just before it collapsed, but it's now talking up housing in a big way. Listen to what he said yesterday about individual investment in housing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN PAULSON, PAULSON &amp; CO: I still feel buying a home is the best investment any individual can make. Affordability is still at an all-time high. It still costs less to own a home after tax than it does to rent.</p><p>So, if anyone bought a home last year, let's say for $100, you put down $20. Today, that home is worth $112. So you made $12 on a $20 investment, 60 percent return.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB: So, is John Paulson right on housing?</p><p>Our next guest disagrees. He's Yale's economics professor Robert Shiller, who is also the co-founder of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index.</p><p>Professor Shiller, so nice to have you on the program again. And really want to get your point of view of why you disagree with John Paulson.</p><p>ROBERT SHILLER, CASE-SHILLER INDEX CO-FOUNDER: I don't totally disagree. I think that home prices are moving up and they might for someone with a flipping plan whose going to get out, it might -- it might be an attractive investment.</p><p>But I think most people are not in that category. Most people are thinking of buy and hold. And for the longer run, I don't -- I don't think housing is a good investment, unless you want the house.</p><p>MATHISEN: So you think that in the short-term, if I'm going to flip the house, it's a better deal than in the long term if I'm going to stay there and own the house.</p><p>Without wading too deeply into the numbers, explain why.</p><p>SHILLER: Well, professional investors like John Paulson are very aware of anomalies in markets. One of them is momentum. It's been remarked in the stock market, I'm sure he knows that very well. It's also in the housing market.</p><p>And it has been much stronger in the housing market than in the stock market. So when home prices start going up, they will probably go -- I wrote a paper about this 20 years ago. It's really true. Home prices move in the same direction.</p><p>They're up 12 percent nationally in the last year. And so, they'll probably do something like that again for a year or so.</p><p>GHARIB: We've been raised to believe that, you know, our parents did this and the parents before them did this, that you buy a home, and you hold on to it and you're set for retirement.</p><p>SHILLER: Right.</p><p>GHARIB: And then we had the housing crisis. So, I get that.</p><p>But are you saying that going forward that that rule of thumb no longer exists? I mean, what really changed here?</p><p>SHILLER: Well, it -- it -- if you want a home and you want to live there, fine. It's -- you know, Paulson is right. There is a tax advantage to homeownership.</p><p>But the question in my mind is are you going to buy a bigger home than you need as an investment or are you going to buy a second home and there - - I think that it's not a good long-run prospect because historically, housing has not increased above the inflation rate. Home prices are down - - now, there's a big misperception that houses are cheap now. They're not generally cheap. They're just kind of back to an average level.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, your argument, basically, if I'm understanding you correctly, is after inflation basis, you're not going to make money owning a home?</p><p>SHILLER: The dividend comes in the form of a nice place to sleep, a family room, you know, a place --</p><p>MATHISEN: You get value from that. Yes, right.</p><p>SHILLER: That's it. Don't expect capital gain.</p><p>Now, it is true that mortgage rates are still very low and I think of it more as a mortgage market play that might be enticing people in for the longer term.</p><p>If you really plan to stay in a house for 30 years, you can get a 30- year mortgage rate that's still a little over 4 percent. That's very good by historical standards.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Interesting conversation, thank you so much Professor Shiller.</p><p>SHILLER: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: Robert Shiller of Yale University.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, television history was made today at the Emmy nominations. The political thriller \"House of Cards\" produced by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was nominated for best drama series, the first time a program that's only available through an online streaming service was recognized by the television industry's leading awards organization. \"House of Cards\" received nine nominations in all.</p><p>Also getting nominated, another popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) show, the situation comedy \"Arrested Development\" got three nods, including for series co-star Jason Bateman as best actor.</p><p>And before we go, which stocks would you like our market monitor guest to discuss tomorrow? You can let us know by logging on to our Web site, NBR.com and don't forget to include where you are from.</p><p>GHARIB: And next week, we also begin a five-part series on how to not outlive your money. So please join us for that and I guess you can't count on your home --</p><p>MATHISEN: To bail you out.</p><p>GHARIB: Yes, to bail you out according to Professor Shiller.</p><p>MATHISEN: You're going to be off tomorrow. Have a nice day off.</p><p>GHARIB: Thanks.</p><p>MATHISEN: Nice long weekend. Survive the heat.</p><p>GHARIB: And I'll be back on Monday.</p><p>But that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me as well. Have a great evening. Stay cool, everybody. See you back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) misses big, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls short -- but are tech  stocks still worth owning as the Dow and S&amp;P are at historic highs?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Detroit bankrupt.   The city filed for Chapter 9 protection, making it the largest city in U.S.  history to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB:  And, Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) drama.  Today was supposed to be the  day Dell's future was decided but a key shareholder vote was delayed.  So,  what happens next?</p><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Thursday, July 18th. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Welcome, everyone.  And good evening.</p><p>It is the heart of earning season and tonight, we heard from two of  the biggest names in technology.  That would be Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). </p><p>Seema Mody is here to break down numbers for us, which weren't so hot. </p><p>Let's start with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). </p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Let's start with  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tyler. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Oh, all right.  Great. </p><p>MODY:  It's reported (INAUDIBLE) -- it's reported a huge miss on the  bottom line with fourth quarter earnings with 66 cents a share, versus an  analyst estimate of 75 cents.  Revenues also came in weak.  Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been hurt by ongoing weakness in the P.C. market and the  ongoing consumer shift to tablets. </p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO (ph) Amy Hood says, \"While our fourth  quarter results were impacted by the decline in the P.C. market, we  continue to see strong demand for our enterprise and Cloud offerings.\"</p><p>One bright spot, Microsoft's entertainment and device business, which  includes Xbox game console.  That business saw a 7.5 percent jump in sales.   Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) while down after hours still up about 30  percent year-to-date. </p><p>Now, Tyler, on to that tech giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which reported  a huge miss, posting a quarterly profit of $3.2 billion up from $2.8  million.  Total revenue grew 19 percent to $14.1 billion, but that did not  satisfy Wall Street. </p><p>Another key number analysts looked for, cost per click, that's the  average price that charges advertisers every time someone clicks on their  ad on a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) web search engine.  That dropped year over  year. </p><p>On the conference call, CEO Larry Page talked about how when Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) started, they were just dealing one ecosystem, the P.C.  Now,  there are many devices, platforms and spaces to really penetrate and how  that's not only a challenge but also an opportunity for Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Seema, thank you very much.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it doesn't matter which  one you begin with.  Thanks very much, Seema Mody.</p><p>All right.  Joining us now to react to the numbers, Skip Aylesworth.   He's co-portfolio manager of the Hennessey Technology Fund. </p><p>Mr. Aylesworth, welcome.</p><p>Take your choice, which one do you want to start with here, Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and what did you think? </p><p>SKIP AYLESWORTH, HENNESSY TECHNOLOGY FUND:  Well, on the big picture,  probably a little disappointed in both.  Let's look at Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), though, because I think when you peel back the numbers here,  there were some positive things for the future.  One of those is research  and development are Cap X, which is an expense, which kept revenues down or  profits down.  For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), up about 30 percent this quarter.   So, an additional $400 million spend on R&amp;D and Cap X. </p><p>Second major issue of a positive nature is the head count shrunk,  almost 9,000 employees. </p><p>These are two positive elements for the future. </p><p>On the negative side --  </p><p>GHARIB:  I --  </p><p>AYLESWORTH:  Go ahead. </p><p>GHARIB:  I was going to jump in, Skip, and ask you about Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT).  What happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and especially  just coming off of this massive reorganization that they announced last  week, they have all of these product offerings. </p><p>Do you see anything here that says that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a  vision for where they are going for growth?</p><p>AYLESWORTH:  Well, I think as the CEO said, it's in these new  services, Cloud-based organizations -- Cloud-based offerings.  What's  really hurting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), of course, is it's relying on the  PC and windows environment -- much like the story of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) to  a certain extent and HP.  So they hurt on that but are trying to turn the  ship around and go down these other paths to generate new sources of  revenues. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Skip, both of the stocks have had pretty nice runs so far  this year.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at one point was one of the leading  stocks in the Dow so far this year. </p><p>Would you buy either of these stocks at today's prices?</p><p>AYLESWORTH:  I think that -- well, from an individual standpoint, it's  really -- your focus on the future, and I would be more positive on the  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) side than I would be on the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  side.  </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  --  </p><p>AYLESWORTH:  So I would buy the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). </p><p>GHARIB:  You would buy Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and I know you have Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) in your portfolio.</p><p>AYLESWORTH:  Yes.</p><p>GHARIB:  Would you buy it at $873?  Do they buy more? </p><p>AYLESWORTH:  I would -- any time you have a price decline like there  was aftermarket, it's a good time to add to positions, as long as you have  a long-term outlook. </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  Real quickly, we've seen the stock market hitting  all these new highs, but the technology stocks have been holding back a  bit.  Just, generally, on tech stocks, you run a tech fund.  What is your  view what's going on with tech overall? </p><p>AYLESWORTH:  Well, on the big tech names, it's very hard to see this  consistent growth just because the numbers are so large for both Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  A little shift of, quote, \"a  billion dollars\" is just a small percentage. </p><p>I think the opportunities and the small cap sector will provide and  might be more rewarding from an appreciation standing. </p><p>The overall environment, you know, technology is the key for  productivity increases and everybody likes the greatest and best new  widgets.  So, we're all awaiting Apple's next product.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Mr. Aylesworth, thank you very much.</p><p>Skip Aylesworth runs the Hennessy Technology Fund.</p><p>GHARIB:  New records on Wall Street today.  The Dow and S&amp;P 500 posted  fresh all time highs, thanks to another batch of positive news on earnings  and a drop in jobless claims.  Investors were also encouraged by more  reassuring words from Ben Bernanke.  In day two his testimony on Capitol  Hill, the Federal Reserve chairman told Senate lawmakers that the Fed will  continue stimulating the U.S. economy as long as necessary. </p><p>By the closing bell, the Dow rose 78 points to 15,549.  That's the new  record.  The NASDAQ added about a point, and the S&amp;P was up 8 1/2 points to  16.89. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, Susie, the city of Detroit has just become the  largest municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy.  The city's  state-appointed emergency manager, Kevin Orr, asked a federal judge for  permission to place the insolvent city in Chapter 9 protection. </p><p>Scott Cohn is with us with more on what that bankruptcy filing means  for the city and its residents and for its creditors. </p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  And for the  nation, Tyler. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Right.</p><p>COHN:  This is a major event.</p><p>Detroit, you know, once had 1.8 million residents.  Now, it has less  than half that.  It was the cradle of American manufacturing.  Today, a  shell of its former self, with vacant homes, blighted neighborhood, and an  unemployment rate in the metropolitan area of 9 percent, much higher in the  city proper. </p><p>Kevin Orr is the emergency manager appointed by the state to handle  Detroit's long festering fiscal woes.  He had tried to reach an agreement  with creditors to stave off this bankruptcy.  He could not. </p><p>Michigan Governor Rick Snyder who appointed Orr called this decision  painful but says there was no other valuable option. </p><p>Detroit, as you heard, is the largest American city ever to file for  bankruptcy -- in fact, by far the largest.  Its long-term debt as high as  $20 billion and not a lot of --  </p><p>(CROSSDTASLK)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So what do the creditors stand to lose on this?  Often  there is a restructuring.  They get paid off at pennies on the dollar.  Do  we have any idea?</p><p>COHN:  We don't.  A federal judge first has to approve this.  This was  a request to go into the Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which is the municipal  branch, just to speak of --  </p><p>MATHISEN:  A corporate bankruptcy.</p><p>COHN:  Right. </p><p>So the judge has to go throw a three-month process in approving this,  and then there's a whole reorganization plan they will have to work out  agreements that they couldn't up to now with all the creditors including  the pensioners. </p><p>GHARIB:  This is just so shocking, that something like that is  happening in the United States.  And, you know, we've heard about state  finances in trouble, city's finances in trouble.  Is Detroit a one-time  unique situation, or will we be hearing this about another major cities.</p><p>COHN:  Well, you know, there has been a lot of talk about that for a  while, since the financial crisis.  Detroit for 40 years has been a place  of extremes.  Extreme racial strife, white flight, decline of the  manufacturing base. </p><p>So, in a lot of ways, it isn't extreme, but maybe a cautionary tale.   You know, this city that has had all of the issues that any municipality  has had in terms of dealing with labor cost, dealing with pension cost,  dealing with the decline in housing base.  And so, other cities have to  take a look at this. </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, it's very interesting two of the largest  bankruptcies we've had in the corporate world in recent years were in  Detroit, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler.  Those companies came out  on the other side much, much stronger. </p><p>Can that happen for Detroit?</p><p>COHN:  That certainly is the hope.  And all the comments you're  hearing now as this long-feared bankruptcy filing has finally happened are  -- you know, Detroit will come out of this.  Maybe this is -- this is  something that even the people who were opposing this for the longest time  seem to be conceding that it was necessary, that this was a necessary step. </p><p>Now, under bankruptcy, the whole purpose of the bankruptcy law is to  allow the city to get out from under its debts, meet obligations with its  creditors, reorganize and move on.  And that's the goal here. </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Scott Cohn, thank you very much.  Appreciate  it.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Let's hope that happens.  </p><p>Meanwhile, some wind was taken out of the sails of the Windy City  today, too.  Ratings agency Moody's Investors Services lowered Chicago's  general obligation bond and sales tax ratings by three notches, citing the  city's large and growing pension liabilities and budget pressures.  The  credit downgrade affects $8.2 billion of Chicago's bonds and sales stocks  debt.  Moody also says the outlook on the city is negative. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Another twist in the long battle to take over Dell  (NASDAQ:DELL), where shareholders were scheduled to vote today on the  future of the company.  But that didn't happen.  So, what do shareholders  think and what is next for the world's number three PC maker? </p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has more from Dell's headquarters in Round Rock,  Texas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINES REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   A vote on Michael Dell's $24.4 billion deal with private equity firm Silver  Lake Partners to take Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) private at $13.65 a share  adjourned until next Wednesday.  This as investor Carl Icahn and  Southeastern Asset Management have put forth a competing proposal, one that  keeps Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) public and values the company at $15.50 to $18 a  share. </p><p>The pros for the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal, if the founder and CEO is  the right person to lead the turnout, privately, without Wall Street  scrutiny.</p><p>But Icahn's camp says that Dell's offer undervalues the company, and  analysts wonder if the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) offer isn't opportunistic. </p><p>BRENT WILSEY, WILSEY ASSET MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT:  Carl Icahn says, no,  we can turn this company around publicly and shareholders will win from  this.  So I like Carl Icahn's plan much better than do Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)  because Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is just -- yes, the company will turn  around, he'll be well off from two years from now, but why can't the  shareholders benefit from that?</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Roughly 300-plus investors attended the meeting today at  Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) headquarters in Round Rock, Texas.  Some concerned about  the adjournment and that it could send shares tumbling.</p><p>NORM PETERS, DELL SHAREHOLDER:  I'm now worried and concerned, and  realistically concerned.  Yes, it's going to have an impact that there are  thousands of us out there waiting to see what's going to happen because  there is an option for us to make more money than the $13.65 that he's  offering us at this point. </p><p>DEANGELIS:  Carl Icahn and Southeastern taking their own view on  today's development, saying in a statement, \"We believe that this delay  reflects the unhappiness of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) stockholders with the  Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)/Silver Lake offer, which we believe  substantially undervalues the company.  This is not time to delay but the  time to move Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) forward.\"</p><p>(on camera):  Investors came here today looking for a decision.  But  all they got was more uncertainty.  Will Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) sweeten  his offer and get his deal passed next week or will shareholders be  reviewing Carl Icahn's offer at the annual meeting? </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  A sigh of relief for Boeing (NYSE:BA) in the wake of a fire  on board one of its 787 Dreamliners last week in London.  Now, British  aviation investigators are recommending that an emergency locating  transmitter found on those aircraft made by Honeywell, not Boeing  (NYSE:BA), be disabled.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Earnings dominate tonight's \"Market Focus\" and we begin  with United Healthcare.  The Dow component and the nation's largest health  insurers signed up almost 10 million new members and fewer people filed  claims.  That's a good recipe and that boosted quarterly revenues and  profits.  They beat analysts' estimates. </p><p>The company also increased its outlook for the year.  Let's take a  look at UNH shares, biggest gainers in the Dow, surging 6.5 percent today. </p><p>Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) reported a billion-dollar  profit and said it plans to buyback 500 million shares, first since 2008.   Revenue grew in all major businesses, trading in particular.  The stock  finished the day up 4 percent to $27.70. </p><p>And it was a case of good news/bad news for Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the  nation's largest wireless carrier.  First, let's give you the good news.   It activated more iPhones than expected in the last quarter.  And now the  bad -- the company saw some weakness in it's traditional wire line unit,  which pressured overall revenue.  And separately, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is  joining rivals AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile instituting an installment plan  for customers who want to update their devices every year instead of  current plan of every two years. </p><p>The stock finishing today lower by 1 1/2 percent.  It closed at  $49.97.</p><p>GHARIB:  It was a tough day for Sherwin Williams.  The paint maker  reported disappointing second quarter results, issued a weak outlook for  the current quarter and said that Mexican regulators rejected the bid to  buy a paint company in that country.  The stock plunged 8 percent to  $167.94. </p><p>And earnings at Scholastic (NASDAQ:SCHL) tumbled 62 percent.  This  publisher of children's book is blaming weak sales of \"The Hunger Games\"  trilogy and lower book club revenue per order.  Next year, the company  plans to focus on new educational technology program for the iPad, which it  hopes will increase revenue. </p><p>Meanwhile, the stock was off by more than 8 percent today, to $29 and  change. </p><p>MATHISEN:  And still ahead, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) facing a record fine - - the allegation it manipulated energy markets, but it is the only firm  accused recently of wrongdoing.  Is there any way to stop businesses from  behaving badly?</p><p>But, first, a look at how the international markets closed today. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase now faces what could be the  biggest fine ever to settle allegations that it manipulated electricity  markets in the Midwest and California.  The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission is close to an agreement with the New York bank.  That could  mean a fine of nearly a half billion.  But remember, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)  made $6 billion in profit last quarter.  So, a half billion-dollar fine  would be less than 10 percent of one quarter's profits. </p><p>Some legal experts say fines for misconduct need to get a lot bigger  to deter corporate misbehavior, of which there has seemingly been a lot  lately. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over):  What's a $500 million fine or settlement to a  company the size of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase?  Not so much says attorney  Melissa Maxman.</p><p>MELISSA MAXMAN, ATTORNEY:  If the fines are astronomical at this  point, on the other hand, the companies better being find astronomical  amounts can afford it. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Maxman has seen both sides.  Once a federal prosecutor, she  now defends companies accused of behaving badly. </p><p>MAXMAN:  Sometimes companies do decide, make a financial decision to  disregard a law or break a law, because it's in their financial interest to  do it, and sometimes just as we all have done in the past, maybe in school  or otherwise, you know, we think we won't get caught. </p><p>MATHISEN:  But increasingly, they are, all around the globe. </p><p>Last year, British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty and agreed  to U.S. civil and criminal penalties for $3 billion for unlawfully  promoting prescription drugs among other offenses.  It was the largest  healthcare fraud settlement in history. </p><p>That was 1/3 of the record $9 billion in settlements negotiated by the  federal government in 2012, nearly triple the recoveries in 2011, and 50  percent more than the previous record hold back in 2006. </p><p>Just this year, BP was sentenced in January to pay $4 billion, a  record for an environmental crime stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon  spill in the Gulf.</p><p>RBS SecuritiesJapan agreed to pay $50 million fine in connection with  the rigging of LIBOR rates, bringing the RBS and RBS Japan totals in that  case alone to $612 million. </p><p>And in May, Walmart pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act  and was sentenced to pay a fine of more than $81 million. </p><p>Fines for antitrust and price-fixing allegations like the one JPMorgan  (NYSE:JPM) Chase faces have grown the most in resent years, topping $5  billion in 2012. </p><p>And still says University of Baltimore law professor, Bob Lande,  companies are willing to take the risk.  Lande, along with co-author John  Connor from Perdue, says we only catch about 25 percent of the market  manipulators and at that rate, he says fines need to be five times what  they have been.  Lande also says people tied to fix pricing and other  violations should be banned from their industries for life. That might be a  deterrent. </p><p>But attorney Maxman figures her practice will stay busy no matter  what. </p><p>MAXMAN;  As long as profit maximization is going to be a primary  motivator of a corporation, there will be incentives to bend the rules, cut  corners. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Lawmakers are close to a deal that would lower the rate on  new subsidized student loans just weeks after allowing them to double to  6.8 percent.  A bipartisan would reverse that rate hike on new Stafford  loans that went into effect on July 1st.  So, if it passes, undergraduates  will be able to borrow at a rate of 3.9 percent, graduate students at 4.9  percent, and parents can borrow at 6.4 percent.</p><p>And coming up on the program, hedge fund manager John Paulson famously  bet against housing before the bust.  Now, he's calling it the best  investment anyone can make.  But is it?</p><p>But, first, let's take a look at home commodities, treasuries and  currencies performed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB:  The housing market has been red hot lately, and that may be  why a California builder decided to go public on Wall Street.  UCP began  selling stock to the public for the first time today on the New York Stock  Exchange.  It's the fourth home builder to go public this year. </p><p>But UCP is off to a disappointing start.  Its shares tumbled nearly 7  percent. </p><p>Looking at the three other homebuilders that also went public this  year, William Lyon and Tri Pointe are trading below their IPO prices.  But  Taylor Morrison up about 14 percent.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, despite those disappointing IPOs, many investors are  still bullish on housing.  And one of them is the hedge fund manager John  Paulson, who made more than a billion betting against the housing industry  just before it collapsed, but it's now talking up housing in a big way.   Listen to what he said yesterday about individual investment in housing. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN PAULSON, PAULSON &amp; CO:  I still feel buying a home is the best  investment any individual can make.  Affordability is still at an all-time  high.  It still costs less to own a home after tax than it does to rent. </p><p>So, if anyone bought a home last year, let's say for $100, you put  down $20.  Today, that home is worth $112.  So you made $12 on a $20  investment, 60 percent return. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB:  So, is John Paulson right on housing? </p><p>Our next guest disagrees.  He's Yale's economics professor Robert  Shiller, who is also the co-founder of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. </p><p>Professor Shiller, so nice to have you on the program again.  And  really want to get your point of view of why you disagree with John  Paulson. </p><p>ROBERT SHILLER, CASE-SHILLER INDEX CO-FOUNDER:  I don't totally  disagree.  I think that home prices are moving up and they might for  someone with a flipping plan whose going to get out, it might -- it might  be an attractive investment. </p><p>But I think most people are not in that category.  Most people are  thinking of buy and hold.  And for the longer run, I don't -- I don't think  housing is a good investment, unless you want the house. </p><p>MATHISEN:  So you think that in the short-term, if I'm going to flip  the house, it's a better deal than in the long term if I'm going to stay  there and own the house. </p><p>Without wading too deeply into the numbers, explain why.</p><p>SHILLER:  Well, professional investors like John Paulson are very  aware of anomalies in markets.  One of them is momentum.  It's been  remarked in the stock market, I'm sure he knows that very well.  It's also  in the housing market.</p><p>And it has been much stronger in the housing market than in the stock  market.   So when home prices start going up, they will probably go -- I  wrote a paper about this 20 years ago.  It's really true.  Home prices move  in the same direction.</p><p>They're up 12 percent nationally in the last year.  And so, they'll  probably do something like that again for a year or so. </p><p>GHARIB:  We've been raised to believe that, you know, our parents did  this and the parents before them did this, that you buy a home, and you  hold on to it and you're set for retirement. </p><p>SHILLER:  Right. </p><p>GHARIB:  And then we had the housing crisis.  So, I get that. </p><p>But are you saying that going forward that that rule of thumb no  longer exists?  I mean, what really changed here? </p><p>SHILLER:  Well, it -- it -- if you want a home and you want to live  there, fine.  It's -- you know, Paulson is right.  There is a tax advantage  to homeownership. </p><p>But the question in my mind is are you going to buy a bigger home than  you need as an investment or are you going to buy a second home and there - - I think that it's not a good long-run prospect because historically,  housing has not increased above the inflation rate.  Home prices are down - - now, there's a big misperception that houses are cheap now.  They're not  generally cheap.  They're just kind of back to an average level. </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, your argument, basically, if I'm understanding you  correctly, is after inflation basis, you're not going to make money owning  a home?</p><p>SHILLER:  The dividend comes in the form of a nice place to sleep, a  family room, you know, a place --  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You get value from that.  Yes, right.</p><p>SHILLER:  That's it.  Don't expect capital gain. </p><p>Now, it is true that mortgage rates are still very low and I think of  it more as a mortgage market play that might be enticing people in for the  longer term. </p><p>If you really plan to stay in a house for 30 years, you can get a 30- year mortgage rate that's still a little over 4 percent.  That's very good  by historical standards. </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  Interesting conversation, thank you so much  Professor Shiller. </p><p>SHILLER:  Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB:  Robert Shiller of Yale University.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, television history was made today at the Emmy  nominations.  The political thriller \"House of Cards\" produced by Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) was nominated for best drama series, the first time a program  that's only available through an online streaming service was recognized by  the television industry's leading awards organization.  \"House of Cards\"  received nine nominations in all.</p><p>Also getting nominated, another popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) show,  the situation comedy \"Arrested Development\" got three nods, including for  series co-star Jason Bateman as best actor. </p><p>And before we go, which stocks would you like our market monitor guest  to discuss tomorrow?  You can let us know by logging on to our Web site,  NBR.com and don't forget to include where you are from. </p><p>GHARIB: And next week, we also begin a five-part series on how to not  outlive your money.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) misses big, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls short -- but are tech stocks still worth owning as the Dow and S&amp;P are at historic highs?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Detroit bankrupt. The city filed for Chapter 9 protection, making it the largest city in U.S. history to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GHARIB: And, Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) drama. Today was supposed to be the day Dell's future was decided but a key shareholder vote was delayed. So, what happens next?</p><p>We have all that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, July 18th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Welcome, everyone. And good evening.</p><p>It is the heart of earning season and tonight, we heard from two of the biggest names in technology. That would be Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>Seema Mody is here to break down numbers for us, which weren't so hot.</p><p>Let's start with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Let's start with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: Oh, all right. Great.</p><p>MODY: It's reported (INAUDIBLE) -- it's reported a huge miss on the bottom line with fourth quarter earnings with 66 cents a share, versus an analyst estimate of 75 cents. Revenues also came in weak. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been hurt by ongoing weakness in the P.C. market and the ongoing consumer shift to tablets.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO (ph) Amy Hood says, \"While our fourth quarter results were impacted by the decline in the P.C. market, we continue to see strong demand for our enterprise and Cloud offerings.\"</p><p>One bright spot, Microsoft's entertainment and device business, which includes Xbox game console. That business saw a 7.5 percent jump in sales. Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) while down after hours still up about 30 percent year-to-date.</p><p>Now, Tyler, on to that tech giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which reported a huge miss, posting a quarterly profit of $3.2 billion up from $2.8 million. Total revenue grew 19 percent to $14.1 billion, but that did not satisfy Wall Street.</p><p>Another key number analysts looked for, cost per click, that's the average price that charges advertisers every time someone clicks on their ad on a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) web search engine. That dropped year over year.</p><p>On the conference call, CEO Larry Page talked about how when Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) started, they were just dealing one ecosystem, the P.C. Now, there are many devices, platforms and spaces to really penetrate and how that's not only a challenge but also an opportunity for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Seema, thank you very much.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it doesn't matter which one you begin with. Thanks very much, Seema Mody.</p><p>All right. Joining us now to react to the numbers, Skip Aylesworth. He's co-portfolio manager of the Hennessey Technology Fund.</p><p>Mr. Aylesworth, welcome.</p><p>Take your choice, which one do you want to start with here, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and what did you think?</p><p>SKIP AYLESWORTH, HENNESSY TECHNOLOGY FUND: Well, on the big picture, probably a little disappointed in both. Let's look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), though, because I think when you peel back the numbers here, there were some positive things for the future. One of those is research and development are Cap X, which is an expense, which kept revenues down or profits down. For Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), up about 30 percent this quarter. So, an additional $400 million spend on R&amp;D and Cap X.</p><p>Second major issue of a positive nature is the head count shrunk, almost 9,000 employees.</p><p>These are two positive elements for the future.</p><p>On the negative side --</p><p>GHARIB: I --</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Go ahead.</p><p>GHARIB: I was going to jump in, Skip, and ask you about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). What happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and especially just coming off of this massive reorganization that they announced last week, they have all of these product offerings.</p><p>Do you see anything here that says that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a vision for where they are going for growth?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Well, I think as the CEO said, it's in these new services, Cloud-based organizations -- Cloud-based offerings. What's really hurting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), of course, is it's relying on the PC and windows environment -- much like the story of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) to a certain extent and HP. So they hurt on that but are trying to turn the ship around and go down these other paths to generate new sources of revenues.</p><p>MATHISEN: Skip, both of the stocks have had pretty nice runs so far this year. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at one point was one of the leading stocks in the Dow so far this year.</p><p>Would you buy either of these stocks at today's prices?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: I think that -- well, from an individual standpoint, it's really -- your focus on the future, and I would be more positive on the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) side than I would be on the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) side.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. --</p><p>AYLESWORTH: So I would buy the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>GHARIB: You would buy Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and I know you have Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in your portfolio.</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Yes.</p><p>GHARIB: Would you buy it at $873? Do they buy more?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: I would -- any time you have a price decline like there was aftermarket, it's a good time to add to positions, as long as you have a long-term outlook.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Real quickly, we've seen the stock market hitting all these new highs, but the technology stocks have been holding back a bit. Just, generally, on tech stocks, you run a tech fund. What is your view what's going on with tech overall?</p><p>AYLESWORTH: Well, on the big tech names, it's very hard to see this consistent growth just because the numbers are so large for both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). A little shift of, quote, \"a billion dollars\" is just a small percentage.</p><p>I think the opportunities and the small cap sector will provide and might be more rewarding from an appreciation standing.</p><p>The overall environment, you know, technology is the key for productivity increases and everybody likes the greatest and best new widgets. So, we're all awaiting Apple's next product.</p><p>MATHISEN: Mr. Aylesworth, thank you very much.</p><p>Skip Aylesworth runs the Hennessy Technology Fund.</p><p>GHARIB: New records on Wall Street today. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 posted fresh all time highs, thanks to another batch of positive news on earnings and a drop in jobless claims. Investors were also encouraged by more reassuring words from Ben Bernanke. In day two his testimony on Capitol Hill, the Federal Reserve chairman told Senate lawmakers that the Fed will continue stimulating the U.S. economy as long as necessary.</p><p>By the closing bell, the Dow rose 78 points to 15,549. That's the new record. The NASDAQ added about a point, and the S&amp;P was up 8 1/2 points to 16.89.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, Susie, the city of Detroit has just become the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy. The city's state-appointed emergency manager, Kevin Orr, asked a federal judge for permission to place the insolvent city in Chapter 9 protection.</p><p>Scott Cohn is with us with more on what that bankruptcy filing means for the city and its residents and for its creditors.</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: And for the nation, Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: Right.</p><p>COHN: This is a major event.</p><p>Detroit, you know, once had 1.8 million residents. Now, it has less than half that. It was the cradle of American manufacturing. Today, a shell of its former self, with vacant homes, blighted neighborhood, and an unemployment rate in the metropolitan area of 9 percent, much higher in the city proper.</p><p>Kevin Orr is the emergency manager appointed by the state to handle Detroit's long festering fiscal woes. He had tried to reach an agreement with creditors to stave off this bankruptcy. He could not.</p><p>Michigan Governor Rick Snyder who appointed Orr called this decision painful but says there was no other valuable option.</p><p>Detroit, as you heard, is the largest American city ever to file for bankruptcy -- in fact, by far the largest. Its long-term debt as high as $20 billion and not a lot of --</p><p>(CROSSDTASLK)</p><p>MATHISEN: So what do the creditors stand to lose on this? Often there is a restructuring. They get paid off at pennies on the dollar. Do we have any idea?</p><p>COHN: We don't. A federal judge first has to approve this. This was a request to go into the Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which is the municipal branch, just to speak of --</p><p>MATHISEN: A corporate bankruptcy.</p><p>COHN: Right.</p><p>So the judge has to go throw a three-month process in approving this, and then there's a whole reorganization plan they will have to work out agreements that they couldn't up to now with all the creditors including the pensioners.</p><p>GHARIB: This is just so shocking, that something like that is happening in the United States. And, you know, we've heard about state finances in trouble, city's finances in trouble. Is Detroit a one-time unique situation, or will we be hearing this about another major cities.</p><p>COHN: Well, you know, there has been a lot of talk about that for a while, since the financial crisis. Detroit for 40 years has been a place of extremes. Extreme racial strife, white flight, decline of the manufacturing base.</p><p>So, in a lot of ways, it isn't extreme, but maybe a cautionary tale. You know, this city that has had all of the issues that any municipality has had in terms of dealing with labor cost, dealing with pension cost, dealing with the decline in housing base. And so, other cities have to take a look at this.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, it's very interesting two of the largest bankruptcies we've had in the corporate world in recent years were in Detroit, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler. Those companies came out on the other side much, much stronger.</p><p>Can that happen for Detroit?</p><p>COHN: That certainly is the hope. And all the comments you're hearing now as this long-feared bankruptcy filing has finally happened are -- you know, Detroit will come out of this. Maybe this is -- this is something that even the people who were opposing this for the longest time seem to be conceding that it was necessary, that this was a necessary step.</p><p>Now, under bankruptcy, the whole purpose of the bankruptcy law is to allow the city to get out from under its debts, meet obligations with its creditors, reorganize and move on. And that's the goal here.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Scott Cohn, thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>GHARIB: Let's hope that happens.</p><p>Meanwhile, some wind was taken out of the sails of the Windy City today, too. Ratings agency Moody's Investors Services lowered Chicago's general obligation bond and sales tax ratings by three notches, citing the city's large and growing pension liabilities and budget pressures. The credit downgrade affects $8.2 billion of Chicago's bonds and sales stocks debt. Moody also says the outlook on the city is negative.</p><p>MATHISEN: Another twist in the long battle to take over Dell (NASDAQ:DELL), where shareholders were scheduled to vote today on the future of the company. But that didn't happen. So, what do shareholders think and what is next for the world's number three PC maker?</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has more from Dell's headquarters in Round Rock, Texas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINES REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A vote on Michael Dell's $24.4 billion deal with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners to take Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) private at $13.65 a share adjourned until next Wednesday. This as investor Carl Icahn and Southeastern Asset Management have put forth a competing proposal, one that keeps Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) public and values the company at $15.50 to $18 a share.</p><p>The pros for the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) deal, if the founder and CEO is the right person to lead the turnout, privately, without Wall Street scrutiny.</p><p>But Icahn's camp says that Dell's offer undervalues the company, and analysts wonder if the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) offer isn't opportunistic.</p><p>BRENT WILSEY, WILSEY ASSET MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Carl Icahn says, no, we can turn this company around publicly and shareholders will win from this. So I like Carl Icahn's plan much better than do Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) because Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) is just -- yes, the company will turn around, he'll be well off from two years from now, but why can't the shareholders benefit from that?</p><p>DEANGELIS: Roughly 300-plus investors attended the meeting today at Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) headquarters in Round Rock, Texas. Some concerned about the adjournment and that it could send shares tumbling.</p><p>NORM PETERS, DELL SHAREHOLDER: I'm now worried and concerned, and realistically concerned. Yes, it's going to have an impact that there are thousands of us out there waiting to see what's going to happen because there is an option for us to make more money than the $13.65 that he's offering us at this point.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Carl Icahn and Southeastern taking their own view on today's development, saying in a statement, \"We believe that this delay reflects the unhappiness of Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) stockholders with the Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)/Silver Lake offer, which we believe substantially undervalues the company. This is not time to delay but the time to move Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) forward.\"</p><p>(on camera): Investors came here today looking for a decision. But all they got was more uncertainty. Will Michael Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) sweeten his offer and get his deal passed next week or will shareholders be reviewing Carl Icahn's offer at the annual meeting?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: A sigh of relief for Boeing (NYSE:BA) in the wake of a fire on board one of its 787 Dreamliners last week in London. Now, British aviation investigators are recommending that an emergency locating transmitter found on those aircraft made by Honeywell, not Boeing (NYSE:BA), be disabled.</p><p>MATHISEN: Earnings dominate tonight's \"Market Focus\" and we begin with United Healthcare. The Dow component and the nation's largest health insurers signed up almost 10 million new members and fewer people filed claims. That's a good recipe and that boosted quarterly revenues and profits. They beat analysts' estimates.</p><p>The company also increased its outlook for the year. Let's take a look at UNH shares, biggest gainers in the Dow, surging 6.5 percent today.</p><p>Morgan Stanley (NASDAQ:NBXH) (NYSE:MS) reported a billion-dollar profit and said it plans to buyback 500 million shares, first since 2008. Revenue grew in all major businesses, trading in particular. The stock finished the day up 4 percent to $27.70.</p><p>And it was a case of good news/bad news for Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the nation's largest wireless carrier. First, let's give you the good news. It activated more iPhones than expected in the last quarter. And now the bad -- the company saw some weakness in it's traditional wire line unit, which pressured overall revenue. And separately, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is joining rivals AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile instituting an installment plan for customers who want to update their devices every year instead of current plan of every two years.</p><p>The stock finishing today lower by 1 1/2 percent. It closed at $49.97.</p><p>GHARIB: It was a tough day for Sherwin Williams. The paint maker reported disappointing second quarter results, issued a weak outlook for the current quarter and said that Mexican regulators rejected the bid to buy a paint company in that country. The stock plunged 8 percent to $167.94.</p><p>And earnings at Scholastic (NASDAQ:SCHL) tumbled 62 percent. This publisher of children's book is blaming weak sales of \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy and lower book club revenue per order. Next year, the company plans to focus on new educational technology program for the iPad, which it hopes will increase revenue.</p><p>Meanwhile, the stock was off by more than 8 percent today, to $29 and change.</p><p>MATHISEN: And still ahead, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) facing a record fine - - the allegation it manipulated energy markets, but it is the only firm accused recently of wrongdoing. Is there any way to stop businesses from behaving badly?</p><p>But, first, a look at how the international markets closed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase now faces what could be the biggest fine ever to settle allegations that it manipulated electricity markets in the Midwest and California. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is close to an agreement with the New York bank. That could mean a fine of nearly a half billion. But remember, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) made $6 billion in profit last quarter. So, a half billion-dollar fine would be less than 10 percent of one quarter's profits.</p><p>Some legal experts say fines for misconduct need to get a lot bigger to deter corporate misbehavior, of which there has seemingly been a lot lately.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): What's a $500 million fine or settlement to a company the size of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase? Not so much says attorney Melissa Maxman.</p><p>MELISSA MAXMAN, ATTORNEY: If the fines are astronomical at this point, on the other hand, the companies better being find astronomical amounts can afford it.</p><p>MATHISEN: Maxman has seen both sides. Once a federal prosecutor, she now defends companies accused of behaving badly.</p><p>MAXMAN: Sometimes companies do decide, make a financial decision to disregard a law or break a law, because it's in their financial interest to do it, and sometimes just as we all have done in the past, maybe in school or otherwise, you know, we think we won't get caught.</p><p>MATHISEN: But increasingly, they are, all around the globe.</p><p>Last year, British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty and agreed to U.S. civil and criminal penalties for $3 billion for unlawfully promoting prescription drugs among other offenses. It was the largest healthcare fraud settlement in history.</p><p>That was 1/3 of the record $9 billion in settlements negotiated by the federal government in 2012, nearly triple the recoveries in 2011, and 50 percent more than the previous record hold back in 2006.</p><p>Just this year, BP was sentenced in January to pay $4 billion, a record for an environmental crime stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf.</p><p>RBS Securities Japan agreed to pay $50 million fine in connection with the rigging of LIBOR rates, bringing the RBS and RBS Japan totals in that case alone to $612 million.</p><p>And in May, Walmart pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and was sentenced to pay a fine of more than $81 million.</p><p>Fines for antitrust and price-fixing allegations like the one JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase faces have grown the most in resent years, topping $5 billion in 2012.</p><p>And still says University of Baltimore law professor, Bob Lande, companies are willing to take the risk. Lande, along with co-author John Connor from Perdue, says we only catch about 25 percent of the market manipulators and at that rate, he says fines need to be five times what they have been. Lande also says people tied to fix pricing and other violations should be banned from their industries for life. That might be a deterrent.</p><p>But attorney Maxman figures her practice will stay busy no matter what.</p><p>MAXMAN; As long as profit maximization is going to be a primary motivator of a corporation, there will be incentives to bend the rules, cut corners.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Lawmakers are close to a deal that would lower the rate on new subsidized student loans just weeks after allowing them to double to 6.8 percent. A bipartisan would reverse that rate hike on new Stafford loans that went into effect on July 1st. So, if it passes, undergraduates will be able to borrow at a rate of 3.9 percent, graduate students at 4.9 percent, and parents can borrow at 6.4 percent.</p><p>And coming up on the program, hedge fund manager John Paulson famously bet against housing before the bust. Now, he's calling it the best investment anyone can make. But is it?</p><p>But, first, let's take a look at home commodities, treasuries and currencies performed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: The housing market has been red hot lately, and that may be why a California builder decided to go public on Wall Street. UCP began selling stock to the public for the first time today on the New York Stock Exchange. It's the fourth home builder to go public this year.</p><p>But UCP is off to a disappointing start. Its shares tumbled nearly 7 percent.</p><p>Looking at the three other homebuilders that also went public this year, William Lyon and Tri Pointe are trading below their IPO prices. But Taylor Morrison up about 14 percent.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, despite those disappointing IPOs, many investors are still bullish on housing. And one of them is the hedge fund manager John Paulson, who made more than a billion betting against the housing industry just before it collapsed, but it's now talking up housing in a big way. Listen to what he said yesterday about individual investment in housing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN PAULSON, PAULSON &amp; CO: I still feel buying a home is the best investment any individual can make. Affordability is still at an all-time high. It still costs less to own a home after tax than it does to rent.</p><p>So, if anyone bought a home last year, let's say for $100, you put down $20. Today, that home is worth $112. So you made $12 on a $20 investment, 60 percent return.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB: So, is John Paulson right on housing?</p><p>Our next guest disagrees. He's Yale's economics professor Robert Shiller, who is also the co-founder of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index.</p><p>Professor Shiller, so nice to have you on the program again. And really want to get your point of view of why you disagree with John Paulson.</p><p>ROBERT SHILLER, CASE-SHILLER INDEX CO-FOUNDER: I don't totally disagree. I think that home prices are moving up and they might for someone with a flipping plan whose going to get out, it might -- it might be an attractive investment.</p><p>But I think most people are not in that category. Most people are thinking of buy and hold. And for the longer run, I don't -- I don't think housing is a good investment, unless you want the house.</p><p>MATHISEN: So you think that in the short-term, if I'm going to flip the house, it's a better deal than in the long term if I'm going to stay there and own the house.</p><p>Without wading too deeply into the numbers, explain why.</p><p>SHILLER: Well, professional investors like John Paulson are very aware of anomalies in markets. One of them is momentum. It's been remarked in the stock market, I'm sure he knows that very well. It's also in the housing market.</p><p>And it has been much stronger in the housing market than in the stock market. So when home prices start going up, they will probably go -- I wrote a paper about this 20 years ago. It's really true. Home prices move in the same direction.</p><p>They're up 12 percent nationally in the last year. And so, they'll probably do something like that again for a year or so.</p><p>GHARIB: We've been raised to believe that, you know, our parents did this and the parents before them did this, that you buy a home, and you hold on to it and you're set for retirement.</p><p>SHILLER: Right.</p><p>GHARIB: And then we had the housing crisis. So, I get that.</p><p>But are you saying that going forward that that rule of thumb no longer exists? I mean, what really changed here?</p><p>SHILLER: Well, it -- it -- if you want a home and you want to live there, fine. It's -- you know, Paulson is right. There is a tax advantage to homeownership.</p><p>But the question in my mind is are you going to buy a bigger home than you need as an investment or are you going to buy a second home and there - - I think that it's not a good long-run prospect because historically, housing has not increased above the inflation rate. Home prices are down - - now, there's a big misperception that houses are cheap now. They're not generally cheap. They're just kind of back to an average level.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, your argument, basically, if I'm understanding you correctly, is after inflation basis, you're not going to make money owning a home?</p><p>SHILLER: The dividend comes in the form of a nice place to sleep, a family room, you know, a place --</p><p>MATHISEN: You get value from that. Yes, right.</p><p>SHILLER: That's it. Don't expect capital gain.</p><p>Now, it is true that mortgage rates are still very low and I think of it more as a mortgage market play that might be enticing people in for the longer term.</p><p>If you really plan to stay in a house for 30 years, you can get a 30- year mortgage rate that's still a little over 4 percent. That's very good by historical standards.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Interesting conversation, thank you so much Professor Shiller.</p><p>SHILLER: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: Robert Shiller of Yale University.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, television history was made today at the Emmy nominations. The political thriller \"House of Cards\" produced by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was nominated for best drama series, the first time a program that's only available through an online streaming service was recognized by the television industry's leading awards organization. \"House of Cards\" received nine nominations in all.</p><p>Also getting nominated, another popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) show, the situation comedy \"Arrested Development\" got three nods, including for series co-star Jason Bateman as best actor.</p><p>And before we go, which stocks would you like our market monitor guest to discuss tomorrow? You can let us know by logging on to our Web site, NBR.com and don't forget to include where you are from.</p><p>GHARIB: And next week, we also begin a five-part series on how to not outlive your money. So please join us for that and I guess you can't count on your home --</p><p>MATHISEN: To bail you out.</p><p>GHARIB: Yes, to bail you out according to Professor Shiller.</p><p>MATHISEN: You're going to be off tomorrow. Have a nice day off.</p><p>GHARIB: Thanks.</p><p>MATHISEN: Nice long weekend. Survive the heat.</p><p>GHARIB: And I'll be back on Monday.</p><p>But that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me as well. Have a great evening. Stay cool, everybody. See you back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) does not add as many new customers as hoped.  And the stocks  fall sharply in initial after hours trading.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Floor flight.  Delegates who opposed the nomination of Donald Trump stormed  the convention, putting a spotlight on the deep divisions within the party.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Drum beat of bad news.  We're being inundated by it globally and  domestically.  And even with stocks at record highs, it's something  investors need to pay attention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July  18th.  </p><p> Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is  off tonight.</p><p> A new record for stocks today.  But we begin with two big tech earnings  that could change the tone of trading tomorrow.  </p><p> First, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which disappointed investors when it said not  as many people as expected subscribe to the streaming service in the most  recent quarter.  Price hikes put off customers and contributed to the sharp  slowdown in user growth.  On the surface, the numbers looked pretty decent.   Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) earned 9 cents a share, beating estimates of 2 cents.   Revenue was in-line with expectations and up about 28 percent from a year  ago.  </p><p> But it was that subscriber number that sent shares lower initially in after  hours trading.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin has more on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) results.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big surprise in  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) earnings -- disappointing subscriber additions and  projections.  </p><p> The company added 1.7 million members in the quarter, compared to the 2.5  million that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) projected in its last earnings report.   Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) saying that while the number of new subscribers was  on target, the amount of turn or the number of people dropping the service  as a result of a price increase kicking in was higher than expected and  will continue to impact subscriber numbers in Q3.  </p><p>Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings saying in his letter to  shareholders that the disappointing numbers are not the result of  competition or market saturation, finishing the quarter with over 83  million members.  They believe that the opportunity ahead is as big as  ever.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And now to Dow component IBM, which saw its sales declined again,  and this came despite gains in its cloud and mobile computing units.  The  company earned $2.95 a share, and that was six cents better than  expectations.  Revenues also topped estimates.  But when compared to last  year, the results were 2 1/2 percent lower.  Shares of Big Blue rose in  after-hours trading.</p><p> And Susan Li tells us now, the key thing investors should focus on in IBM's  support.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A 17th straight quarter  of revenue declines for Big Blue.  But what analysts were looking for were  signs of improve in growth as CEO Ginny Rometty transitions IBM into cloud  and cognitive computing company.  (INAUDIBLE) beat in profits and in  revenue, IBM's cloud business grew 30 percent in the three months and the  business line that also houses Watson, yes, the cognitive computing  division, produced revenues that beat analyst estimates in the quarter as  well.</p><p> So, cloud, Watson, and cognitive computing, along with social and mobile  computing are the businesses that IBM is focused on to build their future.   They bundle this into the group called Strategic Imperatives, which IBM  hopes will make up 40 percent of revenues by the year 2018.  </p><p> But if you look closer at the latest report card, the Strategic Imperatives  already make up 38 percent of IBM's revenues, which seems to be way ahead  of schedule.  Shares are up so far this year, way out performing the  broader markets.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Susan Li.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And now to politics and to Cleveland, where the first day of the  Republican national convention was not without drama.  Opponents of the  presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump failed in their attempt to  hold a roll call vote to oppose his candidacy.  This is something the party  leaders had hoped to avoid.  </p><p> John Harwood joins us from the convention itself.  </p><p> And, John, a lot of frustration boiling over late in today's session.</p><p> JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Donald Trump is a  candidate who aroused strong feelings on the positive and negative.  He won  the primary fair and square.  He deserves to be the Republican nominee.  </p><p> Anti-Trump forces wanted to register their opposition.  They tried to force  a roll call vote.  They got signatures on petitions from a requisite number  of states.  But then the pro-Trump forces pushed back hard, got delegates  from three states to withdraw their petitions, the result of that was very  loud booing and a chaotic scene on the floor when one side was shouting  \"roll call vote, roll call vote.\"  The other side was shouting, we want  Trump, not what you want to see at a convention where the goal is to  present a united front to the rest of the country.  </p><p> HERERA:  Does it indicate that this is going to be kind of the business as  usual if you will for this particular convention?  There are a lot of  issues that are dividing all of those delegates?</p><p> HARWOOD:  Not clear.  It depends on how strongly the anti-Trump delegates  feel.  If they decide that they've had their say, they made their point.   If they're influenced by those who say you're only helping Hillary Clinton,  they may calm down and the rest of the convention may look -- it's not like  a typical convention, at least more like a typical convention.  </p><p> But there are some people predicting Donald Trump could get booed during  his nomination acceptance speech.  That would be an extraordinary scene.  </p><p> HERERA:  Now, Melania Trump, his wife, is going to be speaking tonight.   What do we expect to hear from her, and what is her role?</p><p> HARWOOD:  I think she's going to -- even though she's speaking on law and  order night at the Republican convention, try to display some of Donald  Trump's softer side.  She's going to talk a little about immigration.  </p><p> But the other thing to watch is that Donald Trump has indicated in  interviews, he may come to the podium and speak alongside Melania Trump or  before or after she speaks.  So, that's going to be quite interesting,  Donald Trump we know, likes microphones and there was --  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes.</p><p> HARWOOD:  There were includes earlier about whether he was going to speak  on all four nights.  Don't know if that's going to, but he may speak  tonight.  </p><p> HERERA:  What about the latest poll numbers, the NBC News \"Wall Street  Journal\" polls?  </p><p> HARWOOD:  Not good for Donald Trump.  Even after the FBI investigation and  James Comey, with that harsh criticism of Hillary Clinton.  Donald Trump  trails Hillary Clinton 46 to 41 percent.  That's a significant lead,  outside the poll's margin of error.  He trails in every region of he  country, except for the south, and he trails with all education categories  except those with only a high school education or less.  </p><p> That is not a promising picture at this point.  He's lagging behind where  Mitt Romney was in similar groups in 2012.  He's going to have to pick up  his game and the convention's game, the Thursday night convention  acceptance speech is going to be pivotal.  </p><p> HERERA:  Absolutely.  John, thanks as always for joining us.  We appreciate  it.  John Harwood at the convention in Cleveland.  </p><p> Well, the drama in Cleveland was not contained to inside the convention  center.  There was also a lot of activity outside, and a lot of money is  being spent to make sure that the protests are peaceful and that everyone  stays safe.  </p><p> Eamon Javers is there.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For the party  faithful, the Republican National Convention in Cleveland is the place  where the party parties.  And for others, it's a place to protest, and make  themselves here.</p><p> (CHANTING)</p><p> JAVERS:  But for law enforcement, it's a massive national security event  that comes at a high cost.  </p><p> The federal government made a $50 million security grant of which $30  million pays for employees here in Cleveland, $20 million pays for  equipment.  </p><p> All that includes 5,500 total officers assigned to RNC security, 10,000  extra handcuffs purchased for this event.  And 1,000 beds cleared in local  jails in case of mass arrests.  </p><p> CALVIN WILLIAMS, CLEVELAND POLICE CHIEF:  We want to make sure that the  demonstrators are safe walking through the streets of the city of  Cleveland, and we want to make sure we have enough officers to respond if  things turn otherwise.  </p><p> JAVERS:  To make sure it doesn't turn otherwise, a massive maze of fencing  stretching for miles, portable barriers in places to stop vehicles, the  shore line protected by a fleet of coast guard boats.  And on land, newly  purchased bikes and protective gear give police another option to stay  ahead of the protesters.  </p><p> And, of course, all of this focus on security comes in the wake of  tragedies in Dallas and in France, and over the weekend in Baton Rouge.   The theme of tonight's convention making America safe again.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eamon Javers, in Cleveland.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And now to foreign relations.  Turkey is one of America's most  important allies.  But in the days following the failed coup attempt, that  strategic alliance has been severely strained.  </p><p> Hadley Gamble reports tonight from Istanbul.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HADLEY GAMBLE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Just days after an  attempted coup in Turkey, more than 7,000 members of the military judiciary  and security services have been detained, and with the country's president  now calling for a reinstatement of the death penalty, many in the West  wonder how far this crackdown could go.  </p><p> JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE:  A NATO ally and a key partner to the E.U.   We stand squarely on the side of the elected leadership in Turkey.  We also  firmly urge the government of turkey to maintain calm and stability  throughout the country and we also urge the government of Turkey to uphold  the highest standards of respect for the nation's democratic institutions  and the rule of law.  </p><p> GAMBLE:  For the U.S. and Europe, a strong relationship with Turkey today  is crucial.  Turkey is supposed to be helping to send the flow of  terrorists along the so called jihadi highway, while putting a stop to the  flow of migrants and refugees overwhelming Europe.  All while using your  military, NATO's second largest, to shore up E.U. defenses in Europe.</p><p> But a crackdown that's rapidly turning, critics say into a witch hunt is  worrying world leaders and international investors alike, the stability of  this country, literally the bridge between Europe and Asia.</p><p> Turkey's stock market closed down 7 percent on Monday, after dipping down 9  basis points earlier in the day.  And while the lira pared back last  Friday's losses, the real concern continues to be foreign outflows and the  independence of the Central Bank, especially during this time of internal  crisis.  </p><p> And as details emerge about just how close the failed coup attempt came to  success, many in the West won't be reassured by just how close Turkey's  government came to collapse.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hadley Gamble, in Istanbul.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Back home on Wall Street, a new record was set for stocks as the  Dow's win streak was extended to seven straight days.  This despite that  political uncertainty in Turkey.  A big merger and some positive earnings  momentums helped support stocks.  And while the gains weren't big, they  were gains nonetheless.  </p><p> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16 points to 18,533.  The NASDAQ  added 26 and the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.  </p><p> Well, it does seem as though there's been a drumbeat of bad news, globally  and here at home.  And while stocks are near record levels, there are some  things investors need to pay at.  </p><p> Jack McIntyre is Brandywine's Global portfolio manager and he joins us  tonight.  Good to see you again, Jack.  Welcome back.  </p><p> JACK MCINTYRE, BRANDYWINE GLOBAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Thanks, Sue.  </p><p> HERERA:  It does seem as though there's kind of a litany of things.  You  can talk about the Brexit vote, the Turkey situation in which we just  detailed and the violence that we've seen in the last few days here at  home.  </p><p> Does it -- is this a confluence of events that should normally upset Wall  Street?  Or does it make our markets look better than other markets around  the world?  </p><p> MCINTYRE:  Well, I think when you take a step back -- and you're absolutely  right.  There's a headline of some negative news, but I think more  importantly, there's actually some positive developments going on.  It's  just -- you know, when you look at China is actually sort of doing some  pro-growth policies, the U.S., we're actually seeing a better economic  growth so far.  </p><p> These negative headlines haven't impacted consumer confidence.  I don't  think it will as long as housing and other areas of the U.S. economy do  better, and therefore, you can kind of extrapolate U.S. equities, I think  overall risk assets should be able to weather this sort of litany of some  negative headlines.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, if you're a long term investors, do you take a step back and  put all this negative news aside and revisit your plan and say, OK, we have  negative situations here, but I'm looking 10, 20 years out?  </p><p> MCINTYRE:  Yes.  So, you don't want to ignore it because a lot of this I  had -- Brexit and some other things are symptoms of the broader disease and  the broader disease being we're in a growth challenged world, but we're not  going into global recession.  You always want to have in your asset  allocation, some things that are a little more defensive that are going to  hold up in a risk off environment.  </p><p> We just don't think that you want to put your entire exposure in those  types of assets.  I mean, those are the ones that, for instance, U.S.  treasuries, I think they're over valued.  We've seen yields back up a  little bit.  I'm focusing on Fed policy, global monetary policy.  </p><p> A lot of these things globally are going to keep the Fed sidelined.  I  think that's going to be welcomed news by the financial markets.  I think  you've got to keep an eye on China.  China, the second largest economy, but  they have the largest sort of global footprint in terms of global growth.  </p><p> So, what comes out of China is more important than what happens in Turkey.  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, you mentioned the Fed, they've been pushed to the  sideline with all the headline risk news that's out there.  What camp do  you fall into?  Do you fall into the one and done camp in terms of raising  interest rates?  Or are you with those who say, we're not going to see an  increase in interest rates until the next year?  </p><p> MCINTYRE:  Yes, probably the latter camp.  The Fed is going to go slow.   This is a rate tightening cycle.  They're going to stay sidelined for quite  a while.  </p><p> The last FOMC, or the minutes -- you know, they talked a lot about global  development.  As long as we have some of these global issues, and again,  you look at Brexit, it's off the limelight, but we know there's some  uncertainty around that.  I think it's going to keep the Fed sort of on  hold until they see sustainable inflation pressures. </p><p> HERERA:  On that note, Jack, thank you very much for joining us.  Jack  McIntyre with Brandywine Global.</p><p> MCINTYRE:  My pleasure.</p><p> HERERA:  And still ahead, why home builders surprise pretty much everyone.   Their latest read on the market is coming up.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  Japan's Soft Bank is buying Britain's Armed Holdings.  The price  tag: Armed Holdings is one of Apple's suppliers and marks a big investment  for Soft Bank into the Internet of things, which refers to how home devices  connect on line.  The British government has called the deal a vote of  confidence in the country, following last month's vote to leave the E.U.  </p><p> Shares of Armed Holdings, which trade here as an ADR, soared 40 percent.   Take a look at shares of Spring which fell 5 percent.  Soft Bank owns  nearly 85 percent of that company and investors are interpreting the  acquisition of Armed as a sign that Soft Bank is not planning to invest  more money into Sprint.  </p><p> An earnings miss for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), highlighting the struggles the  Internet company faces.  Revenue beat expectations and was up about 5  percent from a year ago.  These results come almost four years to the day  that Marissa Mayer was named chief executive, with the goal of turning the  company around.  Shares were volatile in after hours trading.  </p><p> The bigger question, though, for investors about the future of the company  is Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) is closing in on the final bids for its core  businesses.  </p><p> Scott Kessler with S&amp;P global market intelligence follows Yahoo  (NASDAQ:YHOO) and he joins us now.</p><p> Good to see you, Scott.  Welcome back.  </p><p> SCOTT KESSLER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  Thanks a lot, Sue.</p><p> HERERA:  Let me start by asking you, whether Marissa Mayer has succeeded in  her mission of helping to turn the company around?  </p><p> KESSLER:  The answer in short is no.  She's been with the company for four  years.  And when she joined, I think she attracted a lot of interest and  generated a lot of enthusiasm and excitement.  But four years later, we're  looking at a no growth company with declining fundamentals on a trend  basis.  </p><p> So, you look quarter to quarter, you can see some upticks.  But the  reality, I think, according to all accounts is that Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) is  challenged at best and problematic at worst.  And I think that likely  predicted for the beginning of this year, she will no longer be the CEO of  Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) by the end of this year.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  Hence the auction that's coming up, who do you think - - or what are your odds as to who will win this auction?  </p><p> KESSLER:  So, what's interesting in our opinion is that Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)  interestingly has said very little on this subject.  Nonetheless,  unconfirmed reports have indicated multiple suitors, timelines, and  expectations for what's going to happen next.  </p><p> Our view is that the major U.S. telecommunications company is likely going  to be the prevailing suitor for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO).  They are most  obviously interested, they're most obviously resourced, meaning having  balance sheet and company size and strength.  And I think most importantly,  have the will to kind of take on what obviously is a pretty substantial  challenge.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, where does that lead?  Once the bids are in, and the decision  is made and it's awarded, where does that leave what's left of Yahoo  (NASDAQ:YHOO)?  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, what's interesting is, a lot of people have been talking  about, how much will the core operations of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) be valued  at in the context of a transaction and whether you include patents and real  estate.  The reality is, shorthand-wise, think of it like this, for every  dollar difference we're talking about in the price of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO),  that's a billion dollars for the market cap.  </p><p> So, if someone's going to bid $6 billion versus $5 billion, that's only the  difference of $1.  It's a reason why we don't think this amounts to much  from a shareholder perspective, for employees of the company, we think this  is huge, because they're going to have a new owner and new bosses and  arguably a new strategy.  </p><p> HERERA:  A new strategy.  All right.  Scott, thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> KESSLER:  Thanks, Sue.</p><p> HERERA:  Scott Kessler with S&amp;P global market intelligence.  </p><p> Quarterly profit falls nearly 20 percent of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).   That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> Lower interest rates weighed on earnings, those results came in ahead of  estimates.  The bank also saw revenue decline, but that too was better than  expected as higher deposit balances and an uptick in bond trading helps  stabilize results.  Shares were up 3 percent to $14.11.</p><p> The Brexit helped quarterly results at Charles Schwab.  The bank said it  took on more clients during late June, when the U.K. vote to leave the  European Union happened.  That helped revenue rise, and it topped  expectations.  Analysts also noted that a reduction in money market fees  was a big factor in helping to lift results.  Shares were up a tick to  $27.10.  </p><p> Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) posted higher than expected profit and revenue, thanks in  part to strong demand for toys based off the Disney (NYSE:DIS) movie's  \"Frozen\" and \"Star Wars\".  The makers of the Monopoly board game said,  starting in 2018 it will no longer sell products tied to the \"Jurassic  Park\" movies, after failing to reach a licensing renewal agreement with  Universal (NYSE:UVV) Studios.  Shares fell more than 6 percent to $79.82.  </p><p> U.S. authorities are investigating FiatChrysler.  The SEC and the Justice  Department are looking into whether the automaker reported fraudulent new  car sales numbers after two auto dealers field federal lawsuit against the  company.  Fiat/Chrysler said it's cooperating with the authorities.  Shares  were down fractionally to $6.73.</p><p> The nation's home builders lost a little faith in their market this month.   Foot traffic thinned out, while construction constraints remain.  </p><p> And as Diana Olick reports, the move lower in home builder sentiment was a  big surprise.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From as far away as  London and its Brexit vote, smack into the middle of the nation, where  Republicans are choosing their nominee, the U.S. housing market is feeling  all the effects.  Uncertainty is no longer the exception, but the rule, and  home builders are feeling each tremor.  A monthly reading of builder  confidence dropped unexpectedly in July.  </p><p> JERRY HOWARD, CEO NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS:  Home buyers are  as skittish as everybody in the world is skittish right now.  It's not just  the political landscape.  It's the geopolitical landscape.  You know, it's  the 24 hour news cycle of people aware of what's going on, that has to  impact everybody, including prospective home buyers.</p><p> OLICK:  Builder confidence is still in positive territory, but it hasn't  moved much since January.  Despite spring being the busy season for housing  and builder's especially.  </p><p> Besides consumer uncertainty, builders are still stymied by land and labor  issues, as well as increased regulation, especially out west where Tri  Pointe Homes does much of its business.  </p><p> DOUG BAUER, TRI POINTE HOMES CEO: When you're dealing with those types of  headwinds, it causes -- you know, it doesn't allow you to generate as much  housing and develop as much land as quickly as you like.  It just takes  longer over time.  It will get done.  But it just takes longer.</p><p> OLICK:  Bauer says Tri Pointe is uniquely positioned with 17,000 lots ready  to build in California.  Builders nationally recorded a slight drop in  current sales and buyer traffic, according to the monthly survey.  Their  sales expectations over the next six months dropped even more  significantly.</p><p> BAUER:  Home buying does have a certain amount of confidence factor to it.   So, you know, what happened in Britain and the political uncertainty of  going into this election cycle.  It was a pretty warm late June, the number  of the southwestern markets.  So, sales kind of tailed off a little bit.  </p><p> OLICK:  Builders are benefiting from the lack of supply of exiting homes  for sale.  But newly built homes like this one are pricier than their  exiting counterparts.  Even low mortgage rates are not making up for that  premium, in an economy where premiums are rising far faster than incomes.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, how the biggest energy reducing state lowered oil  prices and is now an economic success story.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  We recently reported that Utah was ranked by CNBC as the top state  for business.  The annual survey is in its 10th year, and over the past  decade, there is one state with the best cumulative score, Texas.  And it  wins by a mile.</p><p> Scott Cohn reports.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Texas does everything  big -- big places, big spaces, big energy, nearly twice as much total  energy production as its nearest competitor.  And yet, as energy prices  have plunged, Texas has barely missed a beat.  </p><p> NICK SAMUELS, MOODY'S VICE PRESIDENT:  Very prudently, Texas has one of the  biggest budget reserves of any state.  Its rainy day fund is $9.6 billion.  </p><p> COHN:  It is a far cry from 30 years ago, when collapsing oil prices  decimated the Texas economy.  One of every seven Texans lost their jobs.   Foreclosures soared, hundreds of banks failed.  </p><p> FEMALE TV ANCHOR:  The most costly bank rescue ever.  So big it will add a  burden to the national deficit.  </p><p> COHN:  Nothing like that to convince Texans to diversify.  </p><p> Energy production including oil is still the largest industry in Texas, but  it's no longer the only game in town.  Twenty-five years ago, Texas was  relying on oil for 25 percent of state revenue.  Today, it's less than half  that.  </p><p> The state's largest employer is not an oil company, but a supermarket  chain.  And while the energy industry has grown in the last 30 years, so  have other industries like health care.  Texas has dominated the top states  for business rankings the past ten years, never finishing lower than second  place.  Bu all that time, oil prices were high.  No one knew for certain  what might happen in the next oil shock.  Now they know.  </p><p> SAMUELS:  While the state's revenues are down in the current fiscal year,  following very strong growth coming out of the recession, the economic  strength of those other parts of the states have mitigated how severe the  drop might have been.  </p><p> COHN:  But the story may not be over.  The oil slump is less severe than  the '80s, and no one knows for certain how long it will last.  That means,  the state could still face fiscal pressures for some time to come.  But for  now, Texas is meeting the challenge in a big way.  </p><p> Scott Cohn, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, San Antonio, Texas.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  Thanks for joining us.

I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is  off tonight.</p><p>A new record for stocks today.  But we begin with two big tech earnings  that could change the tone of trading tomorrow.  </p><p>First, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which disappointed investors when it said not  as many people as expected subscribe to the streaming service in the most  recent quarter.  Price hikes put off customers and contributed to the sharp  slowdown in user growth.  On the surface, the numbers looked pretty decent.   Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) earned 9 cents a share, beating estimates of 2 cents.   Revenue was in-line with expectations and up about 28 percent from a year  ago.  </p><p>But it was that subscriber number that sent shares lower initially in after  hours trading.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin has more on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) results.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big surprise in  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) earnings -- disappointing subscriber additions and  projections.  </p><p>The company added 1.7 million members in the quarter, compared to the 2.5  million that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) projected in its last earnings report.   Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) saying that while the number of new subscribers was  on target, the amount of turn or the number of people dropping the service  as a result of a price increase kicking in was higher than expected and  will continue to impact subscriber numbers in Q3.  </p><p>Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings saying in his letter to  shareholders that the disappointing numbers are not the result of  competition or market saturation, finishing the quarter with over 83  million members.  They believe that the opportunity ahead is as big as  ever.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And now to Dow component IBM, which saw its sales declined again,  and this came despite gains in its cloud and mobile computing units.  The  company earned $2.95 a share, and that was six cents better than  expectations.  Revenues also topped estimates.  But when compared to last  year, the results were 2 1/2 percent lower.  Shares of Big Blue rose in  after-hours trading.</p><p>And Susan Li tells us now, the key thing investors should focus on in IBM's  support.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A 17th straight quarter  of revenue declines for Big Blue.  But what analysts were looking for were  signs of improve in growth as CEO Ginny Rometty transitions IBM into cloud  and cognitive computing company.  (INAUDIBLE) beat in profits and in  revenue, IBM's cloud business grew 30 percent in the three months and the  business line that also houses Watson, yes, the cognitive computing  division, produced revenues that beat analyst estimates in the quarter as  well.</p><p>So, cloud, Watson, and cognitive computing, along with social and mobile  computing are the businesses that IBM is focused on to build their future.   They bundle this into the group called Strategic Imperatives, which IBM  hopes will make up 40 percent of revenues by the year 2018.  </p><p>But if you look closer at the latest report card, the Strategic Imperatives  already make up 38 percent of IBM's revenues, which seems to be way ahead  of schedule.  Shares are up so far this year, way out performing the  broader markets.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Susan Li.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And now to politics and to Cleveland, where the first day of the  Republican national convention was not without drama.  Opponents of the  presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump failed in their attempt to  hold a roll call vote to oppose his candidacy.  This is something the party  leaders had hoped to avoid.  </p><p>John Harwood joins us from the convention itself.  </p><p>And, John, a lot of frustration boiling over late in today's session.</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Donald Trump is a  candidate who aroused strong feelings on the positive and negative.  He won  the primary fair and square.  He deserves to be the Republican nominee.  </p><p>Anti-Trump forces wanted to register their opposition.  They tried to force  a roll call vote.  They got signatures on petitions from a requisite number  of states.  But then the pro-Trump forces pushed back hard, got delegates  from three states to withdraw their petitions, the result of that was very  loud booing and a chaotic scene on the floor when one side was shouting  \"roll call vote, roll call vote.\"  The other side was shouting, we want  Trump, not what you want to see at a convention where the goal is to  present a united front to the rest of the country.  </p><p>HERERA:  Does it indicate that this is going to be kind of the business as  usual if you will for this particular convention?  There are a lot of  issues that are dividing all of those delegates?</p><p>HARWOOD:  Not clear.  It depends on how strongly the anti-Trump delegates  feel.  If they decide that they've had their say, they made their point.   If they're influenced by those who say you're only helping Hillary Clinton,  they may calm down and the rest of the convention may look -- it's not like  a typical convention, at least more like a typical convention.  </p><p>But there are some people predicting Donald Trump could get booed during  his nomination acceptance speech.  That would be an extraordinary scene.  </p><p>HERERA:  Now, Melania Trump, his wife, is going to be speaking tonight.   What do we expect to hear from her, and what is her role?</p><p>HARWOOD:  I think she's going to -- even though she's speaking on law and  order night at the Republican convention, try to display some of Donald  Trump's softer side.  She's going to talk a little about immigration.  </p><p>But the other thing to watch is that Donald Trump has indicated in  interviews, he may come to the podium and speak alongside Melania Trump or  before or after she speaks.  So, that's going to be quite interesting,  Donald Trump we know, likes microphones and there was --  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes.</p><p>HARWOOD:  There were includes earlier about whether he was going to speak  on all four nights.  Don't know if that's going to, but he may speak  tonight.  </p><p>HERERA:  What about the latest poll numbers, the NBC News \"Wall Street  Journal\" polls?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Not good for Donald Trump.  Even after the FBI investigation and  James Comey, with that harsh criticism of Hillary Clinton.  Donald Trump  trails Hillary Clinton 46 to 41 percent.  That's a significant lead,  outside the poll's margin of error.  He trails in every region of he  country, except for the south, and he trails with all education categories  except those with only a high school education or less.  </p><p>That is not a promising picture at this point.  He's lagging behind where  Mitt Romney was in similar groups in 2012.  He's going to have to pick up  his game and the convention's game, the Thursday night convention  acceptance speech is going to be pivotal.  </p><p>HERERA:  Absolutely.  John, thanks as always for joining us.  We appreciate  it.  John Harwood at the convention in Cleveland.  </p><p>Well, the drama in Cleveland was not contained to inside the convention  center.  There was also a lot of activity outside, and a lot of money is  being spent to make sure that the protests are peaceful and that everyone  stays safe.  </p><p>Eamon Javers is there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For the party  faithful, the Republican National Convention in Cleveland is the place  where the party parties.  And for others, it's a place to protest, and make  themselves here.</p><p>(CHANTING)</p><p>JAVERS:  But for law enforcement, it's a massive national security event  that comes at a high cost.  </p><p>The federal government made a $50 million security grant of which $30  million pays for employees here in Cleveland, $20 million pays for  equipment.  </p><p>All that includes 5,500 total officers assigned to RNC security, 10,000  extra handcuffs purchased for this event.  And 1,000 beds cleared in local  jails in case of mass arrests.  </p><p>CALVIN WILLIAMS, CLEVELAND POLICE CHIEF:  We want to make sure that the  demonstrators are safe walking through the streets of the city of  Cleveland, and we want to make sure we have enough officers to respond if  things turn otherwise.  </p><p>JAVERS:  To make sure it doesn't turn otherwise, a massive maze of fencing  stretching for miles, portable barriers in places to stop vehicles, the  shore line protected by a fleet of coast guard boats.  And on land, newly  purchased bikes and protective gear give police another option to stay  ahead of the protesters.  </p><p>And, of course, all of this focus on security comes in the wake of  tragedies in Dallas and in France, and over the weekend in Baton Rouge.   The theme of tonight's convention making America safe again.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eamon Javers, in Cleveland.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And now to foreign relations.  Turkey is one of America's most  important allies.  But in the days following the failed coup attempt, that  strategic alliance has been severely strained.  </p><p>Hadley Gamble reports tonight from Istanbul.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HADLEY GAMBLE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Just days after an  attempted coup in Turkey, more than 7,000 members of the military judiciary  and security services have been detained, and with the country's president  now calling for a reinstatement of the death penalty, many in the West  wonder how far this crackdown could go.  </p><p>JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE:  A NATO ally and a key partner to the E.U.   We stand squarely on the side of the elected leadership in Turkey.  We also  firmly urge the government of turkey to maintain calm and stability  throughout the country and we also urge the government of Turkey to uphold  the highest standards of respect for the nation's democratic institutions  and the rule of law.  </p><p>GAMBLE:  For the U.S. and Europe, a strong relationship with Turkey today  is crucial.  Turkey is supposed to be helping to send the flow of  terrorists along the so called jihadi highway, while putting a stop to the  flow of migrants and refugees overwhelming Europe.  All while using your  military, NATO's second largest, to shore up E.U. defenses in Europe.</p><p>But a crackdown that's rapidly turning, critics say into a witch hunt is  worrying world leaders and international investors alike, the stability of  this country, literally the bridge between Europe and Asia.</p><p>Turkey's stock market closed down 7 percent on Monday, after dipping down 9  basis points earlier in the day.  And while the lira pared back last  Friday's losses, the real concern continues to be foreign outflows and the  independence of the Central Bank, especially during this time of internal  crisis.  </p><p>And as details emerge about just how close the failed coup attempt came to  success, many in the West won't be reassured by just how close Turkey's  government came to collapse.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hadley Gamble, in Istanbul.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Back home on Wall Street, a new record was set for stocks as the  Dow's win streak was extended to seven straight days.  This despite that  political uncertainty in Turkey.  A big merger and some positive earnings  momentums helped support stocks.  And while the gains weren't big, they  were gains nonetheless.  </p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16 points to 18,533.  The NASDAQ  added 26 and the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.  </p><p>Well, it does seem as though there's been a drumbeat of bad news, globally  and here at home.  And while stocks are near record levels, there are some  things investors need to pay at.  </p><p>Jack McIntyre is Brandywine's Global portfolio manager and he joins us  tonight.  Good to see you again, Jack.  Welcome back.  </p><p>JACK MCINTYRE, BRANDYWINE GLOBAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Thanks, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  It does seem as though there's kind of a litany of things.  You  can talk about the Brexit vote, the Turkey situation in which we just  detailed and the violence that we've seen in the last few days here at  home.  </p><p>Does it -- is this a confluence of events that should normally upset Wall  Street?  Or does it make our markets look better than other markets around  the world?  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  Well, I think when you take a step back -- and you're absolutely  right.  There's a headline of some negative news, but I think more  importantly, there's actually some positive developments going on.  It's  just -- you know, when you look at China is actually sort of doing some  pro-growth policies, the U.S., we're actually seeing a better economic  growth so far.  </p><p>These negative headlines haven't impacted consumer confidence.  I don't  think it will as long as housing and other areas of the U.S. economy do  better, and therefore, you can kind of extrapolate U.S. equities, I think  overall risk assets should be able to weather this sort of litany of some  negative headlines.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, if you're a long term investors, do you take a step back and  put all this negative news aside and revisit your plan and say, OK, we have  negative situations here, but I'm looking 10, 20 years out?  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  Yes.  So, you don't want to ignore it because a lot of this I  had -- Brexit and some other things are symptoms of the broader disease and  the broader disease being we're in a growth challenged world, but we're not  going into global recession.  You always want to have in your asset  allocation, some things that are a little more defensive that are going to  hold up in a risk off environment.  </p><p>We just don't think that you want to put your entire exposure in those  types of assets.  I mean, those are the ones that, for instance, U.S.  treasuries, I think they're over valued.  We've seen yields back up a  little bit.  I'm focusing on Fed policy, global monetary policy.  </p><p>A lot of these things globally are going to keep the Fed sidelined.  I  think that's going to be welcomed news by the financial markets.  I think  you've got to keep an eye on China.  China, the second largest economy, but  they have the largest sort of global footprint in terms of global growth.  </p><p>So, what comes out of China is more important than what happens in Turkey.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, you mentioned the Fed, they've been pushed to the  sideline with all the headline risk news that's out there.  What camp do  you fall into?  Do you fall into the one and done camp in terms of raising  interest rates?  Or are you with those who say, we're not going to see an  increase in interest rates until the next year?  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  Yes, probably the latter camp.  The Fed is going to go slow.   This is a rate tightening cycle.  They're going to stay sidelined for quite  a while.  </p><p>The last FOMC, or the minutes -- you know, they talked a lot about global  development.  As long as we have some of these global issues, and again,  you look at Brexit, it's off the limelight, but we know there's some  uncertainty around that.  I think it's going to keep the Fed sort of on  hold until they see sustainable inflation pressures. </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Jack, thank you very much for joining us.  Jack  McIntyre with Brandywine Global.</p><p>MCINTYRE:  My pleasure.</p><p>HERERA:  And still ahead, why home builders surprise pretty much everyone.   Their latest read on the market is coming up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Japan's Soft Bank is buying Britain's Armed Holdings.  The price  tag: Armed Holdings is one of Apple's suppliers and marks a big investment  for Soft Bank into the Internet of things, which refers to how home devices  connect on line.  The British government has called the deal a vote of  confidence in the country, following last month's vote to leave the E.U.  </p><p>Shares of Armed Holdings, which trade here as an ADR, soared 40 percent.   Take a look at shares of Spring which fell 5 percent.  Soft Bank owns  nearly 85 percent of that company and investors are interpreting the  acquisition of Armed as a sign that Soft Bank is not planning to invest  more money into Sprint.  </p><p>An earnings miss for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), highlighting the struggles the  Internet company faces.  Revenue beat expectations and was up about 5  percent from a year ago.  These results come almost four years to the day  that Marissa Mayer was named chief executive, with the goal of turning the  company around.  Shares were volatile in after hours trading.  </p><p>The bigger question, though, for investors about the future of the company  is Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) is closing in on the final bids for its core  businesses.  </p><p>Scott Kessler with S&amp;P global market intelligence follows Yahoo  (NASDAQ:YHOO) and he joins us now.</p><p>Good to see you, Scott.  Welcome back.  </p><p>SCOTT KESSLER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  Thanks a lot, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  Let me start by asking you, whether Marissa Mayer has succeeded in  her mission of helping to turn the company around?  </p><p>KESSLER:  The answer in short is no.  She's been with the company for four  years.  And when she joined, I think she attracted a lot of interest and  generated a lot of enthusiasm and excitement.  But four years later, we're  looking at a no growth company with declining fundamentals on a trend  basis.  </p><p>So, you look quarter to quarter, you can see some upticks.  But the  reality, I think, according to all accounts is that Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) is  challenged at best and problematic at worst.  And I think that likely  predicted for the beginning of this year, she will no longer be the CEO of  Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) by the end of this year.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Hence the auction that's coming up, who do you think - - or what are your odds as to who will win this auction?  </p><p>KESSLER:  So, what's interesting in our opinion is that Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)  interestingly has said very little on this subject.  Nonetheless,  unconfirmed reports have indicated multiple suitors, timelines, and  expectations for what's going to happen next.  </p><p>Our view is that the major U.S. telecommunications company is likely going  to be the prevailing suitor for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO).  They are most  obviously interested, they're most obviously resourced, meaning having  balance sheet and company size and strength.  And I think most importantly,  have the will to kind of take on what obviously is a pretty substantial  challenge.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, where does that lead?  Once the bids are in, and the decision  is made and it's awarded, where does that leave what's left of Yahoo  (NASDAQ:YHOO)?  </p><p>KESSLER:  Well, what's interesting is, a lot of people have been talking  about, how much will the core operations of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) be valued  at in the context of a transaction and whether you include patents and real  estate.  The reality is, shorthand-wise, think of it like this, for every  dollar difference we're talking about in the price of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO),  that's a billion dollars for the market cap.  </p><p>So, if someone's going to bid $6 billion versus $5 billion, that's only the  difference of $1.  It's a reason why we don't think this amounts to much  from a shareholder perspective, for employees of the company, we think this  is huge, because they're going to have a new owner and new bosses and  arguably a new strategy.  </p><p>HERERA:  A new strategy.  All right.  Scott, thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>KESSLER:  Thanks, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  Scott Kessler with S&amp;P global market intelligence.  </p><p>Quarterly profit falls nearly 20 percent of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).   That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>Lower interest rates weighed on earnings, those results came in ahead of  estimates.  The bank also saw revenue decline, but that too was better than  expected as higher deposit balances and an uptick in bond trading helps  stabilize results.  Shares were up 3 percent to $14.11.</p><p>The Brexit helped quarterly results at Charles Schwab.  The bank said it  took on more clients during late June, when the U.K. vote to leave the  European Union happened.  That helped revenue rise, and it topped  expectations.  Analysts also noted that a reduction in money market fees  was a big factor in helping to lift results.  Shares were up a tick to  $27.10.  </p><p>Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) posted higher than expected profit and revenue, thanks in  part to strong demand for toys based off the Disney (NYSE:DIS) movie's  \"Frozen\" and \"Star Wars\".  The makers of the Monopoly board game said,  starting in 2018 it will no longer sell products tied to the \"Jurassic  Park\" movies, after failing to reach a licensing renewal agreement with  Universal (NYSE:UVV) Studios.  Shares fell more than 6 percent to $79.82.  </p><p>U.S. authorities are investigating FiatChrysler.  The SEC and the Justice  Department are looking into whether the automaker reported fraudulent new  car sales numbers after two auto dealers field federal lawsuit against the  company.  Fiat/Chrysler said it's cooperating with the authorities.  Shares  were down fractionally to $6.73.</p><p>The nation's home builders lost a little faith in their market this month.   Foot traffic thinned out, while construction constraints remain.  </p><p>And as Diana Olick reports, the move lower in home builder sentiment was a  big surprise.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From as far away as  London and its Brexit vote, smack into the middle of the nation, where  Republicans are choosing their nominee, the U.S. housing market is feeling  all the effects.  Uncertainty is no longer the exception, but the rule, and  home builders are feeling each tremor.  A monthly reading of builder  confidence dropped unexpectedly in July.  </p><p>JERRY HOWARD, CEO NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS:  Home buyers are  as skittish as everybody in the world is skittish right now.  It's not just  the political landscape.  It's the geopolitical landscape.  You know, it's  the 24 hour news cycle of people aware of what's going on, that has to  impact everybody, including prospective home buyers.</p><p>OLICK:  Builder confidence is still in positive territory, but it hasn't  moved much since January.  Despite spring being the busy season for housing  and builder's especially.  </p><p>Besides consumer uncertainty, builders are still stymied by land and labor  issues, as well as increased regulation, especially out west where Tri  Pointe Homes does much of its business.  </p><p>DOUG BAUER, TRI POINTE HOMES CEO: When you're dealing with those types of  headwinds, it causes -- you know, it doesn't allow you to generate as much  housing and develop as much land as quickly as you like.  It just takes  longer over time.  It will get done.  But it just takes longer.</p><p>OLICK:  Bauer says Tri Pointe is uniquely positioned with 17,000 lots ready  to build in California.  Builders nationally recorded a slight drop in  current sales and buyer traffic, according to the monthly survey.  Their  sales expectations over the next six months dropped even more  significantly.</p><p>BAUER:  Home buying does have a certain amount of confidence factor to it.   So, you know, what happened in Britain and the political uncertainty of  going into this election cycle.  It was a pretty warm late June, the number  of the southwestern markets.  So, sales kind of tailed off a little bit.  </p><p>OLICK:  Builders are benefiting from the lack of supply of exiting homes  for sale.  But newly built homes like this one are pricier than their  exiting counterparts.  Even low mortgage rates are not making up for that  premium, in an economy where premiums are rising far faster than incomes.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, how the biggest energy reducing state lowered oil  prices and is now an economic success story.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  We recently reported that Utah was ranked by CNBC as the top state  for business.  The annual survey is in its 10th year, and over the past  decade, there is one state with the best cumulative score, Texas.  And it  wins by a mile.</p><p>Scott Cohn reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Texas does everything  big -- big places, big spaces, big energy, nearly twice as much total  energy production as its nearest competitor.  And yet, as energy prices  have plunged, Texas has barely missed a beat.  </p><p>NICK SAMUELS, MOODY'S VICE PRESIDENT:  Very prudently, Texas has one of the  biggest budget reserves of any state.  Its rainy day fund is $9.6 billion.  </p><p>COHN:  It is a far cry from 30 years ago, when collapsing oil prices  decimated the Texas economy.  One of every seven Texans lost their jobs.   Foreclosures soared, hundreds of banks failed.  </p><p>FEMALE TV ANCHOR:  The most costly bank rescue ever.  So big it will add a  burden to the national deficit.  </p><p>COHN:  Nothing like that to convince Texans to diversify.  </p><p>Energy production including oil is still the largest industry in Texas, but  it's no longer the only game in town.  Twenty-five years ago, Texas was  relying on oil for 25 percent of state revenue.  Today, it's less than half  that.  </p><p>The state's largest employer is not an oil company, but a supermarket  chain.  And while the energy industry has grown in the last 30 years, so  have other industries like health care.  Texas has dominated the top states  for business rankings the past ten years, never finishing lower than second  place.  Bu all that time, oil prices were high.  No one knew for certain  what might happen in the next oil shock.  Now they know.  </p><p>SAMUELS:  While the state's revenues are down in the current fiscal year,  following very strong growth coming out of the recession, the economic  strength of those other parts of the states have mitigated how severe the  drop might have been.  </p><p>COHN:  But the story may not be over.  The oil slump is less severe than  the '80s, and no one knows for certain how long it will last.  That means,  the state could still face fiscal pressures for some time to come.  But for  now, Texas is meeting the challenge in a big way.  </p><p>Scott Cohn, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, San Antonio, Texas.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  Thanks for joining us.

I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is  off tonight.</p><p> A new record for stocks today.  But we begin with two big tech earnings  that could change the tone of trading tomorrow.  </p><p> First, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which disappointed investors when it said not  as many people as expected subscribe to the streaming service in the most  recent quarter.  Price hikes put off customers and contributed to the sharp  slowdown in user growth.  On the surface, the numbers looked pretty decent.   Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) earned 9 cents a share, beating estimates of 2 cents.   Revenue was in-line with expectations and up about 28 percent from a year  ago.  </p><p> But it was that subscriber number that sent shares lower initially in after  hours trading.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin has more on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) results.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big surprise in  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) earnings -- disappointing subscriber additions and  projections.  </p><p> The company added 1.7 million members in the quarter, compared to the 2.5  million that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) projected in its last earnings report.   Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) saying that while the number of new subscribers was  on target, the amount of turn or the number of people dropping the service  as a result of a price increase kicking in was higher than expected and  will continue to impact subscriber numbers in Q3.  </p><p>Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings saying in his letter to  shareholders that the disappointing numbers are not the result of  competition or market saturation, finishing the quarter with over 83  million members.  They believe that the opportunity ahead is as big as  ever.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And now to Dow component IBM, which saw its sales declined again,  and this came despite gains in its cloud and mobile computing units.  The  company earned $2.95 a share, and that was six cents better than  expectations.  Revenues also topped estimates.  But when compared to last  year, the results were 2 1/2 percent lower.  Shares of Big Blue rose in  after-hours trading.</p><p> And Susan Li tells us now, the key thing investors should focus on in IBM's  support.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A 17th straight quarter  of revenue declines for Big Blue.  But what analysts were looking for were  signs of improve in growth as CEO Ginny Rometty transitions IBM into cloud  and cognitive computing company.  (INAUDIBLE) beat in profits and in  revenue, IBM's cloud business grew 30 percent in the three months and the  business line that also houses Watson, yes, the cognitive computing  division, produced revenues that beat analyst estimates in the quarter as  well.</p><p> So, cloud, Watson, and cognitive computing, along with social and mobile  computing are the businesses that IBM is focused on to build their future.   They bundle this into the group called Strategic Imperatives, which IBM  hopes will make up 40 percent of revenues by the year 2018.  </p><p> But if you look closer at the latest report card, the Strategic Imperatives  already make up 38 percent of IBM's revenues, which seems to be way ahead  of schedule.  Shares are up so far this year, way out performing the  broader markets.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Susan Li.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And now to politics and to Cleveland, where the first day of the  Republican national convention was not without drama.  Opponents of the  presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump failed in their attempt to  hold a roll call vote to oppose his candidacy.  This is something the party  leaders had hoped to avoid.  </p><p> John Harwood joins us from the convention itself.  </p><p> And, John, a lot of frustration boiling over late in today's session.</p><p> JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Donald Trump is a  candidate who aroused strong feelings on the positive and negative.  He won  the primary fair and square.  He deserves to be the Republican nominee.  </p><p> Anti-Trump forces wanted to register their opposition.  They tried to force  a roll call vote.  They got signatures on petitions from a requisite number  of states.  But then the pro-Trump forces pushed back hard, got delegates  from three states to withdraw their petitions, the result of that was very  loud booing and a chaotic scene on the floor when one side was shouting  \"roll call vote, roll call vote.\"  The other side was shouting, we want  Trump, not what you want to see at a convention where the goal is to  present a united front to the rest of the country.  </p><p> HERERA:  Does it indicate that this is going to be kind of the business as  usual if you will for this particular convention?  There are a lot of  issues that are dividing all of those delegates?</p><p> HARWOOD:  Not clear.  It depends on how strongly the anti-Trump delegates  feel.  If they decide that they've had their say, they made their point.   If they're influenced by those who say you're only helping Hillary Clinton,  they may calm down and the rest of the convention may look -- it's not like  a typical convention, at least more like a typical convention.  </p><p> But there are some people predicting Donald Trump could get booed during  his nomination acceptance speech.  That would be an extraordinary scene.  </p><p> HERERA:  Now, Melania Trump, his wife, is going to be speaking tonight.   What do we expect to hear from her, and what is her role?</p><p> HARWOOD:  I think she's going to -- even though she's speaking on law and  order night at the Republican convention, try to display some of Donald  Trump's softer side.  She's going to talk a little about immigration.  </p><p> But the other thing to watch is that Donald Trump has indicated in  interviews, he may come to the podium and speak alongside Melania Trump or  before or after she speaks.  So, that's going to be quite interesting,  Donald Trump we know, likes microphones and there was --  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes.</p><p> HARWOOD:  There were includes earlier about whether he was going to speak  on all four nights.  Don't know if that's going to, but he may speak  tonight.  </p><p> HERERA:  What about the latest poll numbers, the NBC News \"Wall Street  Journal\" polls?  </p><p> HARWOOD:  Not good for Donald Trump.  Even after the FBI investigation and  James Comey, with that harsh criticism of Hillary Clinton.  Donald Trump  trails Hillary Clinton 46 to 41 percent.  That's a significant lead,  outside the poll's margin of error.  He trails in every region of he  country, except for the south, and he trails with all education categories  except those with only a high school education or less.  </p><p> That is not a promising picture at this point.  He's lagging behind where  Mitt Romney was in similar groups in 2012.  He's going to have to pick up  his game and the convention's game, the Thursday night convention  acceptance speech is going to be pivotal.  </p><p> HERERA:  Absolutely.  John, thanks as always for joining us.  We appreciate  it.  John Harwood at the convention in Cleveland.  </p><p> Well, the drama in Cleveland was not contained to inside the convention  center.  There was also a lot of activity outside, and a lot of money is  being spent to make sure that the protests are peaceful and that everyone  stays safe.  </p><p> Eamon Javers is there.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For the party  faithful, the Republican National Convention in Cleveland is the place  where the party parties.  And for others, it's a place to protest, and make  themselves here.</p><p> (CHANTING)</p><p> JAVERS:  But for law enforcement, it's a massive national security event  that comes at a high cost.  </p><p> The federal government made a $50 million security grant of which $30  million pays for employees here in Cleveland, $20 million pays for  equipment.  </p><p> All that includes 5,500 total officers assigned to RNC security, 10,000  extra handcuffs purchased for this event.  And 1,000 beds cleared in local  jails in case of mass arrests.  </p><p> CALVIN WILLIAMS, CLEVELAND POLICE CHIEF:  We want to make sure that the  demonstrators are safe walking through the streets of the city of  Cleveland, and we want to make sure we have enough officers to respond if  things turn otherwise.  </p><p> JAVERS:  To make sure it doesn't turn otherwise, a massive maze of fencing  stretching for miles, portable barriers in places to stop vehicles, the  shore line protected by a fleet of coast guard boats.  And on land, newly  purchased bikes and protective gear give police another option to stay  ahead of the protesters.  </p><p> And, of course, all of this focus on security comes in the wake of  tragedies in Dallas and in France, and over the weekend in Baton Rouge.   The theme of tonight's convention making America safe again.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eamon Javers, in Cleveland.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And now to foreign relations.  Turkey is one of America's most  important allies.  But in the days following the failed coup attempt, that  strategic alliance has been severely strained.  </p><p> Hadley Gamble reports tonight from Istanbul.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HADLEY GAMBLE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Just days after an  attempted coup in Turkey, more than 7,000 members of the military judiciary  and security services have been detained, and with the country's president  now calling for a reinstatement of the death penalty, many in the West  wonder how far this crackdown could go.  </p><p> JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE:  A NATO ally and a key partner to the E.U.   We stand squarely on the side of the elected leadership in Turkey.  We also  firmly urge the government of turkey to maintain calm and stability  throughout the country and we also urge the government of Turkey to uphold  the highest standards of respect for the nation's democratic institutions  and the rule of law.  </p><p> GAMBLE:  For the U.S. and Europe, a strong relationship with Turkey today  is crucial.  Turkey is supposed to be helping to send the flow of  terrorists along the so called jihadi highway, while putting a stop to the  flow of migrants and refugees overwhelming Europe.  All while using your  military, NATO's second largest, to shore up E.U. defenses in Europe.</p><p> But a crackdown that's rapidly turning, critics say into a witch hunt is  worrying world leaders and international investors alike, the stability of  this country, literally the bridge between Europe and Asia.</p><p>Turkey's stock market closed down 7 percent on Monday, after dipping down 9  basis points earlier in the day.  And while the lira pared back last  Friday's losses, the real concern continues to be foreign outflows and the  independence of the Central Bank, especially during this time of internal  crisis.  </p><p> And as details emerge about just how close the failed coup attempt came to  success, many in the West won't be reassured by just how close Turkey's  government came to collapse.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hadley Gamble, in Istanbul.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Back home on Wall Street, a new record was set for stocks as the  Dow's win streak was extended to seven straight days.  This despite that  political uncertainty in Turkey.  A big merger and some positive earnings  momentums helped support stocks.  And while the gains weren't big, they  were gains nonetheless.  </p><p> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16 points to 18,533.  The NASDAQ  added 26 and the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.  </p><p> Well, it does seem as though there's been a drumbeat of bad news, globally  and here at home.  And while stocks are near record levels, there are some  things investors need to pay at.  </p><p> Jack McIntyre is Brandywine's Global portfolio manager and he joins us  tonight.  Good to see you again, Jack.  Welcome back.  </p><p> JACK MCINTYRE, BRANDYWINE GLOBAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Thanks, Sue.  </p><p> HERERA:  It does seem as though there's kind of a litany of things.  You  can talk about the Brexit vote, the Turkey situation in which we just  detailed and the violence that we've seen in the last few days here at  home.  </p><p> Does it -- is this a confluence of events that should normally upset Wall  Street?  Or does it make our markets look better than other markets around  the world?  </p><p> MCINTYRE:  Well, I think when you take a step back -- and you're absolutely  right.  There's a headline of some negative news, but I think more  importantly, there's actually some positive developments going on.  It's  just -- you know, when you look at China is actually sort of doing some  pro-growth policies, the U.S., we're actually seeing a better economic  growth so far.  </p><p> These negative headlines haven't impacted consumer confidence.  I don't  think it will as long as housing and other areas of the U.S. economy do  better, and therefore, you can kind of extrapolate U.S. equities, I think  overall risk assets should be able to weather this sort of litany of some  negative headlines.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, if you're a long term investors, do you take a step back and  put all this negative news aside and revisit your plan and say, OK, we have  negative situations here, but I'm looking 10, 20 years out?  </p><p> MCINTYRE:  Yes.  So, you don't want to ignore it because a lot of this I  had -- Brexit and some other things are symptoms of the broader disease and  the broader disease being we're in a growth challenged world, but we're not  going into global recession.  You always want to have in your asset  allocation, some things that are a little more defensive that are going to  hold up in a risk off environment.  </p><p> We just don't think that you want to put your entire exposure in those  types of assets.  I mean, those are the ones that, for instance, U.S.  treasuries, I think they're over valued.  We've seen yields back up a  little bit.  I'm focusing on Fed policy, global monetary policy.  </p><p> A lot of these things globally are going to keep the Fed sidelined.  I  think that's going to be welcomed news by the financial markets.  I think  you've got to keep an eye on China.  China, the second largest economy, but  they have the largest sort of global footprint in terms of global growth.  </p><p> So, what comes out of China is more important than what happens in Turkey.  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, you mentioned the Fed, they've been pushed to the  sideline with all the headline risk news that's out there.  What camp do  you fall into?  Do you fall into the one and done camp in terms of raising  interest rates?  Or are you with those who say, we're not going to see an  increase in interest rates until the next year?  </p><p> MCINTYRE:  Yes, probably the latter camp.  The Fed is going to go slow.   This is a rate tightening cycle.  They're going to stay sidelined for quite  a while.  </p><p> The last FOMC, or the minutes -- you know, they talked a lot about global  development.  As long as we have some of these global issues, and again,  you look at Brexit, it's off the limelight, but we know there's some  uncertainty around that.  I think it's going to keep the Fed sort of on  hold until they see sustainable inflation pressures. </p><p> HERERA:  On that note, Jack, thank you very much for joining us.  Jack  McIntyre with Brandywine Global.</p><p> MCINTYRE:  My pleasure.</p><p> HERERA:  And still ahead, why home builders surprise pretty much everyone.   Their latest read on the market is coming up.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  Japan's Soft Bank is buying Britain's Armed Holdings.  The price  tag: Armed Holdings is one of Apple's suppliers and marks a big investment  for Soft Bank into the Internet of things, which refers to how home devices  connect on line.  The British government has called the deal a vote of  confidence in the country, following last month's vote to leave the E.U.  </p><p> Shares of Armed Holdings, which trade here as an ADR, soared 40 percent.   Take a look at shares of Spring which fell 5 percent.  Soft Bank owns  nearly 85 percent of that company and investors are interpreting the  acquisition of Armed as a sign that Soft Bank is not planning to invest  more money into Sprint.  </p><p> An earnings miss for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), highlighting the struggles the  Internet company faces.  Revenue beat expectations and was up about 5  percent from a year ago.  These results come almost four years to the day  that Marissa Mayer was named chief executive, with the goal of turning the  company around.  Shares were volatile in after hours trading.  </p><p> The bigger question, though, for investors about the future of the company  is Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) is closing in on the final bids for its core  businesses.  </p><p> Scott Kessler with S&amp;P global market intelligence follows Yahoo  (NASDAQ:YHOO) and he joins us now.</p><p> Good to see you, Scott.  Welcome back.  </p><p> SCOTT KESSLER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  Thanks a lot, Sue.</p><p> HERERA:  Let me start by asking you, whether Marissa Mayer has succeeded in  her mission of helping to turn the company around?  </p><p> KESSLER:  The answer in short is no.  She's been with the company for four  years.  And when she joined, I think she attracted a lot of interest and  generated a lot of enthusiasm and excitement.  But four years later, we're  looking at a no growth company with declining fundamentals on a trend  basis.  </p><p> So, you look quarter to quarter, you can see some upticks.  But the  reality, I think, according to all accounts is that Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) is  challenged at best and problematic at worst.  And I think that likely  predicted for the beginning of this year, she will no longer be the CEO of  Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) by the end of this year.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  Hence the auction that's coming up, who do you think - - or what are your odds as to who will win this auction?  </p><p> KESSLER:  So, what's interesting in our opinion is that Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)  interestingly has said very little on this subject.  Nonetheless,  unconfirmed reports have indicated multiple suitors, timelines, and  expectations for what's going to happen next.  </p><p> Our view is that the major U.S. telecommunications company is likely going  to be the prevailing suitor for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO).  They are most  obviously interested, they're most obviously resourced, meaning having  balance sheet and company size and strength.  And I think most importantly,  have the will to kind of take on what obviously is a pretty substantial  challenge.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, where does that lead?  Once the bids are in, and the decision  is made and it's awarded, where does that leave what's left of Yahoo  (NASDAQ:YHOO)?  </p><p> KESSLER:  Well, what's interesting is, a lot of people have been talking  about, how much will the core operations of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) be valued  at in the context of a transaction and whether you include patents and real  estate.  The reality is, shorthand-wise, think of it like this, for every  dollar difference we're talking about in the price of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO),  that's a billion dollars for the market cap.  </p><p> So, if someone's going to bid $6 billion versus $5 billion, that's only the  difference of $1.  It's a reason why we don't think this amounts to much  from a shareholder perspective, for employees of the company, we think this  is huge, because they're going to have a new owner and new bosses and  arguably a new strategy.  </p><p> HERERA:  A new strategy.  All right.  Scott, thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> KESSLER:  Thanks, Sue.</p><p> HERERA:  Scott Kessler with S&amp;P global market intelligence.  </p><p> Quarterly profit falls nearly 20 percent of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).   That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> Lower interest rates weighed on earnings, those results came in ahead of  estimates.  The bank also saw revenue decline, but that too was better than  expected as higher deposit balances and an uptick in bond trading helps  stabilize results.  Shares were up 3 percent to $14.11.</p><p> The Brexit helped quarterly results at Charles Schwab.  The bank said it  took on more clients during late June, when the U.K. vote to leave the  European Union happened.  That helped revenue rise, and it topped  expectations.  Analysts also noted that a reduction in money market fees  was a big factor in helping to lift results.  Shares were up a tick to  $27.10.  </p><p> Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) posted higher than expected profit and revenue, thanks in  part to strong demand for toys based off the Disney (NYSE:DIS) movie's  \"Frozen\" and \"Star Wars\".  The makers of the Monopoly board game said,  starting in 2018 it will no longer sell products tied to the \"Jurassic  Park\" movies, after failing to reach a licensing renewal agreement with  Universal (NYSE:UVV) Studios.  Shares fell more than 6 percent to $79.82.  </p><p>U.S. authorities are investigating Fiat Chrysler.  The SEC and the Justice  Department are looking into whether the automaker reported fraudulent new  car sales numbers after two auto dealers field federal lawsuit against the  company.  Fiat/Chrysler said it's cooperating with the authorities.  Shares  were down fractionally to $6.73.</p><p> The nation's home builders lost a little faith in their market this month.   Foot traffic thinned out, while construction constraints remain.  </p><p> And as Diana Olick reports, the move lower in home builder sentiment was a  big surprise.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From as far away as  London and its Brexit vote, smack into the middle of the nation, where  Republicans are choosing their nominee, the U.S. housing market is feeling  all the effects.  Uncertainty is no longer the exception, but the rule, and  home builders are feeling each tremor.  A monthly reading of builder  confidence dropped unexpectedly in July.  </p><p> JERRY HOWARD, CEO NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS:  Home buyers are  as skittish as everybody in the world is skittish right now.  It's not just  the political landscape.  It's the geopolitical landscape.  You know, it's  the 24 hour news cycle of people aware of what's going on, that has to  impact everybody, including prospective home buyers.</p><p> OLICK:  Builder confidence is still in positive territory, but it hasn't  moved much since January.  Despite spring being the busy season for housing  and builder's especially.  </p><p> Besides consumer uncertainty, builders are still stymied by land and labor  issues, as well as increased regulation, especially out west where Tri  Pointe Homes does much of its business.  </p><p> DOUG BAUER, TRI POINTE HOMES CEO: When you're dealing with those types of  headwinds, it causes -- you know, it doesn't allow you to generate as much  housing and develop as much land as quickly as you like.  It just takes  longer over time.  It will get done.  But it just takes longer.</p><p> OLICK:  Bauer says Tri Pointe is uniquely positioned with 17,000 lots ready  to build in California.  Builders nationally recorded a slight drop in  current sales and buyer traffic, according to the monthly survey.  Their  sales expectations over the next six months dropped even more  significantly.</p><p> BAUER:  Home buying does have a certain amount of confidence factor to it.   So, you know, what happened in Britain and the political uncertainty of  going into this election cycle.  It was a pretty warm late June, the number  of the southwestern markets.  So, sales kind of tailed off a little bit.  </p><p> OLICK:  Builders are benefiting from the lack of supply of exiting homes  for sale.  But newly built homes like this one are pricier than their  exiting counterparts.  Even low mortgage rates are not making up for that  premium, in an economy where premiums are rising far faster than incomes.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, how the biggest energy reducing state lowered oil  prices and is now an economic success story.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  We recently reported that Utah was ranked by CNBC as the top state  for business.  The annual survey is in its 10th year, and over the past  decade, there is one state with the best cumulative score, Texas.  And it  wins by a mile.</p><p> Scott Cohn reports.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Texas does everything  big -- big places, big spaces, big energy, nearly twice as much total  energy production as its nearest competitor.  And yet, as energy prices  have plunged, Texas has barely missed a beat.  </p><p> NICK SAMUELS, MOODY'S VICE PRESIDENT:  Very prudently, Texas has one of the  biggest budget reserves of any state.  Its rainy day fund is $9.6 billion.  </p><p> COHN:  It is a far cry from 30 years ago, when collapsing oil prices  decimated the Texas economy.  One of every seven Texans lost their jobs.   Foreclosures soared, hundreds of banks failed.  </p><p> FEMALE TV ANCHOR:  The most costly bank rescue ever.  So big it will add a  burden to the national deficit.  </p><p> COHN:  Nothing like that to convince Texans to diversify.  </p><p> Energy production including oil is still the largest industry in Texas, but  it's no longer the only game in town.  Twenty-five years ago, Texas was  relying on oil for 25 percent of state revenue.  Today, it's less than half  that.  </p><p> The state's largest employer is not an oil company, but a supermarket  chain.  And while the energy industry has grown in the last 30 years, so  have other industries like health care.  Texas has dominated the top states  for business rankings the past ten years, never finishing lower than second  place.  Bu all that time, oil prices were high.  No one knew for certain  what might happen in the next oil shock.  Now they know.  </p><p> SAMUELS:  While the state's revenues are down in the current fiscal year,  following very strong growth coming out of the recession, the economic  strength of those other parts of the states have mitigated how severe the  drop might have been.  </p><p> COHN:  But the story may not be over.  The oil slump is less severe than  the '80s, and no one knows for certain how long it will last.  That means,  the state could still face fiscal pressures for some time to come.  But for  now, Texas is meeting the challenge in a big way.  </p><p> Scott Cohn, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, San Antonio, Texas.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  Thanks for joining us.  Have a great evening, everybody.  </p><p> We'll see you right back here tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I`m Sue Herera. Tyler Mathisen is off tonight.</p><p>A new record for stocks today. But we begin with two big tech earnings that could change the tone of trading tomorrow.</p><p>First, Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX), which disappointed investors when it said not as many people as expected subscribe to the streaming service in the most recent quarter. Price hikes put off customers and contributed to the sharp slowdown in user growth. On the surface, the numbers looked pretty decent. Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) earned 9 cents a share, beating estimates of 2 cents. Revenue was in-line with expectations and up about 28 percent from a year ago.</p><p>But it was that subscriber number that sent shares lower initially in after hours trading.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more on Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big surprise in Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) earnings -- disappointing subscriber additions and projections.</p><p>The company added 1.7 million members in the quarter, compared to the 2.5 million that Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) projected in its last earnings report. Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) saying that while the number of new subscribers was on target, the amount of turn or the number of people dropping the service as a result of a price increase kicking in was higher than expected and will continue to impact subscriber numbers in Q3.</p><p>Netflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings saying in his letter to shareholders that the disappointing numbers are not the result of competition or market saturation, finishing the quarter with over 83 million members. They believe that the opportunity ahead is as big as ever.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And now to Dow component IBM, which saw its sales declined again, and this came despite gains in its cloud and mobile computing units. The company earned $2.95 a share, and that was six cents better than expectations. Revenues also topped estimates. But when compared to last year, the results were 2 1/2 percent lower. Shares of Big Blue rose in after-hours trading.</p><p>And Susan Li tells us now, the key thing investors should focus on in IBM`s support.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A 17th straight quarter of revenue declines for Big Blue. But what analysts were looking for were signs of improve in growth as CEO Ginny Rometty transitions IBM into cloud and cognitive computing company. (INAUDIBLE) beat in profits and in revenue, IBM`s cloud business grew 30 percent in the three months and the business line that also houses Watson, yes, the cognitive computing division, produced revenues that beat analyst estimates in the quarter as well.</p><p>So, cloud, Watson, and cognitive computing, along with social and mobile computing are the businesses that IBM is focused on to build their future. They bundle this into the group called Strategic Imperatives, which IBM hopes will make up 40 percent of revenues by the year 2018.</p><p>But if you look closer at the latest report card, the Strategic Imperatives already make up 38 percent of IBM`s revenues, which seems to be way ahead of schedule. Shares are up so far this year, way out performing the broader markets.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Susan Li.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And now to politics and to Cleveland, where the first day of the Republican national convention was not without drama. Opponents of the presumptive presidential nominee <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>failed in their attempt to hold a roll call vote to oppose his candidacy. This is something the party leaders had hoped to avoid.</p><p>John Harwood joins us from the convention itself.</p><p>And, John, a lot of frustration boiling over late in today`s session.</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is a candidate who aroused strong feelings on the positive and negative. He won the primary fair and square. He deserves to be the Republican nominee.</p><p>Anti-Trump forces wanted to register their opposition. They tried to force a roll call vote. They got signatures on petitions from a requisite number of states. But then the pro-Trump forces pushed back hard, got delegates from three states to withdraw their petitions, the result of that was very loud booing and a chaotic scene on the floor when one side was shouting \"roll call vote, roll call vote.\" The other side was shouting, we want Trump, not what you want to see at a convention where the goal is to present a united front to the rest of the country.</p><p>HERERA: Does it indicate that this is going to be kind of the business as usual if you will for this particular convention? There are a lot of issues that are dividing all of those delegates?</p><p>HARWOOD: Not clear. It depends on how strongly the anti-Trump delegates feel. If they decide that they`ve had their say, they made their point. If they`re influenced by those who say you`re only helping Hillary Clinton, they may calm down and the rest of the convention may look -- it`s not like a typical convention, at least more like a typical convention.</p><p>But there are some people predicting <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>could get booed during his nomination acceptance speech. That would be an extraordinary scene.</p><p>HERERA: Now, Melania Trump, his wife, is going to be speaking tonight. What do we expect to hear from her, and what is her role?</p><p>HARWOOD: I think she`s going to -- even though she`s speaking on law and order night at the Republican convention, try to display some of Donald Trump`s softer side. She`s going to talk a little about immigration.</p><p>But the other thing to watch is that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has indicated in interviews, he may come to the podium and speak alongside Melania Trump or before or after she speaks. So, that`s going to be quite interesting, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>we know, likes microphones and there was --</p><p>HERERA: Yes.</p><p>HARWOOD: There were includes earlier about whether he was going to speak on all four nights. Don`t know if that`s going to, but he may speak tonight.</p><p>HERERA: What about the latest poll numbers, the NBC News \"Wall Street Journal\" polls?</p><p>HARWOOD: Not good for <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Even after the FBI investigation and James Comey, with that harsh criticism of Hillary Clinton. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>trails Hillary Clinton 46 to 41 percent. That`s a significant lead, outside the poll`s margin of error. He trails in every region of he country, except for the south, and he trails with all education categories except those with only a high school education or less.</p><p>That is not a promising picture at this point. He`s lagging behind where Mitt Romney was in similar groups in 2012. He`s going to have to pick up his game and the convention`s game, the Thursday night convention acceptance speech is going to be pivotal.</p><p>HERERA: Absolutely. John, thanks as always for joining us. We appreciate it. John Harwood at the convention in Cleveland.</p><p>Well, the drama in Cleveland was not contained to inside the convention center. There was also a lot of activity outside, and a lot of money is being spent to make sure that the protests are peaceful and that everyone stays safe.</p><p>Eamon Javers is there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For the party faithful, the Republican National Convention in Cleveland is the place where the party parties. And for others, it`s a place to protest, and make themselves here.</p><p>(CHANTING)</p><p>JAVERS: But for law enforcement, it`s a massive national security event that comes at a high cost.</p><p>The federal government made a $50 million security grant of which $30 million pays for employees here in Cleveland, $20 million pays for equipment.</p><p>All that includes 5,500 total officers assigned to RNC security, 10,000 extra handcuffs purchased for this event. And 1,000 beds cleared in local jails in case of mass arrests.</p><p>CALVIN WILLIAMS, CLEVELAND POLICE CHIEF: We want to make sure that the demonstrators are safe walking through the streets of the city of Cleveland, and we want to make sure we have enough officers to respond if things turn otherwise.</p><p>JAVERS: To make sure it doesn`t turn otherwise, a massive maze of fencing stretching for miles, portable barriers in places to stop vehicles, the shore line protected by a fleet of coast guard boats. And on land, newly purchased bikes and protective gear give police another option to stay ahead of the protesters.</p><p>And, of course, all of this focus on security comes in the wake of tragedies in Dallas and in France, and over the weekend in Baton Rouge. The theme of tonight`s convention making America safe again.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eamon Javers, in Cleveland.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And now to foreign relations. Turkey is one of America`s most important allies. But in the days following the failed coup attempt, that strategic alliance has been severely strained.</p><p>Hadley Gamble reports tonight from Istanbul.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HADLEY GAMBLE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Just days after an attempted coup in Turkey, more than 7,000 members of the military judiciary and security services have been detained, and with the country`s president now calling for a reinstatement of the death penalty, many in the West wonder how far this crackdown could go.</p><p>JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: A NATO ally and a key partner to the E.U. We stand squarely on the side of the elected leadership in Turkey. We also firmly urge the government of turkey to maintain calm and stability throughout the country and we also urge the government of Turkey to uphold the highest standards of respect for the nation`s democratic institutions and the rule of law.</p><p>GAMBLE: For the U.S. and Europe, a strong relationship with Turkey today is crucial. Turkey is supposed to be helping to send the flow of terrorists along the so called jihadi highway, while putting a stop to the flow of migrants and refugees overwhelming Europe. All while using your military, NATO`s second largest, to shore up E.U. defenses in Europe.</p><p>But a crackdown that`s rapidly turning, critics say into a witch hunt is worrying world leaders and international investors alike, the stability of this country, literally the bridge between Europe and Asia.</p><p>Turkey`s stock market closed down 7 percent on Monday, after dipping down 9 basis points earlier in the day. And while the lira pared back last Friday`s losses, the real concern continues to be foreign outflows and the independence of the Central Bank, especially during this time of internal crisis.</p><p>And as details emerge about just how close the failed coup attempt came to success, many in the West won`t be reassured by just how close Turkey`s government came to collapse.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Hadley Gamble, in Istanbul.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Back home on Wall Street, a new record was set for stocks as the Dow`s win streak was extended to seven straight days. This despite that political uncertainty in Turkey. A big merger and some positive earnings momentums helped support stocks. And while the gains weren`t big, they were gains nonetheless.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16 points to 18,533. The NASDAQ added 26 and the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.</p><p>Well, it does seem as though there`s been a drumbeat of bad news, globally and here at home. And while stocks are near record levels, there are some things investors need to pay at.</p><p>Jack McIntyre is Brandywine`s Global portfolio manager and he joins us tonight. Good to see you again, Jack. Welcome back.</p><p>JACK MCINTYRE, BRANDYWINE GLOBAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Thanks, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: It does seem as though there`s kind of a litany of things. You can talk about the Brexit vote, the Turkey situation in which we just detailed and the violence that we`ve seen in the last few days here at home.</p><p>Does it -- is this a confluence of events that should normally upset Wall Street? Or does it make our markets look better than other markets around the world?</p><p>MCINTYRE: Well, I think when you take a step back -- and you`re absolutely right. There`s a headline of some negative news, but I think more importantly, there`s actually some positive developments going on. It`s just -- you know, when you look at China is actually sort of doing some pro-growth policies, the U.S., we`re actually seeing a better economic growth so far.</p><p>These negative headlines haven`t impacted consumer confidence. I don`t think it will as long as housing and other areas of the U.S. economy do better, and therefore, you can kind of extrapolate U.S. equities, I think overall risk assets should be able to weather this sort of litany of some negative headlines.</p><p>HERERA: So, if you`re a long term investors, do you take a step back and put all this negative news aside and revisit your plan and say, OK, we have negative situations here, but I`m looking 10, 20 years out?</p><p>MCINTYRE: Yes. So, you don`t want to ignore it because a lot of this I had -- Brexit and some other things are symptoms of the broader disease and the broader disease being we`re in a growth challenged world, but we`re not going into global recession. You always want to have in your asset allocation, some things that are a little more defensive that are going to hold up in a risk off environment.</p><p>We just don`t think that you want to put your entire exposure in those types of assets. I mean, those are the ones that, for instance, U.S. treasuries, I think they`re over valued. We`ve seen yields back up a little bit. I`m focusing on Fed policy, global monetary policy.</p><p>A lot of these things globally are going to keep the Fed sidelined. I think that`s going to be welcomed news by the financial markets. I think you`ve got to keep an eye on China. China, the second largest economy, but they have the largest sort of global footprint in terms of global growth.</p><p>So, what comes out of China is more important than what happens in Turkey.</p><p>HERERA: You know, you mentioned the Fed, they`ve been pushed to the sideline with all the headline risk news that`s out there. What camp do you fall into? Do you fall into the one and done camp in terms of raising interest rates? Or are you with those who say, we`re not going to see an increase in interest rates until the next year?</p><p>MCINTYRE: Yes, probably the latter camp. The Fed is going to go slow. This is a rate tightening cycle. They`re going to stay sidelined for quite a while.</p><p>The last FOMC, or the minutes -- you know, they talked a lot about global development. As long as we have some of these global issues, and again, you look at Brexit, it`s off the limelight, but we know there`s some uncertainty around that. I think it`s going to keep the Fed sort of on hold until they see sustainable inflation pressures.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, Jack, thank you very much for joining us. Jack McIntyre with Brandywine Global.</p><p>MCINTYRE: My pleasure.</p><p>HERERA: And still ahead, why home builders surprise pretty much everyone. Their latest read on the market is coming up.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Japan`s Soft Bank is buying Britain`s Armed Holdings. The price tag: Armed Holdings is one of Apple`s suppliers and marks a big investment for Soft Bank into the Internet of things, which refers to how home devices connect on line. The British government has called the deal a vote of confidence in the country, following last month`s vote to leave the E.U.</p><p>Shares of Armed Holdings, which trade here as an ADR, soared 40 percent. Take a look at shares of Spring which fell 5 percent. Soft Bank owns nearly 85 percent of that company and investors are interpreting the acquisition of Armed as a sign that Soft Bank is not planning to invest more money into Sprint.</p><p>An earnings miss for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), highlighting the struggles the Internet company faces. Revenue beat expectations and was up about 5 percent from a year ago. These results come almost four years to the day that Marissa Mayer was named chief executive, with the goal of turning the company around. Shares were volatile in after hours trading.</p><p>The bigger question, though, for investors about the future of the company is Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) is closing in on the final bids for its core businesses.</p><p>Scott Kessler with S&amp;P global market intelligence follows Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) and he joins us now.</p><p>Good to see you, Scott. Welcome back.</p><p>SCOTT KESSLER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE: Thanks a lot, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: Let me start by asking you, whether Marissa Mayer has succeeded in her mission of helping to turn the company around?</p><p>KESSLER: The answer in short is no. She`s been with the company for four years. And when she joined, I think she attracted a lot of interest and generated a lot of enthusiasm and excitement. But four years later, we`re looking at a no growth company with declining fundamentals on a trend basis.</p><p>So, you look quarter to quarter, you can see some upticks. But the reality, I think, according to all accounts is that Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) is challenged at best and problematic at worst. And I think that likely predicted for the beginning of this year, she will no longer be the CEO of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) by the end of this year.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Hence the auction that`s coming up, who do you think - - or what are your odds as to who will win this auction?</p><p>KESSLER: So, what`s interesting in our opinion is that Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) interestingly has said very little on this subject. Nonetheless, unconfirmed reports have indicated multiple suitors, timelines, and expectations for what`s going to happen next.</p><p>Our view is that the major U.S. telecommunications company is likely going to be the prevailing suitor for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO). They are most obviously interested, they`re most obviously resourced, meaning having balance sheet and company size and strength. And I think most importantly, have the will to kind of take on what obviously is a pretty substantial challenge.</p><p>HERERA: So, where does that lead? Once the bids are in, and the decision is made and it`s awarded, where does that leave what`s left of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO)?</p><p>KESSLER: Well, what`s interesting is, a lot of people have been talking about, how much will the core operations of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) be valued at in the context of a transaction and whether you include patents and real estate. The reality is, shorthand-wise, think of it like this, for every dollar difference we`re talking about in the price of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), that`s a billion dollars for the market cap.</p><p>So, if someone`s going to bid $6 billion versus $5 billion, that`s only the difference of $1. It`s a reason why we don`t think this amounts to much from a shareholder perspective, for employees of the company, we think this is huge, because they`re going to have a new owner and new bosses and arguably a new strategy.</p><p>HERERA: A new strategy. All right. Scott, thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p>KESSLER: Thanks, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: Scott Kessler with S&amp;P global market intelligence.</p><p>Quarterly profit falls nearly 20 percent of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Lower interest rates weighed on earnings, those results came in ahead of estimates. The bank also saw revenue decline, but that too was better than expected as higher deposit balances and an uptick in bond trading helps stabilize results. Shares were up 3 percent to $14.11.</p><p>The Brexit helped quarterly results at Charles Schwab. The bank said it took on more clients during late June, when the U.K. vote to leave the European Union happened. That helped revenue rise, and it topped expectations. Analysts also noted that a reduction in money market fees was a big factor in helping to lift results. Shares were up a tick to $27.10.</p><p>Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) posted higher than expected profit and revenue, thanks in part to strong demand for toys based off the Disney (NYSE:DIS) movie`s \"Frozen\" and \"Star Wars\". The makers of the Monopoly board game said, starting in 2018 it will no longer sell products tied to the \"Jurassic Park\" movies, after failing to reach a licensing renewal agreement with Universal (NYSE:UVV) Studios. Shares fell more than 6 percent to $79.82.</p><p>U.S. authorities are investigating Fiat Chrysler. The SEC and the Justice Department are looking into whether the automaker reported fraudulent new car sales numbers after two auto dealers field federal lawsuit against the company. Fiat/Chrysler said it`s cooperating with the authorities. Shares were down fractionally to $6.73.</p><p>The nation`s home builders lost a little faith in their market this month. Foot traffic thinned out, while construction constraints remain.</p><p>And as Diana Olick reports, the move lower in home builder sentiment was a big surprise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: From as far away as London and its Brexit vote, smack into the middle of the nation, where Republicans are choosing their nominee, the U.S. housing market is feeling all the effects. Uncertainty is no longer the exception, but the rule, and home builders are feeling each tremor. A monthly reading of builder confidence dropped unexpectedly in July.</p><p>JERRY HOWARD, CEO NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS: Home buyers are as skittish as everybody in the world is skittish right now. It`s not just the political landscape. It`s the geopolitical landscape. You know, it`s the 24 hour news cycle of people aware of what`s going on, that has to impact everybody, including prospective home buyers.</p><p>OLICK: Builder confidence is still in positive territory, but it hasn`t moved much since January. Despite spring being the busy season for housing and builder`s especially.</p><p>Besides consumer uncertainty, builders are still stymied by land and labor issues, as well as increased regulation, especially out west where Tri Pointe Homes does much of its business.</p><p>DOUG BAUER, TRI POINTE HOMES CEO: When you`re dealing with those types of headwinds, it causes -- you know, it doesn`t allow you to generate as much housing and develop as much land as quickly as you like. It just takes longer over time. It will get done. But it just takes longer.</p><p>OLICK: Bauer says Tri Pointe is uniquely positioned with 17,000 lots ready to build in California. Builders nationally recorded a slight drop in current sales and buyer traffic, according to the monthly survey. Their sales expectations over the next six months dropped even more significantly.</p><p>BAUER: Home buying does have a certain amount of confidence factor to it. So, you know, what happened in Britain and the political uncertainty of going into this election cycle. It was a pretty warm late June, the number of the southwestern markets. So, sales kind of tailed off a little bit.</p><p>OLICK: Builders are benefiting from the lack of supply of exiting homes for sale. But newly built homes like this one are pricier than their exiting counterparts. Even low mortgage rates are not making up for that premium, in an economy where premiums are rising far faster than incomes.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, how the biggest energy reducing state lowered oil prices and is now an economic success story.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: We recently reported that Utah was ranked by CNBC as the top state for business. The annual survey is in its 10th year, and over the past decade, there is one state with the best cumulative score, Texas. And it wins by a mile.</p><p>Scott Cohn reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Texas does everything big -- big places, big spaces, big energy, nearly twice as much total energy production as its nearest competitor. And yet, as energy prices have plunged, Texas has barely missed a beat.</p><p>NICK SAMUELS, MOODY`S VICE PRESIDENT: Very prudently, Texas has one of the biggest budget reserves of any state. Its rainy day fund is $9.6 billion.</p><p>COHN: It is a far cry from 30 years ago, when collapsing oil prices decimated the Texas economy. One of every seven Texans lost their jobs. Foreclosures soared, hundreds of banks failed.</p><p>FEMALE TV ANCHOR: The most costly bank rescue ever. So big it will add a burden to the national deficit.</p><p>COHN: Nothing like that to convince Texans to diversify.</p><p>Energy production including oil is still the largest industry in Texas, but it`s no longer the only game in town. Twenty-five years ago, Texas was relying on oil for 25 percent of state revenue. Today, it`s less than half that.</p><p>The state`s largest employer is not an oil company, but a supermarket chain. And while the energy industry has grown in the last 30 years, so have other industries like health care. Texas has dominated the top states for business rankings the past ten years, never finishing lower than second place. Bu all that time, oil prices were high. No one knew for certain what might happen in the next oil shock. Now they know.</p><p>SAMUELS: While the state`s revenues are down in the current fiscal year, following very strong growth coming out of the recession, the economic strength of those other parts of the states have mitigated how severe the drop might have been.</p><p>COHN: But the story may not be over. The oil slump is less severe than the `80s, and no one knows for certain how long it will last. That means, the state could still face fiscal pressures for some time to come. But for now, Texas is meeting the challenge in a big way.</p><p>Scott Cohn, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, San Antonio, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.

It started  out ugly, then got a little less so after President Obama made it clear  that, as of now, there will be no new sanctions against Russia -- turning  investor attention back to profits.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  milestone.  Fifty million subscribers now use the service, helping profits  double.  Is it enough to keep the stock firing on cylinders?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  As Wall Street turns, what are the business world's biggest soap  operas just took another twist as the chase for Allergan (NYSE:AGN) grows  increasingly hostile. </p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 21st.</p><p>And good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  </p><p>HERERA:  I'm Sue Herera, filling in for Susie Gharib.  </p><p>It was a wild day in the markets with stocks kicking off the new week,  closing to the downside as investors weighed the political and economic  fallout of the conflict in Gaza and the crisis over that downed passenger  jet in Ukraine.  And as the investigation into the exact cause of that  incident crawls along, President Obama asks for Russia's help at the site  of the tragedy.  </p><p>But he stopped short of outright blaming Moscow and made no mention of a  ramp-up of economic sanctions.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If Russia continues to  violate Ukraine's sovereignty, and to back these separatists, and these  separatists become more and more dangerous and now are risks not simply to  the people inside of Ukraine but the broader international community, then  Russia will only further isolate itself from the international community  and the costs for Russia's behavior will only continue to increase.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  On Wall Street, stocks began the day sharply lower with the Dow  down as much as 125 points.  But the major averages battled right back.   And at the close, the Dow was down just 48 points.  The NASDAQ was lower by  seven, and the S&amp;P 500 off by four.</p><p>The volatility in equities impacted the treasury market as well, with the  yield on the 30-year bond dipping as far as 3.24 percent, the lowest level  since June of last year.  </p><p>Bob Pisani has more now on the swings in the market today, what investors  are focusing on and not focusing on.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The markets started  down and they stayed down until President Obama spoke shortly after 11:00  a.m. Eastern Time on the Ukraine crisis.  He called on Russia to use its  influence with separatists to allow investigators full access to the crash  site.  But stocks began coming off their lows when it became clear he would  not announce any new sanctions against Russia at that time.  </p><p>Now, despite the tragedy, the markets have taken the crash in stride.   Because the economic impact on Europe and the U.S., so far, is still  limited.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The market believes they are containable, so that while  -- while they are tragedies, they do not spill over.  Even if the spill  over affects, it doesn't matter, earnings are strong and the Fed is there.  </p><p>PISANI:  Indeed with a little less than 1/5 of the S&amp;P 500 reporting,  earnings are up almost 7 percent compared to the same period last year.   While revenue growth is still modest, companies are continuing to find ways  to cut costs and thus improve earnings, and that, along with continuing low  interest rates are the main factors keeping the indices near historic  highs. </p><p>European Union foreign ministers meet tomorrow and despite the rhetoric,  the markets still believes no big sanctions will be coming against Russia  in the next few days.  That could change if separatists continue to block  access to the crash sites. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, today is the start of one of the busiest weeks of the  second quarter, earnings season.  And one of the hottest momentum stocks on  Wall Street posted its results after the closing bell, Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX).  The video streaming service earned a buck 15 per share.   That was a penny below Wall Street forecasts.  But, revenue was better than  expected on a sharp increase in subscriptions. </p><p>And with that, shares initially moved higher in late trading.  So, how many  more TV watchers are tuning in to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)?  And where will it  be streaming those movies next? </p><p>Julia Boorstin has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Bottom line:  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is adding customers faster than expected, reporting  more than 50 million streaming subscribers for the first time.  So, what  drove that subscriber growth?  Well, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) doesn't disclose  specific viewer numbers, the company says it got a big boost from the  popularity of the second season of \"Orange is the New Black.\"</p><p>Looking forward, the streaming video company says it expects to add  subscribers even faster, projecting the addition of 3.7 million new  streaming subscribers in Q3, most of them coming from overseas.  Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) announcing in September it will launch in France, Germany and  other European markets with over 60 million new broadband households.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So other big tech companies on tap to report earnings this week as  well.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), both are set to  release their second quarter earnings results tomorrow.  </p><p>Kim Forrest joins us now to tell us what she's expected from these two tech  giants.  She is senior equity analyst with Fort Pitt Capital Group.</p><p>Welcome.  </p><p>KIM FORREST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST:  Thanks.  Thank  you for having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  Both of these reports are very important.  But it's going to be  interesting because Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a new CEO.  They had the  Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition.  </p><p>So, there's a lot to look for in these reports, isn't there?  </p><p>FORREST:  There really is.  There is a lot of moving parts.  And Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a lot of change.  But so does Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  And,  well, they have a lot of potential change.</p><p>I think investors would like to hear news of what they have next.  And  usually that's not what they do in earnings reports.  But we'll see  tomorrow.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And what are you expecting?  Why don't you take Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) first? </p><p>FORREST:  Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Since it's sort of a headline stock, not that Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) isn't.  </p><p>FORREST:  Sure.  Well, I think it's more accessible to more people, regular  investors, because they probably have at least one Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  device.  And that's the thing that's going to drive this stock.  How many  phones were sold?  And how many iPads were sold?  </p><p>Last quarter, iPads were a little disappointing, so I think the street is  really going to be looking at that number.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, Kim, we also, of course, have that Nokia (NYSE:NOK)  acquisition for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  And we have some layoffs that are  coming from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  It seems to me that that could really  kind of be confusing in the report.  There's going to be a lot to kind of  separate out to get net/net what Microsoft's performance was in the last  quarter.  </p><p>FORREST:  Exactly.  And adding to this is the fact that you have so many  people that follow and report on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and they may or  may not have gotten a memo on how to do the accounting for this.  </p><p>So, it's going to be a confusing time tomorrow after 4:00.  But we're going  to be able to weed through that.  And the thing that we really look at for  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), especially, is that parts of its business that are  geared more towards business.  So, that's the server and tools, and the  Office franchise.  So, those are the parts that we're going to be looking  at closely.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Let's move on to two other tech companies that report later this  week, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  I seem to be buying  something from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) every day.  I bought a showerhead  today, for goodness sakes, Kim.</p><p>What do you expect out of that company?  </p><p>FORREST:  Well, I have to tell you this, I bought two things.  I bought a  coffeemaker today from them and dog bowls.  But -- so, you know, they  really are the one-stop shop, aren't they?  And we're not really -- the  consumer stuff that they sell is kind of interesting.  It's very low  margin.  What we're really looking at is what they're doing with the Cloud.   And they seem to always give you one piece of information but not another.</p><p>So, it's really difficult to see if they're making money or not, but that's  a very intriguing business for somebody like us -- somebody like me to  watch.  </p><p>HERERA:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), give me the one metric that's going to be  the most important in that report tomorrow or in the analyst call.  </p><p>FORREST:  Sure.  Mobile revenues.  That's where people are focused on for  this stock.  And I think that's for good reason.  We want to know if people  are buying mobile apps, and how that's going to let them grow in the  future.  </p><p>HERERA:  Kim, thank you.  </p><p>FORREST:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Kim Forrest with Fort Pitt Capital Group.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Valeant Pharmaceutical's nasty and hostile takeover battle to  acquire the Botox maker Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is getting nastier and more  hostile.  Despite that, investors sent shares of both companies higher  today, but as Meg Tirrell reports, things are just heating up.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  More  twists in who's become one of the biggest soap operas on Wall Street.   Allergan (NYSE:AGN), the maker of Botox, is cutting 1,500 jobs, in response  to mounting pressure from Valeant Pharmaceuticals.  The move comes three  months into Valeant's hostile bid for Allergan (NYSE:AGN), worth more than  $50 billion.</p><p>Allergan (NYSE:AGN) says its restructuring will save $475 million a year.   Valeant is working with Pershing Square's Bill Ackman, currently the  largest holder of Allergan (NYSE:AGN) stocks.  He said today that  Allergan's slimming down was long overdue.  </p><p>BILL ACKMAN, MANAGING PARTNER:  Allergan (NYSE:AGN) has 1,200 basis points  higher to spend 1,200 basis points more on overhead than the competitive  set.  I mean, that's an incredible gap.  And now they're going to start to  close that gap which, of course, it generates an increase in earnings.  But  really what you're doing over the next several years is cutting out fat you  should have cut out a long time ago.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Valeant today said it contacted regulators in Canada and the U.S.  over what it called false and misleading statements.  Allergan's been  making about its business model.  It also urged Allergan (NYSE:AGN)  shareholders to vote for a special meeting called by Ackman, who is aiming  to replace the majority of Allergan's board.  </p><p>ACKMAN:  Why are we calling a special meeting?  We are calling a special  meeting so the shareholders can explain, express their views, that they  want the Valeant deal, or not.  They can decide they don't want it.  But at  least that's the first time the company's going to have an opportunity to  hear in an official way what their shareholders believe.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Allergan (NYSE:AGN) has other plans.  Chief executive David Pyatt  told analysts that investors are urging him to pursue acquisitions of his  own.  The company said it may consider a deal that would help it lower its  corporate tax rate, a common theme this year known as an inversion.  Pyatt  said it will certainly look for purchases that will add to earnings.  </p><p>(on camera):  In addition to slimming down, Allergan (NYSE:AGN) made big  forecasts for its future.  It predicts 20 percent annual earnings growth  for the next five years, but only time will tell how this soap opera will  end.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Well, Bill Ackman, the investor we just saw in Meg's story is  obviously a busy guy.  He's also embroiled in a longtime short selling  campaign against the vitamin supplement company Herbalife (NYSE:HLF),  calling its sales model a classic pyramid scheme.  Shares of the company  tumbled more than 11 percent today after Ackman said he expects the company  to collapse.  Ackman has long had a major short position in the stock,  meaning he is betting that it will fall.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  More now on the international reaction to that downed passenger  jet over Ukraine.  Russia has been condemned by the West for its support of  the Russian separatists who are likely to blame for the tragedy.  It is  getting support from China.  </p><p>Eunice Yoon explains why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  China is  warning against rushing to blame Russia for the downing over Ukraine of  Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.  Since the weekend, the Chinese press has been  highly critical of the West's approach, saying in editorials that countries  like the U.S. are too quick to point fingers at Russia and Moscow-backed  rebels without hard evidence. </p><p>Chinese state news agency Xinhua has called U.S. and Australian officials  \"rash\".  A communist party-backed newspaper \"The Global Times\" said the  rush to judgment in the west is not based on known facts or logic.  </p><p>The state press is also taking Russia's point of view on the Ukraine  conflict, saying the real culprit is a chaotic situation in Ukraine, which  it says has been fomented by Western influences.  The comments are a signal  that despite historical mistrust between China and Russia, the two powers  are increasingly finding common ground.  Both currently have strained  relations with the West, and are accused of engaging in aggressive foreign  policy that could destabilize their regions, Russia and Ukraine and China  in the east and South China Seas.  </p><p>Yet both are in need of diplomatic and economic support.  Even if the two  may not see eye to eye on the price of gas, both are reluctant to criticize  the other on political affairs.  Perhaps a reason for Russian President  Vladimir Putin's pivot east. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  China's got some media problems of its own, like food safety, for  instance.  A U.S. owned meat supplier in Shanghai has been accused of  selling McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM), owner of the KFC  chain, expired beef and chicken at restaurants in China.  Even though sales  have been suspended, investors were feeling a little queasy day.  Shares of  McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) down about 1 1/2 percent.  Shares of Yum Brands  (NYSE:YUM) down more than 4 percent.  ]</p><p>Still ahead, the aggressive steps that some retailers are taking to fight  what they call a retail funk, and whether those measures are working.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Some very welcome good news for the city of Detroit.  Its plan  to adjust $18 billion of debt and exit the biggest municipal bankruptcy in  the nation's history is, quote, \"feasible\".  That according to an expert  witness chosen by the judge overseeing the Motor City's bankruptcy case.  </p><p>HERERA:  Some good news for workers.  More companies are paying higher  wages.  A new survey from the National Association for Business Economics  says the share of U.S. companies raising wages in the spring quarter more  than doubled from a year ago.  More than half of the firms surveyed  increased wages over the second quarter.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  But things may not be looking quite so rosy for new college  grads.  The research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco shows  that wages for recent college graduates are rising more slowly than they  are for the rest of the U.S. workforce. </p><p>HERERA:  Higher wages might be just what a lot of the nation's retailers  need right now as they fight off a funk from tight-fisted shoppers who are  reluctant to spend their money.  And now, retailers are fighting back.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It  hasn't been an easy year for retailers, and the stakes only get higher.   The all-important back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons have stores  pulling out all the stops to get consumers buying.  Economic data shows  consumers have been spending on big purchases, like homes and cars.</p><p>But when it comes to smaller items, like closet organizers, and clothing,  retail CEOs are scratching their heads.</p><p>Kip Tindell, CEO of the Container Store, thinks there is, quote, \"a retail  funk\" going on, causing sluggish sales at his company, as well as others.  </p><p>Demos Parneros, Staples' president of North American stores and online,  agrees, saying weather is no longer the foremost barometer retailers can  rely on to predict traffic.  </p><p>DEMOS PARNEROS, STAPLES PRESIDENT, N. AMERICAN STORES &amp; ONLINE:  We're  seeing different behavior pattern from customers, because they do have so  many choices.  Online, stores, or the combination, it's hard to put a  finger on exactly what's going on.  </p><p>REAGAN (on camera):  Consumer funk or not, retailers can't afford to sit  back and wait for the tide to turn.  Social media buying options,  aggressive pricing, and more convenient pop-up shops are just some of the  strategies that retailers are using to get shoppers buying in their stores  or on their Web sites.  </p><p>JEREMY ROSENBERG, ALLISON PARTNERS SVP DIGITAL MEDIA:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  \"buy\" button which was just recently introduced, Twitter has now started to  work with credit card purchasing companies and has bought a new company as  well to integrate that into their offer and the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) phone  which is really built around the idea that people can go in and use that as  a showrooming device is also going to help them in terms of building at a  better retail experience.  </p><p>REAGAN (voice-over):  Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) is offering a 110 percent money  back guarantee that its prices are the lowest, to keep shoppers buying  school supplies in stores or on its Web site.  </p><p>Even Fendi is employing a less traditional strategy in order to lure  consumers in, opening up a pop-up shop in New York's Soho neighborhood.  </p><p>While many retailers have certainly lost sales to online players like  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), more than 90 percent of all retail sales are still  made in stores.  But those in-store purchases are falling short, a major  worry going into the second most important retail season of the year, back  to school.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Chipotle posts an easy earnings beat after the bell and that is  where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The burrito chain saw a 25 percent increase in profit after traffic surged  during the quarter, that's despite a menu price increase.  It also lifted  its sales outlook for the year.  And shares initially jumped, look at that,  after hours to a new record high.  During the regular session, the stock  was slightly lower at $589.93.</p><p>Texas Instrument also out with results after the close.  The company's  second quarter earnings beat estimates because of higher demand for its  chips.  But its third quarter guidance was slightly below what Wall Street  has been looking for.  Shares fell slightly right after that report, as you  see on that graphic.  During the regular session, the stock was up a little  bit to $49.17.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's board announced a buyback.  The Dow component will  repurchase up to $5 billion worth of its stock.  The buyback was announced  after the market close and shares initially popped on the news, finishing  the regular session half percent lower at $101.27.</p><p>And Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) posted earnings that matched estimates, but  revenue was well above expectations.  The oilfield services provider said  increased drilling activity in the U.S. and in the Gulf of Mexico helped up  its quarterly net by 20 percent.  It also raised its share repurchase  program.  The stock was up slightly at $71 a share.</p><p>HERERA:  Hasbro's profit slipped last quarter as its sales declined in its  gaming unit.  The toy maker did see sales for its Transformer toys and  other products increase, but not enough to offset those soft game results.   The company said it is well-positioned for the holiday shopping season.   But investors were disappointed.  They sent the shares down more than 2 1/2  percent to $51.78.</p><p>And weak attendance at Six Flags weighed on that company's earnings.  The  company blamed the shrinking crowds on the bad winter weather, which  extended school calendars and shortened spring breaks.  Shares fell 4  percent to $39.31.</p><p>And a Florida jury returns one of the largest verdicts ever against a  tobacco company, awarding $24 billion to the widow of a man who died of  lung cancer.  RJ Reynolds says that it will appeal the verdict and calls  the damages grossly excessive.  RJ Reynolds is a subsidiary of Reynolds  American (NYSE:RAI), which closed 1 percent lower to $57.98.</p><p>And according to reports, EMC (NYSE:EMC) is being pushed to spin-off its  VMWare unit by activist investor Elliot Management.  That firm has taken a  $1 billion stake in the data storage equipment maker and is reportedly  attempting to convince the company that a sale of the unit would help the  lagging stock.  That is just the ticket really that sent shares up about 5  percent to finish at $28.33.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And more trouble for General Motors (NYSE:GM).  A new stop sale  order after a botched recall.  GM ordered Cadillac dealers to stop selling  some versions of the popular CTS (NYSE:CTS) model, because it doesn't yet  have a fix for the half million cars that were recalled last month, over an  issue in which the engine can shut off if the driver's knee hits the  ignition.  The cars involved are the 2003 through 2014 CTS (NYSE:CTS), and  the 2004 through 2006 CRX.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, driving may be hard enough but if you fly you know how time  consuming and costly that can be, especially with all those extra fees.   And starting today, there's one more.  The TSA security fee on every ticket  has more than doubled. </p><p>Phil LeBeau has more on the new fee and why airlines say this increase  could keep people from flying.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Whether  you realize it or not, when you fly, you pay to go through security.  Now,  it's more than double what you were paying just a few days ago.  The 9/11  fee of safety has gone from $2.50 per flight up to $5.60.  Unlike in the  past, there's no longer a cap on how much you might pay for a trip with  multiple legs.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't travel that much, but when I do, you know, I  like it to be affordable.  So, yes, not good for people who travel a lot.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I can nickel and dime my employer, it might work out.   But yes, everything just keeps going up.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Congress first imposed the TSA fee after 9/11, when airports had  to beef up security lines, and thousands of officers were hired to check  passengers, and bags.  But over the last decade, the tax never went up  while the TSA budget did.  So, Congress has okayed a higher TSA fee that  will generate another $16.9 billion.  The excess money going to the federal  deficit.  </p><p>For airlines, it's another tax they fear will hurt business.  </p><p>SEAN KENNEDY, ARILINES FOR AMERICA:  At some point, customers will say, I'm  going to do a staycation, I'll take the bus, I'll take the train, I'll find  another way to get to where I'm going, or I won't go there at all.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  While federal and local taxes for airline tickets have steadily  risen since the year 2000, so have the fees airlines now tack onto tickets  for checking bags, changing reservations, or other services.  In fact,  airlines worldwide generated $31 billion in fees last year.  </p><p>All of which means your average airline ticket is increasingly filled with  charges that go well beyond the base fare.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You got to put up with the annoyances to be able to get  somewhere quick, I guess.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think we have no choice.  So, we're doomed to take  it anyways.  </p><p>LEBEAU (on camera):  Flyers may not like paying a higher TAS fee, but  there's little appetite in Washington to rescind it.  Keeping airports safe  is one area where members of Congress are in agreement, even if that means  you end up paying a little bit more.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up you might want to savor that microbrew while you can  this summer.  We'll tell you why, next. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  It's good to be the boss and it could be really good for Jeff  Bewkes, CEO of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), if his company is acquired by 21st  Century Fox, or anyone else for that matter.</p><p>Bewkes could make 80 million bucks in so called parachute payment if  there's a change in control at Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), adding up all of his  stock awards, life insurance payments and other compensation. </p><p>MATHISEN:  That much money will buy you a lot of beer.  Unless the price of  hops, the key ingredient for brewers keeps rising.  </p><p>Jane Wells has more on just how expensive hops prices are, and what it  could mean for beer lovers.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEFF EDGERTON, BRIDGEPORT BREWING COMPANY:  A little bit of citrus and pine  in there, as well?  </p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  These are  heady times for America's craft brewers.  </p><p>EDGERTON:  It's a great time to be a beer drinker.  I've got a great job.   I love what I do.  </p><p>WELLS:  Jeff Edgerton is brew master for BridgePort Brewing Company, the  oldest brewery in Oregon.  His only problem, as craft beers have gained in  popularity, especially iPAs, there is a shortage of hops, the flower which  flavors them.  </p><p>EDGERTON:  Pricing is getting crazy.  One of the things that our brokers  are telling us is, we need to contract out for many years ahead of time.   So, we're contracted out right now about three years ahead.  I know some  breweries are contracting out five years ahead.  </p><p>BLAKE CROSBY, CROSBY HOP FARMS:  Kind of smells like grassy smell.</p><p>WELLS (on camera):  Wow! </p><p>(voice-over):  Blake Crosby is a fifth generation hops grower in Oregon.   As prices for hops have doubled, he's doubled acreage.  And he's spending  millions to expand into things like a machine which dries and compresses  hops into palettes.  </p><p>CROSBY:  All in all right now, hops are probably at the highest they've  been in 10 years and we're at a place where growers can finally afford to  make expansions and really grow their businesses, which is nice.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That was a good deal.  </p><p>WELLS: Crosby's cousin Ben Smith says if he could grow more hops he would.  </p><p>(on camera):  Are you going to sell everything you grow?  </p><p>BEN SMITH:  Yes, I am completely sold out for the next three years.  </p><p>WELLSS:  But with so many brewers making ever hoppier beers and so many  farmers rushing to add supply, the industry could end up with a craft beer  hangover, a hops bubble that pops.  </p><p>SMITH:  We've done a very good job of oversupplying the market in the past  so I wouldn't doubt that we'll do that again with this.  So, we'll just  kind of have to play it by ear, and lock in some good prices while we can.  </p><p>WELLS:  Stability that farmers can all drink to for now.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Woodburn, Oregon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Finally tonight, a lesson in having faith in your children, and  putting your money where your mouth is.  </p><p>A decade ago, Jerry McIlroy made a legal bet wagering around $340, that his  teenaged son Rory would win the British Open golf tournament by the time he  turned 26.  The odds, 500 to 1.  As any golf fan knows, Little Rory, now  25, and the number two ranked golfer in the world, won the British Open  this past weekend, collecting a lovely trophy.  </p><p>His dad Jerry collected a little something, too.  A staggering $171,000  check on that long-ago bet.  Money well spent.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Putting a few quid on your kid.  </p><p>HERERA:  Exactly.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  It always pays off.  </p><p>HERERA:  And supporting their dreams, too, which is so important.  </p><p>That will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for watching.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  We'll see you back here tomorrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I`m Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>HERERA: I`m Sue Herera, filling in for Susie Gharib.</p><p>It was a wild day in the markets with stocks kicking off the new week, closing to the downside as investors weighed the political and economic fallout of the conflict in Gaza and the crisis over that downed passenger jet in Ukraine. And as the investigation into the exact cause of that incident crawls along, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>asks for Russia`s help at the site of the tragedy.</p><p>But he stopped short of outright blaming Moscow and made no mention of a ramp-up of economic sanctions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If Russia continues to violate Ukraine`s sovereignty, and to back these separatists, and these separatists become more and more dangerous and now are risks not simply to the people inside of Ukraine but the broader international community, then Russia will only further isolate itself from the international community and the costs for Russia`s behavior will only continue to increase.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: On Wall Street, stocks began the day sharply lower with the Dow down as much as 125 points.

He called on Russia to use its influence with separatists to allow investigators full access to the crash site. But stocks began coming off their lows when it became clear he would not announce any new sanctions against Russia at that time.</p><p>Now, despite the tragedy, the markets have taken the crash in stride.

Even if the spill over affects, it doesn`t matter, earnings are strong and the Fed is there.</p><p>PISANI: Indeed with a little less than 1/5 of the S&amp;P 500 reporting, earnings are up almost 7 percent compared to the same period last year. While revenue growth is still modest, companies are continuing to find ways to cut costs and thus improve earnings, and that, along with continuing low interest rates are the main factors keeping the indices near historic highs.</p><p>European Union foreign ministers meet tomorrow and despite the rhetoric, the markets still believes no big sanctions will be coming against Russia in the next few days. That could change if separatists continue to block access to the crash sites.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, today is the start of one of the busiest weeks of the second quarter, earnings season. And one of the hottest momentum stocks on Wall Street posted its results after the closing bell, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The video streaming service earned a buck 15 per share. That was a penny below Wall Street forecasts. But, revenue was better than expected on a sharp increase in subscriptions.</p><p>And with that, shares initially moved higher in late trading. So, how many more TV watchers are tuning in to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)? And where will it be streaming those movies next?</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Bottom line: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is adding customers faster than expected, reporting more than 50 million streaming subscribers for the first time. So, what drove that subscriber growth? Well, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) doesn`t disclose specific viewer numbers, the company says it got a big boost from the popularity of the second season of \"Orange is the New Black.\"</p><p>Looking forward, the streaming video company says it expects to add subscribers even faster, projecting the addition of 3.7 million new streaming subscribers in Q3, most of them coming from overseas. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) announcing in September it will launch in France, Germany and other European markets with over 60 million new broadband households.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So other big tech companies on tap to report earnings this week as well. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), both are set to release their second quarter earnings results tomorrow.</p><p>Kim Forrest joins us now to tell us what she`s expected from these two tech giants. She is senior equity analyst with Fort Pitt Capital Group.</p><p>Welcome.</p><p>KIM FORREST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST: Thanks. Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA: Both of these reports are very important. But it`s going to be interesting because Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a new CEO. They had the Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition.</p><p>So, there`s a lot to look for in these reports, isn`t there?</p><p>FORREST: There really is. There is a lot of moving parts. And Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a lot of change. But so does Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And, well, they have a lot of potential change.</p><p>I think investors would like to hear news of what they have next. And usually that`s not what they do in earnings reports. But we`ll see tomorrow.</p><p>MATHISEN: And what are you expecting? Why don`t you take Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) first?</p><p>FORREST: Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN: Since it`s sort of a headline stock, not that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) isn`t.</p><p>FORREST: Sure. Well, I think it`s more accessible to more people, regular investors, because they probably have at least one Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) device. And that`s the thing that`s going to drive this stock. How many phones were sold? And how many iPads were sold?</p><p>Last quarter, iPads were a little disappointing, so I think the street is really going to be looking at that number.</p><p>HERERA: You know, Kim, we also, of course, have that Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). And we have some layoffs that are coming from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). It seems to me that that could really kind of be confusing in the report. There`s going to be a lot to kind of separate out to get net/net what Microsoft`s performance was in the last quarter.</p><p>FORREST: Exactly. And adding to this is the fact that you have so many people that follow and report on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and they may or may not have gotten a memo on how to do the accounting for this.</p><p>So, it`s going to be a confusing time tomorrow after 4:00. But we`re going to be able to weed through that. And the thing that we really look at for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), especially, is that parts of its business that are geared more towards business. So, that`s the server and tools, and the Office franchise. So, those are the parts that we`re going to be looking at closely.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let`s move on to two other tech companies that report later this week, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). I seem to be buying something from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) every day. I bought a showerhead today, for goodness sakes, Kim.</p><p>What do you expect out of that company?</p><p>FORREST: Well, I have to tell you this, I bought two things. I bought a coffeemaker today from them and dog bowls. But -- so, you know, they really are the one-stop shop, aren`t they? And we`re not really -- the consumer stuff that they sell is kind of interesting. It`s very low margin. What we`re really looking at is what they`re doing with the Cloud. And they seem to always give you one piece of information but not another.</p><p>So, it`s really difficult to see if they`re making money or not, but that`s a very intriguing business for somebody like us -- somebody like me to watch.</p><p>HERERA: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), give me the one metric that`s going to be the most important in that report tomorrow or in the analyst call.</p><p>FORREST: Sure. Mobile revenues. That`s where people are focused on for this stock. And I think that`s for good reason. We want to know if people are buying mobile apps, and how that`s going to let them grow in the future.</p><p>HERERA: Kim, thank you.</p><p>FORREST: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Kim Forrest with Fort Pitt Capital Group.</p><p>MATHISEN: Valeant Pharmaceutical`s nasty and hostile takeover battle to acquire the Botox maker Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is getting nastier and more hostile. Despite that, investors sent shares of both companies higher today, but as Meg Tirrell reports, things are just heating up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): More twists in who`s become one of the biggest soap operas on Wall Street. Allergan (NYSE:AGN), the maker of Botox, is cutting 1,500 jobs, in response to mounting pressure from Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The move comes three months into Valeant`s hostile bid for Allergan (NYSE:AGN), worth more than $50 billion.</p><p>Allergan (NYSE:AGN) says its restructuring will save $475 million a year. Valeant is working with Pershing Square`s Bill Ackman, currently the largest holder of Allergan (NYSE:AGN) stocks. He said today that Allergan`s slimming down was long overdue.</p><p>BILL ACKMAN, MANAGING PARTNER: Allergan (NYSE:AGN) has 1,200 basis points higher to spend 1,200 basis points more on overhead than the competitive set. I mean, that`s an incredible gap. And now they`re going to start to close that gap which, of course, it generates an increase in earnings. But really what you`re doing over the next several years is cutting out fat you should have cut out a long time ago.</p><p>TIRRELL: Valeant today said it contacted regulators in Canada and the U.S. over what it called false and misleading statements. Allergan`s been making about its business model. It also urged Allergan (NYSE:AGN) shareholders to vote for a special meeting called by Ackman, who is aiming to replace the majority of Allergan`s board.</p><p>ACKMAN: Why are we calling a special meeting? We are calling a special meeting so the shareholders can explain, express their views, that they want the Valeant deal, or not. They can decide they don`t want it. But at least that`s the first time the company`s going to have an opportunity to hear in an official way what their shareholders believe.</p><p>TIRRELL: Allergan (NYSE:AGN) has other plans. Chief executive David Pyatt told analysts that investors are urging him to pursue acquisitions of his own. The company said it may consider a deal that would help it lower its corporate tax rate, a common theme this year known as an inversion. Pyatt said it will certainly look for purchases that will add to earnings.</p><p>(on camera): In addition to slimming down, Allergan (NYSE:AGN) made big forecasts for its future. It predicts 20 percent annual earnings growth for the next five years, but only time will tell how this soap opera will end.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Well, Bill Ackman, the investor we just saw in Meg`s story is obviously a busy guy. He`s also embroiled in a longtime short selling campaign against the vitamin supplement company Herbalife (NYSE:HLF), calling its sales model a classic pyramid scheme. Shares of the company tumbled more than 11 percent today after Ackman said he expects the company to collapse. Ackman has long had a major short position in the stock, meaning he is betting that it will fall.</p><p>MATHISEN: More now on the international reaction to that downed passenger jet over Ukraine. Russia has been condemned by the West for its support of the Russian separatists who are likely to blame for the tragedy. It is getting support from China.</p><p>Eunice Yoon explains why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): China is warning against rushing to blame Russia for the downing over Ukraine of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Since the weekend, the Chinese press has been highly critical of the West`s approach, saying in editorials that countries like the U.S. are too quick to point fingers at Russia and Moscow-backed rebels without hard evidence.</p><p>Chinese state news agency Xinhua has called U.S. and Australian officials \"rash\". A communist party-backed newspaper \"The Global Times\" said the rush to judgment in the west is not based on known facts or logic.</p><p>The state press is also taking Russia`s point of view on the Ukraine conflict, saying the real culprit is a chaotic situation in Ukraine, which it says has been fomented by Western influences. The comments are a signal that despite historical mistrust between China and Russia, the two powers are increasingly finding common ground. Both currently have strained relations with the West, and are accused of engaging in aggressive foreign policy that could destabilize their regions, Russia and Ukraine and China in the east and South China Seas.</p><p>Yet both are in need of diplomatic and economic support. Even if the two may not see eye to eye on the price of gas, both are reluctant to criticize the other on political affairs. Perhaps a reason for Russian President Vladimir Putin`s pivot east.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: China`s got some media problems of its own, like food safety, for instance. A U.S. owned meat supplier in Shanghai has been accused of selling McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) and Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM), owner of the KFC chain, expired beef and chicken at restaurants in China. Even though sales have been suspended, investors were feeling a little queasy day. Shares of McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) down about 1 1/2 percent. Shares of Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) down more than 4 percent. &gt;</p><p>Still ahead, the aggressive steps that some retailers are taking to fight what they call a retail funk, and whether those measures are working.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Some very welcome good news for the city of Detroit. Its plan to adjust $18 billion of debt and exit the biggest municipal bankruptcy in the nation`s history is, quote, \"feasible\". That according to an expert witness chosen by the judge overseeing the Motor City`s bankruptcy case.</p><p>HERERA: Some good news for workers. More companies are paying higher wages. A new survey from the National Association for Business Economics says the share of U.S. companies raising wages in the spring quarter more than doubled from a year ago. More than half of the firms surveyed increased wages over the second quarter.</p><p>MATHISEN: But things may not be looking quite so rosy for new college grads. The research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco shows that wages for recent college graduates are rising more slowly than they are for the rest of the U.S. workforce.</p><p>HERERA: Higher wages might be just what a lot of the nation`s retailers need right now as they fight off a funk from tight-fisted shoppers who are reluctant to spend their money. And now, retailers are fighting back.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It hasn`t been an easy year for retailers, and the stakes only get higher. The all-important back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons have stores pulling out all the stops to get consumers buying. Economic data shows consumers have been spending on big purchases, like homes and cars.</p><p>But when it comes to smaller items, like closet organizers, and clothing, retail CEOs are scratching their heads.</p><p>Kip Tindell, CEO of the Container Store, thinks there is, quote, \"a retail funk\" going on, causing sluggish sales at his company, as well as others.</p><p>Demos Parneros, Staples` president of North American stores and online, agrees, saying weather is no longer the foremost barometer retailers can rely on to predict traffic.</p><p>DEMOS PARNEROS, STAPLES PRESIDENT, N. AMERICAN STORES &amp; ONLINE: We`re seeing different behavior pattern from customers, because they do have so many choices. Online, stores, or the combination, it`s hard to put a finger on exactly what`s going on.</p><p>REAGAN (on camera): Consumer funk or not, retailers can`t afford to sit back and wait for the tide to turn. Social media buying options, aggressive pricing, and more convenient pop-up shops are just some of the strategies that retailers are using to get shoppers buying in their stores or on their Web sites.</p><p>JEREMY ROSENBERG, ALLISON PARTNERS SVP DIGITAL MEDIA: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) \"buy\" button which was just recently introduced, Twitter has now started to work with credit card purchasing companies and has bought a new company as well to integrate that into their offer and the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) phone which is really built around the idea that people can go in and use that as a showrooming device is also going to help them in terms of building at a better retail experience.</p><p>REAGAN (voice-over): Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) is offering a 110 percent money back guarantee that its prices are the lowest, to keep shoppers buying school supplies in stores or on its Web site.</p><p>Even Fendi is employing a less traditional strategy in order to lure consumers in, opening up a pop-up shop in New York`s Soho neighborhood.</p><p>While many retailers have certainly lost sales to online players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), more than 90 percent of all retail sales are still made in stores. But those in-store purchases are falling short, a major worry going into the second most important retail season of the year, back to school.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Chipotle posts an easy earnings beat after the bell and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The burrito chain saw a 25 percent increase in profit after traffic surged during the quarter, that`s despite a menu price increase. It also lifted its sales outlook for the year. And shares initially jumped, look at that, after hours to a new record high. During the regular session, the stock was slightly lower at $589.93.</p><p>Texas Instrument also out with results after the close. The company`s second quarter earnings beat estimates because of higher demand for its chips. But its third quarter guidance was slightly below what Wall Street has been looking for. Shares fell slightly right after that report, as you see on that graphic. During the regular session, the stock was up a little bit to $49.17.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson`s board announced a buyback. The Dow component will repurchase up to $5 billion worth of its stock. The buyback was announced after the market close and shares initially popped on the news, finishing the regular session half percent lower at $101.27.</p><p>And Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) posted earnings that matched estimates, but revenue was well above expectations. The oilfield services provider said increased drilling activity in the U.S. and in the Gulf of Mexico helped up its quarterly net by 20 percent. It also raised its share repurchase program. The stock was up slightly at $71 a share.</p><p>HERERA: Hasbro`s profit slipped last quarter as its sales declined in its gaming unit. The toy maker did see sales for its Transformer toys and other products increase, but not enough to offset those soft game results. The company said it is well-positioned for the holiday shopping season. But investors were disappointed. They sent the shares down more than 2 1/2 percent to $51.78.</p><p>And weak attendance at Six Flags weighed on that company`s earnings. The company blamed the shrinking crowds on the bad winter weather, which extended school calendars and shortened spring breaks. Shares fell 4 percent to $39.31.</p><p>And a Florida jury returns one of the largest verdicts ever against a tobacco company, awarding $24 billion to the widow of a man who died of lung cancer. RJ Reynolds says that it will appeal the verdict and calls the damages grossly excessive. RJ Reynolds is a subsidiary of Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI), which closed 1 percent lower to $57.98.</p><p>And according to reports, EMC (NYSE:EMC) is being pushed to spin-off its VMWare unit by activist investor Elliot Management. That firm has taken a $1 billion stake in the data storage equipment maker and is reportedly attempting to convince the company that a sale of the unit would help the lagging stock. That is just the ticket really that sent shares up about 5 percent to finish at $28.33.</p><p>MATHISEN: And more trouble for General Motors (NYSE:GM). A new stop sale order after a botched recall. GM ordered Cadillac dealers to stop selling some versions of the popular CTS (NYSE:CTS) model, because it doesn`t yet have a fix for the half million cars that were recalled last month, over an issue in which the engine can shut off if the driver`s knee hits the ignition. The cars involved are the 2003 through 2014 CTS (NYSE:CTS), and the 2004 through 2006 CRX.</p><p>HERERA: Well, driving may be hard enough but if you fly you know how time consuming and costly that can be, especially with all those extra fees. And starting today, there`s one more. The TSA security fee on every ticket has more than doubled.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more on the new fee and why airlines say this increase could keep people from flying.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Whether you realize it or not, when you fly, you pay to go through security. Now, it`s more than double what you were paying just a few days ago. The 9/11 fee of safety has gone from $2.50 per flight up to $5.60. Unlike in the past, there`s no longer a cap on how much you might pay for a trip with multiple legs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don`t travel that much, but when I do, you know, I like it to be affordable. So, yes, not good for people who travel a lot.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can nickel and dime my employer, it might work out. But yes, everything just keeps going up.</p><p>LEBEAU: Congress first imposed the TSA fee after 9/11, when airports had to beef up security lines, and thousands of officers were hired to check passengers, and bags. But over the last decade, the tax never went up while the TSA budget did. So, Congress has okayed a higher TSA fee that will generate another $16.9 billion. The excess money going to the federal deficit.</p><p>For airlines, it`s another tax they fear will hurt business.</p><p>SEAN KENNEDY, ARILINES FOR AMERICA: At some point, customers will say, I`m going to do a staycation, I`ll take the bus, I`ll take the train, I`ll find another way to get to where I`m going, or I won`t go there at all.</p><p>LEBEAU: While federal and local taxes for airline tickets have steadily risen since the year 2000, so have the fees airlines now tack onto tickets for checking bags, changing reservations, or other services. In fact, airlines worldwide generated $31 billion in fees last year.</p><p>All of which means your average airline ticket is increasingly filled with charges that go well beyond the base fare.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got to put up with the annoyances to be able to get somewhere quick, I guess.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we have no choice. So, we`re doomed to take it anyways.</p><p>LEBEAU (on camera): Flyers may not like paying a higher TAS fee, but there`s little appetite in Washington to rescind it. Keeping airports safe is one area where members of Congress are in agreement, even if that means you end up paying a little bit more.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up you might want to savor that microbrew while you can this summer. We`ll tell you why, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: It`s good to be the boss and it could be really good for Jeff Bewkes, CEO of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), if his company is acquired by 21st Century Fox, or anyone else for that matter.</p><p>Bewkes could make 80 million bucks in so called parachute payment if there`s a change in control at Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), adding up all of his stock awards, life insurance payments and other compensation.</p><p>MATHISEN: That much money will buy you a lot of beer. Unless the price of hops, the key ingredient for brewers keeps rising.</p><p>Jane Wells has more on just how expensive hops prices are, and what it could mean for beer lovers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEFF EDGERTON, BRIDGEPORT BREWING COMPANY: A little bit of citrus and pine in there, as well?</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These are heady times for America`s craft brewers.</p><p>EDGERTON: It`s a great time to be a beer drinker. I`ve got a great job. I love what I do.</p><p>WELLS: Jeff Edgerton is brew master for BridgePort Brewing Company, the oldest brewery in Oregon. His only problem, as craft beers have gained in popularity, especially iPAs, there is a shortage of hops, the flower which flavors them.</p><p>EDGERTON: Pricing is getting crazy. One of the things that our brokers are telling us is, we need to contract out for many years ahead of time. So, we`re contracted out right now about three years ahead. I know some breweries are contracting out five years ahead.</p><p>BLAKE CROSBY, CROSBY HOP FARMS: Kind of smells like grassy smell.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): Wow!</p><p>(voice-over): Blake Crosby is a fifth generation hops grower in Oregon. As prices for hops have doubled, he`s doubled acreage. And he`s spending millions to expand into things like a machine which dries and compresses hops into palettes.</p><p>CROSBY: All in all right now, hops are probably at the highest they`ve been in 10 years and we`re at a place where growers can finally afford to make expansions and really grow their businesses, which is nice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was a good deal.</p><p>WELLS: Crosby`s cousin Ben Smith says if he could grow more hops he would.</p><p>(on camera): Are you going to sell everything you grow?</p><p>BEN SMITH: Yes, I am completely sold out for the next three years.</p><p>WELLSS: But with so many brewers making ever hoppier beers and so many farmers rushing to add supply, the industry could end up with a craft beer hangover, a hops bubble that pops.</p><p>SMITH: We`ve done a very good job of oversupplying the market in the past so I wouldn`t doubt that we`ll do that again with this. So, we`ll just kind of have to play it by ear, and lock in some good prices while we can.</p><p>WELLS: Stability that farmers can all drink to for now.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Woodburn, Oregon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Finally tonight, a lesson in having faith in your children, and putting your money where your mouth is.</p><p>A decade ago, Jerry McIlroy made a legal bet wagering around $340, that his teenaged son Rory would win the British Open golf tournament by the time he turned 26. The odds, 500 to 1. As any golf fan knows, Little Rory, now 25, and the number two ranked golfer in the world, won the British Open this past weekend, collecting a lovely trophy.</p><p>His dad Jerry collected a little something, too. A staggering $171,000 check on that long-ago bet. Money well spent.</p><p>MATHISEN: Putting a few quid on your kid.</p><p>HERERA: Exactly.</p><p>MATHISEN: It always pays off.</p><p>HERERA: And supporting their dreams, too, which is so important.</p><p>That will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

Fifty million subscribers now use the service, helping profits double. Is it enough to keep the stock firing on cylinders?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: As Wall Street turns, what are the business world's biggest soap operas just took another twist as the chase for Allergan (NYSE:AGN) grows increasingly hostile.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, July 21st.</p><p>And good evening, everyone, and welcome. I'm Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>HERERA: I'm Sue Herera, filling in for Susie Gharib.</p><p>It was a wild day in the markets with stocks kicking off the new week, closing to the downside as investors weighed the political and economic fallout of the conflict in Gaza and the crisis over that downed passenger jet in Ukraine. And as the investigation into the exact cause of that incident crawls along, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>asks for Russia's help at the site of the tragedy.</p><p>But he stopped short of outright blaming Moscow and made no mention of a ramp-up of economic sanctions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If Russia continues to violate Ukraine's sovereignty, and to back these separatists, and these separatists become more and more dangerous and now are risks not simply to the people inside of Ukraine but the broader international community, then Russia will only further isolate itself from the international community and the costs for Russia's behavior will only continue to increase.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: On Wall Street, stocks began the day sharply lower with the Dow down as much as 125 points. But the major averages battled right back. And at the close, the Dow was down just 48 points. The NASDAQ was lower by seven, and the S&amp;P 500 off by four.</p><p>The volatility in equities impacted the treasury market as well, with the yield on the 30-year bond dipping as far as 3.24 percent, the lowest level since June of last year.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more now on the swings in the market today, what investors are focusing on and not focusing on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The markets started down and they stayed down until <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>spoke shortly after 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the Ukraine crisis. He called on Russia to use its influence with separatists to allow investigators full access to the crash site. But stocks began coming off their lows when it became clear he would not announce any new sanctions against Russia at that time.</p><p>Now, despite the tragedy, the markets have taken the crash in stride. Because the economic impact on Europe and the U.S., so far, is still limited.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The market believes they are containable, so that while -- while they are tragedies, they do not spill over. Even if the spill over affects, it doesn't matter, earnings are strong and the Fed is there.</p><p>PISANI: Indeed with a little less than 1/5 of the S&amp;P 500 reporting, earnings are up almost 7 percent compared to the same period last year. While revenue growth is still modest, companies are continuing to find ways to cut costs and thus improve earnings, and that, along with continuing low interest rates are the main factors keeping the indices near historic highs.</p><p>European Union foreign ministers meet tomorrow and despite the rhetoric, the markets still believes no big sanctions will be coming against Russia in the next few days. That could change if separatists continue to block access to the crash sites.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, today is the start of one of the busiest weeks of the second quarter, earnings season. And one of the hottest momentum stocks on Wall Street posted its results after the closing bell, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The video streaming service earned a buck 15 per share. That was a penny below Wall Street forecasts. But, revenue was better than expected on a sharp increase in subscriptions.</p><p>And with that, shares initially moved higher in late trading. So, how many more TV watchers are tuning in to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)? And where will it be streaming those movies next?</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Bottom line: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is adding customers faster than expected, reporting more than 50 million streaming subscribers for the first time. So, what drove that subscriber growth? Well, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) doesn't disclose specific viewer numbers, the company says it got a big boost from the popularity of the second season of \"Orange is the New Black.\"</p><p>Looking forward, the streaming video company says it expects to add subscribers even faster, projecting the addition of 3.7 million new streaming subscribers in Q3, most of them coming from overseas. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) announcing in September it will launch in France, Germany and other European markets with over 60 million new broadband households.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So other big tech companies on tap to report earnings this week as well. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), both are set to release their second quarter earnings results tomorrow.</p><p>Kim Forrest joins us now to tell us what she's expected from these two tech giants. She is senior equity analyst with Fort Pitt Capital Group.</p><p>Welcome.</p><p>KIM FORREST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST: Thanks. Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA: Both of these reports are very important. But it's going to be interesting because Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a new CEO. They had the Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition.</p><p>So, there's a lot to look for in these reports, isn't there?</p><p>FORREST: There really is. There is a lot of moving parts. And Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a lot of change. But so does Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And, well, they have a lot of potential change.</p><p>I think investors would like to hear news of what they have next. And usually that's not what they do in earnings reports. But we'll see tomorrow.</p><p>MATHISEN: And what are you expecting? Why don't you take Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) first?</p><p>FORREST: Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN: Since it's sort of a headline stock, not that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) isn't.</p><p>FORREST: Sure. Well, I think it's more accessible to more people, regular investors, because they probably have at least one Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) device. And that's the thing that's going to drive this stock. How many phones were sold? And how many iPads were sold?</p><p>Last quarter, iPads were a little disappointing, so I think the street is really going to be looking at that number.</p><p>HERERA: You know, Kim, we also, of course, have that Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). And we have some layoffs that are coming from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). It seems to me that that could really kind of be confusing in the report. There's going to be a lot to kind of separate out to get net/net what Microsoft's performance was in the last quarter.</p><p>FORREST: Exactly. And adding to this is the fact that you have so many people that follow and report on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and they may or may not have gotten a memo on how to do the accounting for this.</p><p>So, it's going to be a confusing time tomorrow after 4:00. But we're going to be able to weed through that. And the thing that we really look at for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), especially, is that parts of its business that are geared more towards business. So, that's the server and tools, and the Office franchise. So, those are the parts that we're going to be looking at closely.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let's move on to two other tech companies that report later this week, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). I seem to be buying something from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) every day. I bought a showerhead today, for goodness sakes, Kim.</p><p>What do you expect out of that company?</p><p>FORREST: Well, I have to tell you this, I bought two things. I bought a coffeemaker today from them and dog bowls. But -- so, you know, they really are the one-stop shop, aren't they? And we're not really -- the consumer stuff that they sell is kind of interesting. It's very low margin. What we're really looking at is what they're doing with the Cloud. And they seem to always give you one piece of information but not another.</p><p>So, it's really difficult to see if they're making money or not, but that's a very intriguing business for somebody like us -- somebody like me to watch.</p><p>HERERA: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), give me the one metric that's going to be the most important in that report tomorrow or in the analyst call.</p><p>FORREST: Sure. Mobile revenues. That's where people are focused on for this stock. And I think that's for good reason. We want to know if people are buying mobile apps, and how that's going to let them grow in the future.</p><p>HERERA: Kim, thank you.</p><p>FORREST: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Kim Forrest with Fort Pitt Capital Group.</p><p>MATHISEN: Valeant Pharmaceutical's nasty and hostile takeover battle to acquire the Botox maker Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is getting nastier and more hostile. Despite that, investors sent shares of both companies higher today, but as Meg Tirrell reports, things are just heating up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): More twists in who's become one of the biggest soap operas on Wall Street. Allergan (NYSE:AGN), the maker of Botox, is cutting 1,500 jobs, in response to mounting pressure from Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The move comes three months into Valeant's hostile bid for Allergan (NYSE:AGN), worth more than $50 billion.</p><p>Allergan (NYSE:AGN) says its restructuring will save $475 million a year. Valeant is working with Pershing Square's Bill Ackman, currently the largest holder of Allergan (NYSE:AGN) stocks. He said today that Allergan's slimming down was long overdue.</p><p>BILL ACKMAN, MANAGING PARTNER: Allergan (NYSE:AGN) has 1,200 basis points higher to spend 1,200 basis points more on overhead than the competitive set. I mean, that's an incredible gap. And now they're going to start to close that gap which, of course, it generates an increase in earnings. But really what you're doing over the next several years is cutting out fat you should have cut out a long time ago.</p><p>TIRRELL: Valeant today said it contacted regulators in Canada and the U.S. over what it called false and misleading statements. Allergan's been making about its business model. It also urged Allergan (NYSE:AGN) shareholders to vote for a special meeting called by Ackman, who is aiming to replace the majority of Allergan's board.</p><p>ACKMAN: Why are we calling a special meeting? We are calling a special meeting so the shareholders can explain, express their views, that they want the Valeant deal, or not. They can decide they don't want it. But at least that's the first time the company's going to have an opportunity to hear in an official way what their shareholders believe.</p><p>TIRRELL: Allergan (NYSE:AGN) has other plans. Chief executive David Pyatt told analysts that investors are urging him to pursue acquisitions of his own. The company said it may consider a deal that would help it lower its corporate tax rate, a common theme this year known as an inversion. Pyatt said it will certainly look for purchases that will add to earnings.</p><p>(on camera): In addition to slimming down, Allergan (NYSE:AGN) made big forecasts for its future. It predicts 20 percent annual earnings growth for the next five years, but only time will tell how this soap opera will end.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Well, Bill Ackman, the investor we just saw in Meg's story is obviously a busy guy. He's also embroiled in a longtime short selling campaign against the vitamin supplement company Herbalife (NYSE:HLF), calling its sales model a classic pyramid scheme. Shares of the company tumbled more than 11 percent today after Ackman said he expects the company to collapse. Ackman has long had a major short position in the stock, meaning he is betting that it will fall.</p><p>MATHISEN: More now on the international reaction to that downed passenger jet over Ukraine. Russia has been condemned by the West for its support of the Russian separatists who are likely to blame for the tragedy. It is getting support from China.</p><p>Eunice Yoon explains why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): China is warning against rushing to blame Russia for the downing over Ukraine of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Since the weekend, the Chinese press has been highly critical of the West's approach, saying in editorials that countries like the U.S. are too quick to point fingers at Russia and Moscow-backed rebels without hard evidence.</p><p>Chinese state news agency Xinhua has called U.S. and Australian officials \"rash\". A communist party-backed newspaper \"The Global Times\" said the rush to judgment in the west is not based on known facts or logic.</p><p>The state press is also taking Russia's point of view on the Ukraine conflict, saying the real culprit is a chaotic situation in Ukraine, which it says has been fomented by Western influences. The comments are a signal that despite historical mistrust between China and Russia, the two powers are increasingly finding common ground. Both currently have strained relations with the West, and are accused of engaging in aggressive foreign policy that could destabilize their regions, Russia and Ukraine and China in the east and South China Seas.</p><p>Yet both are in need of diplomatic and economic support. Even if the two may not see eye to eye on the price of gas, both are reluctant to criticize the other on political affairs. Perhaps a reason for Russian President Vladimir Putin's pivot east.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: China's got some media problems of its own, like food safety, for instance. A U.S. owned meat supplier in Shanghai has been accused of selling McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM), owner of the KFC chain, expired beef and chicken at restaurants in China. Even though sales have been suspended, investors were feeling a little queasy day. Shares of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) down about 1 1/2 percent. Shares of Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) down more than 4 percent. ]</p><p>Still ahead, the aggressive steps that some retailers are taking to fight what they call a retail funk, and whether those measures are working.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Some very welcome good news for the city of Detroit. Its plan to adjust $18 billion of debt and exit the biggest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history is, quote, \"feasible\". That according to an expert witness chosen by the judge overseeing the Motor City's bankruptcy case.</p><p>HERERA: Some good news for workers. More companies are paying higher wages. A new survey from the National Association for Business Economics says the share of U.S. companies raising wages in the spring quarter more than doubled from a year ago. More than half of the firms surveyed increased wages over the second quarter.</p><p>MATHISEN: But things may not be looking quite so rosy for new college grads. The research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco shows that wages for recent college graduates are rising more slowly than they are for the rest of the U.S. workforce.</p><p>HERERA: Higher wages might be just what a lot of the nation's retailers need right now as they fight off a funk from tight-fisted shoppers who are reluctant to spend their money. And now, retailers are fighting back.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It hasn't been an easy year for retailers, and the stakes only get higher. The all-important back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons have stores pulling out all the stops to get consumers buying. Economic data shows consumers have been spending on big purchases, like homes and cars.</p><p>But when it comes to smaller items, like closet organizers, and clothing, retail CEOs are scratching their heads.</p><p>Kip Tindell, CEO of the Container Store, thinks there is, quote, \"a retail funk\" going on, causing sluggish sales at his company, as well as others.</p><p>Demos Parneros, Staples' president of North American stores and online, agrees, saying weather is no longer the foremost barometer retailers can rely on to predict traffic.</p><p>DEMOS PARNEROS, STAPLES PRESIDENT, N. AMERICAN STORES &amp; ONLINE: We're seeing different behavior pattern from customers, because they do have so many choices. Online, stores, or the combination, it's hard to put a finger on exactly what's going on.</p><p>REAGAN (on camera): Consumer funk or not, retailers can't afford to sit back and wait for the tide to turn. Social media buying options, aggressive pricing, and more convenient pop-up shops are just some of the strategies that retailers are using to get shoppers buying in their stores or on their Web sites.</p><p>JEREMY ROSENBERG, ALLISON PARTNERS SVP DIGITAL MEDIA: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) \"buy\" button which was just recently introduced, Twitter has now started to work with credit card purchasing companies and has bought a new company as well to integrate that into their offer and the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) phone which is really built around the idea that people can go in and use that as a showrooming device is also going to help them in terms of building at a better retail experience.</p><p>REAGAN (voice-over): Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) is offering a 110 percent money back guarantee that its prices are the lowest, to keep shoppers buying school supplies in stores or on its Web site.</p><p>Even Fendi is employing a less traditional strategy in order to lure consumers in, opening up a pop-up shop in New York's Soho neighborhood.</p><p>While many retailers have certainly lost sales to online players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), more than 90 percent of all retail sales are still made in stores. But those in-store purchases are falling short, a major worry going into the second most important retail season of the year, back to school.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Chipotle posts an easy earnings beat after the bell and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The burrito chain saw a 25 percent increase in profit after traffic surged during the quarter, that's despite a menu price increase. It also lifted its sales outlook for the year. And shares initially jumped, look at that, after hours to a new record high. During the regular session, the stock was slightly lower at $589.93.</p><p>Texas Instrument also out with results after the close. The company's second quarter earnings beat estimates because of higher demand for its chips. But its third quarter guidance was slightly below what Wall Street has been looking for. Shares fell slightly right after that report, as you see on that graphic. During the regular session, the stock was up a little bit to $49.17.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's board announced a buyback. The Dow component will repurchase up to $5 billion worth of its stock. The buyback was announced after the market close and shares initially popped on the news, finishing the regular session half percent lower at $101.27.</p><p>And Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) posted earnings that matched estimates, but revenue was well above expectations. The oilfield services provider said increased drilling activity in the U.S. and in the Gulf of Mexico helped up its quarterly net by 20 percent. It also raised its share repurchase program. The stock was up slightly at $71 a share.</p><p>HERERA: Hasbro's profit slipped last quarter as its sales declined in its gaming unit. The toy maker did see sales for its Transformer toys and other products increase, but not enough to offset those soft game results. The company said it is well-positioned for the holiday shopping season. But investors were disappointed. They sent the shares down more than 2 1/2 percent to $51.78.</p><p>And weak attendance at Six Flags weighed on that company's earnings. The company blamed the shrinking crowds on the bad winter weather, which extended school calendars and shortened spring breaks. Shares fell 4 percent to $39.31.</p><p>And a Florida jury returns one of the largest verdicts ever against a tobacco company, awarding $24 billion to the widow of a man who died of lung cancer. RJ Reynolds says that it will appeal the verdict and calls the damages grossly excessive. RJ Reynolds is a subsidiary of Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI), which closed 1 percent lower to $57.98.</p><p>And according to reports, EMC (NYSE:EMC) is being pushed to spin-off its VMWare unit by activist investor Elliot Management. That firm has taken a $1 billion stake in the data storage equipment maker and is reportedly attempting to convince the company that a sale of the unit would help the lagging stock. That is just the ticket really that sent shares up about 5 percent to finish at $28.33.</p><p>MATHISEN: And more trouble for General Motors (NYSE:GM). A new stop sale order after a botched recall. GM ordered Cadillac dealers to stop selling some versions of the popular CTS (NYSE:CTS) model, because it doesn't yet have a fix for the half million cars that were recalled last month, over an issue in which the engine can shut off if the driver's knee hits the ignition. The cars involved are the 2003 through 2014 CTS (NYSE:CTS), and the 2004 through 2006 CRX.</p><p>HERERA: Well, driving may be hard enough but if you fly you know how time consuming and costly that can be, especially with all those extra fees. And starting today, there's one more. The TSA security fee on every ticket has more than doubled.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more on the new fee and why airlines say this increase could keep people from flying.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Whether you realize it or not, when you fly, you pay to go through security. Now, it's more than double what you were paying just a few days ago. The 9/11 fee of safety has gone from $2.50 per flight up to $5.60. Unlike in the past, there's no longer a cap on how much you might pay for a trip with multiple legs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't travel that much, but when I do, you know, I like it to be affordable. So, yes, not good for people who travel a lot.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can nickel and dime my employer, it might work out. But yes, everything just keeps going up.</p><p>LEBEAU: Congress first imposed the TSA fee after 9/11, when airports had to beef up security lines, and thousands of officers were hired to check passengers, and bags. But over the last decade, the tax never went up while the TSA budget did. So, Congress has okayed a higher TSA fee that will generate another $16.9 billion. The excess money going to the federal deficit.</p><p>For airlines, it's another tax they fear will hurt business.</p><p>SEAN KENNEDY, ARILINES FOR AMERICA: At some point, customers will say, I'm going to do a staycation, I'll take the bus, I'll take the train, I'll find another way to get to where I'm going, or I won't go there at all.</p><p>LEBEAU: While federal and local taxes for airline tickets have steadily risen since the year 2000, so have the fees airlines now tack onto tickets for checking bags, changing reservations, or other services. In fact, airlines worldwide generated $31 billion in fees last year.</p><p>All of which means your average airline ticket is increasingly filled with charges that go well beyond the base fare.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got to put up with the annoyances to be able to get somewhere quick, I guess.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we have no choice. So, we're doomed to take it anyways.</p><p>LEBEAU (on camera): Flyers may not like paying a higher TAS fee, but there's little appetite in Washington to rescind it. Keeping airports safe is one area where members of Congress are in agreement, even if that means you end up paying a little bit more.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up you might want to savor that microbrew while you can this summer. We'll tell you why, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: It's good to be the boss and it could be really good for Jeff Bewkes, CEO of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), if his company is acquired by 21st Century Fox, or anyone else for that matter.</p><p>Bewkes could make 80 million bucks in so called parachute payment if there's a change in control at Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), adding up all of his stock awards, life insurance payments and other compensation.</p><p>MATHISEN: That much money will buy you a lot of beer. Unless the price of hops, the key ingredient for brewers keeps rising.</p><p>Jane Wells has more on just how expensive hops prices are, and what it could mean for beer lovers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEFF EDGERTON, BRIDGEPORT BREWING COMPANY: A little bit of citrus and pine in there, as well?</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These are heady times for America's craft brewers.</p><p>EDGERTON: It's a great time to be a beer drinker. I've got a great job. I love what I do.</p><p>WELLS: Jeff Edgerton is brew master for BridgePort Brewing Company, the oldest brewery in Oregon. His only problem, as craft beers have gained in popularity, especially iPAs, there is a shortage of hops, the flower which flavors them.</p><p>EDGERTON: Pricing is getting crazy. One of the things that our brokers are telling us is, we need to contract out for many years ahead of time. So, we're contracted out right now about three years ahead. I know some breweries are contracting out five years ahead.</p><p>BLAKE CROSBY, CROSBY HOP FARMS: Kind of smells like grassy smell.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): Wow!</p><p>(voice-over): Blake Crosby is a fifth generation hops grower in Oregon. As prices for hops have doubled, he's doubled acreage. And he's spending millions to expand into things like a machine which dries and compresses hops into palettes.</p><p>CROSBY: All in all right now, hops are probably at the highest they've been in 10 years and we're at a place where growers can finally afford to make expansions and really grow their businesses, which is nice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was a good deal.</p><p>WELLS: Crosby's cousin Ben Smith says if he could grow more hops he would.</p><p>(on camera): Are you going to sell everything you grow?</p><p>BEN SMITH: Yes, I am completely sold out for the next three years.</p><p>WELLSS: But with so many brewers making ever hoppier beers and so many farmers rushing to add supply, the industry could end up with a craft beer hangover, a hops bubble that pops.</p><p>SMITH: We've done a very good job of oversupplying the market in the past so I wouldn't doubt that we'll do that again with this. So, we'll just kind of have to play it by ear, and lock in some good prices while we can.</p><p>WELLS: Stability that farmers can all drink to for now.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Woodburn, Oregon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Finally tonight, a lesson in having faith in your children, and putting your money where your mouth is.</p><p>A decade ago, Jerry McIlroy made a legal bet wagering around $340, that his teenaged son Rory would win the British Open golf tournament by the time he turned 26. The odds, 500 to 1. As any golf fan knows, Little Rory, now 25, and the number two ranked golfer in the world, won the British Open this past weekend, collecting a lovely trophy.</p><p>His dad Jerry collected a little something, too. A staggering $171,000 check on that long-ago bet. Money well spent.</p><p>MATHISEN: Putting a few quid on your kid.</p><p>HERERA: Exactly.</p><p>MATHISEN: It always pays off.</p><p>HERERA: And supporting their dreams, too, which is so important.</p><p>That will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Sue Herera. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. We'll see you back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Dow components Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fall sharply after reporting late-day profits, potentially extending today`s deep selloff in stocks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: New hope and a new generation of potential drugs that can treat a growing disease with no cure -- Alzheimer`s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: And not so fast. The one thing that could prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, July 21st.</p><p>EPPERSON: Good evening, everyone. I`m Sharon Epperson, in tonight for Sue Herera.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Welcome, everybody.</p><p>Sharon, it was a blue chip wreck on Wall Street today. More on that in a moment.</p><p>But we begin tonight with earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), two bellwether companies of the new economy, and two dominant players in the tech sector, of course. The tech sector makes up 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500, by the way.</p><p>And, tonight, both companies, which you likely own through your mutual funds and 401(k)s, well, they failed to wow investors.</p><p>First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The world`s most valuable company reported earnings of $1.85 a share. That was 4 cents better than the consensus forecast. Revenue was also slightly better at $49.6 billion.</p><p>So, what`s the problem? Well, despite selling more than 47 million iPhones in the quarter, yes, you heard me right, it was the company`s weak outlook that sent shares initially lower. A lot lower after that report.</p><p>Josh Lipton has the key takeaway from Apple`s results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big number in Apple`s latest earnings report, 47.5 million. That is the number of iPhones Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it shipped in the quarter. Now, that was up 35 percent year over year, but was also basically in line with what Wall Street expected. Analysts had forecasted that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would ship some 47.3 million iPhones.</p><p>In a conversation with Apple`s CEO Tim Cook, he told me that only 27 percent of the company`s install base had moved those newer 6 and 6-Plus models. That suggests plenty of upgrade headroom ahead. But at least in the after-hours, investors seem to be focused on that in-line number.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton in Cupertino, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: Now to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which reported better than expected earnings in revenue, but took a hit from restructuring charges and soft demand from some of its products. The world`s largest software company reported earnings of 62 cents a share, 6 cents better than estimates. The company reported revenue that was slightly more than $22 billion.</p><p>But investors wanted more, sending shares initially lower after the report.</p><p>Kayla Tausche digs deeper into the results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: From the face of it, Microsoft`s fiscal fourth quarter looks like a beat all around, the problem was, that the company`s quarter was marred by a massive write-down of its Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition that happened just a few years ago. It was forecast to be a $7.6 billion write-down. It came in $8.4 billion.</p><p>When you peel away what the revenue story told us, it did look a little weaker, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling prey again to a stronger dollar, and some currency head winds, especially in its overseas business, namely for Japan.</p><p>When you look at its licensing, there was an expectation that as P.C. shipments declined, that installs of Windows and Office would decline as well. They declined more than the PC shipments fell by. That`s leading people to wonder what exactly is going on there.</p><p>Kayla Tausche, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) missed second quarter earnings estimates, those sales narrowly beat those forecasts. The Internet media company`s results were way down by higher spending to attract users to its Web sites in order to better compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and others. Part of Yahoo`s strategy has been to invest for its mobile platform, as a way to drive ad sales. Shares of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) fell initially after the report as you see there.</p><p>EPPERSON: Let`s turn to David Garrity now for more discussion about what`s happening in the tech sector and what it may mean for you and your money. He`s principle at GVA Research.</p><p>David, thank you for joining us.</p><p>So many people have some of these big tech names in their portfolio, either in their IRA or perhaps in the mutual funds they have in their 401k. But when we`re talking about names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), is there really growth in some of these big stocks over the long term, over the next five, 10 years?</p><p>DAVID GARRITY, GVA RESEARCH: Well, Sharon, certainly, looking at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), we`re in a situation here where the expectations for smartphone growth over the next five years probably better than 15 percent on a secular rate, and we`re in a situation where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is gaining share. And as we know from the standpoint of the price points that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products are being sold at, they occupy the top of the market.</p><p>And so, from that standpoint, we think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains the dominant player in a high growth segment, if we look at the valuation on the stock, whether we back the $200 billion in cash out or not, we`re still looking at a valuation which is below an overall market multiple. And so, from that stand point, we think that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of what you`re paying for its growth remains quite attractive, might have been somewhat disappointing in the quarter that we didn`t see the announcement coming out with respect to the dividend. But the company certainly has the funds available to do that.</p><p>On the product innovation side, we would say that, you know, the iPhone 6 upgrade cycle still remains strong. It might have been disappointing in terms of the quarter, and there may some concerns about the September quarter`s guidance. But we would say, overall, the opportunity to buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on this pull back remains attractive.</p><p>MATHISEN: As a long term bet, and that is two-thumbs up for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). You can use both thumbs there, David.</p><p>How about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)? As a long term play, how does it look to you?</p><p>GARRITY: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a little bit trickier because certainly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a company which was successful in earlier generations of technology, namely around PCs. But if we look at the shift over to mobile devices, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a far distant third behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in terms of the operating system software that`s being provided.</p><p>And, obviously, Microsoft`s predicaments are somewhat underscored by the fact that we`re going to be giving away their Window`s 10 operating system software to consumers. Something they wouldn`t have done in the past.</p><p>Clearly, in the case of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a company that has substantial resources both financial and technical, but nevertheless, somewhat disconcerting to see a company go out and spend approximately $9 billion to buy a company, and then within approximately a year and a half later, write off the full value of that, as well as also fire the substantial number of employees related to that business.</p><p>So, certainly, the hope here is under new CEO, Satya Nadella, the company will find a better direction going more towards Cloud computing that will help to reignite the growth for the company, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a name that we like, might not be so aggressive on a pull back here as we might be with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>EPPERSON: All right. So, a like, not a love, on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from you, David.</p><p>Thank you for joining us. David Garrity with GVA Research.</p><p>GARRITY: Thank you, Sharon.</p><p>MATHISEN: And Sharon was just mentioning how many mutual funds own either Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>According to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), the top three mutual fund holders of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), include the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, a lot of people have that. The Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, it`s in a lot of 401(k)s, and the Fidelity ContraFund.</p><p>As for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, and the Institutional Index Fund are two of the biggest holders as is the American funds group, Washington Mutual Fund.</p><p>EPPERSON: Tyler, those weak after the bell results could extend today`s deep losses, disappointing results from a handful of Dow components before the open weighed on the blue chip index.</p><p>United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) fell 7 percent. IBM, which we told you about last night, was off nearly 6 percent. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) dropped more than 2 percent. Travelers was one of the bright spots after it reported results this morning, that dragged down the Dow, though, overall, which fell 181 points to 17,9119. The NASDAQ was off 10 points and the S&amp;P 500 fell 9 points.</p><p>Dominic Chu has more on today`s earnings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The dive in the Dow today was the result of a broader base selloff among 30 component stocks, the vast majority of which finished the day lower, and the stock that really drove much of the weakness was United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) - - the diversified industrial company behind brands like Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Engines and Carrier Air-conditioning Systems reported earnings that beat Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>Overall sales, however, fell shy of expectations. The company said that orders from China for its Otis elevators and escalators business fell. As a result of that and other signs of softer customer demand, it cut its full year forecast.</p><p>Now, remember, the company also recently announced the sale of its Sikorsky helicopter business to defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). Another decliner on the day was Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Communications, America`s biggest telecom company by market value. It reported profits that beat Wall Street estimates, but it too reported sales that missed. While Verizon (NYSE:VZ) did manage to add more wireless phone customers and boosted revenues for its FiOS high speed internet phone and TV service, average sales generated per user fell, thanks to increased competition and promotions. That was one of the reasons it lowered expectations for full year sales growth.</p><p>One of the modest bright spots came by insurance giant travelers. It too reported profits that beat analyst estimates on sales that fell slightly below forecast. The company was aided by fewer losses tied to catastrophes that the company insures against and settlement of a prior tax issue. Shares were among just a handful on the Dow that rose on the day.</p><p>With less than a fifth of companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported their quarterly results, a big focus will be on whether the rest of corporate America can help drive earnings growth. We`re still very early in earnings season.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Late today, Dow Jones reports that federal regulators are close to approving AT&amp;T`s $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV. That would clear the way for the biggest media deal of the past year. The Justice Department has already signed off on that deal.</p><p>Now, Citigroup (NYSE:C) is being ordered to pay about $700 million to customers for deceptive marketing and billing tactics. The refund will go to more than 8 1/2 million credit card customers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says Citi`s violations took place from 2003 to 2012, and include misrepresenting the cost and benefits of certain add-on products like identity theft monitoring and debt protection services.</p><p>EPPERSON: Some big banks are setting aside more money to cover bad loans to energy companies, after oil prices dropped over the past year. According to \"Reuters\", which cited analysts reports, that raises the possibility that deteriorating loans could start to hurt bank earnings.</p><p>Last week, executives from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) told investors that they are increasingly concerned about loans to oil and gas companies. Today, oil prices settled around $50 a barrel.</p><p>MATHISEN: One Wall Street strategist says the Federal Reserve had never hiked rates when commodities had been in a pronounced downtrend. He`s Larry McDonald, head of U.S. Micro Strategy at Societe Generale.</p><p>Larry, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>Is it as simple as history? If it is, the CRB, which is the leading commodities index, I think is down about a third over the past year, that would say the Fed ain`t going to do anything this year.</p><p>LARRY MCDONALD, SOCIETE GENERALE: That`s the thing, Tyler. I mean, the CRB is right on the 2009 recession lows, and it`s very close to the 2002 recession lows.</p><p>So, the commodity index is right on recession levels, and you have to remember, the United States in the `80s and `90s was about 55 percent to 60 percent of global GDP. Today, we`re 24, 25 percent.</p><p>So, the Fed has to look at the global economy, much more so than he did in years past.</p><p>EPPERSON: That`s not the first thing, Larry, that the Fed will say they`re going to look at when it comes to what they`re going to do with interest rates. How important do you think are commodity prices to their next move, and when do you think they`re going to make that move?</p><p>MCDONALD: Well, remember, they have a dual mandate, which was established -- think about how long the dual mandate, they have to look at unemployment and inflation. And 10 years ago, Chinese GDP would say $2 trillion. Now, we`re up around $10 trillion or $11 trillion.</p><p>The dual mandate around inflation, if China`s slowing and that`s hurting commodity prices, that`s going to leak over eventually to core inflation, which is part of the Fed`s dual mandate, which doesn`t give them a reason to hike. On unemployment level does, but the inflation level, if it`s ticking down a notch, certainly doesn`t.</p><p>MATHISEN: Very interesting point. Larry McDonald, haven`t heard it made. We appreciate it.</p><p>MCDONALD: Thanks, Tyler. Thanks, Sharon.</p><p>MATHISEN: Larry McDonald of Societe Generale.</p><p>EPPERSON: And still ahead, the big hope, big opportunity and big risks associated with developing new Alzheimer`s drugs.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Alzheimer`s, it affects more than 5 million Americans today. It is the country`s sixth most deadly disease. And yet finding a cure or a treatment that slows the progression of the ailment has proved illusive.</p><p>But now, as Meg Tirrell reports, there appears to be new hope.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The quest to develop a drug that actually slows the course of Alzheimer`s disease has been a long one, marked by failure. Since 1998, 123 drugs have failed in development. Just four were approved. None slowed the declines in memory loss and sinking clearly that characterized Alzheimer`s.</p><p>This year, though, new hope has bloomed.</p><p>DR. MARIA CARRILLO: The scientific community has really been given a boost by some recent positive news of different drugs. So, we are all very hopeful at this time, more hopeful than we have been before.</p><p>TIRRELL: Experimental medicines from Biogen and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) are under the spotlight this week, with new data coming Wednesday at the Alzheimer`s Association International Conference in Washington, D.C.</p><p>They work to remove the plaque buildups in the brain known as beta amyloid, thought to be toxic to neurons. Evidence from early studies shows that removing the plaques may help steam declines in cognition, results that still need to be supported by larger studies.</p><p>A successful drug could mean big business. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer`s today, a number that could triple by 2050. Some analysts estimate the market for an Alzheimer`s drug could be $20 billion a year.</p><p>CARRILLO: This disease is urgent and we need answers now. Baby boomers cost us about 2 percent of Medicare overall spending today. That number will increase almost 25 percent by 2040 if we don`t stop this disease.</p><p>TIRRELL: The National Institutes of Health spent about $560 million of its $30 billion budget on Alzheimer`s disease last year, an amount some say isn`t enough to address the size of the problem. It allocated more than a billion and a half to heart disease, and $5 billion to cancer.</p><p>FRED HASSAN, WARBURG PINCUS: We need to have a war on Alzheimer`s mentality here, a sense of urgency.</p><p>TIRRELL: Fred Hassan led pharmaceutical companies including Schering Plough, which developed an Alzheimer`s drug now owned by Merck (NYSE:MRK). He calls the disease the biggest long term tsunami facing many countries</p><p>HASSAN: It`s a moral imperative because the patients can`t speak for themselves. That`s why we as a society need to speak for the patients here and do more. Half a billion is not much.</p><p>TIRREL: The results tomorrow could spur not just hope for medicine, but big moves in drug maker stock prices as well.</p><p>Cowen estimates Biogen shares could swing $50 in either direction, representing as much as $10 billion in market value.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: Chipotle beats estimates but misses on one key metric. That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The burrito chain said same store sales rose less than analysts were expecting, still, it managed to top consensus on the top and bottom lines. After the bell, shares were initially lower, but managed to turn around. During the regular session, shares were off a fraction to $673.07.</p><p>GoPro saw its revenues surge by more than 70 percent, helped by growing demand for its action cameras overseas. Earnings in revenue topped the street`s consensus. Shares were volatile initially in after-hours trading. Before the close, though, the stock was 2 percent higher to $62.04.</p><p>Novartis saw its shares after reporting a decline in profits. This was drug giant was hit by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar and weak results from its eye care treatment business. Yet, the CEO says he`s optimistic about the company`s pipeline.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE JIMENEZ, NOVARTIS CEO: When you look at our results, the best part about the quarter was the innovation. You know, we just got approval to launch our new heart failure drug called Entresto. This is a drug that`s proven to reduce cardiovascular death by 20 percent. We think this is going to be a multimillion dollar drug for the company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EPPERSON: Still, shares slipped more than 2 percent to $103.71.</p><p>Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) swung to a loss in its most recent quarter. The oil field services company saw revenue dropped more than 30 percent, saying it expects tumbling oil prices will persist for the rest of the year. Still, sales weren`t as weak as expected. Shares rose about 2 percent to $60.64.</p><p>MATHISEN: And an increase in trading activity helped TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) post an increase in profit. Revenue also coming in better than expected. Still, shares flipped on this down day by more than 1 1/2 percent. They close at $37.73.</p><p>Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) also reporting mixed quarterlies, the strong greenback weighed on its international sales. But the cycle maker refused to keep pace with rivals` steep discounts. Shares revved up a little bit, about 5 percent to $57.67.</p><p>LifeLock shares were halted at one point in today`s session, after the Federal Trade Commission charged the identity theft monitoring company, saying it failed to protect its consumers` data. The charges say the firm is violating the terms of a previous settlement with the agency. LifeLock could disagree saying it`s prepared to take the case to court.</p><p>When shares continue trading they plunged, plunging almost 50 percent lower on the day at $8.15.</p><p>CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) won a key approval for its pending deal to buy the parent company of One West Bank. The Office of the Comptroller Currency gave the OK. The Federal Reserve now has to approve the agreement, which was announced way back in last July. Shares were more than 2 percent higher, they finished at $48.18.</p><p>EPPERSON: Toshiba finds itself at the center of one of Japan`s biggest accounting scandals. The CEO and other executives resigned after taking responsibility for inflating profits by more than $1 billion over several years. At a press conference today, the executives were seen vowing, a gesture meant to convey deep shame.</p><p>The company will have to restate profits back to 2008 when the cover- up began.</p><p>MATHISEN: Uber, the fast growing, ride hailing app start-up held a jobs tour for drivers today in New York City. The jobs tour comes as New York tries to crackdown on the company`s expansion. The city council is expected to vote on a bill that would cap Uber`s growth while the city studies its impact on traffic congestion. Uber executives say the measure threatens its business model in one of its largest markets.</p><p>And Uber now valued at around $40 billion, is fast becoming a political lightning rod. Not just in New York, but also on the national stage. Republicans generally have embraced it as a symbol of disruptive progress. Democrats say it represents a new era of job insecurity, the temping of America.</p><p>John Harwood joins us from Washington.</p><p>John, Uber`s not only changing the business world, but also the political world. Why have so many politicians not just Mayor de Blasio here in New York, latched on to it and made it the target of political warfare?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: What do they say about economics? It`s about creative destruction. And when you have creative destruction, some things get destroyed -- old models, old incumbent firms, and in the case of Bill de Blasio in New York, yes, he is raising the issue of traffic congestion, but the rise of Uber is also threatening the incumbent taxi drivers who have relationships, financial relationships with the city, with its politicians. And so, that`s not an insignificant item.</p><p>Secondly, Uber represents broader changes in the national economy, that`s what Hillary Clinton and some Democrats have pointed to, although they are not -- to be fair to Democrats -- they are not saying Uber is bad in and of itself. They`re saying it raises some problems and underscores some problems in the economy that we have to deal with.</p><p>EPPERSON: What about the Republicans, what are they saying in terms of how Uber or companies like that are changing the economy, changing the way people are working today?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, Republicans are casting Uber as a symbol of the 21st century economy, and say when Democrats raise questions about it, they`re looking backwards, they`re representing the past.</p><p>For example, last week, Hillary Clinton gave a speech reflecting her economic view in which she talked about the issue of classification, should workers be described as contractors or as employees of firms like Uber?</p><p>Well, as it happened, this is a big issue with Uber, many other firms too. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) just paid a big settlement on that issue as well. And Jeb Bush attacked her for being stuck in the last century. That`s a future past debate that Republicans think they`re on the right side of.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. John Harwood, thanks very much -- John Harwood reporting tonight from Washington.</p><p>And coming up, one sector of the real estate market that has been red- hot for investors. We`ll tell you what it is. You may be surprised, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>EPPERSON: Here`s what to watch tomorrow: earnings from Dow components American Express (NYSE:EXPR) (NYSE:AXP), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and more. Housing data, including existing home sales and weekly mortgage applications. And that`s what to watch Wednesday.</p><p>MATHISEN: It`s a little known sector of real estate investment, but it is growing exponentially -- data centers that serve the Cloud. Sounds pretty dull, right? Well, not if you look at the product potential involved.</p><p>Diana Olick has. And she`s got more on this red hot sector.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Most people think the Cloud lives in the sky. But it really lives here, in data centers in downtown buildings and suburban warehouses. As data booms, so too does the value of all that real estate, and the REITs that own it.</p><p>GARY WOJTASZEK, CYRUSONE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: Our focus is serving the needs of the Fortune 1,000. That comprises about 75 percent of our business, including nine of the Fortune 20. So, these are the largest companies in the world that have chosen to store their computers in our data centers.</p><p>OLICK: CyrusOne is one of five data center REITs which own two types of property. One is basically a big power station for servers like this one in Sterling, Virginia. The other is an Internet hub where the tenants exchange data. These are more valuable because they`re generally located in urban areas.</p><p>WOJTASZEK: We`re structured as a real estate investment trust. So, we`re predominantly just a real estate company, but we are a derivative of what`s going on in all the growth and technology space. So, everything you hear about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Rackspace and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and all those new technologies that are going on, ultimately reside in the data center.</p><p>OLICK: Data center REIT returns have been robust to say the least. CyrusOne, Coresite, Digital Realty, Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), and QTS, in particular, up 46 percent in the past year.</p><p>They can, however, be a tough sell because they are at the crossroads of real estate and technology, which investors value differently.</p><p>JOHN BEJJANI, GREEN STREET ADVISORS: Because data centers are subject to all this technology risk, potential technology risk, because there`s so much more to understanding the sector than simply knowing where the real estate is located, some investors opt not to take on the brain damage of understanding these various risks.</p><p>OLICK: And then there`s demand. Technology changes moment to moment, and forecasting that change in terms of real estate, for both tenants and landlords is tricky. Developers want to capture this demand immediately. But too much speculation could lead to too much supply.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: That`s a really nice investment. Interesting investment to think about when you want that debate, but you`re afraid of the risks coming to the technology sector.</p><p>MATHISEN: And the capital returns were huge as Diana just showed out over the past year.</p><p>EPPERSON: Absolutely.</p><p>MATHISEN: Quite amazing.</p><p>EPPERSON: Really good.</p><p>That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sharon Epperson. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And thanks from me as well. I`m Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody. Hope you`ll join us here tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The one thing that could prevent the  Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.  </p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday,  July 21st.</p><p>EPPERSON:  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Sharon Epperson, in tonight  for Sue Herera.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Welcome, everybody.  </p><p>Sharon, it was a blue chip wreck on Wall Street today.  More on that  in a moment.</p><p>But we begin tonight with earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), two bellwether companies of the new economy, and  two dominant players in the tech sector, of course.  The tech sector makes  up 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500, by the way.</p><p>And, tonight, both companies, which you likely own through your  mutual funds and 401(k)s, well, they failed to wow investors.  </p><p>First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  The world's most valuable company  reported earnings of $1.85 a share.  That was 4 cents better than the  consensus forecast.  Revenue was also slightly better at $49.6 billion.</p><p>So, what's the problem?  Well, despite selling more than 47 million  iPhones in the quarter, yes, you heard me right, it was the company's weak  outlook that sent shares initially lower.  A lot lower after that report.  </p><p>Josh Lipton has the key takeaway from Apple's results.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big number  in Apple's latest earnings report, 47.5 million.  That is the number of  iPhones Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it shipped in the quarter.  Now, that was  up 35 percent year over year, but was also basically in line with what Wall  Street expected.  Analysts had forecasted that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would  ship some 47.3 million iPhones.</p><p>In a conversation with Apple's CEO Tim Cook, he told me that only 27  percent of the company's install base had moved those newer 6 and 6-Plus  models.  That suggests plenty of upgrade headroom ahead.  But at least in  the after-hours, investors seem to be focused on that in-line number.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in Cupertino,  California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON:  Now to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which reported better than  expected earnings in revenue, but took a hit from restructuring charges and  soft demand from some of its products.  The world's largest software  company reported earnings of 62 cents a share, 6 cents better than  estimates.  The company reported revenue that was slightly more than $22  billion. </p><p>But investors wanted more, sending shares initially lower after the  report.  </p><p>Kayla Tausche digs deeper into the results.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From the face  of it, Microsoft's fiscal fourth quarter looks like a beat all around, the  problem was, that the company's quarter was marred by a massive write-down  of its Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition that happened just a few years ago.  It  was forecast to be a $7.6 billion write-down.  It came in $8.4 billion.  </p><p>When you peel away what the revenue story told us, it did look a  little weaker, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling prey again to a stronger  dollar, and some currency head winds, especially in its overseas business,  namely for Japan.  </p><p>When you look at its licensing, there was an expectation that as P.C.  shipments declined, that installs of Windows and Office would decline as  well.  They declined more than the PC shipments fell by.  That's leading  people to wonder what exactly is going on there.</p><p>Kayla Tausche, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) missed second quarter earnings  estimates, those sales narrowly beat those forecasts.  The Internet media  company's results were way down by higher spending to attract users to its  Web sites in order to better compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and others.  Part of Yahoo's strategy has been to invest for  its mobile platform, as a way to drive ad sales.  Shares of Yahoo  (NASDAQ:YHOO) fell initially after the report as you see there.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  Let's turn to David Garrity now for more discussion about  what's happening in the tech sector and what it may mean for you and your  money.  He's principle at GVA Research.</p><p>David, thank you for joining us.</p><p>So many people have some of these big tech names in their portfolio,  either in their IRA or perhaps in the mutual funds they have in their 401k.   But when we're talking about names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), is there  really growth in some of these big stocks over the long term, over the next  five, 10 years?</p><p>DAVID GARRITY, GVA RESEARCH:  Well, Sharon, certainly, looking at  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), we're in a situation here where the expectations for  smartphone growth over the next five years probably better than 15 percent  on a secular rate, and we're in a situation where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is  gaining share.  And as we know from the standpoint of the price points that  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products are being sold at, they occupy the top of the  market.  </p><p>And so, from that standpoint, we think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains  the dominant player in a high growth segment, if we look at the valuation  on the stock, whether we back the $200 billion in cash out or not, we're  still looking at a valuation which is below an overall market multiple.   And so, from that stand point, we think that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms  of what you're paying for its growth remains quite attractive, might have  been somewhat disappointing in the quarter that we didn't see the  announcement coming out with respect to the dividend.  But the company  certainly has the funds available to do that.  </p><p>On the product innovation side, we would say that, you know, the  iPhone 6 upgrade cycle still remains strong.  It might have been  disappointing in terms of the quarter, and there may some concerns about  the September quarter's guidance.  But we would say, overall, the  opportunity to buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on this pull back remains  attractive.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  As a long term bet, and that is two-thumbs up for Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL).  You can use both thumbs there, David.  </p><p>How about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)?  As a long term play, how does it  look to you?  </p><p>GARRITY:  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a little bit trickier because  certainly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a company which was successful in  earlier generations of technology, namely around PCs.  But if we look at  the shift over to mobile devices, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a far distant  third behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in terms of the  operating system software that's being provided.  </p><p>And, obviously, Microsoft's predicaments are somewhat underscored by  the fact that we're going to be giving away their Window's 10 operating  system software to consumers.  Something they wouldn't have done in the  past.  </p><p>Clearly, in the case of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a company that has  substantial resources both financial and technical, but nevertheless,  somewhat disconcerting to see a company go out and spend approximately $9  billion to buy a company, and then within approximately a year and a half  later, write off the full value of that, as well as also fire the  substantial number of employees related to that business.  </p><p>So, certainly, the hope here is under new CEO, Satya Nadella, the  company will find a better direction going more towards Cloud computing  that will help to reignite the growth for the company, Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), a name that we like, might not be so aggressive on a pull  back here as we might be with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>EPPERSON:  All right.  So, a like, not a love, on Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) from you, David.  </p><p>Thank you for joining us.  David Garrity with GVA Research.  </p><p>GARRITY:  Thank you, Sharon.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And Sharon was just mentioning how many mutual funds own  either Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>According to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), the top three mutual fund  holders of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), include the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, a lot  of people have that.  The Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, it's in a lot  of 401(k)s, and the Fidelity ContraFund.  </p><p>As for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, and the  Institutional Index Fund are two of the biggest holders as is the American  funds group, Washington Mutual Fund.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  Tyler, those weak after the bell results could extend  today's deep losses, disappointing results from a handful of Dow components  before the open weighed on the blue chip index.  </p><p>United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) fell 7 percent.  IBM, which we told  you about last night, was off nearly 6 percent.  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) dropped  more than 2 percent.  Travelers was one of the bright spots after it  reported results this morning, that dragged down the Dow, though, overall,  which fell 181 points to 17,9119.  The NASDAQ was off 10 points and the S&amp;P  500 fell 9 points.  </p><p>Dominic Chu has more on today's earnings.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The dive in the  Dow today was the result of a broader base selloff among 30 component  stocks, the vast majority of which finished the day lower, and the stock  that really drove much of the weakness was United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) - - the diversified industrial company behind brands like Pratt &amp; Whitney  Aircraft Engines and Carrier Air-conditioning Systems reported earnings  that beat Wall Street forecasts.  </p><p>Overall sales, however, fell shy of expectations.  The company said  that orders from China for its Otis elevators and escalators business fell.   As a result of that and other signs of softer customer demand, it cut its  full year forecast.  </p><p>Now, remember, the company also recently announced the sale of its  Sikorsky helicopter business to defense contractor Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT).  Another decliner on the day was Verizon (NYSE:VZ)  Communications, America's biggest telecom company by market value.  It  reported profits that beat Wall Street estimates, but it too reported sales  that missed.  While Verizon (NYSE:VZ) did manage to add more wireless phone  customers and boosted revenues for its FiOS high speed internet phone and  TV service, average sales generated per user fell, thanks to increased  competition and promotions.  That was one of the reasons it lowered  expectations for full year sales growth.  </p><p>One of the modest bright spots came by insurance giant travelers.  It  too reported profits that beat analyst estimates on sales that fell  slightly below forecast.  The company was aided by fewer losses tied to  catastrophes that the company insures against and settlement of a prior tax  issue.  Shares were among just a handful on the Dow that rose on the day.  </p><p>With less than a fifth of companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported  their quarterly results, a big focus will be on whether the rest of  corporate America can help drive earnings growth.  We're still very early  in earnings season.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Late today, Dow Jones reports that federal regulators are  close to approving AT&amp;T's $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV.  That would  clear the way for the biggest media deal of the past year.  The Justice  Department has already signed off on that deal.  </p><p>Now, Citigroup (NYSE:C) is being ordered to pay about $700 million to  customers for deceptive marketing and billing tactics.  The refund will go  to more than 8 1/2 million credit card customers.  The Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau says Citi's violations took place from 2003 to 2012, and  include misrepresenting the cost and benefits of certain add-on products  like identity theft monitoring and debt protection services.</p><p>EPPERSON:  Some big banks are setting aside more money to cover bad  loans to energy companies, after oil prices dropped over the past year.   According to \"Reuters\", which cited analysts reports, that raises the  possibility that deteriorating loans could start to hurt bank earnings.</p><p>Last week, executives from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) told investors that they are increasingly concerned about loans  to oil and gas companies.  Today, oil prices settled around $50 a barrel.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  One Wall Street strategist says the Federal Reserve had  never hiked rates when commodities had been in a pronounced downtrend.   He's Larry McDonald, head of U.S. Micro Strategy at Societe Generale.</p><p>Larry, welcome.  Good to have you with us.  </p><p>Is it as simple as history?  If it is, the CRB, which is the leading  commodities index, I think is down about a third over the past year, that  would say the Fed ain't going to do anything this year.  </p><p>LARRY MCDONALD, SOCIETE GENERALE:  That's the thing, Tyler.  I mean,  the CRB is right on the 2009 recession lows, and it's very close to the  2002 recession lows.  </p><p>So, the commodity index is right on recession levels, and you have to  remember, the United States in the '80s and '90s was about 55 percent to 60  percent of global GDP.  Today, we're 24, 25 percent.  </p><p>So, the Fed has to look at the global economy, much more so than he  did in years past.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  That's not the first thing, Larry, that the Fed will say  they're going to look at when it comes to what they're going to do with  interest rates.  How important do you think are commodity prices to their  next move, and when do you think they're going to make that move?  </p><p>MCDONALD:  Well, remember, they have a dual mandate, which was  established -- think about how long the dual mandate, they have to look at  unemployment and inflation.  And 10 years ago, Chinese GDP would say $2  trillion.  Now, we're up around $10 trillion or $11 trillion.  </p><p>The dual mandate around inflation, if China's slowing and that's  hurting commodity prices, that's going to leak over eventually to core  inflation, which is part of the Fed's dual mandate, which doesn't give them  a reason to hike.  On unemployment level does, but the inflation level, if  it's ticking down a notch, certainly doesn't.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Very interesting point.  Larry McDonald, haven't heard it  made.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>MCDONALD:  Thanks, Tyler.  Thanks, Sharon.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Larry McDonald of Societe Generale.</p><p>EPPERSON:  And still ahead, the big hope, big opportunity and big  risks associated with developing new Alzheimer's drugs.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Alzheimer's, it affects more than 5 million Americans  today.  It is the country's sixth most deadly disease.  And yet finding a  cure or a treatment that slows the progression of the ailment has proved  illusive.  </p><p>But now, as Meg Tirrell reports, there appears to be new hope.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The quest to  develop a drug that actually slows the course of Alzheimer's disease has  been a long one, marked by failure.  Since 1998, 123 drugs have failed in  development.  Just four were approved.  None slowed the declines in memory  loss and sinking clearly that characterized Alzheimer's.  </p><p>This year, though, new hope has bloomed.  </p><p>DR. MARIA CARRILLO:  The scientific community has really been given a  boost by some recent positive news of different drugs.  So, we are all very  hopeful at this time, more hopeful than we have been before.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Experimental medicines from Biogen and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)  are under the spotlight this week, with new data coming Wednesday at the  Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington, D.C.</p><p>They work to remove the plaque buildups in the brain known as beta  amyloid, thought to be toxic to neurons.  Evidence from early studies shows  that removing the plaques may help steam declines in cognition, results  that still need to be supported by larger studies.  </p><p>A successful drug could mean big business.  More than 5 million  Americans have Alzheimer's today, a number that could triple by 2050.  Some  analysts estimate the market for an Alzheimer's drug could be $20 billion a  year.  </p><p>CARRILLO:  This disease is urgent and we need answers now.  Baby  boomers cost us about 2 percent of Medicare overall spending today.  That  number will increase almost 25 percent by 2040 if we don't stop this  disease.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  The National Institutes of Health spent about $560 million  of its $30 billion budget on Alzheimer's disease last year, an amount some  say isn't enough to address the size of the problem.  It allocated more  than a billion and a half to heart disease, and $5 billion to cancer.  </p><p>FRED HASSAN, WARBURG PINCUS:  We need to have a war on Alzheimer's  mentality here, a sense of urgency.</p><p>TIRRELL:  Fred Hassan led pharmaceutical companies including Schering  Plough, which developed an Alzheimer's drug now owned by Merck (NYSE:MRK).   He calls the disease the biggest long term tsunami facing many countries</p><p>HASSAN:  It's a moral imperative because the patients can't speak for  themselves.  That's why we as a society need to speak for the patients here  and do more.  Half a billion is not much.  </p><p>TIRREL:  The results tomorrow could spur not just hope for medicine,  but big moves in drug maker stock prices as well.  </p><p>Cowen estimates Biogen shares could swing $50 in either direction,  representing as much as $10 billion in market value.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON:  Chipotle beats estimates but misses on one key metric.   That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The burrito chain said same store sales rose less than analysts were  expecting, still, it managed to top consensus on the top and bottom lines.   After the bell, shares were initially lower, but managed to turn around.   During the regular session, shares were off a fraction to $673.07.  </p><p>GoPro saw its revenues surge by more than 70 percent, helped by  growing demand for its action cameras overseas.  Earnings in revenue topped  the street's consensus.  Shares were volatile initially in after-hours  trading.  Before the close, though, the stock was 2 percent higher to  $62.04.</p><p>Novartis saw its shares after reporting a decline in profits.  This  was drug giant was hit by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar and weak  results from its eye care treatment business.  Yet, the CEO says he's  optimistic about the company's pipeline.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE JIMENEZ, NOVARTIS CEO:  When you look at our results, the best  part about the quarter was the innovation.  You know, we just got approval  to launch our new heart failure drug called Entresto.  This is a drug  that's proven to reduce cardiovascular death by 20 percent.  We think this  is going to be a multimillion dollar drug for the company.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EPPERSON:  Still, shares slipped more than 2 percent to $103.71.  </p><p>Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) swung to a loss in its most recent quarter.   The oil field services company saw revenue dropped more than 30 percent,  saying it expects tumbling oil prices will persist for the rest of the  year.  Still, sales weren't as weak as expected.  Shares rose about 2  percent to $60.64.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And an increase in trading activity helped TD Ameritrade  (NASDAQ:AMTD) post an increase in profit.  Revenue also coming in better  than expected.  Still, shares flipped on this down day by more than 1 1/2  percent.  They close at $37.73.  </p><p>Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) also reporting mixed quarterlies, the  strong greenback weighed on its international sales.  But the cycle maker  refused to keep pace with rivals' steep discounts.  Shares revved up a  little bit, about 5 percent to $57.67.  </p><p>LifeLock shares were halted at one point in today's session, after  the Federal Trade Commission charged the identity theft monitoring company,  saying it failed to protect its consumers' data.  The charges say the firm  is violating the terms of a previous settlement with the agency.  LifeLock  could disagree saying it's prepared to take the case to court.  </p><p>When shares continue trading they plunged, plunging almost 50 percent  lower on the day at $8.15.  </p><p>CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) won a key approval for its pending deal to buy  the parent company of One West Bank.  The Office of the Comptroller  Currency gave the OK.  The Federal Reserve now has to approve the  agreement, which was announced way back in last July.  Shares were more  than 2 percent higher, they finished at $48.18.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  Toshiba finds itself at the center of one of Japan's  biggest accounting scandals.  The CEO and other executives resigned after  taking responsibility for inflating profits by more than $1 billion over  several years.  At a press conference today, the executives were seen  vowing, a gesture meant to convey deep shame.  </p><p>The company will have to restate profits back to 2008 when the cover- up began.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Uber, the fast growing, ride hailing app start-up held a  jobs tour for drivers today in New York City.  The jobs tour comes as New  York tries to crackdown on the company's expansion.  The city council is  expected to vote on a bill that would cap Uber's growth while the city  studies its impact on traffic congestion.  Uber executives say the measure  threatens its business model in one of its largest markets.  </p><p>And Uber now valued at around $40 billion, is fast becoming a  political lightning rod.  Not just in New York, but also on the national  stage.  Republicans generally have embraced it as a symbol of disruptive  progress.  Democrats say it represents a new era of job insecurity, the  temping of America.  </p><p>John Harwood joins us from Washington.  </p><p>John, Uber's not only changing the business world, but also the  political world.  Why have so many politicians not just Mayor de Blasio  here in New York, latched on to it and made it the target of political  warfare?  </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  What do they  say about economics?  It's about creative destruction.  And when you have  creative destruction, some things get destroyed -- old models, old  incumbent firms, and in the case of Bill de Blasio in New York, yes, he is  raising the issue of traffic congestion, but the rise of Uber is also  threatening the incumbent taxi drivers who have relationships, financial  relationships with the city, with its politicians.  And so, that's not an  insignificant item.  </p><p>Secondly, Uber represents broader changes in the national economy,  that's what Hillary Clinton and some Democrats have pointed to, although  they are not -- to be fair to Democrats -- they are not saying Uber is bad  in and of itself.  They're saying it raises some problems and underscores  some problems in the economy that we have to deal with.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  What about the Republicans, what are they saying in terms  of how Uber or companies like that are changing the economy, changing the  way people are working today?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Well, Republicans are casting Uber as a symbol of the 21st  century economy, and say when Democrats raise questions about it, they're  looking backwards, they're representing the past.</p><p>For example, last week, Hillary Clinton gave a speech reflecting her  economic view in which she talked about the issue of classification, should  workers be described as contractors or as employees of firms like Uber?  </p><p>Well, as it happened, this is a big issue with Uber, many other firms  too.  FedEx (NYSE:FDX) just paid a big settlement on that issue as well.   And Jeb Bush attacked her for being stuck in the last century.  That's a  future past debate that Republicans think they're on the right side of.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  John Harwood, thanks very much -- John Harwood  reporting tonight from Washington.  </p><p>And coming up, one sector of the real estate market that has been  red-hot for investors.  We'll tell you what it is.  You may be surprised,  next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>EPPERSON:  Here's what to watch tomorrow: earnings from Dow  components American Express (NYSE:EXPR) (NYSE:AXP), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) and more.  Housing data, including existing home sales and  weekly mortgage applications.  And that's what to watch Wednesday.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  It's a little known sector of real estate investment, but  it is growing exponentially -- data centers that serve the Cloud.  Sounds  pretty dull, right?  Well, not if you look at the product potential  involved.  </p><p>Diana Olick has.  And she's got more on this red hot sector.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Most people  think the Cloud lives in the sky.  But it really lives here, in data  centers in downtown buildings and suburban warehouses.  As data booms, so  too does the value of all that real estate, and the REITs that own it.  </p><p>GARY WOJTASZEK, CYRUSONE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO:  Our focus is serving the  needs of the Fortune 1,000.  That comprises about 75 percent of our  business, including nine of the Fortune 20.  So, these are the largest  companies in the world that have chosen to store their computers in our  data centers.  </p><p>OLICK:  CyrusOne is one of five data center REITs which own two types  of property.  One is basically a big power station for servers like this  one in Sterling, Virginia.  The other is an Internet hub where the tenants  exchange data.  These are more valuable because they're generally located  in urban areas.  </p><p>WOJTASZEK:  We're structured as a real estate investment trust.  So,  we're predominantly just a real estate company, but we are a derivative of  what's going on in all the growth and technology space.  So, everything you  hear about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Rackspace and  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and all those new technologies that are going on,  ultimately reside in the data center.  </p><p>OLICK:  Data center REIT returns have been robust to say the least.   CyrusOne, Coresite, Digital Realty, Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), and QTS, in  particular, up 46 percent in the past year.  </p><p>They can, however, be a tough sell because they are at the crossroads  of real estate and technology, which investors value differently.  </p><p>JOHN BEJJANI, GREEN STREET ADVISORS:  Because data centers are  subject to all this technology risk, potential technology risk, because  there's so much more to understanding the sector than simply knowing where  the real estate is located, some investors opt not to take on the brain  damage of understanding these various risks.  </p><p>OLICK:  And then there's demand.  Technology changes moment to  moment, and forecasting that change in terms of real estate, for both  tenants and landlords is tricky.  Developers want to capture this demand  immediately.  But too much speculation could lead to too much supply.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON:  That's a really nice investment.  Interesting investment  to think about when you want that debate, but you're afraid of the risks  coming to the technology sector.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And the capital returns were huge as Diana just showed out  over the past year.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  Absolutely.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Quite amazing.</p><p>EPPERSON:  Really good. </p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sharon Epperson.   Thanks for watching.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a  great evening, everybody.

Dow  components Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fall sharply  after reporting late-day profits, potentially extending today's deep  selloff in stocks.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  New hope and a new  generation of potential drugs that can treat a growing disease with no cure  -- Alzheimer's.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  MATHISEN:  And not so fast.  The one thing that could prevent the  Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.  </p><p>  All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, July  21st.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Sharon Epperson, in tonight  for Sue Herera.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Welcome, everybody.  </p><p>  Sharon, it was a blue chip wreck on Wall Street today.  More on that  in a moment.</p><p>  But we begin tonight with earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), two bellwether companies of the new economy, and  two dominant players in the tech sector, of course.  The tech sector makes  up 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500, by the way.</p><p>  And, tonight, both companies, which you likely own through your mutual  funds and 401(k)s, well, they failed to wow investors.  </p><p>  First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  The world's most valuable company  reported earnings of $1.85 a share.  That was 4 cents better than the  consensus forecast.  Revenue was also slightly better at $49.6 billion.</p><p>  So, what's the problem?  Well, despite selling more than 47 million  iPhones in the quarter, yes, you heard me right, it was the company's weak  outlook that sent shares initially lower.  A lot lower after that report.  </p><p>  Josh Lipton has the key takeaway from Apple's results.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big number in  Apple's latest earnings report, 47.5 million.  That is the number of  iPhones Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it shipped in the quarter.  Now, that was  up 35 percent year over year, but was also basically in line with what Wall  Street expected.  Analysts had forecasted that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would  ship some 47.3 million iPhones.</p><p>  In a conversation with Apple's CEO Tim Cook, he told me that only 27  percent of the company's install base had moved those newer 6 and 6-Plus  models.  That suggests plenty of upgrade headroom ahead.  But at least in  the after-hours, investors seem to be focused on that in-line number.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in Cupertino, California.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Now to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which reported better than  expected earnings in revenue, but took a hit from restructuring charges and  soft demand from some of its products.  The world's largest software  company reported earnings of 62 cents a share, 6 cents better than  estimates.  The company reported revenue that was slightly more than $22  billion. </p><p>  But investors wanted more, sending shares initially lower after the  report.  </p><p>  Kayla Tausche digs deeper into the results.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From the face  of it, Microsoft's fiscal fourth quarter looks like a beat all around, the  problem was, that the company's quarter was marred by a massive write-down  of its Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition that happened just a few years ago.  It  was forecast to be a $7.6 billion write-down.  It came in $8.4 billion.  </p><p>  When you peel away what the revenue story told us, it did look a  little weaker, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling prey again to a stronger  dollar, and some currency head winds, especially in its overseas business,  namely for Japan.  </p><p>  When you look at its licensing, there was an expectation that as P.C.  shipments declined, that installs of Windows and Office would decline as  well.  They declined more than the PC shipments fell by.  That's leading  people to wonder what exactly is going on there.</p><p>  Kayla Tausche, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) missed second quarter earnings  estimates, those sales narrowly beat those forecasts.  The Internet media  company's results were way down by higher spending to attract users to its  Web sites in order to better compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and others.  Part of Yahoo's strategy has been to invest for  its mobile platform, as a way to drive ad sales.  Shares of Yahoo  (NASDAQ:YHOO) fell initially after the report as you see there.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Let's turn to David Garrity now for more discussion about  what's happening in the tech sector and what it may mean for you and your  money.  He's principle at GVA Research.</p><p>  David, thank you for joining us.</p><p>  So many people have some of these big tech names in their portfolio,  either in their IRA or perhaps in the mutual funds they have in their 401k.   But when we're talking about names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), is there  really growth in some of these big stocks over the long term, over the next  five, 10 years?</p><p>  DAVID GARRITY, GVA RESEARCH:  Well, Sharon, certainly, looking at  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), we're in a situation here where the expectations for  smartphone growth over the next five years probably better than 15 percent  on a secular rate, and we're in a situation where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is  gaining share.  And as we know from the standpoint of the price points that  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products are being sold at, they occupy the top of the  market.  </p><p>  And so, from that standpoint, we think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains the  dominant player in a high growth segment, if we look at the valuation on  the stock, whether we back the $200 billion in cash out or not, we're still  looking at a valuation which is below an overall market multiple.  And so,  from that stand point, we think that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of what  you're paying for its growth remains quite attractive, might have been  somewhat disappointing in the quarter that we didn't see the announcement  coming out with respect to the dividend.  But the company certainly has the  funds available to do that.  </p><p>  On the product innovation side, we would say that, you know, the  iPhone 6 upgrade cycle still remains strong.  It might have been  disappointing in terms of the quarter, and there may some concerns about  the September quarter's guidance.  But we would say, overall, the  opportunity to buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on this pull back remains  attractive.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  As a long term bet, and that is two-thumbs up for Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL).  You can use both thumbs there, David.  </p><p>  How about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)?  As a long term play, how does it  look to you?  </p><p>  GARRITY:  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a little bit trickier because  certainly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a company which was successful in  earlier generations of technology, namely around PCs.  But if we look at  the shift over to mobile devices, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a far distant  third behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in terms of the  operating system software that's being provided.  </p><p>  And, obviously, Microsoft's predicaments are somewhat underscored by  the fact that we're going to be giving away their Window's 10 operating  system software to consumers.  Something they wouldn't have done in the  past.  </p><p>  Clearly, in the case of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a company that has  substantial resources both financial and technical, but nevertheless,  somewhat disconcerting to see a company go out and spend approximately $9  billion to buy a company, and then within approximately a year and a half  later, write off the full value of that, as well as also fire the  substantial number of employees related to that business.  </p><p>  So, certainly, the hope here is under new CEO, Satya Nadella, the  company will find a better direction going more towards Cloud computing  that will help to reignite the growth for the company, Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), a name that we like, might not be so aggressive on a pull  back here as we might be with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  All right.  So, a like, not a love, on Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) from you, David.  </p><p>  Thank you for joining us.  David Garrity with GVA Research.  </p><p>  GARRITY:  Thank you, Sharon.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  And Sharon was just mentioning how many mutual funds own  either Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>  According to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), the top three mutual fund  holders of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), include the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, a lot  of people have that.  The Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, it's in a lot  of 401(k)s, and the Fidelity ContraFund.  </p><p>  As for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, and the  Institutional Index Fund are two of the biggest holders as is the American  funds group, Washington Mutual Fund.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Tyler, those weak after the bell results could extend  today's deep losses, disappointing results from a handful of Dow components  before the open weighed on the blue chip index.  </p><p>  United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) fell 7 percent.  IBM, which we told you  about last night, was off nearly 6 percent.  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) dropped more  than 2 percent.  Travelers was one of the bright spots after it reported  results this morning, that dragged down the Dow, though, overall, which  fell 181 points to 17,9119.  The NASDAQ was off 10 points and the S&amp;P 500  fell 9 points.  </p><p>  Dominic Chu has more on today's earnings.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The dive in the  Dow today was the result of a broader base selloff among 30 component  stocks, the vast majority of which finished the day lower, and the stock  that really drove much of the weakness was United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) - - the diversified industrial company behind brands like Pratt &amp; Whitney  Aircraft Engines and Carrier Air-conditioning Systems reported earnings  that beat Wall Street forecasts.  </p><p>  Overall sales, however, fell shy of expectations.  The company said  that orders from China for its Otis elevators and escalators business fell.   As a result of that and other signs of softer customer demand, it cut its  full year forecast.  </p><p>  Now, remember, the company also recently announced the sale of its  Sikorsky helicopter business to defense contractor Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT).  Another decliner on the day was Verizon (NYSE:VZ)  Communications, America's biggest telecom company by market value.  It  reported profits that beat Wall Street estimates, but it too reported sales  that missed.  While Verizon (NYSE:VZ) did manage to add more wireless phone  customers and boosted revenues for its FiOS high speed internet phone and  TV service, average sales generated per user fell, thanks to increased  competition and promotions.  That was one of the reasons it lowered  expectations for full year sales growth.  </p><p>  One of the modest bright spots came by insurance giant travelers.  It  too reported profits that beat analyst estimates on sales that fell  slightly below forecast.  The company was aided by fewer losses tied to  catastrophes that the company insures against and settlement of a prior tax  issue.  Shares were among just a handful on the Dow that rose on the day.  </p><p>  With less than a fifth of companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported  their quarterly results, a big focus will be on whether the rest of  corporate America can help drive earnings growth.  We're still very early  in earnings season.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Late today, Dow Jones reports that federal regulators are  close to approving AT&amp;T's $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV.  That would  clear the way for the biggest media deal of the past year.  The Justice  Department has already signed off on that deal.  </p><p>  Now, Citigroup (NYSE:C) is being ordered to pay about $700 million to  customers for deceptive marketing and billing tactics.  The refund will go  to more than 8 1/2 million credit card customers.  The Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau says Citi's violations took place from 2003 to 2012, and  include misrepresenting the cost and benefits of certain add-on products  like identity theft monitoring and debt protection services.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Some big banks are setting aside more money to cover bad  loans to energy companies, after oil prices dropped over the past year.   According to \"Reuters\", which cited analysts reports, that raises the  possibility that deteriorating loans could start to hurt bank earnings.</p><p>  Last week, executives from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) told investors that they are increasingly concerned about loans  to oil and gas companies.  Today, oil prices settled around $50 a barrel.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  One Wall Street strategist says the Federal Reserve had  never hiked rates when commodities had been in a pronounced downtrend.   He's Larry McDonald, head of U.S. Micro Strategy at Societe Generale.</p><p>  Larry, welcome.  Good to have you with us.  </p><p>  Is it as simple as history?  If it is, the CRB, which is the leading  commodities index, I think is down about a third over the past year, that  would say the Fed ain't going to do anything this year.  </p><p>  LARRY MCDONALD, SOCIETE GENERALE:  That's the thing, Tyler.  I mean,  the CRB is right on the 2009 recession lows, and it's very close to the  2002 recession lows.  </p><p>  So, the commodity index is right on recession levels, and you have to  remember, the United States in the '80s and '90s was about 55 percent to 60  percent of global GDP.  Today, we're 24, 25 percent.  </p><p>  So, the Fed has to look at the global economy, much more so than he  did in years past.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  That's not the first thing, Larry, that the Fed will say  they're going to look at when it comes to what they're going to do with  interest rates.  How important do you think are commodity prices to their  next move, and when do you think they're going to make that move?  </p><p>  MCDONALD:  Well, remember, they have a dual mandate, which was  established -- think about how long the dual mandate, they have to look at  unemployment and inflation.  And 10 years ago, Chinese GDP would say $2  trillion.  Now, we're up around $10 trillion or $11 trillion.  </p><p>  The dual mandate around inflation, if China's slowing and that's  hurting commodity prices, that's going to leak over eventually to core  inflation, which is part of the Fed's dual mandate, which doesn't give them  a reason to hike.  On unemployment level does, but the inflation level, if  it's ticking down a notch, certainly doesn't.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Very interesting point.  Larry McDonald, haven't heard it  made.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>  MCDONALD:  Thanks, Tyler.  Thanks, Sharon.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Larry McDonald of Societe Generale.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  And still ahead, the big hope, big opportunity and big  risks associated with developing new Alzheimer's drugs.</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Alzheimer's, it affects more than 5 million Americans  today.  It is the country's sixth most deadly disease.  And yet finding a  cure or a treatment that slows the progression of the ailment has proved  illusive.  </p><p>  But now, as Meg Tirrell reports, there appears to be new hope.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MEG TIRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The quest to  develop a drug that actually slows the course of Alzheimer's disease has  been a long one, marked by failure.  Since 1998, 123 drugs have failed in  development.  Just four were approved.  None slowed the declines in memory  loss and sinking clearly that characterized Alzheimer's.  </p><p>  This year, though, new hope has bloomed.  </p><p>  DR. MARIA CARRILLO:  The scientific community has really been given a  boost by some recent positive news of different drugs.  So, we are all very  hopeful at this time, more hopeful than we have been before.  </p><p>  TIRRELL:  Experimental medicines from Biogen and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)  are under the spotlight this week, with new data coming Wednesday at the  Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington, D.C.</p><p>  They work to remove the plaque buildups in the brain known as beta  amyloid, thought to be toxic to neurons.  Evidence from early studies shows  that removing the plaques may help steam declines in cognition, results  that still need to be supported by larger studies.  </p><p>  A successful drug could mean big business.  More than 5 million  Americans have Alzheimer's today, a number that could triple by 2050.  Some  analysts estimate the market for an Alzheimer's drug could be $20 billion a  year.  </p><p>  CARRILLO:  This disease is urgent and we need answers now.  Baby  boomers cost us about 2 percent of Medicare overall spending today.  That  number will increase almost 25 percent by 2040 if we don't stop this  disease.  </p><p>  TIRRELL:  The National Institutes of Health spent about $560 million  of its $30 billion budget on Alzheimer's disease last year, an amount some  say isn't enough to address the size of the problem.  It allocated more  than a billion and a half to heart disease, and $5 billion to cancer.  </p><p>  FRED HASSAN, WARBURG PINCUS:  We need to have a war on Alzheimer's  mentality here, a sense of urgency.</p><p>  TIRRELL:  Fred Hassan led pharmaceutical companies including Schering  Plough, which developed an Alzheimer's drug now owned by Merck (NYSE:MRK).   He calls the disease the biggest long term tsunami facing many countries</p><p>  HASSAN:  It's a moral imperative because the patients can't speak for  themselves.  That's why we as a society need to speak for the patients here  and do more.  Half a billion is not much.  </p><p>  TIRREL:  The results tomorrow could spur not just hope for medicine,  but big moves in drug maker stock prices as well.  </p><p>  Cowen estimates Biogen shares could swing $50 in either direction,  representing as much as $10 billion in market value.</p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Chipotle beats estimates but misses on one key metric.   That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>  The burrito chain said same store sales rose less than analysts were  expecting, still, it managed to top consensus on the top and bottom lines.   After the bell, shares were initially lower, but managed to turn around.   During the regular session, shares were off a fraction to $673.07.  </p><p>  GoPro saw its revenues surge by more than 70 percent, helped by  growing demand for its action cameras overseas.  Earnings in revenue topped  the street's consensus.  Shares were volatile initially in after-hours  trading.  Before the close, though, the stock was 2 percent higher to  $62.04.</p><p>  Novartis saw its shares after reporting a decline in profits.  This  was drug giant was hit by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar and weak  results from its eye care treatment business.  Yet, the CEO says he's  optimistic about the company's pipeline.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  JOE JIMENEZ, NOVARTIS CEO:  When you look at our results, the best  part about the quarter was the innovation.  You know, we just got approval  to launch our new heart failure drug called Entresto.  This is a drug  that's proven to reduce cardiovascular death by 20 percent.  We think this  is going to be a multimillion dollar drug for the company.  </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Still, shares slipped more than 2 percent to $103.71.  </p><p>  Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) swung to a loss in its most recent quarter.   The oil field services company saw revenue dropped more than 30 percent,  saying it expects tumbling oil prices will persist for the rest of the  year.  Still, sales weren't as weak as expected.  Shares rose about 2  percent to $60.64.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  And an increase in trading activity helped TD Ameritrade  (NASDAQ:AMTD) post an increase in profit.  Revenue also coming in better  than expected.  Still, shares flipped on this down day by more than 1 1/2  percent.  They close at $37.73.  </p><p>  Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) also reporting mixed quarterlies, the  strong greenback weighed on its international sales.  But the cycle maker  refused to keep pace with rivals' steep discounts.  Shares revved up a  little bit, about 5 percent to $57.67.  </p><p>  LifeLock shares were halted at one point in today's session, after the  Federal Trade Commission charged the identity theft monitoring company,  saying it failed to protect its consumers' data.  The charges say the firm  is violating the terms of a previous settlement with the agency.  LifeLock  could disagree saying it's prepared to take the case to court.  </p><p>  When shares continue trading they plunged, plunging almost 50 percent  lower on the day at $8.15.  </p><p>  CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) won a key approval for its pending deal to buy  the parent company of One West Bank.  The Office of the Comptroller  Currency gave the OK.  The Federal Reserve now has to approve the  agreement, which was announced way back in last July.  Shares were more  than 2 percent higher, they finished at $48.18.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Toshiba finds itself at the center of one of Japan's  biggest accounting scandals.  The CEO and other executives resigned after  taking responsibility for inflating profits by more than $1 billion over  several years.  At a press conference today, the executives were seen  vowing, a gesture meant to convey deep shame.  </p><p>  The company will have to restate profits back to 2008 when the cover- up began.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Uber, the fast growing, ride hailing app start-up held a  jobs tour for drivers today in New York City.  The jobs tour comes as New  York tries to crackdown on the company's expansion.  The city council is  expected to vote on a bill that would cap Uber's growth while the city  studies its impact on traffic congestion.  Uber executives say the measure  threatens its business model in one of its largest markets.  </p><p>  And Uber now valued at around $40 billion, is fast becoming a  political lightning rod.  Not just in New York, but also on the national  stage.  Republicans generally have embraced it as a symbol of disruptive  progress.  Democrats say it represents a new era of job insecurity, the  temping of America.  </p><p>  John Harwood joins us from Washington.  </p><p>  John, Uber's not only changing the business world, but also the  political world.  Why have so many politicians not just Mayor de Blasio  here in New York, latched on to it and made it the target of political  warfare?  </p><p>  JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  What do they say  about economics?  It's about creative destruction.  And when you have  creative destruction, some things get destroyed -- old models, old  incumbent firms, and in the case of Bill de Blasio in New York, yes, he is  raising the issue of traffic congestion, but the rise of Uber is also  threatening the incumbent taxi drivers who have relationships, financial  relationships with the city, with its politicians.  And so, that's not an  insignificant item.  </p><p>  Secondly, Uber represents broader changes in the national economy,  that's what Hillary Clinton and some Democrats have pointed to, although  they are not -- to be fair to Democrats -- they are not saying Uber is bad  in and of itself.  They're saying it raises some problems and underscores  some problems in the economy that we have to deal with.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  What about the Republicans, what are they saying in terms  of how Uber or companies like that are changing the economy, changing the  way people are working today?  </p><p>  HARWOOD:  Well, Republicans are casting Uber as a symbol of the 21st  century economy, and say when Democrats raise questions about it, they're  looking backwards, they're representing the past.</p><p>  For example, last week, Hillary Clinton gave a speech reflecting her  economic view in which she talked about the issue of classification, should  workers be described as contractors or as employees of firms like Uber?  </p><p>  Well, as it happened, this is a big issue with Uber, many other firms  too.  FedEx (NYSE:FDX) just paid a big settlement on that issue as well.   And Jeb Bush attacked her for being stuck in the last century.  That's a  future past debate that Republicans think they're on the right side of.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  John Harwood, thanks very much -- John Harwood  reporting tonight from Washington.  </p><p>  And coming up, one sector of the real estate market that has been red- hot for investors.  We'll tell you what it is.  You may be surprised, next.</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Here's what to watch tomorrow: earnings from Dow components  American Express (NYSE:EXPR) (NYSE:AXP), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Coca-Cola  (NYSE:KO) and more.  Housing data, including existing home sales and weekly  mortgage applications.  And that's what to watch Wednesday.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  It's a little known sector of real estate investment, but  it is growing exponentially -- data centers that serve the Cloud.  Sounds  pretty dull, right?  Well, not if you look at the product potential  involved.  </p><p>  Diana Olick has.  And she's got more on this red hot sector.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Most people think  the Cloud lives in the sky.  But it really lives here, in data centers in  downtown buildings and suburban warehouses.  As data booms, so too does the  value of all that real estate, and the REITs that own it.  </p><p>  GARY WOJTASZEK, CYRUSONE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO:  Our focus is serving the  needs of the Fortune 1,000.  That comprises about 75 percent of our  business, including nine of the Fortune 20.  So, these are the largest  companies in the world that have chosen to store their computers in our  data centers.  </p><p>  OLICK:  CyrusOne is one of five data center REITs which own two types  of property.  One is basically a big power station for servers like this  one in Sterling, Virginia.  The other is an Internet hub where the tenants  exchange data.  These are more valuable because they're generally located  in urban areas.  </p><p>  WOJTASZEK:  We're structured as a real estate investment trust.  So,  we're predominantly just a real estate company, but we are a derivative of  what's going on in all the growth and technology space.  So, everything you  hear about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Rackspace and  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and all those new technologies that are going on,  ultimately reside in the data center.  </p><p>  OLICK:  Data center REIT returns have been robust to say the least.   CyrusOne, Coresite, Digital Realty, Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), and QTS, in  particular, up 46 percent in the past year.  </p><p>  They can, however, be a tough sell because they are at the crossroads  of real estate and technology, which investors value differently.  </p><p>  JOHN BEJJANI, GREEN STREET ADVISORS:  Because data centers are subject  to all this technology risk, potential technology risk, because there's so  much more to understanding the sector than simply knowing where the real  estate is located, some investors opt not to take on the brain damage of  understanding these various risks.  </p><p>  OLICK:  And then there's demand.  Technology changes moment to moment,  and forecasting that change in terms of real estate, for both tenants and  landlords is tricky.  Developers want to capture this demand immediately.   But too much speculation could lead to too much supply.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  EPPERSON:  That's a really nice investment.  Interesting investment to  think about when you want that debate, but you're afraid of the risks  coming to the technology sector.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  And the capital returns were huge as Diana just showed out  over the past year.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Absolutely.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Quite amazing.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Really good. </p><p>  That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sharon Epperson.   Thanks for watching.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a  great evening, everybody.  Hope you'll join us here tomorrow night.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Dow components Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fall sharply after reporting late-day profits, potentially extending today's deep selloff in stocks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: New hope and a new generation of potential drugs that can treat a growing disease with no cure -- Alzheimer's.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: And not so fast. The one thing that could prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, July 21st.</p><p>EPPERSON: Good evening, everyone. I'm Sharon Epperson, in tonight for Sue Herera.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Welcome, everybody.</p><p>Sharon, it was a blue chip wreck on Wall Street today. More on that in a moment.</p><p>But we begin tonight with earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), two bellwether companies of the new economy, and two dominant players in the tech sector, of course. The tech sector makes up 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500, by the way.</p><p>And, tonight, both companies, which you likely own through your mutual funds and 401(k)s, well, they failed to wow investors.</p><p>First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The world's most valuable company reported earnings of $1.85 a share. That was 4 cents better than the consensus forecast. Revenue was also slightly better at $49.6 billion.</p><p>So, what's the problem? Well, despite selling more than 47 million iPhones in the quarter, yes, you heard me right, it was the company's weak outlook that sent shares initially lower. A lot lower after that report.</p><p>Josh Lipton has the key takeaway from Apple's results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big number in Apple's latest earnings report, 47.5 million. That is the number of iPhones Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it shipped in the quarter. Now, that was up 35 percent year over year, but was also basically in line with what Wall Street expected. Analysts had forecasted that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would ship some 47.3 million iPhones.</p><p>In a conversation with Apple's CEO Tim Cook, he told me that only 27 percent of the company's install base had moved those newer 6 and 6-Plus models. That suggests plenty of upgrade headroom ahead. But at least in the after-hours, investors seem to be focused on that in-line number.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in Cupertino, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: Now to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which reported better than expected earnings in revenue, but took a hit from restructuring charges and soft demand from some of its products. The world's largest software company reported earnings of 62 cents a share, 6 cents better than estimates. The company reported revenue that was slightly more than $22 billion.</p><p>But investors wanted more, sending shares initially lower after the report.</p><p>Kayla Tausche digs deeper into the results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: From the face of it, Microsoft's fiscal fourth quarter looks like a beat all around, the problem was, that the company's quarter was marred by a massive write-down of its Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition that happened just a few years ago. It was forecast to be a $7.6 billion write-down. It came in $8.4 billion.</p><p>When you peel away what the revenue story told us, it did look a little weaker, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling prey again to a stronger dollar, and some currency head winds, especially in its overseas business, namely for Japan.</p><p>When you look at its licensing, there was an expectation that as P.C. shipments declined, that installs of Windows and Office would decline as well. They declined more than the PC shipments fell by. That's leading people to wonder what exactly is going on there.</p><p>Kayla Tausche, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) missed second quarter earnings estimates, those sales narrowly beat those forecasts. The Internet media company's results were way down by higher spending to attract users to its Web sites in order to better compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and others. Part of Yahoo's strategy has been to invest for its mobile platform, as a way to drive ad sales. Shares of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) fell initially after the report as you see there.</p><p>EPPERSON: Let's turn to David Garrity now for more discussion about what's happening in the tech sector and what it may mean for you and your money. He's principle at GVA Research.</p><p>David, thank you for joining us.</p><p>So many people have some of these big tech names in their portfolio, either in their IRA or perhaps in the mutual funds they have in their 401k. But when we're talking about names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), is there really growth in some of these big stocks over the long term, over the next five, 10 years?</p><p>DAVID GARRITY, GVA RESEARCH: Well, Sharon, certainly, looking at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), we're in a situation here where the expectations for smartphone growth over the next five years probably better than 15 percent on a secular rate, and we're in a situation where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is gaining share. And as we know from the standpoint of the price points that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products are being sold at, they occupy the top of the market.</p><p>And so, from that standpoint, we think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains the dominant player in a high growth segment, if we look at the valuation on the stock, whether we back the $200 billion in cash out or not, we're still looking at a valuation which is below an overall market multiple. And so, from that stand point, we think that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of what you're paying for its growth remains quite attractive, might have been somewhat disappointing in the quarter that we didn't see the announcement coming out with respect to the dividend. But the company certainly has the funds available to do that.</p><p>On the product innovation side, we would say that, you know, the iPhone 6 upgrade cycle still remains strong. It might have been disappointing in terms of the quarter, and there may some concerns about the September quarter's guidance. But we would say, overall, the opportunity to buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on this pull back remains attractive.</p><p>MATHISEN: As a long term bet, and that is two-thumbs up for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). You can use both thumbs there, David.</p><p>How about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)? As a long term play, how does it look to you?</p><p>GARRITY: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a little bit trickier because certainly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a company which was successful in earlier generations of technology, namely around PCs. But if we look at the shift over to mobile devices, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a far distant third behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in terms of the operating system software that's being provided.</p><p>And, obviously, Microsoft's predicaments are somewhat underscored by the fact that we're going to be giving away their Window's 10 operating system software to consumers. Something they wouldn't have done in the past.</p><p>Clearly, in the case of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a company that has substantial resources both financial and technical, but nevertheless, somewhat disconcerting to see a company go out and spend approximately $9 billion to buy a company, and then within approximately a year and a half later, write off the full value of that, as well as also fire the substantial number of employees related to that business.</p><p>So, certainly, the hope here is under new CEO, Satya Nadella, the company will find a better direction going more towards Cloud computing that will help to reignite the growth for the company, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a name that we like, might not be so aggressive on a pull back here as we might be with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>EPPERSON: All right. So, a like, not a love, on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from you, David.</p><p>Thank you for joining us. David Garrity with GVA Research.</p><p>GARRITY: Thank you, Sharon.</p><p>MATHISEN: And Sharon was just mentioning how many mutual funds own either Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>According to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), the top three mutual fund holders of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), include the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, a lot of people have that. The Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, it's in a lot of 401(k)s, and the Fidelity ContraFund.</p><p>As for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, and the Institutional Index Fund are two of the biggest holders as is the American funds group, Washington Mutual Fund.</p><p>EPPERSON: Tyler, those weak after the bell results could extend today's deep losses, disappointing results from a handful of Dow components before the open weighed on the blue chip index.</p><p>United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) fell 7 percent. IBM, which we told you about last night, was off nearly 6 percent. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) dropped more than 2 percent. Travelers was one of the bright spots after it reported results this morning, that dragged down the Dow, though, overall, which fell 181 points to 17,9119. The NASDAQ was off 10 points and the S&amp;P 500 fell 9 points.</p><p>Dominic Chu has more on today's earnings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The dive in the Dow today was the result of a broader base selloff among 30 component stocks, the vast majority of which finished the day lower, and the stock that really drove much of the weakness was United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) - - the diversified industrial company behind brands like Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Engines and Carrier Air-conditioning Systems reported earnings that beat Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>Overall sales, however, fell shy of expectations. The company said that orders from China for its Otis elevators and escalators business fell. As a result of that and other signs of softer customer demand, it cut its full year forecast.</p><p>Now, remember, the company also recently announced the sale of its Sikorsky helicopter business to defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). Another decliner on the day was Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Communications, America's biggest telecom company by market value. It reported profits that beat Wall Street estimates, but it too reported sales that missed. While Verizon (NYSE:VZ) did manage to add more wireless phone customers and boosted revenues for its FiOS high speed internet phone and TV service, average sales generated per user fell, thanks to increased competition and promotions. That was one of the reasons it lowered expectations for full year sales growth.</p><p>One of the modest bright spots came by insurance giant travelers. It too reported profits that beat analyst estimates on sales that fell slightly below forecast. The company was aided by fewer losses tied to catastrophes that the company insures against and settlement of a prior tax issue. Shares were among just a handful on the Dow that rose on the day.</p><p>With less than a fifth of companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported their quarterly results, a big focus will be on whether the rest of corporate America can help drive earnings growth. We're still very early in earnings season.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Late today, Dow Jones reports that federal regulators are close to approving AT&amp;T's $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV. That would clear the way for the biggest media deal of the past year. The Justice Department has already signed off on that deal.</p><p>Now, Citigroup (NYSE:C) is being ordered to pay about $700 million to customers for deceptive marketing and billing tactics. The refund will go to more than 8 1/2 million credit card customers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says Citi's violations took place from 2003 to 2012, and include misrepresenting the cost and benefits of certain add-on products like identity theft monitoring and debt protection services.</p><p>EPPERSON: Some big banks are setting aside more money to cover bad loans to energy companies, after oil prices dropped over the past year. According to \"Reuters\", which cited analysts reports, that raises the possibility that deteriorating loans could start to hurt bank earnings.</p><p>Last week, executives from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) told investors that they are increasingly concerned about loans to oil and gas companies. Today, oil prices settled around $50 a barrel.</p><p>MATHISEN: One Wall Street strategist says the Federal Reserve had never hiked rates when commodities had been in a pronounced downtrend. He's Larry McDonald, head of U.S. Micro Strategy at Societe Generale.</p><p>Larry, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>Is it as simple as history? If it is, the CRB, which is the leading commodities index, I think is down about a third over the past year, that would say the Fed ain't going to do anything this year.</p><p>LARRY MCDONALD, SOCIETE GENERALE: That's the thing, Tyler. I mean, the CRB is right on the 2009 recession lows, and it's very close to the 2002 recession lows.</p><p>So, the commodity index is right on recession levels, and you have to remember, the United States in the '80s and '90s was about 55 percent to 60 percent of global GDP. Today, we're 24, 25 percent.</p><p>So, the Fed has to look at the global economy, much more so than he did in years past.</p><p>EPPERSON: That's not the first thing, Larry, that the Fed will say they're going to look at when it comes to what they're going to do with interest rates. How important do you think are commodity prices to their next move, and when do you think they're going to make that move?</p><p>MCDONALD: Well, remember, they have a dual mandate, which was established -- think about how long the dual mandate, they have to look at unemployment and inflation. And 10 years ago, Chinese GDP would say $2 trillion. Now, we're up around $10 trillion or $11 trillion.</p><p>The dual mandate around inflation, if China's slowing and that's hurting commodity prices, that's going to leak over eventually to core inflation, which is part of the Fed's dual mandate, which doesn't give them a reason to hike. On unemployment level does, but the inflation level, if it's ticking down a notch, certainly doesn't.</p><p>MATHISEN: Very interesting point. Larry McDonald, haven't heard it made. We appreciate it.</p><p>MCDONALD: Thanks, Tyler. Thanks, Sharon.</p><p>MATHISEN: Larry McDonald of Societe Generale.</p><p>EPPERSON: And still ahead, the big hope, big opportunity and big risks associated with developing new Alzheimer's drugs.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Alzheimer's, it affects more than 5 million Americans today. It is the country's sixth most deadly disease. And yet finding a cure or a treatment that slows the progression of the ailment has proved illusive.</p><p>But now, as Meg Tirrell reports, there appears to be new hope.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The quest to develop a drug that actually slows the course of Alzheimer's disease has been a long one, marked by failure. Since 1998, 123 drugs have failed in development. Just four were approved. None slowed the declines in memory loss and sinking clearly that characterized Alzheimer's.</p><p>This year, though, new hope has bloomed.</p><p>DR. MARIA CARRILLO: The scientific community has really been given a boost by some recent positive news of different drugs. So, we are all very hopeful at this time, more hopeful than we have been before.</p><p>TIRRELL: Experimental medicines from Biogen and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) are under the spotlight this week, with new data coming Wednesday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington, D.C.</p><p>They work to remove the plaque buildups in the brain known as beta amyloid, thought to be toxic to neurons. Evidence from early studies shows that removing the plaques may help steam declines in cognition, results that still need to be supported by larger studies.</p><p>A successful drug could mean big business. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's today, a number that could triple by 2050. Some analysts estimate the market for an Alzheimer's drug could be $20 billion a year.</p><p>CARRILLO: This disease is urgent and we need answers now. Baby boomers cost us about 2 percent of Medicare overall spending today. That number will increase almost 25 percent by 2040 if we don't stop this disease.</p><p>TIRRELL: The National Institutes of Health spent about $560 million of its $30 billion budget on Alzheimer's disease last year, an amount some say isn't enough to address the size of the problem. It allocated more than a billion and a half to heart disease, and $5 billion to cancer.</p><p>FRED HASSAN, WARBURG PINCUS: We need to have a war on Alzheimer's mentality here, a sense of urgency.</p><p>TIRRELL: Fred Hassan led pharmaceutical companies including Schering Plough, which developed an Alzheimer's drug now owned by Merck (NYSE:MRK). He calls the disease the biggest long term tsunami facing many countries</p><p>HASSAN: It's a moral imperative because the patients can't speak for themselves. That's why we as a society need to speak for the patients here and do more. Half a billion is not much.</p><p>TIRREL: The results tomorrow could spur not just hope for medicine, but big moves in drug maker stock prices as well.</p><p>Cowen estimates Biogen shares could swing $50 in either direction, representing as much as $10 billion in market value.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: Chipotle beats estimates but misses on one key metric. That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The burrito chain said same store sales rose less than analysts were expecting, still, it managed to top consensus on the top and bottom lines. After the bell, shares were initially lower, but managed to turn around. During the regular session, shares were off a fraction to $673.07.</p><p>GoPro saw its revenues surge by more than 70 percent, helped by growing demand for its action cameras overseas. Earnings in revenue topped the street's consensus. Shares were volatile initially in after-hours trading. Before the close, though, the stock was 2 percent higher to $62.04.</p><p>Novartis saw its shares after reporting a decline in profits. This was drug giant was hit by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar and weak results from its eye care treatment business. Yet, the CEO says he's optimistic about the company's pipeline.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE JIMENEZ, NOVARTIS CEO: When you look at our results, the best part about the quarter was the innovation. You know, we just got approval to launch our new heart failure drug called Entresto. This is a drug that's proven to reduce cardiovascular death by 20 percent. We think this is going to be a multimillion dollar drug for the company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EPPERSON: Still, shares slipped more than 2 percent to $103.71.</p><p>Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) swung to a loss in its most recent quarter. The oil field services company saw revenue dropped more than 30 percent, saying it expects tumbling oil prices will persist for the rest of the year. Still, sales weren't as weak as expected. Shares rose about 2 percent to $60.64.</p><p>MATHISEN: And an increase in trading activity helped TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) post an increase in profit. Revenue also coming in better than expected. Still, shares flipped on this down day by more than 1 1/2 percent. They close at $37.73.</p><p>Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) also reporting mixed quarterlies, the strong greenback weighed on its international sales. But the cycle maker refused to keep pace with rivals' steep discounts. Shares revved up a little bit, about 5 percent to $57.67.</p><p>LifeLock shares were halted at one point in today's session, after the Federal Trade Commission charged the identity theft monitoring company, saying it failed to protect its consumers' data. The charges say the firm is violating the terms of a previous settlement with the agency. LifeLock could disagree saying it's prepared to take the case to court.</p><p>When shares continue trading they plunged, plunging almost 50 percent lower on the day at $8.15.</p><p>CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) won a key approval for its pending deal to buy the parent company of One West Bank. The Office of the Comptroller Currency gave the OK. The Federal Reserve now has to approve the agreement, which was announced way back in last July. Shares were more than 2 percent higher, they finished at $48.18.</p><p>EPPERSON: Toshiba finds itself at the center of one of Japan's biggest accounting scandals. The CEO and other executives resigned after taking responsibility for inflating profits by more than $1 billion over several years. At a press conference today, the executives were seen vowing, a gesture meant to convey deep shame.</p><p>The company will have to restate profits back to 2008 when the cover- up began.</p><p>MATHISEN: Uber, the fast growing, ride hailing app start-up held a jobs tour for drivers today in New York City. The jobs tour comes as New York tries to crackdown on the company's expansion. The city council is expected to vote on a bill that would cap Uber's growth while the city studies its impact on traffic congestion. Uber executives say the measure threatens its business model in one of its largest markets.</p><p>And Uber now valued at around $40 billion, is fast becoming a political lightning rod. Not just in New York, but also on the national stage. Republicans generally have embraced it as a symbol of disruptive progress. Democrats say it represents a new era of job insecurity, the temping of America.</p><p>John Harwood joins us from Washington.</p><p>John, Uber's not only changing the business world, but also the political world. Why have so many politicians not just Mayor de Blasio here in New York, latched on to it and made it the target of political warfare?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: What do they say about economics? It's about creative destruction. And when you have creative destruction, some things get destroyed -- old models, old incumbent firms, and in the case of Bill de Blasio in New York, yes, he is raising the issue of traffic congestion, but the rise of Uber is also threatening the incumbent taxi drivers who have relationships, financial relationships with the city, with its politicians. And so, that's not an insignificant item.</p><p>Secondly, Uber represents broader changes in the national economy, that's what Hillary Clinton and some Democrats have pointed to, although they are not -- to be fair to Democrats -- they are not saying Uber is bad in and of itself. They're saying it raises some problems and underscores some problems in the economy that we have to deal with.</p><p>EPPERSON: What about the Republicans, what are they saying in terms of how Uber or companies like that are changing the economy, changing the way people are working today?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, Republicans are casting Uber as a symbol of the 21st century economy, and say when Democrats raise questions about it, they're looking backwards, they're representing the past.</p><p>For example, last week, Hillary Clinton gave a speech reflecting her economic view in which she talked about the issue of classification, should workers be described as contractors or as employees of firms like Uber?</p><p>Well, as it happened, this is a big issue with Uber, many other firms too. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) just paid a big settlement on that issue as well. And Jeb Bush attacked her for being stuck in the last century. That's a future past debate that Republicans think they're on the right side of.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. John Harwood, thanks very much -- John Harwood reporting tonight from Washington.</p><p>And coming up, one sector of the real estate market that has been red- hot for investors. We'll tell you what it is. You may be surprised, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>EPPERSON: Here's what to watch tomorrow: earnings from Dow components American Express (NYSE:EXPR) (NYSE:AXP), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and more. Housing data, including existing home sales and weekly mortgage applications. And that's what to watch Wednesday.</p><p>MATHISEN: It's a little known sector of real estate investment, but it is growing exponentially -- data centers that serve the Cloud. Sounds pretty dull, right? Well, not if you look at the product potential involved.</p><p>Diana Olick has. And she's got more on this red hot sector.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Most people think the Cloud lives in the sky. But it really lives here, in data centers in downtown buildings and suburban warehouses. As data booms, so too does the value of all that real estate, and the REITs that own it.</p><p>GARY WOJTASZEK, CYRUSONE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: Our focus is serving the needs of the Fortune 1,000. That comprises about 75 percent of our business, including nine of the Fortune 20. So, these are the largest companies in the world that have chosen to store their computers in our data centers.</p><p>OLICK: CyrusOne is one of five data center REITs which own two types of property. One is basically a big power station for servers like this one in Sterling, Virginia. The other is an Internet hub where the tenants exchange data. These are more valuable because they're generally located in urban areas.</p><p>WOJTASZEK: We're structured as a real estate investment trust. So, we're predominantly just a real estate company, but we are a derivative of what's going on in all the growth and technology space. So, everything you hear about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Rackspace and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and all those new technologies that are going on, ultimately reside in the data center.</p><p>OLICK: Data center REIT returns have been robust to say the least. CyrusOne, Coresite, Digital Realty, Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), and QTS, in particular, up 46 percent in the past year.</p><p>They can, however, be a tough sell because they are at the crossroads of real estate and technology, which investors value differently.</p><p>JOHN BEJJANI, GREEN STREET ADVISORS: Because data centers are subject to all this technology risk, potential technology risk, because there's so much more to understanding the sector than simply knowing where the real estate is located, some investors opt not to take on the brain damage of understanding these various risks.</p><p>OLICK: And then there's demand. Technology changes moment to moment, and forecasting that change in terms of real estate, for both tenants and landlords is tricky. Developers want to capture this demand immediately. But too much speculation could lead to too much supply.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: That's a really nice investment. Interesting investment to think about when you want that debate, but you're afraid of the risks coming to the technology sector.</p><p>MATHISEN: And the capital returns were huge as Diana just showed out over the past year.</p><p>EPPERSON: Absolutely.</p><p>MATHISEN: Quite amazing.</p><p>EPPERSON: Really good.</p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Sharon Epperson. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And thanks from me as well. I'm Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody. Hope you'll join us here tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Dow  components Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fall sharply  after reporting late-day profits, potentially extending today's deep  selloff in stocks.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  New hope and a new  generation of potential drugs that can treat a growing disease with no cure  -- Alzheimer's.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       MATHISEN:  And not so fast.  The one thing that could prevent the  Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.  </p><p>       All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday,  July 21st.</p><p>       EPPERSON:  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Sharon Epperson, in tonight  for Sue Herera.</p><p>       MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Welcome, everybody.  </p><p>       Sharon, it was a blue chip wreck on Wall Street today.  More on that  in a moment.</p><p>       But we begin tonight with earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), two bellwether companies of the new economy, and  two dominant players in the tech sector, of course.  The tech sector makes  up 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500, by the way.</p><p>       And, tonight, both companies, which you likely own through your  mutual funds and 401(k)s, well, they failed to wow investors.  </p><p>       First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  The world's most valuable company  reported earnings of $1.85 a share.  That was 4 cents better than the  consensus forecast.  Revenue was also slightly better at $49.6 billion.</p><p>       So, what's the problem?  Well, despite selling more than 47 million  iPhones in the quarter, yes, you heard me right, it was the company's weak  outlook that sent shares initially lower.  A lot lower after that report.  </p><p>       Josh Lipton has the key takeaway from Apple's results.  </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big number  in Apple's latest earnings report, 47.5 million.  That is the number of  iPhones Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it shipped in the quarter.  Now, that was  up 35 percent year over year, but was also basically in line with what Wall  Street expected.  Analysts had forecasted that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would  ship some 47.3 million iPhones.</p><p>       In a conversation with Apple's CEO Tim Cook, he told me that only 27  percent of the company's install base had moved those newer 6 and 6-Plus  models.  That suggests plenty of upgrade headroom ahead.  But at least in  the after-hours, investors seem to be focused on that in-line number.  </p><p>       For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in Cupertino,  California.  </p><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       EPPERSON:  Now to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which reported better than  expected earnings in revenue, but took a hit from restructuring charges and  soft demand from some of its products.  The world's largest software  company reported earnings of 62 cents a share, 6 cents better than  estimates.  The company reported revenue that was slightly more than $22  billion. </p><p>       But investors wanted more, sending shares initially lower after the  report.  </p><p>       Kayla Tausche digs deeper into the results.  </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From the face  of it, Microsoft's fiscal fourth quarter looks like a beat all around, the  problem was, that the company's quarter was marred by a massive write-down  of its Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition that happened just a few years ago.  It  was forecast to be a $7.6 billion write-down.  It came in $8.4 billion.  </p><p>       When you peel away what the revenue story told us, it did look a  little weaker, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling prey again to a stronger  dollar, and some currency head winds, especially in its overseas business,  namely for Japan.  </p><p>       When you look at its licensing, there was an expectation that as P.C.  shipments declined, that installs of Windows and Office would decline as  well.  They declined more than the PC shipments fell by.  That's leading  people to wonder what exactly is going on there.</p><p>       Kayla Tausche, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.  </p><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       MATHISEN:  Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) missed second quarter earnings  estimates, those sales narrowly beat those forecasts.  The Internet media  company's results were way down by higher spending to attract users to its  Web sites in order to better compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and others.  Part of Yahoo's strategy has been to invest for  its mobile platform, as a way to drive ad sales.  Shares of Yahoo  (NASDAQ:YHOO) fell initially after the report as you see there.  </p><p>       EPPERSON:  Let's turn to David Garrity now for more discussion about  what's happening in the tech sector and what it may mean for you and your  money.  He's principle at GVA Research.</p><p>       David, thank you for joining us.</p><p>       So many people have some of these big tech names in their portfolio,  either in their IRA or perhaps in the mutual funds they have in their 401k.   But when we're talking about names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), is there  really growth in some of these big stocks over the long term, over the next  five, 10 years?</p><p>       DAVID GARRITY, GVA RESEARCH:  Well, Sharon, certainly, looking at  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), we're in a situation here where the expectations for  smartphone growth over the next five years probably better than 15 percent  on a secular rate, and we're in a situation where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is  gaining share.  And as we know from the standpoint of the price points that  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products are being sold at, they occupy the top of the  market.  </p><p>       And so, from that standpoint, we think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains  the dominant player in a high growth segment, if we look at the valuation  on the stock, whether we back the $200 billion in cash out or not, we're  still looking at a valuation which is below an overall market multiple.   And so, from that stand point, we think that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms  of what you're paying for its growth remains quite attractive, might have  been somewhat disappointing in the quarter that we didn't see the  announcement coming out with respect to the dividend.  But the company  certainly has the funds available to do that.  </p><p>       On the product innovation side, we would say that, you know, the  iPhone 6 upgrade cycle still remains strong.  It might have been  disappointing in terms of the quarter, and there may some concerns about  the September quarter's guidance.  But we would say, overall, the  opportunity to buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on this pull back remains  attractive.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  As a long term bet, and that is two-thumbs up for Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL).  You can use both thumbs there, David.  </p><p>       How about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)?  As a long term play, how does it  look to you?  </p><p>       GARRITY:  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a little bit trickier because  certainly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a company which was successful in  earlier generations of technology, namely around PCs.  But if we look at  the shift over to mobile devices, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a far distant  third behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in terms of the  operating system software that's being provided.  </p><p>       And, obviously, Microsoft's predicaments are somewhat underscored by  the fact that we're going to be giving away their Window's 10 operating  system software to consumers.  Something they wouldn't have done in the  past.  </p><p>       Clearly, in the case of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a company that has  substantial resources both financial and technical, but nevertheless,  somewhat disconcerting to see a company go out and spend approximately $9  billion to buy a company, and then within approximately a year and a half  later, write off the full value of that, as well as also fire the  substantial number of employees related to that business.  </p><p>       So, certainly, the hope here is under new CEO, Satya Nadella, the  company will find a better direction going more towards Cloud computing  that will help to reignite the growth for the company, Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), a name that we like, might not be so aggressive on a pull  back here as we might be with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>       EPPERSON:  All right.  So, a like, not a love, on Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) from you, David.  </p><p>       Thank you for joining us.  David Garrity with GVA Research.  </p><p>       GARRITY:  Thank you, Sharon.</p><p>       MATHISEN:  And Sharon was just mentioning how many mutual funds own  either Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>       According to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), the top three mutual fund  holders of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), include the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, a lot  of people have that.  The Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, it's in a lot  of 401(k)s, and the Fidelity ContraFund.  </p><p>       As for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, and the  Institutional Index Fund are two of the biggest holders as is the American  funds group, Washington Mutual Fund.  </p><p>       EPPERSON:  Tyler, those weak after the bell results could extend  today's deep losses, disappointing results from a handful of Dow components  before the open weighed on the blue chip index.  </p><p>       United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) fell 7 percent.  IBM, which we told  you about last night, was off nearly 6 percent.  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) dropped  more than 2 percent.  Travelers was one of the bright spots after it  reported results this morning, that dragged down the Dow, though, overall,  which fell 181 points to 17,9119.  The NASDAQ was off 10 points and the S&amp;P  500 fell 9 points.  </p><p>       Dominic Chu has more on today's earnings.  </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The dive in the  Dow today was the result of a broader base selloff among 30 component  stocks, the vast majority of which finished the day lower, and the stock  that really drove much of the weakness was United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) - - the diversified industrial company behind brands like Pratt &amp; Whitney  Aircraft Engines and Carrier Air-conditioning Systems reported earnings  that beat Wall Street forecasts.  </p><p>       Overall sales, however, fell shy of expectations.  The company said  that orders from China for its Otis elevators and escalators business fell.   As a result of that and other signs of softer customer demand, it cut its  full year forecast.  </p><p>       Now, remember, the company also recently announced the sale of its  Sikorsky helicopter business to defense contractor Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT).  Another decliner on the day was Verizon (NYSE:VZ)  Communications, America's biggest telecom company by market value.  It  reported profits that beat Wall Street estimates, but it too reported sales  that missed.  While Verizon (NYSE:VZ) did manage to add more wireless phone  customers and boosted revenues for its FiOS high speed internet phone and  TV service, average sales generated per user fell, thanks to increased  competition and promotions.  That was one of the reasons it lowered  expectations for full year sales growth.  </p><p>       One of the modest bright spots came by insurance giant travelers.  It  too reported profits that beat analyst estimates on sales that fell  slightly below forecast.  The company was aided by fewer losses tied to  catastrophes that the company insures against and settlement of a prior tax  issue.  Shares were among just a handful on the Dow that rose on the day.  </p><p>       With less than a fifth of companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported  their quarterly results, a big focus will be on whether the rest of  corporate America can help drive earnings growth.  We're still very early  in earnings season.  </p><p>       For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.  </p><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       MATHISEN:  Late today, Dow Jones reports that federal regulators are  close to approving AT&amp;T's $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV.  That would  clear the way for the biggest media deal of the past year.  The Justice  Department has already signed off on that deal.  </p><p>       Now, Citigroup (NYSE:C) is being ordered to pay about $700 million to  customers for deceptive marketing and billing tactics.  The refund will go  to more than 8 1/2 million credit card customers.  The Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau says Citi's violations took place from 2003 to 2012, and  include misrepresenting the cost and benefits of certain add-on products  like identity theft monitoring and debt protection services.</p><p>       EPPERSON:  Some big banks are setting aside more money to cover bad  loans to energy companies, after oil prices dropped over the past year.   According to \"Reuters\", which cited analysts reports, that raises the  possibility that deteriorating loans could start to hurt bank earnings.</p><p>       Last week, executives from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) told investors that they are increasingly concerned about loans  to oil and gas companies.  Today, oil prices settled around $50 a barrel.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  One Wall Street strategist says the Federal Reserve had  never hiked rates when commodities had been in a pronounced downtrend.   He's Larry McDonald, head of U.S. Micro Strategy at Societe Generale.</p><p>       Larry, welcome.  Good to have you with us.  </p><p>       Is it as simple as history?  If it is, the CRB, which is the leading  commodities index, I think is down about a third over the past year, that  would say the Fed ain't going to do anything this year.  </p><p>       LARRY MCDONALD, SOCIETE GENERALE:  That's the thing, Tyler.  I mean,  the CRB is right on the 2009 recession lows, and it's very close to the  2002 recession lows.  </p><p>       So, the commodity index is right on recession levels, and you have to  remember, the United States in the '80s and '90s was about 55 percent to 60  percent of global GDP.  Today, we're 24, 25 percent.  </p><p>       So, the Fed has to look at the global economy, much more so than he  did in years past.  </p><p>       EPPERSON:  That's not the first thing, Larry, that the Fed will say  they're going to look at when it comes to what they're going to do with  interest rates.  How important do you think are commodity prices to their  next move, and when do you think they're going to make that move?  </p><p>       MCDONALD:  Well, remember, they have a dual mandate, which was  established -- think about how long the dual mandate, they have to look at  unemployment and inflation.  And 10 years ago, Chinese GDP would say $2  trillion.  Now, we're up around $10 trillion or $11 trillion.  </p><p>       The dual mandate around inflation, if China's slowing and that's  hurting commodity prices, that's going to leak over eventually to core  inflation, which is part of the Fed's dual mandate, which doesn't give them  a reason to hike.  On unemployment level does, but the inflation level, if  it's ticking down a notch, certainly doesn't.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  Very interesting point.  Larry McDonald, haven't heard it  made.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>       MCDONALD:  Thanks, Tyler.  Thanks, Sharon.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  Larry McDonald of Societe Generale.</p><p>       EPPERSON:  And still ahead, the big hope, big opportunity and big  risks associated with developing new Alzheimer's drugs.</p><p>       (MUSIC)</p><p>       MATHISEN:  Alzheimer's, it affects more than 5 million Americans  today.  It is the country's sixth most deadly disease.  And yet finding a  cure or a treatment that slows the progression of the ailment has proved  illusive.  </p><p>       But now, as Meg Tirrell reports, there appears to be new hope.  </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       MEG TIRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The quest to  develop a drug that actually slows the course of Alzheimer's disease has  been a long one, marked by failure.  Since 1998, 123 drugs have failed in  development.  Just four were approved.  None slowed the declines in memory  loss and sinking clearly that characterized Alzheimer's.  </p><p>       This year, though, new hope has bloomed.  </p><p>       DR. MARIA CARRILLO:  The scientific community has really been given a  boost by some recent positive news of different drugs.  So, we are all very  hopeful at this time, more hopeful than we have been before.  </p><p>       TIRRELL:  Experimental medicines from Biogen and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)  are under the spotlight this week, with new data coming Wednesday at the  Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington, D.C.</p><p>       They work to remove the plaque buildups in the brain known as beta  amyloid, thought to be toxic to neurons.  Evidence from early studies shows  that removing the plaques may help steam declines in cognition, results  that still need to be supported by larger studies.  </p><p>       A successful drug could mean big business.  More than 5 million  Americans have Alzheimer's today, a number that could triple by 2050.  Some  analysts estimate the market for an Alzheimer's drug could be $20 billion a  year.  </p><p>       CARRILLO:  This disease is urgent and we need answers now.  Baby  boomers cost us about 2 percent of Medicare overall spending today.  That  number will increase almost 25 percent by 2040 if we don't stop this  disease.  </p><p>       TIRRELL:  The National Institutes of Health spent about $560 million  of its $30 billion budget on Alzheimer's disease last year, an amount some  say isn't enough to address the size of the problem.  It allocated more  than a billion and a half to heart disease, and $5 billion to cancer.  </p><p>       FRED HASSAN, WARBURG PINCUS:  We need to have a war on Alzheimer's  mentality here, a sense of urgency.</p><p>       TIRRELL:  Fred Hassan led pharmaceutical companies including Schering  Plough, which developed an Alzheimer's drug now owned by Merck (NYSE:MRK).   He calls the disease the biggest long term tsunami facing many countries</p><p>       HASSAN:  It's a moral imperative because the patients can't speak for  themselves.  That's why we as a society need to speak for the patients here  and do more.  Half a billion is not much.  </p><p>       TIRREL:  The results tomorrow could spur not just hope for medicine,  but big moves in drug maker stock prices as well.  </p><p>       Cowen estimates Biogen shares could swing $50 in either direction,  representing as much as $10 billion in market value.</p><p>       For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.  </p><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       EPPERSON:  Chipotle beats estimates but misses on one key metric.   That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>       The burrito chain said same store sales rose less than analysts were  expecting, still, it managed to top consensus on the top and bottom lines.   After the bell, shares were initially lower, but managed to turn around.   During the regular session, shares were off a fraction to $673.07.  </p><p>       GoPro saw its revenues surge by more than 70 percent, helped by  growing demand for its action cameras overseas.  Earnings in revenue topped  the street's consensus.  Shares were volatile initially in after-hours  trading.  Before the close, though, the stock was 2 percent higher to  $62.04.</p><p>       Novartis saw its shares after reporting a decline in profits.  This  was drug giant was hit by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar and weak  results from its eye care treatment business.  Yet, the CEO says he's  optimistic about the company's pipeline.  </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>       JOE JIMENEZ, NOVARTIS CEO:  When you look at our results, the best  part about the quarter was the innovation.  You know, we just got approval  to launch our new heart failure drug called Entresto.  This is a drug  that's proven to reduce cardiovascular death by 20 percent.  We think this  is going to be a multimillion dollar drug for the company.  </p><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>       EPPERSON:  Still, shares slipped more than 2 percent to $103.71.  </p><p>       Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) swung to a loss in its most recent quarter.   The oil field services company saw revenue dropped more than 30 percent,  saying it expects tumbling oil prices will persist for the rest of the  year.  Still, sales weren't as weak as expected.  Shares rose about 2  percent to $60.64.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  And an increase in trading activity helped TD Ameritrade  (NASDAQ:AMTD) post an increase in profit.  Revenue also coming in better  than expected.  Still, shares flipped on this down day by more than 1 1/2  percent.  They close at $37.73.  </p><p>       Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) also reporting mixed quarterlies, the  strong greenback weighed on its international sales.  But the cycle maker  refused to keep pace with rivals' steep discounts.  Shares revved up a  little bit, about 5 percent to $57.67.  </p><p>       LifeLock shares were halted at one point in today's session, after  the Federal Trade Commission charged the identity theft monitoring company,  saying it failed to protect its consumers' data.  The charges say the firm  is violating the terms of a previous settlement with the agency.  LifeLock  could disagree saying it's prepared to take the case to court.  </p><p>       When shares continue trading they plunged, plunging almost 50 percent  lower on the day at $8.15.  </p><p>       CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) won a key approval for its pending deal to buy  the parent company of One West Bank.  The Office of the Comptroller  Currency gave the OK.  The Federal Reserve now has to approve the  agreement, which was announced way back in last July.  Shares were more  than 2 percent higher, they finished at $48.18.  </p><p>       EPPERSON:  Toshiba finds itself at the center of one of Japan's  biggest accounting scandals.  The CEO and other executives resigned after  taking responsibility for inflating profits by more than $1 billion over  several years.  At a press conference today, the executives were seen  vowing, a gesture meant to convey deep shame.  </p><p>       The company will have to restate profits back to 2008 when the cover- up began.</p><p>       MATHISEN:  Uber, the fast growing, ride hailing app start-up held a  jobs tour for drivers today in New York City.  The jobs tour comes as New  York tries to crackdown on the company's expansion.  The city council is  expected to vote on a bill that would cap Uber's growth while the city  studies its impact on traffic congestion.  Uber executives say the measure  threatens its business model in one of its largest markets.  </p><p>       And Uber now valued at around $40 billion, is fast becoming a  political lightning rod.  Not just in New York, but also on the national  stage.  Republicans generally have embraced it as a symbol of disruptive  progress.  Democrats say it represents a new era of job insecurity, the  temping of America.  </p><p>       John Harwood joins us from Washington.  </p><p>       John, Uber's not only changing the business world, but also the  political world.  Why have so many politicians not just Mayor de Blasio  here in New York, latched on to it and made it the target of political  warfare?  </p><p>       JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  What do they  say about economics?  It's about creative destruction.  And when you have  creative destruction, some things get destroyed -- old models, old  incumbent firms, and in the case of Bill de Blasio in New York, yes, he is  raising the issue of traffic congestion, but the rise of Uber is also  threatening the incumbent taxi drivers who have relationships, financial  relationships with the city, with its politicians.  And so, that's not an  insignificant item.  </p><p>       Secondly, Uber represents broader changes in the national economy,  that's what Hillary Clinton and some Democrats have pointed to, although  they are not -- to be fair to Democrats -- they are not saying Uber is bad  in and of itself.  They're saying it raises some problems and underscores  some problems in the economy that we have to deal with.  </p><p>       EPPERSON:  What about the Republicans, what are they saying in terms  of how Uber or companies like that are changing the economy, changing the  way people are working today?  </p><p>       HARWOOD:  Well, Republicans are casting Uber as a symbol of the 21st  century economy, and say when Democrats raise questions about it, they're  looking backwards, they're representing the past.</p><p>       For example, last week, Hillary Clinton gave a speech reflecting her  economic view in which she talked about the issue of classification, should  workers be described as contractors or as employees of firms like Uber?  </p><p>       Well, as it happened, this is a big issue with Uber, many other firms  too.  FedEx (NYSE:FDX) just paid a big settlement on that issue as well.   And Jeb Bush attacked her for being stuck in the last century.  That's a  future past debate that Republicans think they're on the right side of.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  All right.  John Harwood, thanks very much -- John Harwood  reporting tonight from Washington.  </p><p>       And coming up, one sector of the real estate market that has been  red-hot for investors.  We'll tell you what it is.  You may be surprised,  next.</p><p>       (MUSIC)</p><p>       EPPERSON:  Here's what to watch tomorrow: earnings from Dow  components American Express (NYSE:EXPR) (NYSE:AXP), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) and more.  Housing data, including existing home sales and  weekly mortgage applications.  And that's what to watch Wednesday.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  It's a little known sector of real estate investment, but  it is growing exponentially -- data centers that serve the Cloud.  Sounds  pretty dull, right?  Well, not if you look at the product potential  involved.  </p><p>       Diana Olick has.  And she's got more on this red hot sector.  </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Most people  think the Cloud lives in the sky.  But it really lives here, in data  centers in downtown buildings and suburban warehouses.  As data booms, so  too does the value of all that real estate, and the REITs that own it.  </p><p>       GARY WOJTASZEK, CYRUSONE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO:  Our focus is serving the  needs of the Fortune 1,000.  That comprises about 75 percent of our  business, including nine of the Fortune 20.  So, these are the largest  companies in the world that have chosen to store their computers in our  data centers.  </p><p>       OLICK:  CyrusOne is one of five data center REITs which own two types  of property.  One is basically a big power station for servers like this  one in Sterling, Virginia.  The other is an Internet hub where the tenants  exchange data.  These are more valuable because they're generally located  in urban areas.  </p><p>       WOJTASZEK:  We're structured as a real estate investment trust.  So,  we're predominantly just a real estate company, but we are a derivative of  what's going on in all the growth and technology space.  So, everything you  hear about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Rackspace and  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and all those new technologies that are going on,  ultimately reside in the data center.  </p><p>       OLICK:  Data center REIT returns have been robust to say the least.   CyrusOne, Coresite, Digital Realty, Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), and QTS, in  particular, up 46 percent in the past year.  </p><p>       They can, however, be a tough sell because they are at the crossroads  of real estate and technology, which investors value differently.  </p><p>       JOHN BEJJANI, GREEN STREET ADVISORS:  Because data centers are  subject to all this technology risk, potential technology risk, because  there's so much more to understanding the sector than simply knowing where  the real estate is located, some investors opt not to take on the brain  damage of understanding these various risks.  </p><p>       OLICK:  And then there's demand.  Technology changes moment to  moment, and forecasting that change in terms of real estate, for both  tenants and landlords is tricky.  Developers want to capture this demand  immediately.  But too much speculation could lead to too much supply.  </p><p>       For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       EPPERSON:  That's a really nice investment.  Interesting investment  to think about when you want that debate, but you're afraid of the risks  coming to the technology sector.</p><p>       MATHISEN:  And the capital returns were huge as Diana just showed out  over the past year.  </p><p>       EPPERSON:  Absolutely.</p><p>       MATHISEN:  Quite amazing.</p><p>       EPPERSON:  Really good. </p><p>       That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sharon Epperson.   Thanks for watching.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a  great evening, everybody.  Hope you'll join us here tomorrow night.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Dow components Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fall sharply after reporting late-day profits, potentially extending today's deep selloff in stocks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: New hope and a new generation of potential drugs that can treat a growing disease with no cure -- Alzheimer's.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: And not so fast. The one thing that could prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, July 21st.</p><p>EPPERSON: Good evening, everyone. I'm Sharon Epperson, in tonight for Sue Herera.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Welcome, everybody.</p><p>Sharon, it was a blue chip wreck on Wall Street today. More on that in a moment.</p><p>But we begin tonight with earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), two bellwether companies of the new economy, and two dominant players in the tech sector, of course. The tech sector makes up 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500, by the way.</p><p>And, tonight, both companies, which you likely own through your mutual funds and 401(k)s, well, they failed to wow investors.</p><p>First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The world's most valuable company reported earnings of $1.85 a share. That was 4 cents better than the consensus forecast. Revenue was also slightly better at $49.6 billion.</p><p>So, what's the problem? Well, despite selling more than 47 million iPhones in the quarter, yes, you heard me right, it was the company's weak outlook that sent shares initially lower. A lot lower after that report.</p><p>Josh Lipton has the key takeaway from Apple's results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big number in Apple's latest earnings report, 47.5 million. That is the number of iPhones Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it shipped in the quarter. Now, that was up 35 percent year over year, but was also basically in line with what Wall Street expected. Analysts had forecasted that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would ship some 47.3 million iPhones.</p><p>In a conversation with Apple's CEO Tim Cook, he told me that only 27 percent of the company's install base had moved those newer 6 and 6-Plus models. That suggests plenty of upgrade headroom ahead. But at least in the after-hours, investors seem to be focused on that in-line number.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in Cupertino, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: Now to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which reported better than expected earnings in revenue, but took a hit from restructuring charges and soft demand from some of its products. The world's largest software company reported earnings of 62 cents a share, 6 cents better than estimates. The company reported revenue that was slightly more than $22 billion.</p><p>But investors wanted more, sending shares initially lower after the report.</p><p>Kayla Tausche digs deeper into the results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: From the face of it, Microsoft's fiscal fourth quarter looks like a beat all around, the problem was, that the company's quarter was marred by a massive write-down of its Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition that happened just a few years ago. It was forecast to be a $7.6 billion write-down. It came in $8.4 billion.</p><p>When you peel away what the revenue story told us, it did look a little weaker, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling prey again to a stronger dollar, and some currency head winds, especially in its overseas business, namely for Japan.</p><p>When you look at its licensing, there was an expectation that as P.C. shipments declined, that installs of Windows and Office would decline as well. They declined more than the PC shipments fell by. That's leading people to wonder what exactly is going on there.</p><p>Kayla Tausche, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) missed second quarter earnings estimates, those sales narrowly beat those forecasts. The Internet media company's results were way down by higher spending to attract users to its Web sites in order to better compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and others. Part of Yahoo's strategy has been to invest for its mobile platform, as a way to drive ad sales. Shares of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) fell initially after the report as you see there.</p><p>EPPERSON: Let's turn to David Garrity now for more discussion about what's happening in the tech sector and what it may mean for you and your money. He's principle at GVA Research.</p><p>David, thank you for joining us.</p><p>So many people have some of these big tech names in their portfolio, either in their IRA or perhaps in the mutual funds they have in their 401k. But when we're talking about names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), is there really growth in some of these big stocks over the long term, over the next five, 10 years?</p><p>DAVID GARRITY, GVA RESEARCH: Well, Sharon, certainly, looking at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), we're in a situation here where the expectations for smartphone growth over the next five years probably better than 15 percent on a secular rate, and we're in a situation where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is gaining share. And as we know from the standpoint of the price points that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products are being sold at, they occupy the top of the market.</p><p>And so, from that standpoint, we think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains the dominant player in a high growth segment, if we look at the valuation on the stock, whether we back the $200 billion in cash out or not, we're still looking at a valuation which is below an overall market multiple. And so, from that stand point, we think that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of what you're paying for its growth remains quite attractive, might have been somewhat disappointing in the quarter that we didn't see the announcement coming out with respect to the dividend. But the company certainly has the funds available to do that.</p><p>On the product innovation side, we would say that, you know, the iPhone 6 upgrade cycle still remains strong. It might have been disappointing in terms of the quarter, and there may some concerns about the September quarter's guidance. But we would say, overall, the opportunity to buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on this pull back remains attractive.</p><p>MATHISEN: As a long term bet, and that is two-thumbs up for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). You can use both thumbs there, David.</p><p>How about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)? As a long term play, how does it look to you?</p><p>GARRITY: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a little bit trickier because certainly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a company which was successful in earlier generations of technology, namely around PCs. But if we look at the shift over to mobile devices, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a far distant third behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in terms of the operating system software that's being provided.</p><p>And, obviously, Microsoft's predicaments are somewhat underscored by the fact that we're going to be giving away their Window's 10 operating system software to consumers. Something they wouldn't have done in the past.</p><p>Clearly, in the case of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a company that has substantial resources both financial and technical, but nevertheless, somewhat disconcerting to see a company go out and spend approximately $9 billion to buy a company, and then within approximately a year and a half later, write off the full value of that, as well as also fire the substantial number of employees related to that business.</p><p>So, certainly, the hope here is under new CEO, Satya Nadella, the company will find a better direction going more towards Cloud computing that will help to reignite the growth for the company, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a name that we like, might not be so aggressive on a pull back here as we might be with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>EPPERSON: All right. So, a like, not a love, on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from you, David.</p><p>Thank you for joining us. David Garrity with GVA Research.</p><p>GARRITY: Thank you, Sharon.</p><p>MATHISEN: And Sharon was just mentioning how many mutual funds own either Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>According to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), the top three mutual fund holders of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), include the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, a lot of people have that. The Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, it's in a lot of 401(k)s, and the Fidelity ContraFund.</p><p>As for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, and the Institutional Index Fund are two of the biggest holders as is the American funds group, Washington Mutual Fund.</p><p>EPPERSON: Tyler, those weak after the bell results could extend today's deep losses, disappointing results from a handful of Dow components before the open weighed on the blue chip index.</p><p>United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) fell 7 percent. IBM, which we told you about last night, was off nearly 6 percent. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) dropped more than 2 percent. Travelers was one of the bright spots after it reported results this morning, that dragged down the Dow, though, overall, which fell 181 points to 17,9119. The NASDAQ was off 10 points and the S&amp;P 500 fell 9 points.</p><p>Dominic Chu has more on today's earnings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The dive in the Dow today was the result of a broader base selloff among 30 component stocks, the vast majority of which finished the day lower, and the stock that really drove much of the weakness was United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) - - the diversified industrial company behind brands like Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Engines and Carrier Air-conditioning Systems reported earnings that beat Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>Overall sales, however, fell shy of expectations. The company said that orders from China for its Otis elevators and escalators business fell. As a result of that and other signs of softer customer demand, it cut its full year forecast.</p><p>Now, remember, the company also recently announced the sale of its Sikorsky helicopter business to defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). Another decliner on the day was Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Communications, America's biggest telecom company by market value. It reported profits that beat Wall Street estimates, but it too reported sales that missed. While Verizon (NYSE:VZ) did manage to add more wireless phone customers and boosted revenues for its FiOS high speed internet phone and TV service, average sales generated per user fell, thanks to increased competition and promotions. That was one of the reasons it lowered expectations for full year sales growth.</p><p>One of the modest bright spots came by insurance giant travelers. It too reported profits that beat analyst estimates on sales that fell slightly below forecast. The company was aided by fewer losses tied to catastrophes that the company insures against and settlement of a prior tax issue. Shares were among just a handful on the Dow that rose on the day.</p><p>With less than a fifth of companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported their quarterly results, a big focus will be on whether the rest of corporate America can help drive earnings growth. We're still very early in earnings season.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Late today, Dow Jones reports that federal regulators are close to approving AT&amp;T's $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV. That would clear the way for the biggest media deal of the past year. The Justice Department has already signed off on that deal.</p><p>Now, Citigroup (NYSE:C) is being ordered to pay about $700 million to customers for deceptive marketing and billing tactics. The refund will go to more than 8 1/2 million credit card customers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says Citi's violations took place from 2003 to 2012, and include misrepresenting the cost and benefits of certain add-on products like identity theft monitoring and debt protection services.</p><p>EPPERSON: Some big banks are setting aside more money to cover bad loans to energy companies, after oil prices dropped over the past year. According to \"Reuters\", which cited analysts reports, that raises the possibility that deteriorating loans could start to hurt bank earnings.</p><p>Last week, executives from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) told investors that they are increasingly concerned about loans to oil and gas companies. Today, oil prices settled around $50 a barrel.</p><p>MATHISEN: One Wall Street strategist says the Federal Reserve had never hiked rates when commodities had been in a pronounced downtrend. He's Larry McDonald, head of U.S. Micro Strategy at Societe Generale.</p><p>Larry, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>Is it as simple as history? If it is, the CRB, which is the leading commodities index, I think is down about a third over the past year, that would say the Fed ain't going to do anything this year.</p><p>LARRY MCDONALD, SOCIETE GENERALE: That's the thing, Tyler. I mean, the CRB is right on the 2009 recession lows, and it's very close to the 2002 recession lows.</p><p>So, the commodity index is right on recession levels, and you have to remember, the United States in the '80s and '90s was about 55 percent to 60 percent of global GDP. Today, we're 24, 25 percent.</p><p>So, the Fed has to look at the global economy, much more so than he did in years past.</p><p>EPPERSON: That's not the first thing, Larry, that the Fed will say they're going to look at when it comes to what they're going to do with interest rates. How important do you think are commodity prices to their next move, and when do you think they're going to make that move?</p><p>MCDONALD: Well, remember, they have a dual mandate, which was established -- think about how long the dual mandate, they have to look at unemployment and inflation. And 10 years ago, Chinese GDP would say $2 trillion. Now, we're up around $10 trillion or $11 trillion.</p><p>The dual mandate around inflation, if China's slowing and that's hurting commodity prices, that's going to leak over eventually to core inflation, which is part of the Fed's dual mandate, which doesn't give them a reason to hike. On unemployment level does, but the inflation level, if it's ticking down a notch, certainly doesn't.</p><p>MATHISEN: Very interesting point. Larry McDonald, haven't heard it made. We appreciate it.</p><p>MCDONALD: Thanks, Tyler. Thanks, Sharon.</p><p>MATHISEN: Larry McDonald of Societe Generale.</p><p>EPPERSON: And still ahead, the big hope, big opportunity and big risks associated with developing new Alzheimer's drugs.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Alzheimer's, it affects more than 5 million Americans today. It is the country's sixth most deadly disease. And yet finding a cure or a treatment that slows the progression of the ailment has proved illusive.</p><p>But now, as Meg Tirrell reports, there appears to be new hope.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The quest to develop a drug that actually slows the course of Alzheimer's disease has been a long one, marked by failure. Since 1998, 123 drugs have failed in development. Just four were approved. None slowed the declines in memory loss and sinking clearly that characterized Alzheimer's.</p><p>This year, though, new hope has bloomed.</p><p>DR. MARIA CARRILLO: The scientific community has really been given a boost by some recent positive news of different drugs. So, we are all very hopeful at this time, more hopeful than we have been before.</p><p>TIRRELL: Experimental medicines from Biogen and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) are under the spotlight this week, with new data coming Wednesday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington, D.C.</p><p>They work to remove the plaque buildups in the brain known as beta amyloid, thought to be toxic to neurons. Evidence from early studies shows that removing the plaques may help steam declines in cognition, results that still need to be supported by larger studies.</p><p>A successful drug could mean big business. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's today, a number that could triple by 2050. Some analysts estimate the market for an Alzheimer's drug could be $20 billion a year.</p><p>CARRILLO: This disease is urgent and we need answers now. Baby boomers cost us about 2 percent of Medicare overall spending today. That number will increase almost 25 percent by 2040 if we don't stop this disease.</p><p>TIRRELL: The National Institutes of Health spent about $560 million of its $30 billion budget on Alzheimer's disease last year, an amount some say isn't enough to address the size of the problem. It allocated more than a billion and a half to heart disease, and $5 billion to cancer.</p><p>FRED HASSAN, WARBURG PINCUS: We need to have a war on Alzheimer's mentality here, a sense of urgency.</p><p>TIRRELL: Fred Hassan led pharmaceutical companies including Schering Plough, which developed an Alzheimer's drug now owned by Merck (NYSE:MRK). He calls the disease the biggest long term tsunami facing many countries</p><p>HASSAN: It's a moral imperative because the patients can't speak for themselves. That's why we as a society need to speak for the patients here and do more. Half a billion is not much.</p><p>TIRREL: The results tomorrow could spur not just hope for medicine, but big moves in drug maker stock prices as well.</p><p>Cowen estimates Biogen shares could swing $50 in either direction, representing as much as $10 billion in market value.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: Chipotle beats estimates but misses on one key metric. That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The burrito chain said same store sales rose less than analysts were expecting, still, it managed to top consensus on the top and bottom lines. After the bell, shares were initially lower, but managed to turn around. During the regular session, shares were off a fraction to $673.07.</p><p>GoPro saw its revenues surge by more than 70 percent, helped by growing demand for its action cameras overseas. Earnings in revenue topped the street's consensus. Shares were volatile initially in after-hours trading. Before the close, though, the stock was 2 percent higher to $62.04.</p><p>Novartis saw its shares after reporting a decline in profits. This was drug giant was hit by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar and weak results from its eye care treatment business. Yet, the CEO says he's optimistic about the company's pipeline.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE JIMENEZ, NOVARTIS CEO: When you look at our results, the best part about the quarter was the innovation. You know, we just got approval to launch our new heart failure drug called Entresto. This is a drug that's proven to reduce cardiovascular death by 20 percent. We think this is going to be a multimillion dollar drug for the company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EPPERSON: Still, shares slipped more than 2 percent to $103.71.</p><p>Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) swung to a loss in its most recent quarter. The oil field services company saw revenue dropped more than 30 percent, saying it expects tumbling oil prices will persist for the rest of the year. Still, sales weren't as weak as expected. Shares rose about 2 percent to $60.64.</p><p>MATHISEN: And an increase in trading activity helped TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) post an increase in profit. Revenue also coming in better than expected. Still, shares flipped on this down day by more than 1 1/2 percent. They close at $37.73.</p><p>Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) also reporting mixed quarterlies, the strong greenback weighed on its international sales. But the cycle maker refused to keep pace with rivals' steep discounts. Shares revved up a little bit, about 5 percent to $57.67.</p><p>LifeLock shares were halted at one point in today's session, after the Federal Trade Commission charged the identity theft monitoring company, saying it failed to protect its consumers' data. The charges say the firm is violating the terms of a previous settlement with the agency. LifeLock could disagree saying it's prepared to take the case to court.</p><p>When shares continue trading they plunged, plunging almost 50 percent lower on the day at $8.15.</p><p>CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) won a key approval for its pending deal to buy the parent company of One West Bank. The Office of the Comptroller Currency gave the OK. The Federal Reserve now has to approve the agreement, which was announced way back in last July. Shares were more than 2 percent higher, they finished at $48.18.</p><p>EPPERSON: Toshiba finds itself at the center of one of Japan's biggest accounting scandals. The CEO and other executives resigned after taking responsibility for inflating profits by more than $1 billion over several years. At a press conference today, the executives were seen vowing, a gesture meant to convey deep shame.</p><p>The company will have to restate profits back to 2008 when the cover- up began.</p><p>MATHISEN: Uber, the fast growing, ride hailing app start-up held a jobs tour for drivers today in New York City. The jobs tour comes as New York tries to crackdown on the company's expansion. The city council is expected to vote on a bill that would cap Uber's growth while the city studies its impact on traffic congestion. Uber executives say the measure threatens its business model in one of its largest markets.</p><p>And Uber now valued at around $40 billion, is fast becoming a political lightning rod. Not just in New York, but also on the national stage. Republicans generally have embraced it as a symbol of disruptive progress. Democrats say it represents a new era of job insecurity, the temping of America.</p><p>John Harwood joins us from Washington.</p><p>John, Uber's not only changing the business world, but also the political world. Why have so many politicians not just Mayor de Blasio here in New York, latched on to it and made it the target of political warfare?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: What do they say about economics? It's about creative destruction. And when you have creative destruction, some things get destroyed -- old models, old incumbent firms, and in the case of Bill de Blasio in New York, yes, he is raising the issue of traffic congestion, but the rise of Uber is also threatening the incumbent taxi drivers who have relationships, financial relationships with the city, with its politicians. And so, that's not an insignificant item.</p><p>Secondly, Uber represents broader changes in the national economy, that's what Hillary Clinton and some Democrats have pointed to, although they are not -- to be fair to Democrats -- they are not saying Uber is bad in and of itself. They're saying it raises some problems and underscores some problems in the economy that we have to deal with.</p><p>EPPERSON: What about the Republicans, what are they saying in terms of how Uber or companies like that are changing the economy, changing the way people are working today?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, Republicans are casting Uber as a symbol of the 21st century economy, and say when Democrats raise questions about it, they're looking backwards, they're representing the past.</p><p>For example, last week, Hillary Clinton gave a speech reflecting her economic view in which she talked about the issue of classification, should workers be described as contractors or as employees of firms like Uber?</p><p>Well, as it happened, this is a big issue with Uber, many other firms too. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) just paid a big settlement on that issue as well. And Jeb Bush attacked her for being stuck in the last century. That's a future past debate that Republicans think they're on the right side of.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. John Harwood, thanks very much -- John Harwood reporting tonight from Washington.</p><p>And coming up, one sector of the real estate market that has been red-hot for investors. We'll tell you what it is. You may be surprised, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>EPPERSON: Here's what to watch tomorrow: earnings from Dow components American Express (NYSE:EXPR) (NYSE:AXP), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) and more. Housing data, including existing home sales and weekly mortgage applications. And that's what to watch Wednesday.</p><p>MATHISEN: It's a little known sector of real estate investment, but it is growing exponentially -- data centers that serve the Cloud. Sounds pretty dull, right? Well, not if you look at the product potential involved.</p><p>Diana Olick has. And she's got more on this red hot sector.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Most people think the Cloud lives in the sky. But it really lives here, in data centers in downtown buildings and suburban warehouses. As data booms, so too does the value of all that real estate, and the REITs that own it.</p><p>GARY WOJTASZEK, CYRUSONE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: Our focus is serving the needs of the Fortune 1,000. That comprises about 75 percent of our business, including nine of the Fortune 20. So, these are the largest companies in the world that have chosen to store their computers in our data centers.</p><p>OLICK: CyrusOne is one of five data center REITs which own two types of property. One is basically a big power station for servers like this one in Sterling, Virginia. The other is an Internet hub where the tenants exchange data. These are more valuable because they're generally located in urban areas.</p><p>WOJTASZEK: We're structured as a real estate investment trust. So, we're predominantly just a real estate company, but we are a derivative of what's going on in all the growth and technology space. So, everything you hear about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Rackspace and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and all those new technologies that are going on, ultimately reside in the data center.</p><p>OLICK: Data center REIT returns have been robust to say the least. CyrusOne, Coresite, Digital Realty, Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), and QTS, in particular, up 46 percent in the past year.</p><p>They can, however, be a tough sell because they are at the crossroads of real estate and technology, which investors value differently.</p><p>JOHN BEJJANI, GREEN STREET ADVISORS: Because data centers are subject to all this technology risk, potential technology risk, because there's so much more to understanding the sector than simply knowing where the real estate is located, some investors opt not to take on the brain damage of understanding these various risks.</p><p>OLICK: And then there's demand. Technology changes moment to moment, and forecasting that change in terms of real estate, for both tenants and landlords is tricky. Developers want to capture this demand immediately. But too much speculation could lead to too much supply.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: That's a really nice investment. Interesting investment to think about when you want that debate, but you're afraid of the risks coming to the technology sector.</p><p>MATHISEN: And the capital returns were huge as Diana just showed out over the past year.</p><p>EPPERSON: Absolutely.</p><p>MATHISEN: Quite amazing.</p><p>EPPERSON: Really good.</p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Sharon Epperson. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And thanks from me as well. I'm Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody.

Dow  components Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fall sharply  after reporting late-day profits, potentially extending today's deep  selloff in stocks.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  New hope and a new  generation of potential drugs that can treat a growing disease with no cure  -- Alzheimer's.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  MATHISEN:  And not so fast.  The one thing that could prevent the  Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.  </p><p>  All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, July  21st.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Sharon Epperson, in tonight  for Sue Herera.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Welcome, everybody.  </p><p>  Sharon, it was a blue chip wreck on Wall Street today.  More on that  in a moment.</p><p>  But we begin tonight with earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), two bellwether companies of the new economy, and  two dominant players in the tech sector, of course.  The tech sector makes  up 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500, by the way.</p><p>  And, tonight, both companies, which you likely own through your mutual  funds and 401(k)s, well, they failed to wow investors.  </p><p>  First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  The world's most valuable company  reported earnings of $1.85 a share.  That was 4 cents better than the  consensus forecast.  Revenue was also slightly better at $49.6 billion.</p><p>  So, what's the problem?  Well, despite selling more than 47 million  iPhones in the quarter, yes, you heard me right, it was the company's weak  outlook that sent shares initially lower.  A lot lower after that report.  </p><p>  Josh Lipton has the key takeaway from Apple's results.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big number in  Apple's latest earnings report, 47.5 million.  That is the number of  iPhones Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it shipped in the quarter.  Now, that was  up 35 percent year over year, but was also basically in line with what Wall  Street expected.  Analysts had forecasted that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would  ship some 47.3 million iPhones.</p><p>  In a conversation with Apple's CEO Tim Cook, he told me that only 27  percent of the company's install base had moved those newer 6 and 6-Plus  models.  That suggests plenty of upgrade headroom ahead.  But at least in  the after-hours, investors seem to be focused on that in-line number.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in Cupertino, California.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Now to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which reported better than  expected earnings in revenue, but took a hit from restructuring charges and  soft demand from some of its products.  The world's largest software  company reported earnings of 62 cents a share, 6 cents better than  estimates.  The company reported revenue that was slightly more than $22  billion. </p><p>  But investors wanted more, sending shares initially lower after the  report.  </p><p>  Kayla Tausche digs deeper into the results.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  From the face  of it, Microsoft's fiscal fourth quarter looks like a beat all around, the  problem was, that the company's quarter was marred by a massive write-down  of its Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition that happened just a few years ago.  It  was forecast to be a $7.6 billion write-down.  It came in $8.4 billion.  </p><p>  When you peel away what the revenue story told us, it did look a  little weaker, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling prey again to a stronger  dollar, and some currency head winds, especially in its overseas business,  namely for Japan.  </p><p>  When you look at its licensing, there was an expectation that as P.C.  shipments declined, that installs of Windows and Office would decline as  well.  They declined more than the PC shipments fell by.  That's leading  people to wonder what exactly is going on there.</p><p>  Kayla Tausche, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) missed second quarter earnings  estimates, those sales narrowly beat those forecasts.  The Internet media  company's results were way down by higher spending to attract users to its  Web sites in order to better compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and others.  Part of Yahoo's strategy has been to invest for  its mobile platform, as a way to drive ad sales.  Shares of Yahoo  (NASDAQ:YHOO) fell initially after the report as you see there.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Let's turn to David Garrity now for more discussion about  what's happening in the tech sector and what it may mean for you and your  money.  He's principle at GVA Research.</p><p>  David, thank you for joining us.</p><p>  So many people have some of these big tech names in their portfolio,  either in their IRA or perhaps in the mutual funds they have in their 401k.   But when we're talking about names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), is there  really growth in some of these big stocks over the long term, over the next  five, 10 years?</p><p>  DAVID GARRITY, GVA RESEARCH:  Well, Sharon, certainly, looking at  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), we're in a situation here where the expectations for  smartphone growth over the next five years probably better than 15 percent  on a secular rate, and we're in a situation where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is  gaining share.  And as we know from the standpoint of the price points that  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products are being sold at, they occupy the top of the  market.  </p><p>  And so, from that standpoint, we think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains the  dominant player in a high growth segment, if we look at the valuation on  the stock, whether we back the $200 billion in cash out or not, we're still  looking at a valuation which is below an overall market multiple.  And so,  from that stand point, we think that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of what  you're paying for its growth remains quite attractive, might have been  somewhat disappointing in the quarter that we didn't see the announcement  coming out with respect to the dividend.  But the company certainly has the  funds available to do that.  </p><p>  On the product innovation side, we would say that, you know, the  iPhone 6 upgrade cycle still remains strong.  It might have been  disappointing in terms of the quarter, and there may some concerns about  the September quarter's guidance.  But we would say, overall, the  opportunity to buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on this pull back remains  attractive.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  As a long term bet, and that is two-thumbs up for Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL).  You can use both thumbs there, David.  </p><p>  How about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)?  As a long term play, how does it  look to you?  </p><p>  GARRITY:  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a little bit trickier because  certainly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a company which was successful in  earlier generations of technology, namely around PCs.  But if we look at  the shift over to mobile devices, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a far distant  third behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in terms of the  operating system software that's being provided.  </p><p>  And, obviously, Microsoft's predicaments are somewhat underscored by  the fact that we're going to be giving away their Window's 10 operating  system software to consumers.  Something they wouldn't have done in the  past.  </p><p>  Clearly, in the case of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a company that has  substantial resources both financial and technical, but nevertheless,  somewhat disconcerting to see a company go out and spend approximately $9  billion to buy a company, and then within approximately a year and a half  later, write off the full value of that, as well as also fire the  substantial number of employees related to that business.  </p><p>  So, certainly, the hope here is under new CEO, Satya Nadella, the  company will find a better direction going more towards Cloud computing  that will help to reignite the growth for the company, Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), a name that we like, might not be so aggressive on a pull  back here as we might be with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  All right.  So, a like, not a love, on Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) from you, David.  </p><p>  Thank you for joining us.  David Garrity with GVA Research.  </p><p>  GARRITY:  Thank you, Sharon.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  And Sharon was just mentioning how many mutual funds own  either Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>  According to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), the top three mutual fund  holders of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), include the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, a lot  of people have that.  The Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, it's in a lot  of 401(k)s, and the Fidelity ContraFund.  </p><p>  As for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, and the  Institutional Index Fund are two of the biggest holders as is the American  funds group, Washington Mutual Fund.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Tyler, those weak after the bell results could extend  today's deep losses, disappointing results from a handful of Dow components  before the open weighed on the blue chip index.  </p><p>  United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) fell 7 percent.  IBM, which we told you  about last night, was off nearly 6 percent.  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) dropped more  than 2 percent.  Travelers was one of the bright spots after it reported  results this morning, that dragged down the Dow, though, overall, which  fell 181 points to 17,9119.  The NASDAQ was off 10 points and the S&amp;P 500  fell 9 points.  </p><p>  Dominic Chu has more on today's earnings.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The dive in the  Dow today was the result of a broader base selloff among 30 component  stocks, the vast majority of which finished the day lower, and the stock  that really drove much of the weakness was United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) - - the diversified industrial company behind brands like Pratt &amp; Whitney  Aircraft Engines and Carrier Air-conditioning Systems reported earnings  that beat Wall Street forecasts.  </p><p>  Overall sales, however, fell shy of expectations.  The company said  that orders from China for its Otis elevators and escalators business fell.   As a result of that and other signs of softer customer demand, it cut its  full year forecast.  </p><p>  Now, remember, the company also recently announced the sale of its  Sikorsky helicopter business to defense contractor Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT).  Another decliner on the day was Verizon (NYSE:VZ)  Communications, America's biggest telecom company by market value.  It  reported profits that beat Wall Street estimates, but it too reported sales  that missed.  While Verizon (NYSE:VZ) did manage to add more wireless phone  customers and boosted revenues for its FiOS high speed internet phone and  TV service, average sales generated per user fell, thanks to increased  competition and promotions.  That was one of the reasons it lowered  expectations for full year sales growth.  </p><p>  One of the modest bright spots came by insurance giant travelers.  It  too reported profits that beat analyst estimates on sales that fell  slightly below forecast.  The company was aided by fewer losses tied to  catastrophes that the company insures against and settlement of a prior tax  issue.  Shares were among just a handful on the Dow that rose on the day.  </p><p>  With less than a fifth of companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported  their quarterly results, a big focus will be on whether the rest of  corporate America can help drive earnings growth.  We're still very early  in earnings season.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Late today, Dow Jones reports that federal regulators are  close to approving AT&amp;T's $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV.  That would  clear the way for the biggest media deal of the past year.  The Justice  Department has already signed off on that deal.  </p><p>  Now, Citigroup (NYSE:C) is being ordered to pay about $700 million to  customers for deceptive marketing and billing tactics.  The refund will go  to more than 8 1/2 million credit card customers.  The Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau says Citi's violations took place from 2003 to 2012, and  include misrepresenting the cost and benefits of certain add-on products  like identity theft monitoring and debt protection services.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Some big banks are setting aside more money to cover bad  loans to energy companies, after oil prices dropped over the past year.   According to \"Reuters\", which cited analysts reports, that raises the  possibility that deteriorating loans could start to hurt bank earnings.</p><p>  Last week, executives from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) told investors that they are increasingly concerned about loans  to oil and gas companies.  Today, oil prices settled around $50 a barrel.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  One Wall Street strategist says the Federal Reserve had  never hiked rates when commodities had been in a pronounced downtrend.   He's Larry McDonald, head of U.S. Micro Strategy at Societe Generale.</p><p>  Larry, welcome.  Good to have you with us.  </p><p>  Is it as simple as history?  If it is, the CRB, which is the leading  commodities index, I think is down about a third over the past year, that  would say the Fed ain't going to do anything this year.  </p><p>  LARRY MCDONALD, SOCIETE GENERALE:  That's the thing, Tyler.  I mean,  the CRB is right on the 2009 recession lows, and it's very close to the  2002 recession lows.  </p><p>  So, the commodity index is right on recession levels, and you have to  remember, the United States in the '80s and '90s was about 55 percent to 60  percent of global GDP.  Today, we're 24, 25 percent.  </p><p>  So, the Fed has to look at the global economy, much more so than he  did in years past.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  That's not the first thing, Larry, that the Fed will say  they're going to look at when it comes to what they're going to do with  interest rates.  How important do you think are commodity prices to their  next move, and when do you think they're going to make that move?  </p><p>  MCDONALD:  Well, remember, they have a dual mandate, which was  established -- think about how long the dual mandate, they have to look at  unemployment and inflation.  And 10 years ago, Chinese GDP would say $2  trillion.  Now, we're up around $10 trillion or $11 trillion.  </p><p>  The dual mandate around inflation, if China's slowing and that's  hurting commodity prices, that's going to leak over eventually to core  inflation, which is part of the Fed's dual mandate, which doesn't give them  a reason to hike.  On unemployment level does, but the inflation level, if  it's ticking down a notch, certainly doesn't.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Very interesting point.  Larry McDonald, haven't heard it  made.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>  MCDONALD:  Thanks, Tyler.  Thanks, Sharon.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Larry McDonald of Societe Generale.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  And still ahead, the big hope, big opportunity and big  risks associated with developing new Alzheimer's drugs.</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Alzheimer's, it affects more than 5 million Americans  today.  It is the country's sixth most deadly disease.  And yet finding a  cure or a treatment that slows the progression of the ailment has proved  illusive.  </p><p>  But now, as Meg Tirrell reports, there appears to be new hope.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MEG TIRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The quest to  develop a drug that actually slows the course of Alzheimer's disease has  been a long one, marked by failure.  Since 1998, 123 drugs have failed in  development.  Just four were approved.  None slowed the declines in memory  loss and sinking clearly that characterized Alzheimer's.  </p><p>  This year, though, new hope has bloomed.  </p><p>  DR. MARIA CARRILLO:  The scientific community has really been given a  boost by some recent positive news of different drugs.  So, we are all very  hopeful at this time, more hopeful than we have been before.  </p><p>  TIRRELL:  Experimental medicines from Biogen and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)  are under the spotlight this week, with new data coming Wednesday at the  Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington, D.C.</p><p>  They work to remove the plaque buildups in the brain known as beta  amyloid, thought to be toxic to neurons.  Evidence from early studies shows  that removing the plaques may help steam declines in cognition, results  that still need to be supported by larger studies.  </p><p>  A successful drug could mean big business.  More than 5 million  Americans have Alzheimer's today, a number that could triple by 2050.  Some  analysts estimate the market for an Alzheimer's drug could be $20 billion a  year.  </p><p>  CARRILLO:  This disease is urgent and we need answers now.  Baby  boomers cost us about 2 percent of Medicare overall spending today.  That  number will increase almost 25 percent by 2040 if we don't stop this  disease.  </p><p>  TIRRELL:  The National Institutes of Health spent about $560 million  of its $30 billion budget on Alzheimer's disease last year, an amount some  say isn't enough to address the size of the problem.  It allocated more  than a billion and a half to heart disease, and $5 billion to cancer.  </p><p>  FRED HASSAN, WARBURG PINCUS:  We need to have a war on Alzheimer's  mentality here, a sense of urgency.</p><p>  TIRRELL:  Fred Hassan led pharmaceutical companies including Schering  Plough, which developed an Alzheimer's drug now owned by Merck (NYSE:MRK).   He calls the disease the biggest long term tsunami facing many countries</p><p>  HASSAN:  It's a moral imperative because the patients can't speak for  themselves.  That's why we as a society need to speak for the patients here  and do more.  Half a billion is not much.  </p><p>  TIRREL:  The results tomorrow could spur not just hope for medicine,  but big moves in drug maker stock prices as well.  </p><p>  Cowen estimates Biogen shares could swing $50 in either direction,  representing as much as $10 billion in market value.</p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Chipotle beats estimates but misses on one key metric.   That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>  The burrito chain said same store sales rose less than analysts were  expecting, still, it managed to top consensus on the top and bottom lines.   After the bell, shares were initially lower, but managed to turn around.   During the regular session, shares were off a fraction to $673.07.  </p><p>  GoPro saw its revenues surge by more than 70 percent, helped by  growing demand for its action cameras overseas.  Earnings in revenue topped  the street's consensus.  Shares were volatile initially in after-hours  trading.  Before the close, though, the stock was 2 percent higher to  $62.04.</p><p>  Novartis saw its shares after reporting a decline in profits.  This  was drug giant was hit by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar and weak  results from its eye care treatment business.  Yet, the CEO says he's  optimistic about the company's pipeline.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  JOE JIMENEZ, NOVARTIS CEO:  When you look at our results, the best  part about the quarter was the innovation.  You know, we just got approval  to launch our new heart failure drug called Entresto.  This is a drug  that's proven to reduce cardiovascular death by 20 percent.  We think this  is going to be a multimillion dollar drug for the company.  </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Still, shares slipped more than 2 percent to $103.71.  </p><p>  Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) swung to a loss in its most recent quarter.   The oil field services company saw revenue dropped more than 30 percent,  saying it expects tumbling oil prices will persist for the rest of the  year.  Still, sales weren't as weak as expected.  Shares rose about 2  percent to $60.64.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  And an increase in trading activity helped TD Ameritrade  (NASDAQ:AMTD) post an increase in profit.  Revenue also coming in better  than expected.  Still, shares flipped on this down day by more than 1 1/2  percent.  They close at $37.73.  </p><p>  Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) also reporting mixed quarterlies, the  strong greenback weighed on its international sales.  But the cycle maker  refused to keep pace with rivals' steep discounts.  Shares revved up a  little bit, about 5 percent to $57.67.  </p><p>  LifeLock shares were halted at one point in today's session, after the  Federal Trade Commission charged the identity theft monitoring company,  saying it failed to protect its consumers' data.  The charges say the firm  is violating the terms of a previous settlement with the agency.  LifeLock  could disagree saying it's prepared to take the case to court.  </p><p>  When shares continue trading they plunged, plunging almost 50 percent  lower on the day at $8.15.  </p><p>  CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) won a key approval for its pending deal to buy  the parent company of One West Bank.  The Office of the Comptroller  Currency gave the OK.  The Federal Reserve now has to approve the  agreement, which was announced way back in last July.  Shares were more  than 2 percent higher, they finished at $48.18.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Toshiba finds itself at the center of one of Japan's  biggest accounting scandals.  The CEO and other executives resigned after  taking responsibility for inflating profits by more than $1 billion over  several years.  At a press conference today, the executives were seen  vowing, a gesture meant to convey deep shame.  </p><p>  The company will have to restate profits back to 2008 when the cover- up began.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Uber, the fast growing, ride hailing app start-up held a  jobs tour for drivers today in New York City.  The jobs tour comes as New  York tries to crackdown on the company's expansion.  The city council is  expected to vote on a bill that would cap Uber's growth while the city  studies its impact on traffic congestion.  Uber executives say the measure  threatens its business model in one of its largest markets.  </p><p>  And Uber now valued at around $40 billion, is fast becoming a  political lightning rod.  Not just in New York, but also on the national  stage.  Republicans generally have embraced it as a symbol of disruptive  progress.  Democrats say it represents a new era of job insecurity, the  temping of America.  </p><p>  John Harwood joins us from Washington.  </p><p>  John, Uber's not only changing the business world, but also the  political world.  Why have so many politicians not just Mayor de Blasio  here in New York, latched on to it and made it the target of political  warfare?  </p><p>  JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  What do they say  about economics?  It's about creative destruction.  And when you have  creative destruction, some things get destroyed -- old models, old  incumbent firms, and in the case of Bill de Blasio in New York, yes, he is  raising the issue of traffic congestion, but the rise of Uber is also  threatening the incumbent taxi drivers who have relationships, financial  relationships with the city, with its politicians.  And so, that's not an  insignificant item.  </p><p>  Secondly, Uber represents broader changes in the national economy,  that's what Hillary Clinton and some Democrats have pointed to, although  they are not -- to be fair to Democrats -- they are not saying Uber is bad  in and of itself.  They're saying it raises some problems and underscores  some problems in the economy that we have to deal with.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  What about the Republicans, what are they saying in terms  of how Uber or companies like that are changing the economy, changing the  way people are working today?  </p><p>  HARWOOD:  Well, Republicans are casting Uber as a symbol of the 21st  century economy, and say when Democrats raise questions about it, they're  looking backwards, they're representing the past.</p><p>  For example, last week, Hillary Clinton gave a speech reflecting her  economic view in which she talked about the issue of classification, should  workers be described as contractors or as employees of firms like Uber?  </p><p>  Well, as it happened, this is a big issue with Uber, many other firms  too.  FedEx (NYSE:FDX) just paid a big settlement on that issue as well.   And Jeb Bush attacked her for being stuck in the last century.  That's a  future past debate that Republicans think they're on the right side of.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  John Harwood, thanks very much -- John Harwood  reporting tonight from Washington.  </p><p>  And coming up, one sector of the real estate market that has been red- hot for investors.  We'll tell you what it is.  You may be surprised, next.</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Here's what to watch tomorrow: earnings from Dow components  American Express (NYSE:EXPR) (NYSE:AXP), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Coca-Cola  (NYSE:KO) and more.  Housing data, including existing home sales and weekly  mortgage applications.  And that's what to watch Wednesday.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  It's a little known sector of real estate investment, but  it is growing exponentially -- data centers that serve the Cloud.  Sounds  pretty dull, right?  Well, not if you look at the product potential  involved.  </p><p>  Diana Olick has.  And she's got more on this red hot sector.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Most people think  the Cloud lives in the sky.  But it really lives here, in data centers in  downtown buildings and suburban warehouses.  As data booms, so too does the  value of all that real estate, and the REITs that own it.  </p><p>  GARY WOJTASZEK, CYRUSONE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO:  Our focus is serving the  needs of the Fortune 1,000.  That comprises about 75 percent of our  business, including nine of the Fortune 20.  So, these are the largest  companies in the world that have chosen to store their computers in our  data centers.  </p><p>  OLICK:  CyrusOne is one of five data center REITs which own two types  of property.  One is basically a big power station for servers like this  one in Sterling, Virginia.  The other is an Internet hub where the tenants  exchange data.  These are more valuable because they're generally located  in urban areas.  </p><p>  WOJTASZEK:  We're structured as a real estate investment trust.  So,  we're predominantly just a real estate company, but we are a derivative of  what's going on in all the growth and technology space.  So, everything you  hear about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Rackspace and  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and all those new technologies that are going on,  ultimately reside in the data center.  </p><p>  OLICK:  Data center REIT returns have been robust to say the least.   CyrusOne, Coresite, Digital Realty, Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), and QTS, in  particular, up 46 percent in the past year.  </p><p>  They can, however, be a tough sell because they are at the crossroads  of real estate and technology, which investors value differently.  </p><p>  JOHN BEJJANI, GREEN STREET ADVISORS:  Because data centers are subject  to all this technology risk, potential technology risk, because there's so  much more to understanding the sector than simply knowing where the real  estate is located, some investors opt not to take on the brain damage of  understanding these various risks.  </p><p>  OLICK:  And then there's demand.  Technology changes moment to moment,  and forecasting that change in terms of real estate, for both tenants and  landlords is tricky.  Developers want to capture this demand immediately.   But too much speculation could lead to too much supply.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  EPPERSON:  That's a really nice investment.  Interesting investment to  think about when you want that debate, but you're afraid of the risks  coming to the technology sector.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  And the capital returns were huge as Diana just showed out  over the past year.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Absolutely.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Quite amazing.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  Really good. </p><p>  That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sharon Epperson.   Thanks for watching.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a  great evening, everybody.  Hope you'll join us here tomorrow night.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Dow components Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fall sharply after reporting late-day profits, potentially extending today`s deep selloff in stocks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: New hope and a new generation of potential drugs that can treat a growing disease with no cure -- Alzheimer`s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: And not so fast. The one thing that could prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, July 21st.</p><p>EPPERSON: Good evening, everyone. I`m Sharon Epperson, in tonight for Sue Herera.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Welcome, everybody.</p><p>Sharon, it was a blue chip wreck on Wall Street today. More on that in a moment.</p><p>But we begin tonight with earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), two bellwether companies of the new economy, and two dominant players in the tech sector, of course. The tech sector makes up 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500, by the way.</p><p>And, tonight, both companies, which you likely own through your mutual funds and 401(k)s, well, they failed to wow investors.</p><p>First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The world`s most valuable company reported earnings of $1.85 a share. That was 4 cents better than the consensus forecast. Revenue was also slightly better at $49.6 billion.</p><p>So, what`s the problem? Well, despite selling more than 47 million iPhones in the quarter, yes, you heard me right, it was the company`s weak outlook that sent shares initially lower. A lot lower after that report.</p><p>Josh Lipton has the key takeaway from Apple`s results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big number in Apple`s latest earnings report, 47.5 million. That is the number of iPhones Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it shipped in the quarter. Now, that was up 35 percent year over year, but was also basically in line with what Wall Street expected. Analysts had forecasted that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would ship some 47.3 million iPhones.</p><p>In a conversation with Apple`s CEO Tim Cook, he told me that only 27 percent of the company`s install base had moved those newer 6 and 6-Plus models. That suggests plenty of upgrade headroom ahead. But at least in the after-hours, investors seem to be focused on that in-line number.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton in Cupertino, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: Now to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which reported better than expected earnings in revenue, but took a hit from restructuring charges and soft demand from some of its products. The world`s largest software company reported earnings of 62 cents a share, 6 cents better than estimates. The company reported revenue that was slightly more than $22 billion.</p><p>But investors wanted more, sending shares initially lower after the report.</p><p>Kayla Tausche digs deeper into the results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: From the face of it, Microsoft`s fiscal fourth quarter looks like a beat all around, the problem was, that the company`s quarter was marred by a massive write-down of its Nokia (NYSE:NOK) acquisition that happened just a few years ago. It was forecast to be a $7.6 billion write-down. It came in $8.4 billion.</p><p>When you peel away what the revenue story told us, it did look a little weaker, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) falling prey again to a stronger dollar, and some currency head winds, especially in its overseas business, namely for Japan.</p><p>When you look at its licensing, there was an expectation that as P.C. shipments declined, that installs of Windows and Office would decline as well. They declined more than the PC shipments fell by. That`s leading people to wonder what exactly is going on there.</p><p>Kayla Tausche, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) missed second quarter earnings estimates, those sales narrowly beat those forecasts. The Internet media company`s results were way down by higher spending to attract users to its Web sites in order to better compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and others. Part of Yahoo`s strategy has been to invest for its mobile platform, as a way to drive ad sales. Shares of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) fell initially after the report as you see there.</p><p>EPPERSON: Let`s turn to David Garrity now for more discussion about what`s happening in the tech sector and what it may mean for you and your money. He`s principle at GVA Research.</p><p>David, thank you for joining us.</p><p>So many people have some of these big tech names in their portfolio, either in their IRA or perhaps in the mutual funds they have in their 401k. But when we`re talking about names as big as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), is there really growth in some of these big stocks over the long term, over the next five, 10 years?</p><p>DAVID GARRITY, GVA RESEARCH: Well, Sharon, certainly, looking at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), we`re in a situation here where the expectations for smartphone growth over the next five years probably better than 15 percent on a secular rate, and we`re in a situation where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is gaining share. And as we know from the standpoint of the price points that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products are being sold at, they occupy the top of the market.</p><p>And so, from that standpoint, we think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains the dominant player in a high growth segment, if we look at the valuation on the stock, whether we back the $200 billion in cash out or not, we`re still looking at a valuation which is below an overall market multiple. And so, from that stand point, we think that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of what you`re paying for its growth remains quite attractive, might have been somewhat disappointing in the quarter that we didn`t see the announcement coming out with respect to the dividend. But the company certainly has the funds available to do that.</p><p>On the product innovation side, we would say that, you know, the iPhone 6 upgrade cycle still remains strong. It might have been disappointing in terms of the quarter, and there may some concerns about the September quarter`s guidance. But we would say, overall, the opportunity to buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on this pull back remains attractive.</p><p>MATHISEN: As a long term bet, and that is two-thumbs up for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). You can use both thumbs there, David.</p><p>How about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)? As a long term play, how does it look to you?</p><p>GARRITY: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a little bit trickier because certainly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a company which was successful in earlier generations of technology, namely around PCs. But if we look at the shift over to mobile devices, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a far distant third behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in terms of the operating system software that`s being provided.</p><p>And, obviously, Microsoft`s predicaments are somewhat underscored by the fact that we`re going to be giving away their Window`s 10 operating system software to consumers. Something they wouldn`t have done in the past.</p><p>Clearly, in the case of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a company that has substantial resources both financial and technical, but nevertheless, somewhat disconcerting to see a company go out and spend approximately $9 billion to buy a company, and then within approximately a year and a half later, write off the full value of that, as well as also fire the substantial number of employees related to that business.</p><p>So, certainly, the hope here is under new CEO, Satya Nadella, the company will find a better direction going more towards Cloud computing that will help to reignite the growth for the company, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a name that we like, might not be so aggressive on a pull back here as we might be with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>EPPERSON: All right. So, a like, not a love, on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from you, David.</p><p>Thank you for joining us. David Garrity with GVA Research.</p><p>GARRITY: Thank you, Sharon.</p><p>MATHISEN: And Sharon was just mentioning how many mutual funds own either Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>According to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), the top three mutual fund holders of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), include the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, a lot of people have that. The Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, it`s in a lot of 401(k)s, and the Fidelity ContraFund.</p><p>As for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, and the Institutional Index Fund are two of the biggest holders as is the American funds group, Washington Mutual Fund.</p><p>EPPERSON: Tyler, those weak after the bell results could extend today`s deep losses, disappointing results from a handful of Dow components before the open weighed on the blue chip index.</p><p>United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) fell 7 percent. IBM, which we told you about last night, was off nearly 6 percent. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) dropped more than 2 percent. Travelers was one of the bright spots after it reported results this morning, that dragged down the Dow, though, overall, which fell 181 points to 17,9119. The NASDAQ was off 10 points and the S&amp;P 500 fell 9 points.</p><p>Dominic Chu has more on today`s earnings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The dive in the Dow today was the result of a broader base selloff among 30 component stocks, the vast majority of which finished the day lower, and the stock that really drove much of the weakness was United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) - - the diversified industrial company behind brands like Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Engines and Carrier Air-conditioning Systems reported earnings that beat Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>Overall sales, however, fell shy of expectations. The company said that orders from China for its Otis elevators and escalators business fell. As a result of that and other signs of softer customer demand, it cut its full year forecast.</p><p>Now, remember, the company also recently announced the sale of its Sikorsky helicopter business to defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). Another decliner on the day was Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Communications, America`s biggest telecom company by market value. It reported profits that beat Wall Street estimates, but it too reported sales that missed. While Verizon (NYSE:VZ) did manage to add more wireless phone customers and boosted revenues for its FiOS high speed internet phone and TV service, average sales generated per user fell, thanks to increased competition and promotions. That was one of the reasons it lowered expectations for full year sales growth.</p><p>One of the modest bright spots came by insurance giant travelers. It too reported profits that beat analyst estimates on sales that fell slightly below forecast. The company was aided by fewer losses tied to catastrophes that the company insures against and settlement of a prior tax issue. Shares were among just a handful on the Dow that rose on the day.</p><p>With less than a fifth of companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported their quarterly results, a big focus will be on whether the rest of corporate America can help drive earnings growth. We`re still very early in earnings season.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Late today, Dow Jones reports that federal regulators are close to approving AT&amp;T`s $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV. That would clear the way for the biggest media deal of the past year. The Justice Department has already signed off on that deal.</p><p>Now, Citigroup (NYSE:C) is being ordered to pay about $700 million to customers for deceptive marketing and billing tactics. The refund will go to more than 8 1/2 million credit card customers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says Citi`s violations took place from 2003 to 2012, and include misrepresenting the cost and benefits of certain add-on products like identity theft monitoring and debt protection services.</p><p>EPPERSON: Some big banks are setting aside more money to cover bad loans to energy companies, after oil prices dropped over the past year. According to \"Reuters\", which cited analysts reports, that raises the possibility that deteriorating loans could start to hurt bank earnings.</p><p>Last week, executives from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) told investors that they are increasingly concerned about loans to oil and gas companies. Today, oil prices settled around $50 a barrel.</p><p>MATHISEN: One Wall Street strategist says the Federal Reserve had never hiked rates when commodities had been in a pronounced downtrend. He`s Larry McDonald, head of U.S. Micro Strategy at Societe Generale.</p><p>Larry, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>Is it as simple as history? If it is, the CRB, which is the leading commodities index, I think is down about a third over the past year, that would say the Fed ain`t going to do anything this year.</p><p>LARRY MCDONALD, SOCIETE GENERALE: That`s the thing, Tyler. I mean, the CRB is right on the 2009 recession lows, and it`s very close to the 2002 recession lows.</p><p>So, the commodity index is right on recession levels, and you have to remember, the United States in the `80s and `90s was about 55 percent to 60 percent of global GDP. Today, we`re 24, 25 percent.</p><p>So, the Fed has to look at the global economy, much more so than he did in years past.</p><p>EPPERSON: That`s not the first thing, Larry, that the Fed will say they`re going to look at when it comes to what they`re going to do with interest rates. How important do you think are commodity prices to their next move, and when do you think they`re going to make that move?</p><p>MCDONALD: Well, remember, they have a dual mandate, which was established -- think about how long the dual mandate, they have to look at unemployment and inflation. And 10 years ago, Chinese GDP would say $2 trillion. Now, we`re up around $10 trillion or $11 trillion.</p><p>The dual mandate around inflation, if China`s slowing and that`s hurting commodity prices, that`s going to leak over eventually to core inflation, which is part of the Fed`s dual mandate, which doesn`t give them a reason to hike. On unemployment level does, but the inflation level, if it`s ticking down a notch, certainly doesn`t.</p><p>MATHISEN: Very interesting point. Larry McDonald, haven`t heard it made. We appreciate it.</p><p>MCDONALD: Thanks, Tyler. Thanks, Sharon.</p><p>MATHISEN: Larry McDonald of Societe Generale.</p><p>EPPERSON: And still ahead, the big hope, big opportunity and big risks associated with developing new Alzheimer`s drugs.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Alzheimer`s, it affects more than 5 million Americans today. It is the country`s sixth most deadly disease. And yet finding a cure or a treatment that slows the progression of the ailment has proved illusive.</p><p>But now, as Meg Tirrell reports, there appears to be new hope.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The quest to develop a drug that actually slows the course of Alzheimer`s disease has been a long one, marked by failure. Since 1998, 123 drugs have failed in development. Just four were approved. None slowed the declines in memory loss and sinking clearly that characterized Alzheimer`s.</p><p>This year, though, new hope has bloomed.</p><p>DR. MARIA CARRILLO: The scientific community has really been given a boost by some recent positive news of different drugs. So, we are all very hopeful at this time, more hopeful than we have been before.</p><p>TIRRELL: Experimental medicines from Biogen and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) are under the spotlight this week, with new data coming Wednesday at the Alzheimer`s Association International Conference in Washington, D.C.</p><p>They work to remove the plaque buildups in the brain known as beta amyloid, thought to be toxic to neurons. Evidence from early studies shows that removing the plaques may help steam declines in cognition, results that still need to be supported by larger studies.</p><p>A successful drug could mean big business. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer`s today, a number that could triple by 2050. Some analysts estimate the market for an Alzheimer`s drug could be $20 billion a year.</p><p>CARRILLO: This disease is urgent and we need answers now. Baby boomers cost us about 2 percent of Medicare overall spending today. That number will increase almost 25 percent by 2040 if we don`t stop this disease.</p><p>TIRRELL: The National Institutes of Health spent about $560 million of its $30 billion budget on Alzheimer`s disease last year, an amount some say isn`t enough to address the size of the problem. It allocated more than a billion and a half to heart disease, and $5 billion to cancer.</p><p>FRED HASSAN, WARBURG PINCUS: We need to have a war on Alzheimer`s mentality here, a sense of urgency.</p><p>TIRRELL: Fred Hassan led pharmaceutical companies including Schering Plough, which developed an Alzheimer`s drug now owned by Merck (NYSE:MRK). He calls the disease the biggest long term tsunami facing many countries</p><p>HASSAN: It`s a moral imperative because the patients can`t speak for themselves. That`s why we as a society need to speak for the patients here and do more. Half a billion is not much.</p><p>TIRREL: The results tomorrow could spur not just hope for medicine, but big moves in drug maker stock prices as well.</p><p>Cowen estimates Biogen shares could swing $50 in either direction, representing as much as $10 billion in market value.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EPPERSON: Chipotle beats estimates but misses on one key metric. That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The burrito chain said same store sales rose less than analysts were expecting, still, it managed to top consensus on the top and bottom lines. After the bell, shares were initially lower, but managed to turn around. During the regular session, shares were off a fraction to $673.07.</p><p>GoPro saw its revenues surge by more than 70 percent, helped by growing demand for its action cameras overseas. Earnings in revenue topped the street`s consensus. Shares were volatile initially in after-hours trading. Before the close, though, the stock was 2 percent higher to $62.04.</p><p>Novartis saw its shares after reporting a decline in profits. This was drug giant was hit by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar and weak results from its eye care treatment business. Yet, the CEO says he`s optimistic about the company`s pipeline.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE JIMENEZ, NOVARTIS CEO: When you look at our results, the best part about the quarter was the innovation. You know, we just got approval to launch our new heart failure drug called Entresto. This is a drug that`s proven to reduce cardiovascular death by 20 percent. We think this is going to be a multimillion dollar drug for the company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EPPERSON: Still, shares slipped more than 2 percent to $103.71.</p><p>Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) swung to a loss in its most recent quarter. The oil field services company saw revenue dropped more than 30 percent, saying it expects tumbling oil prices will persist for the rest of the year. Still, sales weren`t as weak as expected. Shares rose about 2 percent to $60.64.</p><p>MATHISEN: And an increase in trading activity helped TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) post an increase in profit. Revenue also coming in better than expected. Still, shares flipped on this down day by more than 1 1/2 percent. They close at $37.73.</p><p>Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) also reporting mixed quarterlies, the strong greenback weighed on its international sales. But the cycle maker refused to keep pace with rivals` steep discounts. Shares revved up a little bit, about 5 percent to $57.67.</p><p>LifeLock shares were halted at one point in today`s session, after the Federal Trade Commission charged the identity theft monitoring company, saying it failed to protect its consumers` data. The charges say the firm is violating the terms of a previous settlement with the agency. LifeLock could disagree saying it`s prepared to take the case to court.</p><p>When shares continue trading they plunged, plunging almost 50 percent lower on the day at $8.15.</p><p>CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) won a key approval for its pending deal to buy the parent company of One West Bank. The Office of the Comptroller Currency gave the OK. The Federal Reserve now has to approve the agreement, which was announced way back in last July. Shares were more than 2 percent higher, they finished at $48.18.</p><p>EPPERSON: Toshiba finds itself at the center of one of Japan`s biggest accounting scandals. The CEO and other executives resigned after taking responsibility for inflating profits by more than $1 billion over several years. At a press conference today, the executives were seen vowing, a gesture meant to convey deep shame.</p><p>The company will have to restate profits back to 2008 when the cover- up began.</p><p>MATHISEN: Uber, the fast growing, ride hailing app start-up held a jobs tour for drivers today in New York City. The jobs tour comes as New York tries to crackdown on the company`s expansion. The city council is expected to vote on a bill that would cap Uber`s growth while the city studies its impact on traffic congestion. Uber executives say the measure threatens its business model in one of its largest markets.</p><p>And Uber now valued at around $40 billion, is fast becoming a political lightning rod. Not just in New York, but also on the national stage. Republicans generally have embraced it as a symbol of disruptive progress. Democrats say it represents a new era of job insecurity, the temping of America.</p><p>John Harwood joins us from Washington.</p><p>John, Uber`s not only changing the business world, but also the political world. Why have so many politicians not just Mayor de Blasio here in New York, latched on to it and made it the target of political warfare?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: What do they say about economics? It`s about creative destruction. And when you have creative destruction, some things get destroyed -- old models, old incumbent firms, and in the case of Bill de Blasio in New York, yes, he is raising the issue of traffic congestion, but the rise of Uber is also threatening the incumbent taxi drivers who have relationships, financial relationships with the city, with its politicians. And so, that`s not an insignificant item.</p><p>Secondly, Uber represents broader changes in the national economy, that`s what Hillary Clinton and some Democrats have pointed to, although they are not -- to be fair to Democrats -- they are not saying Uber is bad in and of itself. They`re saying it raises some problems and underscores some problems in the economy that we have to deal with.</p><p>EPPERSON: What about the Republicans, what are they saying in terms of how Uber or companies like that are changing the economy, changing the way people are working today?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, Republicans are casting Uber as a symbol of the 21st century economy, and say when Democrats raise questions about it, they`re looking backwards, they`re representing the past.</p><p>For example, last week, Hillary Clinton gave a speech reflecting her economic view in which she talked about the issue of classification, should workers be described as contractors or as employees of firms like Uber?</p><p>Well, as it happened, this is a big issue with Uber, many other firms too. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) just paid a big settlement on that issue as well. And Jeb Bush attacked her for being stuck in the last century. That`s a future past debate that Republicans think they`re on the right side of.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. John Harwood, thanks very much -- John Harwood reporting tonight from Washington.</p><p>And coming up, one sector of the real estate market that has been red-hot for investors. We`ll tell you what it is. You may be surprised, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>EPPERSON: Here`s what to watch tomorrow: earnings from Dow components American Express (NYSE:EXPR) (NYSE:AXP), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Coca- Cola (NYSE:KO) and more. Housing data, including existing home sales and weekly mortgage applications. And that`s what to watch Wednesday.</p><p>MATHISEN: It`s a little known sector of real estate investment, but it is growing exponentially -- data centers that serve the Cloud. Sounds pretty dull, right? Well, not if you look at the product potential involved.</p><p>Diana Olick has. And she`s got more on this red hot sector.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Most people think the Cloud lives in the sky. But it really lives here, in data centers in downtown buildings and suburban warehouses. As data booms, so too does the value of all that real estate, and the REITs that own it.</p><p>GARY WOJTASZEK, CYRUSONE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: Our focus is serving the needs of the Fortune 1,000. That comprises about 75 percent of our business, including nine of the Fortune 20. So, these are the largest companies in the world that have chosen to store their computers in our data centers.</p><p>OLICK: CyrusOne is one of five data center REITs which own two types of property. One is basically a big power station for servers like this one in Sterling, Virginia. The other is an Internet hub where the tenants exchange data. These are more valuable because they`re generally located in urban areas.</p><p>WOJTASZEK: We`re structured as a real estate investment trust. So, we`re predominantly just a real estate company, but we are a derivative of what`s going on in all the growth and technology space. So, everything you hear about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Rackspace and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and all those new technologies that are going on, ultimately reside in the data center.</p><p>OLICK: Data center REIT returns have been robust to say the least. CyrusOne, Coresite, Digital Realty, Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), and QTS, in particular, up 46 percent in the past year.</p><p>They can, however, be a tough sell because they are at the crossroads of real estate and technology, which investors value differently.</p><p>JOHN BEJJANI, GREEN STREET ADVISORS: Because data centers are subject to all this technology risk, potential technology risk, because there`s so much more to understanding the sector than simply knowing where the real estate is located, some investors opt not to take on the brain damage of understanding these various risks.</p><p>OLICK: And then there`s demand.

The bar  was high, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) parent alphabet blew past it, moving its  value ever closer to $1 trillion.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Moving up.  In the market for  a bigger home?  Why it may make financial sense to also keep the old one.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> GRIFFETH:  Less is more.  Does working four days a week instead of five  make you a more productive employee?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday,  July the </p><p> HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> Alphabet is the first of the big tech companies to report earnings and it  did not disappoint.  Google's parent company easily surpassed estimates,  thanks to strong sales of online advertisements and a decline in costs.  </p><p> So, let's get right those numbers for you.  Alphabet earned $11.75 a share.   The estimate was for a profit of $9.59.  Revenue climbed 25 percent to more  than $32 billion.  Investors like that report, sending shares higher in  initial afterhours trading.  </p><p> Josh Lipton has more on Alphabet's quarter.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A big number that  investors make a beeline for in Alphabet's report, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  Properties, that came at a $23.3 billion, a jump of 26 percent.  Aaron  Kessler of Raymond James says that's important because that reflects the  growth of search and YouTube, the core higher margin drivers of the  business.  </p><p> Also, better cost controls in the quarter.  TAC or what Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) pays as distribution partners came in at $3 billion, a  smaller increase, Kessler says, relative to recent quarters.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Joining us now to talk more about Alphabet's earnings beat, and  what he's expecting from other big tech names when they report later this  week.  Daniel Flax is senior tech analyst at Neuberger Berman.</p><p> Daniel, thanks for joining us tonight. </p><p> DANIEL FLAX, NEUBERGER BERMAN SENIOR TECH ANALYST:  Great to see you both.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Alphabet, is such a far-flung company.   Where did you find strength?  What did you like about this report?  </p><p> FLAX:  I think, Bill, what was notable was that there was strength across a  variety of areas.  Core search was healthy.  YouTube was strong, we're  seeing the company make traction in initiatives like the Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) cloud platform.  And so, when you put all that together, the  company has built a series of platforms that we think will enable them to  drive very solid revenue growth over the next few years.  So, we liked it  overall.  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, the other two companies that we're going to be watching  closely are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  But let's take  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  You mentioned the fact that for Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), there was -- there was gains basically in a lot of different  areas of the company.  Do you expect the same types of results for Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and a positive result?  </p><p> FLAX:  We do expect solid revenue growth from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and we  expect them on their earnings call and we'll obviously see how the data  comes in to really spend time talking about how they're trying to improve  safeguards around data, and privacy that, of course, is an issue that all  of these companies face.  But given the scrutiny around Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), we'll look for a little bit more insight on that later this  week.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  The other FANG stock, we mentioned Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  You  either love it or you hate it.  You want it to turn a profit finally at  some point.  But, boy, it sure is getting into a number of areas in retail  these days.  </p><p> What are you expecting from them this time around?  </p><p> FLAX:  We expect to see solid revenue new growth.  And what we'll be  looking for in addition to the core e-commerce platform is really to gain  additional insight into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, which is their  cloud platform, and also some of their newer initiatives, for example like  advertising.  And so, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is I think we appreciate -- many  of us appreciate is an incredibly disruptive company.  And so, we'll look,  besides for the data, to get a little more insight on some of their newer  elements of their strategy later this week.  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, one of the things that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had to  deal with and has created some volatility in its stock is the discussion of  possible antitrust issues.  Sometimes it's being tweeted out by the  president, sometimes it's mentioned by Wall Street analysts and the like.   Do you expect any of that to be addressed?  And do you view that as a  problem for the company if indeed those discussion goes a little further?  </p><p> FLAX:  Well, I think that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and frankly all of these  companies are going to be facing a lot more in the way of scrutiny and  regulation over the next several years.  And that's as much a function of  their size as the fact that they're playing an increasingly large impact on  the economy.  And so, while I do think it is a headline risk and if the  company didn't take action that it could become a larger risk, but what  we've seen from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in this example is that they're really  trying to get ahead of some of these issues and doing their best to really  attack them head on.  </p><p> And so, we expect that to remain part of the story.  It is a risk.  But we  think if they continue to innovate, to execute and to invest in building a  robust platform over the next several years, that they can continue to  drive significant shareholder value over the medium to long term.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Daniel Flax with Neuberger Berman -- again, thanks for joining  us tonight.</p><p> FLAX:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  On Wall Street, the Nasdaq closed at yet another record and that  was before the results from Alphabet were released.  But lingering concerns  outside of the tech sector capped the gains.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average fell 13 points to 25,044, the Nasdaq added 21, and the S&amp;P 500 was  up five.  </p><p> The Nasdaq may be at a record but it's been about six months since the  broader market last peaked.  So, where does the bull market stands?  </p><p> Well, Mike Santoli takes a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This week marked six  months in stocks last hit a record high.  If it's still a bull market, if  it goes half a year without gaining altitude, and if so, what might get it  flying again?</p><p> The S&amp;P 500 remains more than 2 percent below its January 26th record,  having recovered most of the 12 percent February drop in a labored grind.   Most corrections within bull markets are fully recouped in less time, but  the prolonged sideways action in recent months might say more about the  exuberant nature of that January peak than about the underlying strength of  the market.  Stocks had rushed to a 7 percent gain in less than weeks in  January, a pace unsustainable in any environment.  </p><p> But the performance for the year has been perfectly respectable.  The S&amp;P  500 is up close to 5 percent, and on track for better than a 10 percent  annual return, including dividends.  This might not seem all that  impressive given the 20 percent corporate profit growth in the first half  of the year, but flattish stock prices and rising earnings have made the  market appear far less expense then at the peak with the S&amp;P's valuation  back in line with its five-year average.  </p><p> It's not unusual for stocks to stall at a trading range for months  following a very strong low volatility year such as 2017 was.  There was a  similar pattern of grudging gains and frequent pull-backs in the market  back in 2014 in fact, also a midterm election year that followed a powerful  rally the year before.  Of course, a few big concerns specific to the  current moment continue to restrain the market despite stellar corporate  results.  The intensifying trade conflict threatens to hurt U.S. exports,  raise prices and sap CEO confidence.  </p><p> The Federal Reserve seems intent on lifting interest rates well into next  year, on top of seven hikes since 2015, and there are nagging worries that  the economic cycle is nearing a later stage.  It's important to remember  though that the later part of a cycle can last years, even if that's where  we are, and it's hard to find many leading indicators of recession that  suggest a downturn is imminent even as the boost from tax cuts recedes, all  of which indicates that the bull market is showing some wear and tear, but  probably has not seen its ultimate peak just yet.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And then there's housing, which is clearly a key part of the  economy.  It may be starting to stumble.  A new report out this morning  said that existing home sales fell 0.6 percent in June, its third straight  monthly decline.  Tight supply and high prices have been turning off  potential homebuyers, especially those first-time buyers. </p><p> And for those who want to move up to a bigger home, it's becoming  increasingly difficult to find something affordable.  But there's one  strategy that's becoming more and more popular.</p><p> Diana Olick tells us what it is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Liz Chamberlain is  already feeling right at home in her new place in suburban Maryland, she  and her husband didn't want to leave the city but finding a larger house in  D.C. for their growing family was just too expensive, even this home was a  challenge.  </p><p> LIZ CHAMBERLAIN, HOMEOWNER AND LANDLORD:  We bid on four houses and two of  them was kind of crazy into crazy bidding wars.</p><p> OLICK:  In order to afford the bigger home, they needed to rent out the  home they already owned in an increasingly trendy neighborhood on Capitol  Hill.  </p><p> CHAMBERLAIN:  We've ran the numbers.  We -- I literally made a spreadsheet  and ran all the different options like we stay in D.C.  </p><p> We run out, we sell our house, and do you see all the different options.   And it made the most financial sense for us to keep our house in D.C., rent  it out and buy here.</p><p> OLICK:  Home prices hit yet another record high in June, according to the  National Association of Realtors and the supply of homes for sale continues  to hover near record lows.  Part of that is because investors scooped up  distressed homes during the foreclosure crisis, turning about 5 million of  them into new single-family rentals.  Demand for homes both to own and rent  is still very strong as the largest generation millennials ages into  marriage and family.</p><p> Of course, not everyone can afford a down payment on a second home, but  there are low down payment options and it may actually be getting easier  now to get a second mortgage, especially as interest rates rise and lenders  are looking for more business.</p><p> LAURENCE YUN, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS CHIEF ECONOMIST:  They are  looking at the possibility making more loans and prior say several years  ago during the depths of the housing crisis, there would have been  extremely strict.  But now, they're looking at the rental income as a  mitigating factor for carrying two mortgages.</p><p> OLICK:  Being a landlord does mean additional responsibility.</p><p> CHAMBERLAIN:  Certainly having an umbrella policy is a really good idea to  make sure you're covered insurance wise and then I do think living in the  house and really knowing it and making sure it's in good shape before you  leave and rent it out is probably one of the best things you can do.</p><p> OLICK:  Because the last thing you want as a new homeowner is old problems.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Gus Faucher joins us now to discuss his outlook for the housing  market.  He is the chief economist at PNC.</p><p> Welcome back, Gus.  Great to see you again.</p><p> What do you make of --  </p><p> GUS FAUCHER, PNCCHIEF ECONOMIST:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  -- what do you make of where we stand right now in the housing  market?  It certainly is, you know, a fascinating phenomenon from an  economic standpoint, but with the decline in housing sales for the last  couple of months, is it a sign that the markets peaked and is going down,  or just slowing down?</p><p> FAUCHER:  I think it's an indication that the market is just slowing down.   Inventories have been very tight.  So, that's really constrained home  sales.  We saw sales fall in June particularly in the south and west where  markets have been tighter.  So, I think now that inventories are rising  again, I think that there are more homes for sale that will bring more  buyers into the market and I'd expect to see sales increase through the  rest of this year.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  We need home builders to build more homes, especially for the  first-time buyer.  We need more home owners who plan to sell to put their  houses on the market so we get more inventory out there.  Is that going to  happen?  What's it going to take do you think down the road?</p><p> FAUCHER:  Right.  You know, we are starting to see more inventories on the  existing side and we're also starting to see improvements in supply on the  new home side.  There are some constraints in home construction.  There's a  shortage of construction workers in some parts of the country.  There's a  shortage of developable land, but I think we're seeing price gains of about  5 percent or 6 percent a year.  That's going to lead to more people putting  their homes on the market, that's going to lead to more home building, and  so, we'll eventually see supply catch up to demand.</p><p> HERERA:  What about the interest rate phenomenon?  I mean, we did see  interest rates tick up pretty decidedly in today's trading session, and  that will translate into higher mortgage rates.  Is -- are we at the level  of interest rates on mortgages, the 30-year traditional mortgages, where it  will slow down demand, or maybe not yet?</p><p> FAUCHER:  You know, I think that the higher mortgage rates that we've seen  over the past couple of years have weighed slightly on demand.  That being  said, there's still a lot of positives for housing demand.  We have good  job growth.  We have rising incomes.  We have better access to credit.  </p><p> And so, I think you put it all together that higher mortgage rates are a  bit of a headwind, but I still think there's some good tailwinds for the  housing market.  And so, I would expect that we'll see sales increase over  the second half of this year.</p><p> HERERA:  All right.  Gus, thank you so much.  Gus Faucher with PNC  Financial Group.</p><p> Bill?</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p> We begin tonight with Papa John's which was downgraded to sell from hold at  Stifel Nicolaus.  The analysts there cites what he calls a toxic culture at  that company that could hurt the prospects for a turnaround or maybe even a  buyout.  Separately, Papa John's said that its board had a today's  shareholder rights plan that would act against any move by its founder to  take a bigger stake.</p><p> At this point, John Schnatter and his affiliates already owned just over 29  percent of the company.  Price target now $38, shares dropped by 9 percent  today to $46.56.</p><p> General Electric (NYSE:GE) was downgraded to hold from buy at Argos  Research, with the analyst there saying that GE may continue to struggle to  meet the low end of its 2018 earnings guidance.  The firm calls the outlet  for GE's power business bleak.  The stock dropped about 1 percent today at  $12.99.</p><p> HERERA:  Walgreens Boots Alliance was downgraded to market performed from  outperform over at Cowen.  The analyst says Walgreens is poorly positioned  in the move towards value-based care.  The price target is $71.  The stock  rose a fraction to $65.34.</p><p> Philip Morris was downgraded to hold from buy at Societe Generale.  The  analyst their cites concerns over reduced risk products, which are  primarily smokeless tobacco products.  The price target is $90.  The stock  fell 1 percent to $83.22.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, the roadmap for Fiat Chrysler as a new CEO takes  over.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Mexico reportedly wants to reach a NAFTA deal with the White  House by the end of August and today, President Trump hinted that something  could be coming soon.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're talking to Mexico on  NAFTA, and I think we're going to have something worked out.  The new  president, terrific person, I spoke to him at length.  I want to call --  did a great job, got a tremendous vote and they have a lot of confidence in  him in Mexico and that's good.  But we're talking to them about doing  something very dramatic, very positive for both countries.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  The dollar fell against the Mexican peso when those comments  were made this afternoon.</p><p> HERERA:  Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) was one of the first companies to get caught  up in a trade spat, which is why tonight's quarterly results are being so  closely watched.  The appliance maker earned $3.20 a share, which was below  expectations.  Revenue fell to about $5 billion, also below estimates.  And  the stock took a hit in initial after-hours trading as costs for the  company climb.</p><p> Contessa Brewer takes a look at the issues that that company is facing.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CONTESSA BREWER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Whirlpool  (NYSE:WHR) is blaming it's disappointing performance in Europe, the Middle  East and Africa, and it's promising to take strong action to improve  operational execution.  But it lowered its full-year guidance and shares  plummeted more than 8 percent in after-market trading.  The second quarter  earnings miss shows Whirlpools struggling in spite of the 20 percent tariff  on imported washing machines from its foreign competitors.  </p><p> Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) felt Korean makers LG and Samsung were taking them to  the cleaners and pressed Washington for more protection.  The 20 percent  washer tariffs announced in January were among the first the Trump  administration slapped on imports.  There was an immediate impact.  The  share price shot up.  Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) added 200 employees to its  factory in Clyde, Ohio, and LG announced it would hike prices of its  washing machines by roughly $50.  </p><p> But customers started seeing costs of washers and dryers climb across the  board, up 20 percent according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the  biggest monthly increases we've seen since the agency started keeping  track.  </p><p> Whirlpools told investors that it's paying substantially more for raw  materials in part because of tariffs on steel and aluminum.  Tuesday, CEO  Marc Bitzer will hold his earnings call and analysts may press him to  explain how the trade war has affected the company in the second quarter  and what competitive impact LG's and Samsung's investments in the United  States will have on Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR).</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Contessa Brewer.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) gets a lift from Marvel toy sales and that's  where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p> The toy maker reported a decline in profit and revenue largely due to the  loss of its main retail partner Toys \"R\" Us.  But the results still came in  ahead of Wall Street's lowered expectations.  They were helped by strength  in the company's entertainment and licensing division, as well as strong  demand for Marvel and Beyblade branded products.  Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) also  said it plans to move some of its production out of China due to the  ongoing tariff fight.  Shares jumped more than 12 percent today to $106.04,  making it the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 today.</p><p> Then there's the other company.  Revenues came in stronger than expected to  oilfield services provider Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) as production ramped up  in the U.S.  But the beat was overshadowed by concerns that demand is  slowing for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) services in the Permian basin.  Shares  fell by 8 percent on the day to $41.54, making it the worst performing  stock in the S&amp;P today.</p><p> Higher selling prices helped egg producer Cal-Maine's profit rise but a  decline in sales volume did cause total revenue to disappoint.  Company  also warned that the market may see additional pricing pressures due to  excess supply.  Shares were off 2 percent to $44.95.</p><p> HERERA:  Health care services provider LifePoint said it has agreed to be  bought and taken private by the private equity firm Apollo Global  Management.  The price tag nearly $6 billion.  LifePoint Health will merge  with another Apollo-owned hospital company which will expand its operations   LifePoint Health rose 35 percent to $64.90.</p><p> Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) said the stronger dollar would hurt margins  and cut into its full-year profits.  The industrial products maker also  missed quarterly revenue expectations the shares were off 7 percent to  $136.26.</p><p> And after the bell, TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) said that cost cuts and  higher trading revenues helped to offset a decline in new client assets.   The brokerage firm topped both earnings and revenue expectations.  The  shares were volatile in after hours, but they finished the regular session  up nearly 3 percent to $59.06. GRIFFETH:  The longtime CEO of Fiat Chrysler and Ferrari has suddenly been  replaced.  The company's announced over the weekend that Sergio  Marchionne's health rapidly deteriorated over the past week, following  shoulder surgery earlier this month.  Shares of both Fiat Chrysler and  Ferrari were lower as the automakers now faced questions about their  futures with new leaders behind the wheel.  </p><p> Phil LeBeau has more on this story.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With his trademark  black sweater and a maverick style that took Chrysler from bankruptcy to  global growth, Sergio Marchionne's tenure as CEO of Fiat Chrysler was a  huge success.  So, the news that he will not be returning to work due to a  rapid decline in his health is a kick in the gut for a company that he led  for almost a decade.  </p><p> The chairman of Fiat Chrysler said: Sergio taught us to think differently  and to have the courage to change, often in unconventional ways, always  acting with a sense of responsibility for the companies and their people.</p><p> PAUL INGRASSIA, REVS INSTITUTE EDITOR:  His legacy is remarkable.  I think  it's hard to name any other CEO really in any other industry that's  compiled his record over the last 10 or 15 years.</p><p> LEBEAU:  FCA's new CEO is Mike Manley, a longtime lieutenant of  Marchionne's, who turns Jeep into the most profitable part of the business.   Under Manly, Jeep's global sales skyrocketed to almost 1.4 million vehicles  last year, and he's long been considered an heir apparent for the CEO job.</p><p> REBECCA LINDLAND, KELLEY BLUE BOOK:  Anybody taking over for a position  that Sergio filled has incredible expectations put upon them.  This is a  man -- you know, Sergio is just iconic both in the industry throughout  Italy, throughout Canada, really on a global basis.</p><p> LEBEAU:  While Fiat Chrysler's future built around trucks and SUVs appears  clear-cut, it may be a bumpier road for Ferrari.  Marchionne brought the  luxury brand public and its stocks surged under his vision of expanding  Ferrari sales, including adding an SUV.  </p><p> Now, Ferrari board member Camilleri takes the reins.  He may know the  luxury automaker, but will he have the same magic touch as Marchionne.</p><p> Sergio as nearly everyone in the auto industry refers to him was not a  perfect CEO and not everything he tried panned out.  For example, Fiat  compact cars never really caught on here in the United States.  Still,  Marchionne leaves FCA in far better shape than when he took over.</p><p> Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, why a four-day workweek could be good for business.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  So, what do you think?  Could a four-day workweek be in your  future?  Well, one New Zealand firm called Perpetual Guardian tried it out  for two months and it resulted in what they said was greater productivity,  lower stress levels, improve work/life balance, and higher team engagement  levels, all by working just one fewer day a week.  So, is it in our future  and will it make us more productive?</p><p> Joining us tonight, Marc Cenedella is CEO of the job search site Ladders  here to talk about that,</p><p> Marc, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p> MARC CENEDELLA, LADDERS CEO:  Thanks so much for having me.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  I was just reading today that it was in 1940 that the five-day  workweek was mandated here in the United States.  Before then, six days was  more common.</p><p> CENEDELLA:  Things have gone pretty well since then.</p><p> GRIFFEH:  Yes, OK.</p><p> So, here we are 75 years later, are we efficient enough to move now to a  four-day workweek?  What do you think?</p><p> CENEDELLA:  Well, this is part of a bigger trend where companies are  measuring the output of their workers rather than the amount of time they  put on the clock.  So, I think we might see a lot more of this in the  future.</p><p> HERERA:  Does it also come down to what the employee wants in terms of  work-life balance?  You know, depending on what part of the country you  live in, it can cost you a lot of money for housing and things like that?   How much of that is part of this trend?</p><p> CENEDELLA:  A huge part.  So, at Ladders, we focus on kind of 100k-plus  jobs, and we see at the higher end of the workforce that what people really  feel drives them is the ability to have control, the ability to be creative  and the ability to feel like they're contributing to something that they  believe in.</p><p> So, the more that companies are able to put the onus on workers to you have  to produce in whatever amount of time it takes you to produce and we're not  going to watch the clock --  </p><p> GRIFFETH:   Right.</p><p> CENEDELLA:  -- the more powerful they're going to be.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  You know, I would think it would be more it would be better in  the technology industry makes more sense there than it would in a  manufacturing.  But interestingly, again, I'm doing reading today, and I  read it was the Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Company in 1926, was one of the first  companies to introduce the five-day workweek.  So, could this work for all  industries do you think?</p><p> CENEDELLA:  I think what it requires that it's a really measurable business  or a really measurable industry where it's very clear that the output of  the white-collar workforce or the blue-collar work force should be X units  of whatever it is they're producing.  In the case of perpetual guardians,  there are wills and state company.  So, it's pretty easy to measure how  many wills or estates you've handled this week.  </p><p> So, the more you can measure the output and weigh what people do in a week,  the less you need to mandate the amount of time they spend on the clock.</p><p> HERERA:  I know this is kind of a broad brush question, but what's your gut  feeling as to how receptive most employers are to the concept?</p><p> CENEDELLA:  So, everybody feel -- I think a lot of employers feel that at  first, this is just going to reduce my output, it's going to reduce my  productivity.  But in a similar vein, remote work has become a big part of  the American workforce over the last five or ten years, and there we're  starting to see a whole companies move to being remote workforces because  they put in place technology and systems that allow them to measure the  output.  </p><p> And I think as long as employers feel comfortable that they can measure the  output right of their employees, the more comfortable they'll feel with  being more flexible on the time that they do it.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Marc, fascinating conversation, appreciate your thoughts  tonight.</p><p> Marc Cenedella with Ladders joining us tonight.</p><p> HERERA:  All right.  Here's a final look at the day on Wall Street.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13 points, Nasdaq added 21, S&amp;P 500 was  up five.  </p><p> And that'll do it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Welcome back, by the way.</p><p> HERERA:  Thank you.  Good to be back.  Missed you.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening we're here all five  days this week.</p><p> HERERA:  All five days.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  See you tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Google`s parent company easily surpassed estimates, thanks to strong sales of online advertisements and a decline in costs.</p><p>So, let`s get right those numbers for you. Alphabet earned $11.75 a share. The estimate was for a profit of $9.59. Revenue climbed 25 percent to more than $32 billion. Investors like that report, sending shares higher in initial afterhours trading.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more on Alphabet`s quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A big number that investors make a beeline for in Alphabet`s report, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Properties, that came at a $23.3 billion, a jump of 26 percent. Aaron Kessler of Raymond James says that`s important because that reflects the growth of search and YouTube, the core higher margin drivers of the business.</p><p>Also, better cost controls in the quarter. TAC or what Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) pays as distribution partners came in at $3 billion, a smaller increase, Kessler says, relative to recent quarters.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Joining us now to talk more about Alphabet`s earnings beat, and what he`s expecting from other big tech names when they report later this week. Daniel Flax is senior tech analyst at Neuberger Berman.</p><p>Daniel, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>DANIEL FLAX, NEUBERGER BERMAN SENIOR TECH ANALYST: Great to see you both.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Alphabet, is such a far-flung company. Where did you find strength? What did you like about this report?</p><p>FLAX: I think, Bill, what was notable was that there was strength across a variety of areas. Core search was healthy. YouTube was strong, we`re seeing the company make traction in initiatives like the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) cloud platform. And so, when you put all that together, the company has built a series of platforms that we think will enable them to drive very solid revenue growth over the next few years. So, we liked it overall.</p><p>HERERA: You know, the other two companies that we`re going to be watching closely are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). But let`s take Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). You mentioned the fact that for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), there was -- there was gains basically in a lot of different areas of the company. Do you expect the same types of results for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and a positive result?</p><p>FLAX: We do expect solid revenue growth from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and we expect them on their earnings call and we`ll obviously see how the data comes in to really spend time talking about how they`re trying to improve safeguards around data, and privacy that, of course, is an issue that all of these companies face. But given the scrutiny around Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), we`ll look for a little bit more insight on that later this week.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The other FANG stock, we mentioned Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). You either love it or you hate it. You want it to turn a profit finally at some point. But, boy, it sure is getting into a number of areas in retail these days.</p><p>What are you expecting from them this time around?</p><p>FLAX: We expect to see solid revenue new growth. And what we`ll be looking for in addition to the core e-commerce platform is really to gain additional insight into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, which is their cloud platform, and also some of their newer initiatives, for example like advertising. And so, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is I think we appreciate -- many of us appreciate is an incredibly disruptive company. And so, we`ll look, besides for the data, to get a little more insight on some of their newer elements of their strategy later this week.</p><p>HERERA: You know, one of the things that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had to deal with and has created some volatility in its stock is the discussion of possible antitrust issues. Sometimes it`s being tweeted out by the president, sometimes it`s mentioned by Wall Street analysts and the like. Do you expect any of that to be addressed? And do you view that as a problem for the company if indeed those discussion goes a little further?</p><p>FLAX: Well, I think that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and frankly all of these companies are going to be facing a lot more in the way of scrutiny and regulation over the next several years. And that`s as much a function of their size as the fact that they`re playing an increasingly large impact on the economy. And so, while I do think it is a headline risk and if the company didn`t take action that it could become a larger risk, but what we`ve seen from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in this example is that they`re really trying to get ahead of some of these issues and doing their best to really attack them head on.</p><p>And so, we expect that to remain part of the story. It is a risk. But we think if they continue to innovate, to execute and to invest in building a robust platform over the next several years, that they can continue to drive significant shareholder value over the medium to long term.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Daniel Flax with Neuberger Berman -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>FLAX: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: On Wall Street, the Nasdaq closed at yet another record and that was before the results from Alphabet were released. But lingering concerns outside of the tech sector capped the gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13 points to 25,044, the Nasdaq added 21, and the S&amp;P 500 was up five.</p><p>The Nasdaq may be at a record but it`s been about six months since the broader market last peaked. So, where does the bull market stands?</p><p>Well, Mike Santoli takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This week marked six months in stocks last hit a record high. If it`s still a bull market, if it goes half a year without gaining altitude, and if so, what might get it flying again?</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 remains more than 2 percent below its January 26th record, having recovered most of the 12 percent February drop in a labored grind. Most corrections within bull markets are fully recouped in less time, but the prolonged sideways action in recent months might say more about the exuberant nature of that January peak than about the underlying strength of the market. Stocks had rushed to a 7 percent gain in less than weeks in January, a pace unsustainable in any environment.</p><p>But the performance for the year has been perfectly respectable. The S&amp;P 500 is up close to 5 percent, and on track for better than a 10 percent annual return, including dividends. This might not seem all that impressive given the 20 percent corporate profit growth in the first half of the year, but flattish stock prices and rising earnings have made the market appear far less expense then at the peak with the S&amp;P`s valuation back in line with its five-year average.</p><p>It`s not unusual for stocks to stall at a trading range for months following a very strong low volatility year such as 2017 was. There was a similar pattern of grudging gains and frequent pull-backs in the market back in 2014 in fact, also a midterm election year that followed a powerful rally the year before. Of course, a few big concerns specific to the current moment continue to restrain the market despite stellar corporate results. The intensifying trade conflict threatens to hurt U.S. exports, raise prices and sap CEO confidence.</p><p>The Federal Reserve seems intent on lifting interest rates well into next year, on top of seven hikes since 2015, and there are nagging worries that the economic cycle is nearing a later stage. It`s important to remember though that the later part of a cycle can last years, even if that`s where we are, and it`s hard to find many leading indicators of recession that suggest a downturn is imminent even as the boost from tax cuts recedes, all of which indicates that the bull market is showing some wear and tear, but probably has not seen its ultimate peak just yet.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And then there`s housing, which is clearly a key part of the economy. It may be starting to stumble. A new report out this morning said that existing home sales fell 0.6 percent in June, its third straight monthly decline. Tight supply and high prices have been turning off potential homebuyers, especially those first-time buyers.</p><p>And for those who want to move up to a bigger home, it`s becoming increasingly difficult to find something affordable. But there`s one strategy that`s becoming more and more popular.</p><p>Diana Olick tells us what it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Liz Chamberlain is already feeling right at home in her new place in suburban Maryland, she and her husband didn`t want to leave the city but finding a larger house in D.C. for their growing family was just too expensive, even this home was a challenge.</p><p>LIZ CHAMBERLAIN, HOMEOWNER AND LANDLORD: We bid on four houses and two of them was kind of crazy into crazy bidding wars.</p><p>OLICK: In order to afford the bigger home, they needed to rent out the home they already owned in an increasingly trendy neighborhood on Capitol Hill.</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN: We`ve ran the numbers. We -- I literally made a spreadsheet and ran all the different options like we stay in D.C.</p><p>We run out, we sell our house, and do you see all the different options. And it made the most financial sense for us to keep our house in D.C., rent it out and buy here.</p><p>OLICK: Home prices hit yet another record high in June, according to the National Association of Realtors and the supply of homes for sale continues to hover near record lows. Part of that is because investors scooped up distressed homes during the foreclosure crisis, turning about 5 million of them into new single-family rentals. Demand for homes both to own and rent is still very strong as the largest generation millennials ages into marriage and family.</p><p>Of course, not everyone can afford a down payment on a second home, but there are low down payment options and it may actually be getting easier now to get a second mortgage, especially as interest rates rise and lenders are looking for more business.</p><p>LAURENCE YUN, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS CHIEF ECONOMIST: They are looking at the possibility making more loans and prior say several years ago during the depths of the housing crisis, there would have been extremely strict. But now, they`re looking at the rental income as a mitigating factor for carrying two mortgages.</p><p>OLICK: Being a landlord does mean additional responsibility.</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN: Certainly having an umbrella policy is a really good idea to make sure you`re covered insurance wise and then I do think living in the house and really knowing it and making sure it`s in good shape before you leave and rent it out is probably one of the best things you can do.</p><p>OLICK: Because the last thing you want as a new homeowner is old problems.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Gus Faucher joins us now to discuss his outlook for the housing market. He is the chief economist at PNC.</p><p>Welcome back, Gus. Great to see you again.</p><p>What do you make of --</p><p>GUS FAUCHER, PNCCHIEF ECONOMIST: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: -- what do you make of where we stand right now in the housing market? It certainly is, you know, a fascinating phenomenon from an economic standpoint, but with the decline in housing sales for the last couple of months, is it a sign that the markets peaked and is going down, or just slowing down?</p><p>FAUCHER: I think it`s an indication that the market is just slowing down. Inventories have been very tight. So, that`s really constrained home sales. We saw sales fall in June particularly in the south and west where markets have been tighter. So, I think now that inventories are rising again, I think that there are more homes for sale that will bring more buyers into the market and I`d expect to see sales increase through the rest of this year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We need home builders to build more homes, especially for the first-time buyer. We need more home owners who plan to sell to put their houses on the market so we get more inventory out there. Is that going to happen? What`s it going to take do you think down the road?</p><p>FAUCHER: Right. You know, we are starting to see more inventories on the existing side and we`re also starting to see improvements in supply on the new home side. There are some constraints in home construction. There`s a shortage of construction workers in some parts of the country. There`s a shortage of developable land, but I think we`re seeing price gains of about 5 percent or 6 percent a year. That`s going to lead to more people putting their homes on the market, that`s going to lead to more home building, and so, we`ll eventually see supply catch up to demand.</p><p>HERERA: What about the interest rate phenomenon? I mean, we did see interest rates tick up pretty decidedly in today`s trading session, and that will translate into higher mortgage rates. Is -- are we at the level of interest rates on mortgages, the 30-year traditional mortgages, where it will slow down demand, or maybe not yet?</p><p>FAUCHER: You know, I think that the higher mortgage rates that we`ve seen over the past couple of years have weighed slightly on demand. That being said, there`s still a lot of positives for housing demand. We have good job growth. We have rising incomes. We have better access to credit.</p><p>And so, I think you put it all together that higher mortgage rates are a bit of a headwind, but I still think there`s some good tailwinds for the housing market. And so, I would expect that we`ll see sales increase over the second half of this year.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Gus, thank you so much. Gus Faucher with PNC Financial Group.</p><p>Bill?</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>We begin tonight with Papa John`s which was downgraded to sell from hold at Stifel Nicolaus. The analysts there cites what he calls a toxic culture at that company that could hurt the prospects for a turnaround or maybe even a buyout. Separately, Papa John`s said that its board had a today`s shareholder rights plan that would act against any move by its founder to take a bigger stake.</p><p>At this point, John Schnatter and his affiliates already owned just over 29 percent of the company. Price target now $38, shares dropped by 9 percent today to $46.56.</p><p>General Electric (NYSE:GE) was downgraded to hold from buy at Argos Research, with the analyst there saying that GE may continue to struggle to meet the low end of its 2018 earnings guidance. The firm calls the outlet for GE`s power business bleak. The stock dropped about 1 percent today at $12.99.</p><p>HERERA: Walgreens Boots Alliance was downgraded to market performed from outperform over at Cowen. The analyst says Walgreens is poorly positioned in the move towards value-based care. The price target is $71. The stock rose a fraction to $65.34.</p><p>Philip Morris was downgraded to hold from buy at Societe Generale. The analyst their cites concerns over reduced risk products, which are primarily smokeless tobacco products. The price target is $90. The stock fell 1 percent to $83.22.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, the roadmap for Fiat Chrysler as a new CEO takes over.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mexico reportedly wants to reach a NAFTA deal with the White House by the end of August and today, President Trump hinted that something could be coming soon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We`re talking to Mexico on NAFTA, and I think we`re going to have something worked out. The new president, terrific person, I spoke to him at length. I want to call -- did a great job, got a tremendous vote and they have a lot of confidence in him in Mexico and that`s good. But we`re talking to them about doing something very dramatic, very positive for both countries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The dollar fell against the Mexican peso when those comments were made this afternoon.</p><p>HERERA: Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) was one of the first companies to get caught up in a trade spat, which is why tonight`s quarterly results are being so closely watched. The appliance maker earned $3.20 a share, which was below expectations. Revenue fell to about $5 billion, also below estimates. And the stock took a hit in initial after-hours trading as costs for the company climb.</p><p>Contessa Brewer takes a look at the issues that that company is facing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CONTESSA BREWER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) is blaming it`s disappointing performance in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and it`s promising to take strong action to improve operational execution. But it lowered its full-year guidance and shares plummeted more than 8 percent in after-market trading. The second quarter earnings miss shows Whirlpools struggling in spite of the 20 percent tariff on imported washing machines from its foreign competitors.</p><p>Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) felt Korean makers LG and Samsung were taking them to the cleaners and pressed Washington for more protection. The 20 percent washer tariffs announced in January were among the first the Trump administration slapped on imports. There was an immediate impact. The share price shot up. Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) added 200 employees to its factory in Clyde, Ohio, and LG announced it would hike prices of its washing machines by roughly $50.</p><p>But customers started seeing costs of washers and dryers climb across the board, up 20 percent according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the biggest monthly increases we`ve seen since the agency started keeping track.</p><p>Whirlpools told investors that it`s paying substantially more for raw materials in part because of tariffs on steel and aluminum. Tuesday, CEO Marc Bitzer will hold his earnings call and analysts may press him to explain how the trade war has affected the company in the second quarter and what competitive impact LG`s and Samsung`s investments in the United States will have on Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Contessa Brewer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) gets a lift from Marvel toy sales and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The toy maker reported a decline in profit and revenue largely due to the loss of its main retail partner Toys \"R\" Us. But the results still came in ahead of Wall Street`s lowered expectations. They were helped by strength in the company`s entertainment and licensing division, as well as strong demand for Marvel and Beyblade branded products. Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) also said it plans to move some of its production out of China due to the ongoing tariff fight. Shares jumped more than 12 percent today to $106.04, making it the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 today.</p><p>Then there`s the other company. Revenues came in stronger than expected to oilfield services provider Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) as production ramped up in the U.S. But the beat was overshadowed by concerns that demand is slowing for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) services in the Permian basin. Shares fell by 8 percent on the day to $41.54, making it the worst performing stock in the S&amp;P today.</p><p>Higher selling prices helped egg producer Cal-Maine`s profit rise but a decline in sales volume did cause total revenue to disappoint. Company also warned that the market may see additional pricing pressures due to excess supply. Shares were off 2 percent to $44.95.</p><p>HERERA: Health care services provider LifePoint said it has agreed to be bought and taken private by the private equity firm Apollo Global Management. The price tag nearly $6 billion. LifePoint Health will merge with another Apollo-owned hospital company which will expand its operations LifePoint Health rose 35 percent to $64.90.</p><p>Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) said the stronger dollar would hurt margins and cut into its full-year profits. The industrial products maker also missed quarterly revenue expectations the shares were off 7 percent to $136.26.</p><p>And after the bell, TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) said that cost cuts and higher trading revenues helped to offset a decline in new client assets. The brokerage firm topped both earnings and revenue expectations. The shares were volatile in after hours, but they finished the regular session up nearly 3 percent to $59.06. GRIFFETH: The longtime CEO of Fiat Chrysler and Ferrari has suddenly been replaced. The company`s announced over the weekend that Sergio Marchionne`s health rapidly deteriorated over the past week, following shoulder surgery earlier this month. Shares of both Fiat Chrysler and Ferrari were lower as the automakers now faced questions about their futures with new leaders behind the wheel.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more on this story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With his trademark black sweater and a maverick style that took Chrysler from bankruptcy to global growth, Sergio Marchionne`s tenure as CEO of Fiat Chrysler was a huge success. So, the news that he will not be returning to work due to a rapid decline in his health is a kick in the gut for a company that he led for almost a decade.</p><p>The chairman of Fiat Chrysler said: Sergio taught us to think differently and to have the courage to change, often in unconventional ways, always acting with a sense of responsibility for the companies and their people.</p><p>PAUL INGRASSIA, REVS INSTITUTE EDITOR: His legacy is remarkable. I think it`s hard to name any other CEO really in any other industry that`s compiled his record over the last 10 or 15 years.</p><p>LEBEAU: FCA`s new CEO is Mike Manley, a longtime lieutenant of Marchionne`s, who turns Jeep into the most profitable part of the business. Under Manly, Jeep`s global sales skyrocketed to almost 1.4 million vehicles last year, and he`s long been considered an heir apparent for the CEO job.</p><p>REBECCA LINDLAND, KELLEY BLUE BOOK: Anybody taking over for a position that Sergio filled has incredible expectations put upon them. This is a man -- you know, Sergio is just iconic both in the industry throughout Italy, throughout Canada, really on a global basis.</p><p>LEBEAU: While Fiat Chrysler`s future built around trucks and SUVs appears clear-cut, it may be a bumpier road for Ferrari. Marchionne brought the luxury brand public and its stocks surged under his vision of expanding Ferrari sales, including adding an SUV.</p><p>Now, Ferrari board member Camilleri takes the reins. He may know the luxury automaker, but will he have the same magic touch as Marchionne.</p><p>Sergio as nearly everyone in the auto industry refers to him was not a perfect CEO and not everything he tried panned out. For example, Fiat compact cars never really caught on here in the United States. Still, Marchionne leaves FCA in far better shape than when he took over.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, why a four-day workweek could be good for business.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, what do you think? Could a four-day workweek be in your future? Well, one New Zealand firm called Perpetual Guardian tried it out for two months and it resulted in what they said was greater productivity, lower stress levels, improve work/life balance, and higher team engagement levels, all by working just one fewer day a week. So, is it in our future and will it make us more productive?</p><p>Joining us tonight, Marc Cenedella is CEO of the job search site Ladders here to talk about that,</p><p>Marc, good to see you. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MARC CENEDELLA, LADDERS CEO: Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I was just reading today that it was in 1940 that the five-day workweek was mandated here in the United States. Before then, six days was more common.</p><p>CENEDELLA: Things have gone pretty well since then.</p><p>GRIFFEH: Yes, OK.</p><p>So, here we are 75 years later, are we efficient enough to move now to a four-day workweek? What do you think?</p><p>CENEDELLA: Well, this is part of a bigger trend where companies are measuring the output of their workers rather than the amount of time they put on the clock. So, I think we might see a lot more of this in the future.</p><p>HERERA: Does it also come down to what the employee wants in terms of work-life balance? You know, depending on what part of the country you live in, it can cost you a lot of money for housing and things like that? How much of that is part of this trend?</p><p>CENEDELLA: A huge part. So, at Ladders, we focus on kind of 100k-plus jobs, and we see at the higher end of the workforce that what people really feel drives them is the ability to have control, the ability to be creative and the ability to feel like they`re contributing to something that they believe in.</p><p>So, the more that companies are able to put the onus on workers to you have to produce in whatever amount of time it takes you to produce and we`re not going to watch the clock --</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>CENEDELLA: -- the more powerful they`re going to be.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You know, I would think it would be more it would be better in the technology industry makes more sense there than it would in a manufacturing. But interestingly, again, I`m doing reading today, and I read it was the Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Company in 1926, was one of the first companies to introduce the five-day workweek. So, could this work for all industries do you think?</p><p>CENEDELLA: I think what it requires that it`s a really measurable business or a really measurable industry where it`s very clear that the output of the white-collar workforce or the blue-collar work force should be X units of whatever it is they`re producing. In the case of perpetual guardians, there are wills and state company. So, it`s pretty easy to measure how many wills or estates you`ve handled this week.</p><p>So, the more you can measure the output and weigh what people do in a week, the less you need to mandate the amount of time they spend on the clock.</p><p>HERERA: I know this is kind of a broad brush question, but what`s your gut feeling as to how receptive most employers are to the concept?</p><p>CENEDELLA: So, everybody feel -- I think a lot of employers feel that at first, this is just going to reduce my output, it`s going to reduce my productivity. But in a similar vein, remote work has become a big part of the American workforce over the last five or ten years, and there we`re starting to see a whole companies move to being remote workforces because they put in place technology and systems that allow them to measure the output.</p><p>And I think as long as employers feel comfortable that they can measure the output right of their employees, the more comfortable they`ll feel with being more flexible on the time that they do it.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Marc, fascinating conversation, appreciate your thoughts tonight.</p><p>Marc Cenedella with Ladders joining us tonight.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Here`s a final look at the day on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13 points, Nasdaq added 21, S&amp;P 500 was up five.</p><p>And that`ll do it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Welcome back, by the way.</p><p>HERERA: Thank you. Good to be back. Missed you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening we`re here all five days this week.</p><p>HERERA: All five days.</p><p>GRIFFETH: See you tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Does working four days a week instead of five  make you a more productive employee?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday,  July the </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Alphabet is the first of the big tech companies to report earnings and it  did not disappoint.  Google's parent company easily surpassed estimates,  thanks to strong sales of online advertisements and a decline in costs.  </p><p>So, let's get right those numbers for you.  Alphabet earned $11.75 a share.   The estimate was for a profit of $9.59.  Revenue climbed 25 percent to more  than $32 billion.  Investors like that report, sending shares higher in  initial afterhours trading.  </p><p>Josh Lipton has more on Alphabet's quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A big number that  investors make a beeline for in Alphabet's report, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  Properties, that came at a $23.3 billion, a jump of 26 percent.  Aaron  Kessler of Raymond James says that's important because that reflects the  growth of search and YouTube, the core higher margin drivers of the  business.  </p><p>Also, better cost controls in the quarter.  TAC or what Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) pays as distribution partners came in at $3 billion, a  smaller increase, Kessler says, relative to recent quarters.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Joining us now to talk more about Alphabet's earnings beat, and  what he's expecting from other big tech names when they report later this  week.  Daniel Flax is senior tech analyst at Neuberger Berman.</p><p>Daniel, thanks for joining us tonight. </p><p>DANIEL FLAX, NEUBERGER BERMAN SENIOR TECH ANALYST:  Great to see you both.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Alphabet, is such a far-flung company.   Where did you find strength?  What did you like about this report?  </p><p>FLAX:  I think, Bill, what was notable was that there was strength across a  variety of areas.  Core search was healthy.  YouTube was strong, we're  seeing the company make traction in initiatives like the Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) cloud platform.  And so, when you put all that together, the  company has built a series of platforms that we think will enable them to  drive very solid revenue growth over the next few years.  So, we liked it  overall.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, the other two companies that we're going to be watching  closely are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  But let's take  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  You mentioned the fact that for Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), there was -- there was gains basically in a lot of different  areas of the company.  Do you expect the same types of results for Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and a positive result?  </p><p>FLAX:  We do expect solid revenue growth from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and we  expect them on their earnings call and we'll obviously see how the data  comes in to really spend time talking about how they're trying to improve  safeguards around data, and privacy that, of course, is an issue that all  of these companies face.  But given the scrutiny around Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), we'll look for a little bit more insight on that later this  week.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The other FANG stock, we mentioned Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  You  either love it or you hate it.  You want it to turn a profit finally at  some point.  But, boy, it sure is getting into a number of areas in retail  these days.  </p><p>What are you expecting from them this time around?  </p><p>FLAX:  We expect to see solid revenue new growth.  And what we'll be  looking for in addition to the core e-commerce platform is really to gain  additional insight into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, which is their  cloud platform, and also some of their newer initiatives, for example like  advertising.  And so, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is I think we appreciate -- many  of us appreciate is an incredibly disruptive company.  And so, we'll look,  besides for the data, to get a little more insight on some of their newer  elements of their strategy later this week.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, one of the things that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had to  deal with and has created some volatility in its stock is the discussion of  possible antitrust issues.  Sometimes it's being tweeted out by the  president, sometimes it's mentioned by Wall Street analysts and the like.   Do you expect any of that to be addressed?  And do you view that as a  problem for the company if indeed those discussion goes a little further?  </p><p>FLAX:  Well, I think that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and frankly all of these  companies are going to be facing a lot more in the way of scrutiny and  regulation over the next several years.  And that's as much a function of  their size as the fact that they're playing an increasingly large impact on  the economy.  And so, while I do think it is a headline risk and if the  company didn't take action that it could become a larger risk, but what  we've seen from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in this example is that they're really  trying to get ahead of some of these issues and doing their best to really  attack them head on.  </p><p>And so, we expect that to remain part of the story.  It is a risk.  But we  think if they continue to innovate, to execute and to invest in building a  robust platform over the next several years, that they can continue to  drive significant shareholder value over the medium to long term.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Daniel Flax with Neuberger Berman -- again, thanks for joining  us tonight.</p><p>FLAX:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  On Wall Street, the Nasdaq closed at yet another record and that  was before the results from Alphabet were released.  But lingering concerns  outside of the tech sector capped the gains.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average fell 13 points to 25,044, the Nasdaq added 21, and the S&amp;P 500 was  up five.  </p><p>The Nasdaq may be at a record but it's been about six months since the  broader market last peaked.  So, where does the bull market stands?  </p><p>Well, Mike Santoli takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This week marked six  months in stocks last hit a record high.  If it's still a bull market, if  it goes half a year without gaining altitude, and if so, what might get it  flying again?</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 remains more than 2 percent below its January 26th record,  having recovered most of the 12 percent February drop in a labored grind.   Most corrections within bull markets are fully recouped in less time, but  the prolonged sideways action in recent months might say more about the  exuberant nature of that January peak than about the underlying strength of  the market.  Stocks had rushed to a 7 percent gain in less than weeks in  January, a pace unsustainable in any environment.  </p><p>But the performance for the year has been perfectly respectable.  The S&amp;P  500 is up close to 5 percent, and on track for better than a 10 percent  annual return, including dividends.  This might not seem all that  impressive given the 20 percent corporate profit growth in the first half  of the year, but flattish stock prices and rising earnings have made the  market appear far less expense then at the peak with the S&amp;P's valuation  back in line with its five-year average.  </p><p>It's not unusual for stocks to stall at a trading range for months  following a very strong low volatility year such as 2017 was.  There was a  similar pattern of grudging gains and frequent pull-backs in the market  back in 2014 in fact, also a midterm election year that followed a powerful  rally the year before.  Of course, a few big concerns specific to the  current moment continue to restrain the market despite stellar corporate  results.  The intensifying trade conflict threatens to hurt U.S. exports,  raise prices and sap CEO confidence.  </p><p>The Federal Reserve seems intent on lifting interest rates well into next  year, on top of seven hikes since 2015, and there are nagging worries that  the economic cycle is nearing a later stage.  It's important to remember  though that the later part of a cycle can last years, even if that's where  we are, and it's hard to find many leading indicators of recession that  suggest a downturn is imminent even as the boost from tax cuts recedes, all  of which indicates that the bull market is showing some wear and tear, but  probably has not seen its ultimate peak just yet.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And then there's housing, which is clearly a key part of the  economy.  It may be starting to stumble.  A new report out this morning  said that existing home sales fell 0.6 percent in June, its third straight  monthly decline.  Tight supply and high prices have been turning off  potential homebuyers, especially those first-time buyers. </p><p>And for those who want to move up to a bigger home, it's becoming  increasingly difficult to find something affordable.  But there's one  strategy that's becoming more and more popular.</p><p>Diana Olick tells us what it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Liz Chamberlain is  already feeling right at home in her new place in suburban Maryland, she  and her husband didn't want to leave the city but finding a larger house in  D.C. for their growing family was just too expensive, even this home was a  challenge.  </p><p>LIZ CHAMBERLAIN, HOMEOWNER AND LANDLORD:  We bid on four houses and two of  them was kind of crazy into crazy bidding wars.</p><p>OLICK:  In order to afford the bigger home, they needed to rent out the  home they already owned in an increasingly trendy neighborhood on Capitol  Hill.  </p><p>CHAMBERLAIN:  We've ran the numbers.  We -- I literally made a spreadsheet  and ran all the different options like we stay in D.C.</p><p>We run out, we sell our house, and do you see all the different options.   And it made the most financial sense for us to keep our house in D.C., rent  it out and buy here.</p><p>OLICK:  Home prices hit yet another record high in June, according to the  National Association of Realtors and the supply of homes for sale continues  to hover near record lows.  Part of that is because investors scooped up  distressed homes during the foreclosure crisis, turning about 5 million of  them into new single-family rentals.  Demand for homes both to own and rent  is still very strong as the largest generation millennials ages into  marriage and family.</p><p>Of course, not everyone can afford a down payment on a second home, but  there are low down payment options and it may actually be getting easier  now to get a second mortgage, especially as interest rates rise and lenders  are looking for more business.</p><p>LAURENCE YUN, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS CHIEF ECONOMIST:  They are  looking at the possibility making more loans and prior say several years  ago during the depths of the housing crisis, there would have been  extremely strict.  But now, they're looking at the rental income as a  mitigating factor for carrying two mortgages.</p><p>OLICK:  Being a landlord does mean additional responsibility.</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN:  Certainly having an umbrella policy is a really good idea to  make sure you're covered insurance wise and then I do think living in the  house and really knowing it and making sure it's in good shape before you  leave and rent it out is probably one of the best things you can do.</p><p>OLICK:  Because the last thing you want as a new homeowner is old problems.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Gus Faucher joins us now to discuss his outlook for the housing  market.  He is the chief economist at PNC.</p><p>Welcome back, Gus.  Great to see you again.</p><p>What do you make of --  </p><p>GUS FAUCHER, PNC CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  -- what do you make of where we stand right now in the housing  market?  It certainly is, you know, a fascinating phenomenon from an  economic standpoint, but with the decline in housing sales for the last  couple of months, is it a sign that the markets peaked and is going down,  or just slowing down?</p><p>FAUCHER:  I think it's an indication that the market is just slowing down.   Inventories have been very tight.  So, that's really constrained home  sales.  We saw sales fall in June particularly in the south and west where  markets have been tighter.  So, I think now that inventories are rising  again, I think that there are more homes for sale that will bring more  buyers into the market and I'd expect to see sales increase through the  rest of this year.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We need home builders to build more homes, especially for the  first-time buyer.  We need more home owners who plan to sell to put their  houses on the market so we get more inventory out there.  Is that going to  happen?  What's it going to take do you think down the road?</p><p>FAUCHER:  Right.  You know, we are starting to see more inventories on the  existing side and we're also starting to see improvements in supply on the  new home side.  There are some constraints in home construction.  There's a  shortage of construction workers in some parts of the country.  There's a  shortage of developable land, but I think we're seeing price gains of about  5 percent or 6 percent a year.  That's going to lead to more people putting  their homes on the market, that's going to lead to more home building, and  so, we'll eventually see supply catch up to demand.</p><p>HERERA:  What about the interest rate phenomenon?  I mean, we did see  interest rates tick up pretty decidedly in today's trading session, and  that will translate into higher mortgage rates.  Is -- are we at the level  of interest rates on mortgages, the 30-year traditional mortgages, where it  will slow down demand, or maybe not yet?</p><p>FAUCHER:  You know, I think that the higher mortgage rates that we've seen  over the past couple of years have weighed slightly on demand.  That being  said, there's still a lot of positives for housing demand.  We have good  job growth.  We have rising incomes.  We have better access to credit.  </p><p>And so, I think you put it all together that higher mortgage rates are a  bit of a headwind, but I still think there's some good tailwinds for the  housing market.  And so, I would expect that we'll see sales increase over  the second half of this year.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Gus, thank you so much.  Gus Faucher with PNC  Financial Group.</p><p>Bill?</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p>We begin tonight with Papa John's which was downgraded to sell from hold at  Stifel Nicolaus.  The analysts there cites what he calls a toxic culture at  that company that could hurt the prospects for a turnaround or maybe even a  buyout.  Separately, Papa John's said that its board had a today's  shareholder rights plan that would act against any move by its founder to  take a bigger stake.</p><p>At this point, John Schnatter and his affiliates already owned just over 29  percent of the company.  Price target now $38, shares dropped by 9 percent  today to $46.56.</p><p>General Electric (NYSE:GE) was downgraded to hold from buy at Argos  Research, with the analyst there saying that GE may continue to struggle to  meet the low end of its 2018 earnings guidance.  The firm calls the outlet  for GE's power business bleak.  The stock dropped about 1 percent today at  $12.99.</p><p>HERERA:  Walgreens Boots Alliance was downgraded to market performed from  outperform over at Cowen.  The analyst says Walgreens is poorly positioned  in the move towards value-based care.  The price target is $71.  The stock  rose a fraction to $65.34.</p><p>Philip Morris was downgraded to hold from buy at Societe Generale.  The  analyst their cites concerns over reduced risk products, which are  primarily smokeless tobacco products.  The price target is $90.  The stock  fell 1 percent to $83.22.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, the roadmap for FiatChrysler as a new CEO takes  over.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mexico reportedly wants to reach a NAFTA deal with the White  House by the end of August and today, President Trump hinted that something  could be coming soon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're talking to Mexico on  NAFTA, and I think we're going to have something worked out.  The new  president, terrific person, I spoke to him at length.  I want to call --  did a great job, got a tremendous vote and they have a lot of confidence in  him in Mexico and that's good.  But we're talking to them about doing  something very dramatic, very positive for both countries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The dollar fell against the Mexican peso when those comments  were made this afternoon.</p><p>HERERA:  Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) was one of the first companies to get caught  up in a trade spat, which is why tonight's quarterly results are being so  closely watched.  The appliance maker earned $3.20 a share, which was below  expectations.  Revenue fell to about $5 billion, also below estimates.  And  the stock took a hit in initial after-hours trading as costs for the  company climb.</p><p>Contessa Brewer takes a look at the issues that that company is facing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CONTESSA BREWER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Whirlpool  (NYSE:WHR) is blaming it's disappointing performance in Europe, the Middle  East and Africa, and it's promising to take strong action to improve  operational execution.  But it lowered its full-year guidance and shares  plummeted more than 8 percent in after-market trading.  The second quarter  earnings miss shows Whirlpools struggling in spite of the 20 percent tariff  on imported washing machines from its foreign competitors.  </p><p>Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) felt Korean makers LG and Samsung were taking them to  the cleaners and pressed Washington for more protection.  The 20 percent  washer tariffs announced in January were among the first the Trump  administration slapped on imports.  There was an immediate impact.  The  share price shot up.  Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) added 200 employees to its  factory in Clyde, Ohio, and LG announced it would hike prices of its  washing machines by roughly $50.  </p><p>But customers started seeing costs of washers and dryers climb across the  board, up 20 percent according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the  biggest monthly increases we've seen since the agency started keeping  track.  </p><p>Whirlpools told investors that it's paying substantially more for raw  materials in part because of tariffs on steel and aluminum.  Tuesday, CEO  Marc Bitzer will hold his earnings call and analysts may press him to  explain how the trade war has affected the company in the second quarter  and what competitive impact LG's and Samsung's investments in the United  States will have on Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Contessa Brewer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) gets a lift from Marvel toy sales and that's  where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The toy maker reported a decline in profit and revenue largely due to the  loss of its main retail partner Toys \"R\" Us.  But the results still came in  ahead of Wall Street's lowered expectations.  They were helped by strength  in the company's entertainment and licensing division, as well as strong  demand for Marvel and Beyblade branded products.  Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) also  said it plans to move some of its production out of China due to the  ongoing tariff fight.  Shares jumped more than 12 percent today to $106.04,  making it the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 today.</p><p>Then there's the other company.  Revenues came in stronger than expected to  oilfield services provider Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) as production ramped up  in the U.S.  But the beat was overshadowed by concerns that demand is  slowing for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) services in the Permian basin.  Shares  fell by 8 percent on the day to $41.54, making it the worst performing  stock in the S&amp;P today.</p><p>Higher selling prices helped egg producer Cal-Maine's profit rise but a  decline in sales volume did cause total revenue to disappoint.  Company  also warned that the market may see additional pricing pressures due to  excess supply.  Shares were off 2 percent to $44.95.</p><p>HERERA:  Health care services provider LifePoint said it has agreed to be  bought and taken private by the private equity firm Apollo Global  Management.  The price tag nearly $6 billion.  LifePoint Health will merge  with another Apollo-owned hospital company which will expand its operations   LifePoint Health rose 35 percent to $64.90.</p><p>Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) said the stronger dollar would hurt margins  and cut into its full-year profits.  The industrial products maker also  missed quarterly revenue expectations the shares were off 7 percent to  $136.26.</p><p>And after the bell, TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) said that cost cuts and  higher trading revenues helped to offset a decline in new client assets.   The brokerage firm topped both earnings and revenue expectations.  The  shares were volatile in after hours, but they finished the regular session  up nearly 3 percent to $59.06. GRIFFETH:  The longtime CEO of FiatChrysler and Ferrari has suddenly been  replaced.  The company's announced over the weekend that Sergio  Marchionne's health rapidly deteriorated over the past week, following  shoulder surgery earlier this month.  Shares of both FiatChrysler and  Ferrari were lower as the automakers now faced questions about their  futures with new leaders behind the wheel.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau has more on this story.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With his trademark  black sweater and a maverick style that took Chrysler from bankruptcy to  global growth, Sergio Marchionne's tenure as CEO of FiatChrysler was a  huge success.  So, the news that he will not be returning to work due to a  rapid decline in his health is a kick in the gut for a company that he led  for almost a decade.  </p><p>The chairman of FiatChrysler said: Sergio taught us to think differently  and to have the courage to change, often in unconventional ways, always  acting with a sense of responsibility for the companies and their people.</p><p>PAUL INGRASSIA, REVS INSTITUTE EDITOR:  His legacy is remarkable.  I think  it's hard to name any other CEO really in any other industry that's  compiled his record over the last 10 or 15 years.</p><p>LEBEAU:  FCA's new CEO is Mike Manley, a longtime lieutenant of  Marchionne's, who turns Jeep into the most profitable part of the business.   Under Manly, Jeep's global sales skyrocketed to almost 1.4 million vehicles  last year, and he's long been considered an heir apparent for the CEO job.</p><p>REBECCA LINDLAND, KELLEY BLUE BOOK:  Anybody taking over for a position  that Sergio filled has incredible expectations put upon them.  This is a  man -- you know, Sergio is just iconic both in the industry throughout  Italy, throughout Canada, really on a global basis.</p><p>LEBEAU:  While FiatChrysler's future built around trucks and SUVs appears  clear-cut, it may be a bumpier road for Ferrari.  Marchionne brought the  luxury brand public and its stocks surged under his vision of expanding  Ferrari sales, including adding an SUV.  </p><p>Now, Ferrari board member Camilleri takes the reins.  He may know the  luxury automaker, but will he have the same magic touch as Marchionne.</p><p>Sergio as nearly everyone in the auto industry refers to him was not a  perfect CEO and not everything he tried panned out.  For example, Fiat  compact cars never really caught on here in the United States.  Still,  Marchionne leaves FCA in far better shape than when he took over.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, why a four-day workweek could be good for business.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, what do you think?  Could a four-day workweek be in your  future?  Well, one New Zealand firm called Perpetual Guardian tried it out  for two months and it resulted in what they said was greater productivity,  lower stress levels, improve work/life balance, and higher team engagement  levels, all by working just one fewer day a week.  So, is it in our future  and will it make us more productive?</p><p>Joining us tonight, Marc Cenedella is CEO of the job search site Ladders  here to talk about that,</p><p>Marc, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MARC CENEDELLA, LADDERS CEO:  Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I was just reading today that it was in 1940 that the five-day  workweek was mandated here in the United States.  Before then, six days was  more common.</p><p>CENEDELLA:  Things have gone pretty well since then.</p><p>GRIFFEH:  Yes, OK.</p><p>So, here we are 75 years later, are we efficient enough to move now to a  four-day workweek?  What do you think?</p><p>CENEDELLA:  Well, this is part of a bigger trend where companies are  measuring the output of their workers rather than the amount of time they  put on the clock.  So, I think we might see a lot more of this in the  future.</p><p>HERERA:  Does it also come down to what the employee wants in terms of  work-life balance?  You know, depending on what part of the country you  live in, it can cost you a lot of money for housing and things like that?   How much of that is part of this trend?</p><p>CENEDELLA:  A huge part.  So, at Ladders, we focus on kind of 100k-plus  jobs, and we see at the higher end of the workforce that what people really  feel drives them is the ability to have control, the ability to be creative  and the ability to feel like they're contributing to something that they  believe in.</p><p>So, the more that companies are able to put the onus on workers to you have  to produce in whatever amount of time it takes you to produce and we're not  going to watch the clock --  </p><p>GRIFFETH:   Right.</p><p>CENEDELLA:  -- the more powerful they're going to be.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You know, I would think it would be more it would be better in  the technology industry makes more sense there than it would in a  manufacturing.  But interestingly, again, I'm doing reading today, and I  read it was the Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Company in 1926, was one of the first  companies to introduce the five-day workweek.  So, could this work for all  industries do you think?</p><p>CENEDELLA:  I think what it requires that it's a really measurable business  or a really measurable industry where it's very clear that the output of  the white-collar workforce or the blue-collar work force should be X units  of whatever it is they're producing.  In the case of perpetual guardians,  there are wills and state company.  So, it's pretty easy to measure how  many wills or estates you've handled this week.  </p><p>So, the more you can measure the output and weigh what people do in a week,  the less you need to mandate the amount of time they spend on the clock.</p><p>HERERA:  I know this is kind of a broad brush question, but what's your gut  feeling as to how receptive most employers are to the concept?</p><p>CENEDELLA:  So, everybody feel -- I think a lot of employers feel that at  first, this is just going to reduce my output, it's going to reduce my  productivity.  But in a similar vein, remote work has become a big part of  the American workforce over the last five or ten years, and there we're  starting to see a whole companies move to being remote workforces because  they put in place technology and systems that allow them to measure the  output.  </p><p>And I think as long as employers feel comfortable that they can measure the  output right of their employees, the more comfortable they'll feel with  being more flexible on the time that they do it.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Marc, fascinating conversation, appreciate your thoughts  tonight.</p><p>Marc Cenedella with Ladders joining us tonight.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.

The aerospace company says it could suspend production of its 737 MAX, and it posts its largest-ever quarterly loss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digging a hole. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is considered a barometer of the global economy, and right now, it`s feeling the pain of the slowdown.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Friending Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Revenues are up and users are not going anywhere as the company tries to push past all of the regulatory pressures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, July 24th.</p><p>And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome. Sue is off tonight.</p><p>The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq both closed at record highs today, but the Dow was dragged lower in part because of Boeing (NYSE:BA), which reported a massive loss for the second quarter. It also warned about something that no shareholder wants to hear about, that it may have to halt production of its 737 MAX if the grounding of the jet liner drags on much longer. That pushed the stock 3 percent lower in today`s trade.</p><p>Phil LeBeau is on the story for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With the 737 MAX grounded for months, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg says his company could shut down the MAX assembly line if the current plan for recertifying the plane this fall is pushed back even further.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, BOEING CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: If any of the timeline assumptions change significantly from start of the fourth quarter return to service, then we`ll have to evaluate alternatives, and those alternatives could include different production rates. They could include a temporary shutdown of the line. Not something we want to do, but an alternative that we have to prepare for.</p><p>LEBEAU: Stopping production could mean temporarily laying off thousands of workers, which could have a ripple effect on suppliers around the country. It all comes down to when the FAA and other regulators say the MAX is safe to take off. A software fix for the plane is being tested in simulators, but if it is approved and airlines like Southwest can resume MAX flights this year, then Boeing (NYSE:BA) will keep building 42 MAXes a month and plan to ramp up production next year.</p><p>JIM CORRIDORE, CFRA RESEARCH: If they are able to relaunch this plane and it`s as they say the safest plane to ever fly once they bring it back into service, then their reputation can be preserved. They are battling for their very existence, for their very reputation right now.</p><p>LEBEAU: Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin weighed in on the MAX controversy and what the president thinks of the beleaguered plane.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: I think as you know, the president has said he is concerned about the 737 MAX. Quite frankly, he thinks they should bring back the 757 and look at selling 757s.</p><p>LEBEAU: Boeing (NYSE:BA) is not bringing back the 757. In fact, it stopped building that plane in 2004 and reviving it would cost billions of dollars. Instead, the focus right now is on getting the MAX back in the air by the end of the year.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: You just saw Jim Corridore in Phil`s story there. He`s industrials analyst to CFRA Research, joining us to talk about what he believes to be the best and worst case scenarios for Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p>Jim, good to see you again. Welcome back.</p><p>CORRIDORE: Thanks, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Let`s start with the best case scenario. What do you think it is?</p><p>CORRIDORE: Best case scenario is they`re very close to having the software ready to go. They bring it to the FAA sometime early in September. The FAA, who is at Boeing`s side through the whole process, in the simulators with Boeing (NYSE:BA), approves the planes and they get back to flying early October. Then Boeing (NYSE:BA) can start delivering the planes parked at facilities all over the country and start booking these revenues and getting this thing moving again.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Worst case scenario, how bad could it be?</p><p>CORRIDORE: Yes, the worst case scenario is the FAA finds a problem with the software fix, pushes back against Boeing (NYSE:BA), says, we`re not ready to -- we`re not ready to bring the planes back out again, and Boeing (NYSE:BA) has to halt the production line, has to furlough some workers. Their suppliers will not be able to continue to produce at the rate they`re producing. It causes a whole global supply chain effect, that affects more than just Boeing (NYSE:BA) but a lot of companies.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Let`s talk reality. What do you think is most likely to happen and what`s the impact going to be on the company?</p><p>CORRIDORE: Yes, I think Boeing (NYSE:BA) was very careful not to announce a timeline for return of the plane until they felt it was ready. Last week, they said they felt it was going to be Q4. Today, they said they thought it was going to be early Q4.</p><p>So, I think that they`re fairly confident that they have the right fix in place. They`ve been testing it now for quite sometime. And I think the most likely scenario is that before the end of 2009, that plane is flying in the air again.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Even though some regulators here and abroad have said quietly that they don`t think it flies until next year sometime.</p><p>CORRIDORE: Yes, I think that once the FAA gets onboard, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is going to have a coordinated effort with European regulators, with Brazilian, all over the world.</p><p>Once the plane is deemed to be safe, I think that there will be a push out to get everyone on board. I think they will be able to do so.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Jim Corridore with CFRA Research -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>CORRIDORE: Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is having a tough time navigating the slow economy right now globally. The maker of big machinery missed Wall Street earnings estimates and said that profit for the year would be at the lower end of its previous guidance. Cat shares fell about 4-1/2 percent today, making it the worst performing stock in the Dow.</p><p>Seema Mody has more on Caterpillar`s quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is finding it tough to do business. A slowdown in the U.S. shale boom and higher manufacturing costs cut into profits. Revenue from its oil and gas division fell double digits, due in part to weakness in the Permian Basin as some customers pulled back on making large capital investments. Volatile commodity prices didn`t help either.</p><p>Over in Asia, growth remains a challenge. Perhaps most concerning: weakness in China which was once a key market for the industrial heavyweight.</p><p>ROB WERTHEIMER, MELIUS RESEARCH FOUNDING PARTNER: Cat`s had many, many years of gaining share and doing very well in China, selling durable products and good stuff and several months of losing share again. So, whether that`s related to geopolitical tensions or just pricing, it`s not yet clear.</p><p>MODY: Tariffs are pressing margins and winning new business in China is not as easy as it used to be.</p><p>JIM UMPLEBY, CATERPILLAR CEO: We expect continued pressure with China partly offset by growth in other areas of Asia Pacific.</p><p>MODY: Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) did reference strength in construction, which makes up a bulk of its sales. It`s also more positive on North America, though still sees weakness in the housing market. But one thing is clear: if the global economy worsens, the industrial sector is headed for more pain.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And as we mentioned at the top of the broadcast, the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq reached all-time highs today. Chip stocks rallied and investors essentially brushed off regulatory concerns facing big tech right now. And we`ll have more on that in a moment.</p><p>But, first, the final numbers today with the industrial average down 79 points, we are at 27,269. Nasdaq was up 70. The S&amp;P added 14.</p><p>So far, the greatest regulatory pressure from Washington has been on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), but you would never know it by looking at its quarterly results today. The social media company reported better than expected earnings and revenue was up sharply. But the stock was volatile in after hours trading tonight.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has details of Facebook`s results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) continues to grow revenue faster than expected, even as big regulatory issues weigh on the company. Facebook`s generating more revenue per user than predicted. This as the company takes an additional $2 billion charge as a result of the FTC fine for privacy violations, coming in at the highest end of the range Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) gave last quarter.</p><p>The company notes that the online tech industry and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have received increased regulatory scrutiny in the past quarter, announcing that in June Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was informed that the FTC opened an antitrust investigation into the company. This in addition to the Department of Justice`s announcement yet that it will begin an antitrust review of market-leading online platforms.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg saying we are investing in building stronger privacy protections for everyone and on delivering new experiences for the people who use our services.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: That FTC investigation that Julia just mentioned was officially settled today. The commission fined Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) $5 billion for its mishandling of user data after it was learned that political consultant Cambridge Analytica had secretly gained access to 87 million Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) accounts. The settlement orders Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to create new layers of oversight and CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be held personally responsible for making sure that that happens.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH SIMONS, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN: I think Mark Zuckerberg is held personally accountable. He is signing the order. He is named specifically in the order. The order requires him personally to certify that the company is in compliance with our order quarterly, and if he files false certifications, then he is subjecting himself to civil and criminal penalties.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now, the FTC is not Facebook`s only headache. As we have been reporting, the Justice Department has started an antitrust review of some of Silicon Valley`s biggest tech giants to determine if they have purposely been stifling competition. The companies being reviewed have not been named the announcement, but most believe them to be Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>And tonight, we take a look at what the DOJ may be targeting at each company. Back with us is Julia Boorstin on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOORSTIN: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the second largest digital ad platform with 29 percent of U.S. digital ad spending between Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram. And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the most dominant social platform when it comes to user`s time. Americans spend nearly 40 minutes daily on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) plus almost half an hour on Instagram, dwarfing the time spent on Snapchat.</p><p>And as the DOJ looks at how Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has leveraged the power of its large network, it has become a force in other areas including mobile communication and news.</p><p>Facebook`s Messenger and WhatsApp together have nearly 3 billion monthly active users. By comparison, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has 900 million active iPhones. And over half American adults say they get news on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Instagram.</p><p>The question is whether Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is unfairly leveraging its social media power to dominate in new areas, ranging from online dating to movie ticket sales to digital currency.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now to Deirdre Bosa with a look at the issues surrounding Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Three reasons Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could get caught in the regulatory crosshairs.</p><p>First, it controls nearly 40 percent of all U.S. online retail sales. EBay is a distant second with just 6 percent of the market.</p><p>Second, potential competition with third party merchants on its own platform. CEO Jeff Bezos said earlier this year that third party sales that is small and medium businesses who use Amazon`s platform made up more than half of total sales. Critics argue that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could use data from these sellers to unfairly compete against them and push its own private label products from diapers to electronics to toilet paper.</p><p>Third, regulators could zero in on the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime fly wheel. If Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is using money from other business units to subsidize video or music services, how can other companies that do have to make a profit compete?</p><p>Deirdre Bosa, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And, finally, as we mentioned, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) parent Alphabet and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may also be under scrutiny.</p><p>Here is Josh Lipton.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) could be in the government`s crosshairs in part because of its estimated 80 percent market share in search. Antitrust officials will have to decide if that`s a monopoly harming consumers.</p><p>But Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) officials recently testified on Capitol Hill, disputing that argument.</p><p>ADAM COHEN, GOOGLE ECONOMIC POLICY DIRECTOR: For example, when consumers search for information, they can choose among Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Yelp, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Travelocity and many other companies like these that consistently report strong user growth. If you don`t want to use Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), there are many other information providers available.</p><p>LIPTON: And then there is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: I don`t think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a monopoly. Our share is much more modest. We don`t have a dominant position in any market.</p><p>LIPTON: But what about the company`s App Store? Critics of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google`s App Stores argue that the companies favor their own apps, and as a result a whopping 70 percent of all in-app spending goes to the tech giants. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also controls access to the app store.</p><p>But some analysts think an antitrust case could be tough to make because it is not clear to them how the app store actually harms consumers given the breadth and depth of competition on the store itself, they say, and within certain categories like gaming where some apps are free and some aren`t.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: So how concerned should shareholders be about this Justice Department review?</p><p>Joining us tonight is Mark Lehmann. He`s president at JMP Securities.</p><p>Good to see you again, Mark. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MARK LEHMANN, JMP SECURITIES PRESIDENT: Thanks, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I guess the short answer from you is they shouldn`t have to worry much. Why?</p><p>LEHMANN: Well, I mean you`re going to be worried because there will be a lot of headlines coming up, and I think it is going to continue to pay attention to. But like we saw with the Cambridge Analytical scare over the last year, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) had the all-time high a year ago about now when they reported second quarter earnings, there were a lot of headlines and a lot of legislative meetings, but really nothing has happened except some self-regulation, frankly, a slap on the wrist on this $5 billion fine.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>LEHMANN: I think the self-regulation is more likely and I think you`re going to see lots of headlines and lots of bluster but little coming out of Congress and from the legislators, yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Let`s look at each company and see where the vulnerabilities may lie. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), I mean, they clearly have been under the most intense scrutiny as pertains to their user data and the data breaches and all of that. I mean, but at the same time, we just learned today that the users haven`t fled at all.</p><p>LEHMANN: Well, you know, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) always reminds me of, you know, Hall &amp; Oates who sold a couple hundred million albums and they said no one admitted to buying one. Nobody admits to being on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) all day, yet the data says they`re on 40 minutes a day on that, and if my kids are any example on Instagram as well.</p><p>People are not going to flee that platform. It`s where they get their news. It`s where they get their social engagement. And that`s a really hard thing to legislate. And I think that`s why it`s not going to change going forward.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as we heard, may be most vulnerable when it comes to their third party sales and so forth and the strong-arming that they do there and the data they`re able to accumulate.</p><p>LEHMANN: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) certainly has an issue there. I think they`re going to continue to gain the market share that they have on the retail side, but it`s very hard to legislate where people go. And I think you`re going to continue to see consumers want that, maybe some additional choice and maybe there will be some small slap on the wrist that they will probably self-legislate.</p><p>But I just don`t see Congress being able to legislate where people`s eyeballs go and where they want to buy things. It`s been historically a hard thing for Congress and the Justice Department to legislate.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) may also be most vulnerable as it pertains to search results and, you know, the juggernaut that they are in that area there.</p><p>LEHMANN: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) obviously has an overwhelming share. In fact, it has become a verb. We`re going to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) that search. So, I think it is another area we will have great headlines and they could probably rank choice some of the data that does come up, but it may favor some of Google`s top advertisers or other consumers, but they really have to pay attention to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) because they have the juggernaut for market share.</p><p>So, I think, again, all of these stocks will be in the headlines for I think some time on this data but I just don`t see Congress being able to legislate where people put eyeballs and clicks decide to go.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very quickly on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). I mean, you know, Tim Cook has said they`re not a monopoly, but what about the App Store and the tremendous iron fist that they wield there?</p><p>LEHMANN: I think it is somewhat similar. You have a consumer who goes to that App Store constantly and is looking for new ways to access companies and data and products, et cetera. There probably will be some self- regulation where they decide to put certain things on top of others, certain things at different points on the App Store. But like you said, it is an open marketplace and the Congress and the legislators and people who regulate like marketplaces, they will probably find a way to self-regulate.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes.</p><p>LEHMANN: I just think that App Store is here to stay.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And for the record, I was a big fan of Hall and Oates myself.</p><p>Mark Lehmann --</p><p>LEHMANN: You and me both, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mark Lehmann with JMP Securities, thanks again for joining us tonight.</p><p>LEHMANN: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And still ahead, does the most recent budget deal show that the deficits don`t matter anymore?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: In the news today, Queen Elizabeth officially appointed Boris Johnson the prime minister of the United Kingdom. Johnson immediately began forming a government, one that he vows will lead the U.K. out of the European Union.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts because we`re going to restore trust in our democracy and we`re going to fulfill the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the E.U. on October 31st, no ifs or buts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now to the U.S. economy and that recently-agreed to budget deal. As we told you, it raises spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next two years. Now, there was a time when Wall Street and Washington worried quite a bit about debt and deficits. Do they still matter?</p><p>Steve Liesman went in search of some answers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The $22 trillion size of the U.S. debt is astronomical no matter how you measure it. In fact, it`s equivalent to the estimate to the total number of stars in not one, not two, but 22 Andromeda galaxies. That`s the closest neighbor to the Milky Way, and the debt is growing. It doubles roughly every 10 years, is now set to rise by roughly $1 trillion a year if the recent budget deal is enacted into law.</p><p>So, it seems strange to ask, do the trillions upon trillions really matter? Surprisingly, the new trend among politicians on both sides in Washington is that the debt doesn`t matter and neither investors nor economists entirely disagree, at least for now.</p><p>First, while the debt is doubled, the government`s cost of borrowing has fallen from 6 percent in 2000 to around 2 percent today for a ten-year bond. So, larger debt has not pushed up interest rates.</p><p>Second, the size of the debt doesn`t appear to have dragged much on growth. Annual government deficits decline in times of strong growth and they rise during recessions. This is in part by design as the government spends more to kickstart the economy.</p><p>One of the most influential recent developments was a paper presented last year by former IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard. He argued that as long as a country`s interest cost is below its nominal growth rate, countries can or even should borrow more. In the U.S., it`s like the government invests at 2 percent -- that`s the cost of a ten-year -- and gets returns of 4 percent. That`s about where nominal growth is for the U.S.</p><p>Net return, assuming the money is invested well, 2 percent.</p><p>So is all of that old thinking wrong that deficits actually matter? It might sound like it today, but perhaps not forever.</p><p>DAVID MCINTOSH, CLUB FOR GROWTH: This may be less of a problem now when we are in very good economic times, but it is sort of loading the shotgun aimed back at our economy if in the future, interest rates have to go back up and then this tremendous debt service will dramatically limit the ability or force us to borrow even more at a very costly rate.</p><p>LIESMAN: Higher rates could raise the cost of servicing the debt and crowding spending on things like education and defense. The U.S. has trillions of dollars of unfunded liabilities in health and social security costs it soon will be paying. High debt levels also could limit the government to spend more to help the economy in the next recession.</p><p>In Washington, the prevailing political opinion is to ignore all of that in favor of bigger spending and lower taxes today. If rates remain low and the economy continues to grow, it`s all hard to argue against. And that may be the best argument for at least some fiscal prudence today. No one knows quite how long all of the stars will align as perfectly as they are today.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: UPS delivers for investors and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with the company posting better than expected earnings and revenue, and it raised its guidance as well. UPS also said it expects to get FAA approval for drone delivery by end of the year. And to compete with rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS will also be offering a seven-day delivery service next year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID ABNEY, UPS CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: As a company, we had to realize that Sunday, Saturday and Sunday is just like another day of the week. We chose to maximum partners in Michael`s, CVS (NYSE:CVS), Advanced Auto Parts and also for Sunday delivery, enhancing share posts with USPS.</p><p>So, with those combinations and with our network, we feel that we have another good offering for our customers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Stock rose more than 8 percent today to $114.39.</p><p>Health insurer Anthem`s results topped expectations and the company also raised its full-year guidance, but Anthem said that costs connected to its Medicaid business were higher than expected and shares fell more than 4.5 percent today to $288.91.</p><p>VF Corps beat estimates, thanks to sales increases of its Van sneakers and its North Face clothing lines. The apparel maker also raised its full year guidance. Stock was up more than 1 percent to $89.33 today.</p><p>AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) beat revenue estimates and earnings were in line in growth in its wireless and media sector that helped offset continued declines in DirecTV subscriptions. AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) shares rose more than 3.5 percent to $33.24.</p><p>And then after the bell, strong sales of Ford`s F-150 trucks and other SUVs were not enough to offset the automaker`s cost to restructure its global business. As a result, Ford missed earnings expectations and issued soft guidance.</p><p>Shares initially dropped sharply after hours tonight but they did close the regular session up more than 1.5 percent to $10.33.</p><p>And coming up, turning sour. Why the trade war with China is the pits for one American farmer.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin today confirmed he and other trade negotiators will meet with Chinese counterparts next week in Shanghai. That`s certainly welcome news to American farmers who have been hurt by tariffs, but one farmer is not sitting around waiting for them to end. He took it upon himself to head to China to try to drum up demand for American cherries.</p><p>Eunice Yoon went to Shanghai to speak with him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEITH HU, USA NORTHWEST CHERRY GROWERS INTL. DIR.: This box right here is an ideal quality for the Chinese consumers.</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Despite the trade war, the Seattle native Keith Hu is making his best pitch for American cherries.</p><p>HU: China is very important for the farmers, to Northwest Cherry Growers.</p><p>YOON: This is the second largest wholesale fruit market in China and every year, Keith Hu comes to Shanghai to talk to importers to get a sense of what the appetite is in China for U.S. cherries.</p><p>China is a critical market for the cherry growers, making up more than a third of total exports. So they feared the worst when Beijing raised the retaliatory tariffs to 50 percent last year on their cherries, forcing cost up on average over 60 percent. Overall volumes plunged by 40 percent from before the trade war, but the farmers are still making money.</p><p>So far, Chinese importers like George Liu have been willing to eat the extra cost.</p><p>GEORGE LIU, FRUTACLOUD CEO: But because of the tariff, the U.S. cherry right now in the market needs to be selling at a higher price. So, in the end, it will reduce demand a little bit, but Chinese people are willing to pay for premium product.</p><p>YOON: To keep people here buying, Hu is tapping into the Chinese desire to live a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>HU: We try to push the health message of cherries and the lifestyle of U.S. and Northwest. It`s -- we try to sell them the idea of live the pristine environment with fresh air, fresh water.</p><p>YOON: But he still is losing sleep over what might happen if the trade war continues. There`s new competition from cheaper cherries from Turkey and Uzbekistan.</p><p>HU: There`s a lot of berries, other fruits coming from other countries. These are our competitions. I mean, we are fighting an uphill battle. So with the tariff, it just made our problems even bigger.</p><p>YOON: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Shanghai.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Bill Griffeth. Thanks so much for watching. Have a great evening.

The aerospace company says it could suspend production of its 737 MAX, and  it posts its largest-ever quarterly loss.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digging a hole.  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is considered a barometer of the  global economy, and right now, it`s feeling the pain of the slowdown.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Friending Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  Revenues are up and users are not going  anywhere as the company tries to push past all of the regulatory pressures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Wednesday, July 24th.</p><p>And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.  Sue is off  tonight.</p><p>The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq both closed at record highs today, but the Dow was  dragged lower in part because of Boeing (NYSE:BA), which reported a massive  loss for the second quarter.  It also warned about something that no  shareholder wants to hear about, that it may have to halt production of its  737 MAX if the grounding of the jet liner drags on much longer.  That  pushed the stock 3 percent lower in today`s trade.</p><p>Phil LeBeau is on the story for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With the 737 MAX  grounded for months, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg says his  company could shut down the MAX assembly line if the current plan for  recertifying the plane this fall is pushed back even further.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, BOEING CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  If any of the timeline  assumptions change significantly from start of the fourth quarter return to  service, then we`ll have to evaluate alternatives, and those alternatives  could include different production rates.  They could include a temporary  shutdown of the line.  Not something we want to do, but an alternative that  we have to prepare for.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Stopping production could mean temporarily laying off thousands of  workers, which could have a ripple effect on suppliers around the country.   It all comes down to when the FAA and other regulators say the MAX is safe  to take off.  A software fix for the plane is being tested in simulators,  but if it is approved and airlines like Southwest can resume MAX flights  this year, then Boeing (NYSE:BA) will keep building 42 MAXes a month and  plan to ramp up production next year.</p><p>JIM CORRIDORE, CFRA RESEARCH:  If they are able to relaunch this plane and  it`s as they say the safest plane to ever fly once they bring it back into  service, then their reputation can be preserved.  They are battling for  their very existence, for their very reputation right now.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin weighed in on the MAX  controversy and what the president thinks of the beleaguered plane.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think as you know, the  president has said he is concerned about the 737 MAX.  Quite frankly, he  thinks they should bring back the 757 and look at selling 757s.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Boeing (NYSE:BA) is not bringing back the 757.  In fact, it  stopped building that plane in 2004 and reviving it would cost billions of  dollars.  Instead, the focus right now is on getting the MAX back in the  air by the end of the year.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You just saw Jim Corridore in Phil`s story there.  He`s  industrials analyst to CFRA Research, joining us to talk about what he  believes to be the best and worst case scenarios for Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p>Jim, good to see you again.  Welcome back.</p><p>CORRIDORE:  Thanks, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Let`s start with the best case scenario.  What do you think it  is?</p><p>CORRIDORE:  Best case scenario is they`re very close to having the software  ready to go.  They bring it to the FAA sometime early in September.  The  FAA, who is at Boeing`s side through the whole process, in the simulators  with Boeing (NYSE:BA), approves the planes and they get back to flying  early October.  Then Boeing (NYSE:BA) can start delivering the planes  parked at facilities all over the country and start booking these revenues  and getting this thing moving again.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Worst case scenario, how bad could it be?</p><p>CORRIDORE:  Yes, the worst case scenario is the FAA finds a problem with  the software fix, pushes back against Boeing (NYSE:BA), says, we`re not  ready to -- we`re not ready to bring the planes back out again, and Boeing  (NYSE:BA) has to halt the production line, has to furlough some workers.   Their suppliers will not be able to continue to produce at the rate they`re  producing.  It causes a whole global supply chain effect, that affects more  than just Boeing (NYSE:BA) but a lot of companies.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Let`s talk reality.  What do you think is most  likely to happen and what`s the impact going to be on the company?</p><p>CORRIDORE:  Yes, I think Boeing (NYSE:BA) was very careful not to announce  a timeline for return of the plane until they felt it was ready.  Last  week, they said they felt it was going to be Q4.  Today, they said they  thought it was going to be early Q4.</p><p>So, I think that they`re fairly confident that they have the right fix in  place.  They`ve been testing it now for quite sometime.  And I think the  most likely scenario is that before the end of 2009, that plane is flying  in the air again.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Even though some regulators here and abroad have said quietly  that they don`t think it flies until next year sometime.</p><p>CORRIDORE:  Yes, I think that once the FAA gets onboard, Boeing (NYSE:BA)  is going to have a coordinated effort with European regulators, with  Brazilian, all over the world.</p><p>Once the plane is deemed to be safe, I think that there will be a push out  to get everyone on board.  I think they will be able to do so.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Jim Corridore with CFRA Research -- again, thanks  for joining us tonight.</p><p>CORRIDORE:  Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is having a tough time  navigating the slow economy right now globally.  The maker of big machinery  missed Wall Street earnings estimates and said that profit for the year  would be at the lower end of its previous guidance.  Cat shares fell about  4-1/2 percent today, making it the worst performing stock in the Dow.</p><p>Seema Mody has more on Caterpillar`s quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT)  is finding it tough to do business.  A slowdown in the U.S. shale boom and  higher manufacturing costs cut into profits.  Revenue from its oil and gas  division fell double digits, due in part to weakness in the Permian Basin  as some customers pulled back on making large capital investments.   Volatile commodity prices didn`t help either.</p><p>Over in Asia, growth remains a challenge.  Perhaps most concerning:  weakness in China which was once a key market for the industrial  heavyweight.</p><p>ROB WERTHEIMER, MELIUS RESEARCH FOUNDING PARTNER:  Cat`s had many, many  years of gaining share and doing very well in China, selling durable  products and good stuff and several months of losing share again.  So,  whether that`s related to geopolitical tensions or just pricing, it`s not  yet clear.</p><p>MODY:  Tariffs are pressing margins and winning new business in China is  not as easy as it used to be.</p><p>JIM UMPLEBY, CATERPILLAR CEO:  We expect continued pressure with China  partly offset by growth in other areas of Asia Pacific.</p><p>MODY:  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) did reference strength in construction, which  makes up a bulk of its sales.  It`s also more positive on North America,  though still sees weakness in the housing market.  But one thing is clear:  if the global economy worsens, the industrial sector is headed for more  pain.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And as we mentioned at the top of the broadcast, the S&amp;P and the  Nasdaq reached all-time highs today.  Chip stocks rallied and investors  essentially brushed off regulatory concerns facing big tech right now.  And  we`ll have more on that in a moment.</p><p>But, first, the final numbers today with the industrial average down 79  points, we are at 27,269.  Nasdaq was up 70.  The S&amp;P added 14.</p><p>So far, the greatest regulatory pressure from Washington has been on  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), but you would never know it by looking at its  quarterly results today.  The social media company reported better than  expected earnings and revenue was up sharply.  But the stock was volatile  in after hours trading tonight.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has details of Facebook`s results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) continues to grow revenue faster than expected, even as big  regulatory issues weigh on the company.  Facebook`s generating more revenue  per user than predicted.  This as the company takes an additional $2  billion charge as a result of the FTC fine for privacy violations, coming  in at the highest end of the range Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) gave last quarter.</p><p>The company notes that the online tech industry and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  have received increased regulatory scrutiny in the past quarter, announcing  that in June Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was informed that the FTC opened an  antitrust investigation into the company.  This in addition to the  Department of Justice`s announcement yet that it will begin an antitrust  review of market-leading online platforms.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg saying we are investing in building stronger privacy  protections for everyone and on delivering new experiences for the people  who use our services.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  That FTC investigation that Julia just mentioned was officially  settled today.  The commission fined Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) $5 billion for  its mishandling of user data after it was learned that political consultant  Cambridge Analytica had secretly gained access to 87 million Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) accounts.  The settlement orders Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to create  new layers of oversight and CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be held personally  responsible for making sure that that happens.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH SIMONS, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN:  I think Mark Zuckerberg  is held personally accountable.  He is signing the order.  He is named  specifically in the order.  The order requires him personally to certify  that the company is in compliance with our order quarterly, and if he files  false certifications, then he is subjecting himself to civil and criminal  penalties.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, the FTC is not Facebook`s only headache.  As we have been  reporting, the Justice Department has started an antitrust review of some  of Silicon Valley`s biggest tech giants to determine if they have purposely  been stifling competition.  The companies being reviewed have not been  named the announcement, but most believe them to be Facebook (NASDAQ:FB),  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>And tonight, we take a look at what the DOJ may be targeting at each  company.  Back with us is Julia Boorstin on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the second largest digital ad platform  with 29 percent of U.S. digital ad spending between Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  and Instagram.  And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the most dominant social  platform when it comes to user`s time.  Americans spend nearly 40 minutes  daily on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) plus almost half an hour on Instagram,  dwarfing the time spent on Snapchat.</p><p>And as the DOJ looks at how Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has leveraged the power of  its large network, it has become a force in other areas including mobile  communication and news.</p><p>Facebook`s Messenger and WhatsApp together have nearly 3 billion monthly  active users.  By comparison, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has 900 million active  iPhones.  And over half American adults say they get news on Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) or Instagram.</p><p>The question is whether Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is unfairly leveraging its  social media power to dominate in new areas, ranging from online dating to  movie ticket sales to digital currency.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now to Deirdre Bosa with a look at the issues surrounding Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Three reasons Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) could get caught in the regulatory crosshairs.</p><p>First, it controls nearly 40 percent of all U.S. online retail sales.  EBay  is a distant second with just 6 percent of the market.</p><p>Second, potential competition with third party merchants on its own  platform.  CEO Jeff Bezos said earlier this year that third party sales  that is small and medium businesses who use Amazon`s platform made up more  than half of total sales.  Critics argue that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could  use data from these sellers to unfairly compete against them and push its  own private label products from diapers to electronics to toilet paper.</p><p>Third, regulators could zero in on the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime fly  wheel.  If Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is using money from other business units to  subsidize video or music services, how can other companies that do have to  make a profit compete?</p><p>Deirdre Bosa, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And, finally, as we mentioned, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) parent  Alphabet and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may also be under scrutiny.</p><p>Here is Josh Lipton.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  could be in the government`s crosshairs in part because of its estimated 80  percent market share in search.  Antitrust officials will have to decide if  that`s a monopoly harming consumers.</p><p>But Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) officials recently testified on Capitol Hill,  disputing that argument.</p><p>ADAM COHEN, GOOGLE ECONOMIC POLICY DIRECTOR:  For example, when consumers  search for information, they can choose among Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Yelp,  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Travelocity and many other companies like these  that consistently report strong user growth.  If you don`t want to use  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), there are many other information providers available.</p><p>LIPTON:  And then there is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  I don`t think anybody reasonable is going to come to  the conclusion Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a monopoly.  Our share is much more  modest.  We don`t have a dominant position in any market.</p><p>LIPTON:  But what about the company`s App Store?  Critics of Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google`s App Stores argue that the companies favor their  own apps, and as a result a whopping 70 percent of all in-app spending goes  to the tech giants.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also controls access to the app  store.</p><p>But some analysts think an antitrust case could be tough to make because it  is not clear to them how the app store actually harms consumers given the  breadth and depth of competition on the store itself, they say, and within  certain categories like gaming where some apps are free and some aren`t.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So how concerned should shareholders be about this Justice  Department review?</p><p>Joining us tonight is Mark Lehmann.  He`s president at JMP Securities.</p><p>Good to see you again, Mark.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MARK LEHMANN, JMP SECURITIES PRESIDENT:  Thanks, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I guess the short answer from you is they shouldn`t have to  worry much.  Why?</p><p>LEHMANN:  Well, I mean you`re going to be worried because there will be a  lot of headlines coming up, and I think it is going to continue to pay  attention to.  But like we saw with the Cambridge Analytical scare over the  last year, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) had the all-time high a year ago about  now when they reported second quarter earnings, there were a lot of  headlines and a lot of legislative meetings, but really nothing has  happened except some self-regulation, frankly, a slap on the wrist on this  $5 billion fine.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>LEHMANN:  I think the self-regulation is more likely and I think you`re  going to see lots of headlines and lots of bluster but little coming out of  Congress and from the legislators, yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Let`s look at each company and see where the vulnerabilities may  lie.  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), I mean, they clearly have been under the most  intense scrutiny as pertains to their user data and the data breaches and  all of that.  I mean, but at the same time, we just learned today that the  users haven`t fled at all.</p><p>LEHMANN:  Well, you know, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) always reminds me of, you  know, Hall &amp; Oates who sold a couple hundred million albums and they said  no one admitted to buying one.  Nobody admits to being on Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) all day, yet the data says they`re on 40 minutes a day on that,  and if my kids are any example on Instagram as well.</p><p>People are not going to flee that platform.  It`s where they get their  news.  It`s where they get their social engagement.  And that`s a really  hard thing to legislate.  And I think that`s why it`s not going to change  going forward.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as we heard, may be most vulnerable when  it comes to their third party sales and so forth and the strong-arming that  they do there and the data they`re able to accumulate.</p><p>LEHMANN:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) certainly has an issue there.  I think  they`re going to continue to gain the market share that they have on the  retail side, but it`s very hard to legislate where people go.  And I think  you`re going to continue to see consumers want that, maybe some additional  choice and maybe there will be some small slap on the wrist that they will  probably self-legislate.</p><p>But I just don`t see Congress being able to legislate where people`s  eyeballs go and where they want to buy things.  It`s been historically a  hard thing for Congress and the Justice Department to legislate.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) may also be most vulnerable as it pertains  to search results and, you know, the juggernaut that they are in that area  there.</p><p>LEHMANN:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) obviously has an overwhelming share.  In  fact, it has become a verb.  We`re going to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) that  search.  So, I think it is another area we will have great headlines and  they could probably rank choice some of the data that does come up, but it  may favor some of Google`s top advertisers or other consumers, but they  really have to pay attention to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) because they have the  juggernaut for market share.</p><p>So, I think, again, all of these stocks will be in the headlines for I  think some time on this data but I just don`t see Congress being able to  legislate where people put eyeballs and clicks decide to go.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Very quickly on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  I mean, you know, Tim Cook  has said they`re not a monopoly, but what about the App Store and the  tremendous iron fist that they wield there?</p><p>LEHMANN:  I think it is somewhat similar.  You have a consumer who goes to  that App Store constantly and is looking for new ways to access companies  and data and products, et cetera.  There probably will be some self- regulation where they decide to put certain things on top of others,  certain things at different points on the App Store.  But like you said, it  is an open marketplace and the Congress and the legislators and people who  regulate like marketplaces, they will probably find a way to self-regulate.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.</p><p>LEHMANN:  I just think that App Store is here to stay.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And for the record, I was a big fan of Hall and Oates myself.</p><p>Mark Lehmann --</p><p>LEHMANN:  You and me both, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mark Lehmann with JMP Securities, thanks again for joining us  tonight.</p><p>LEHMANN:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, does the most recent budget deal show that the  deficits don`t matter anymore?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  In the news today, Queen Elizabeth officially appointed Boris  Johnson the prime minister of the United Kingdom.  Johnson immediately  began forming a government, one that he vows will lead the U.K. out of the  European Union.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  The people who bet against Britain  are going to lose their shirts because we`re going to restore trust in our  democracy and we`re going to fulfill the repeated promises of parliament to  the people and come out of the E.U. on October 31st, no ifs or buts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now to the U.S. economy and that recently-agreed to budget deal.   As we told you, it raises spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over  the next two years.  Now, there was a time when Wall Street and Washington  worried quite a bit about debt and deficits.  Do they still matter?</p><p>Steve Liesman went in search of some answers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The $22 trillion  size of the U.S. debt is astronomical no matter how you measure it.  In  fact, it`s equivalent to the estimate to the total number of stars in not  one, not two, but 22 Andromeda galaxies.  That`s the closest neighbor to  the Milky Way, and the debt is growing.  It doubles roughly every 10 years,  is now set to rise by roughly $1 trillion a year if the recent budget deal  is enacted into law.</p><p>So, it seems strange to ask, do the trillions upon trillions really matter?   Surprisingly, the new trend among politicians on both sides in Washington  is that the debt doesn`t matter and neither investors nor economists  entirely disagree, at least for now.</p><p>First, while the debt is doubled, the government`s cost of borrowing has  fallen from 6 percent in 2000 to around 2 percent today for a ten-year  bond.  So, larger debt has not pushed up interest rates.</p><p>Second, the size of the debt doesn`t appear to have dragged much on growth.   Annual government deficits decline in times of strong growth and they rise  during recessions.  This is in part by design as the government spends more  to kickstart the economy.</p><p>One of the most influential recent developments was a paper presented last  year by former IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard.  He argued that as  long as a country`s interest cost is below its nominal growth rate,  countries can or even should borrow more.  In the U.S., it`s like the  government invests at 2 percent -- that`s the cost of a ten-year -- and  gets returns of 4 percent.  That`s about where nominal growth is for the  U.S.</p><p>Net return, assuming the money is invested well, 2 percent.</p><p>So is all of that old thinking wrong that deficits actually matter?  It  might sound like it today, but perhaps not forever.</p><p>DAVID MCINTOSH, CLUB FOR GROWTH:  This may be less of a problem now when we  are in very good economic times, but it is sort of loading the shotgun  aimed back at our economy if in the future, interest rates have to go back  up and then this tremendous debt service will dramatically limit the  ability or force us to borrow even more at a very costly rate.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Higher rates could raise the cost of servicing the debt and  crowding spending on things like education and defense.  The U.S. has  trillions of dollars of unfunded liabilities in health and social security  costs it soon will be paying.  High debt levels also could limit the  government to spend more to help the economy in the next recession.</p><p>In Washington, the prevailing political opinion is to ignore all of that in  favor of bigger spending and lower taxes today.  If rates remain low and  the economy continues to grow, it`s all hard to argue against.  And that  may be the best argument for at least some fiscal prudence today.  No one  knows quite how long all of the stars will align as perfectly as they are  today.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  UPS delivers for investors and that`s where we begin tonight`s  \"Market Focus\", with the company posting better than expected earnings and  revenue, and it raised its guidance as well.  UPS also said it expects to  get FAA approval for drone delivery by end of the year.  And to compete  with rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS will also be offering a seven-day delivery  service next year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID ABNEY, UPS CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  As a company, we had to realize that  Sunday, Saturday and Sunday is just like another day of the week.  We chose  to maximum partners in Michael`s, CVS (NYSE:CVS), Advanced Auto Parts and  also for Sunday delivery, enhancing share posts with USPS.</p><p>So, with those combinations and with our network, we feel that we have  another good offering for our customers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Stock rose more than 8 percent today to $114.39.</p><p>Health insurer Anthem`s results topped expectations and the company also  raised its full-year guidance, but Anthem said that costs connected to its  Medicaid business were higher than expected and shares fell more than 4.5  percent today to $288.91.</p><p>VF Corps beat estimates, thanks to sales increases of its Van sneakers and  its North Face clothing lines.  The apparel maker also raised its full year  guidance.  Stock was up more than 1 percent to $89.33 today.</p><p>AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) beat revenue estimates and earnings were in line in growth in  its wireless and media sector that helped offset continued declines in  DirecTV subscriptions.  AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) shares rose more than 3.5 percent to  $33.24.</p><p>And then after the bell, strong sales of Ford`s F-150 trucks and other SUVs  were not enough to offset the automaker`s cost to restructure its global  business.  As a result, Ford missed earnings expectations and issued soft  guidance.</p><p>Shares initially dropped sharply after hours tonight but they did close the  regular session up more than 1.5 percent to $10.33.</p><p>And coming up, turning sour.  Why the trade war with China is the pits for  one American farmer.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin today confirmed he and other  trade negotiators will meet with Chinese counterparts next week in  Shanghai.  That`s certainly welcome news to American farmers who have been  hurt by tariffs, but one farmer is not sitting around waiting for them to  end.  He took it upon himself to head to China to try to drum up demand for  American cherries.</p><p>Eunice Yoon went to Shanghai to speak with him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEITH HU, USA NORTHWEST CHERRY GROWERS INTL. DIR.:  This box right here is  an ideal quality for the Chinese consumers.</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Despite the trade war,  the Seattle native Keith Hu is making his best pitch for American cherries.</p><p>HU:  China is very important for the farmers, to Northwest Cherry Growers.</p><p>YOON:  This is the second largest wholesale fruit market in China and every  year, Keith Hu comes to Shanghai to talk to importers to get a sense of  what the appetite is in China for U.S. cherries.</p><p>China is a critical market for the cherry growers, making up more than a  third of total exports.  So they feared the worst when Beijing raised the  retaliatory tariffs to 50 percent last year on their cherries, forcing cost  up on average over 60 percent.  Overall volumes plunged by 40 percent from  before the trade war, but the farmers are still making money.</p><p>So far, Chinese importers like George Liu have been willing to eat the  extra cost.</p><p>GEORGE LIU, FRUTACLOUD CEO:  But because of the tariff, the U.S. cherry  right now in the market needs to be selling at a higher price.  So, in the  end, it will reduce demand a little bit, but Chinese people are willing to  pay for premium product.</p><p>YOON:  To keep people here buying, Hu is tapping into the Chinese desire to  live a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>HU:  We try to push the health message of cherries and the lifestyle of  U.S. and Northwest.  It`s -- we try to sell them the idea of live the  pristine environment with fresh air, fresh water.</p><p>YOON:  But he still is losing sleep over what might happen if the trade war  continues.  There`s new competition from cheaper cherries from Turkey and  Uzbekistan.</p><p>HU:  There`s a lot of berries, other fruits coming from other countries.   These are our competitions.  I mean, we are fighting an uphill battle.  So  with the tariff, it just made our problems even bigger.</p><p>YOON:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Shanghai.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I`m Bill  Griffeth.  Thanks so much for watching.  Have a great evening.  We`ll see  you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet and Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC), some of the largest companies in the sector, are out with  their quarterly results just one day after the Nasdaq hit a record.  The  group has been a major driving force behind the market`s rally, despite the  threat of regulation from lawmakers, and being the target of inquiries from  government agencies.</p><p>But let`s start with the biggest of them all, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  The  company`s record profit streak is over.  The online retailer reported mixed  results, missing earnings expectations but exceeding revenue forecasts.   Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) cited high shipping costs and weaker than expected  growth in its clouds computing business.  Investors were disappointed and  sent the stock lower in initial after-hours trading.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And then there`s Alphabet, the parent company of Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), easily topped earnings expectations and reported a rebound  in revenue growth, thanks to strength in its advertising business.   Investors cheered in initial afterhours trading tonight, sending that stock  sharply higher.</p><p>We have two reports for you tonight.  In a moment, it will be Josh Lipton  on Alphabet, but we begin with Deirdre Bosa on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big question for  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) this quarter was could they reaction re-accelerate  growth as it goes into spending mode with price initiatives like one-day  shipping?  Total sales did grow over the quarter.  But at 20 percent, it  was still short of the levels of the last few years.</p><p>Meanwhile, profits took a hit, missing Wall Street`s expectation and coming  down from record levels.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also telling investors to  expect more investment ahead as it continues to implement one-day shipping.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Alphabet stock has  been lagging the market this year, in part because of concerns about  slowing growth, but the company just said its net revenues actually  accelerated, jumping 21 percent.</p><p>Oppenheimer`s Jason Helfstein says a lot of hedge funds were short Alphabet  too which could explain the move.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, here is why these reports are so important.  When taken  together, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet make up 13 percent of the  Nasdaq composite index, and when you add in Dow component Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC), together they make up 7 percent of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>HERERA:  And that brings us to Intel`s quarterly results, which blew past  earnings estimates and topped revenue forecast.  The semiconductor company  also confirmed that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is acquiring the majority of its  smartphone business for $1 billion.  That sent the stock higher in initial  afterhours trading.</p><p>Jon Fortt has more on Intel`s results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Chip giant Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC) out with a report for the second quarter that beat on the top  and bottom line, sales just stronger than expected.  That led to an  improved outlook for the full year.  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Bob Swan  saying it was really the growth in data, just data applications, the demand  for data, that powered the PC business, as well as the cloud business which  uses Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) server chips.  And that`s what led to the  outperformance in expectations.</p><p>Now, at the same time as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced earnings, also  announced it was selling its smartphone modem business, the majority of it  to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for a billion dollars.  That includes 2,200  employees as well as facilities and patents.  That`s a big deal that was  expected.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  On Wall Street, the Fed was back in focus today as well, with  investors growing concerned about the central bank`s next move after this  morning`s strong durable goods report and also comments from the head of  the European Central Bank.  Orders for long-lasting goods rose by 2 percent  in June.  That was the fastest rate of growth we have seen since August of  last year.  It was well above expectations, and it could mean an upward  revision of GDP forecasts and a less aggressive interest rate cut from the  Fed next week.</p><p>Also this morning, the European Central Bank`s president Mario Draghi left  the door open for interest rate cut later this year, but he also said there  was not a significant risk of a recession in that region.  So, investors  hoping for a big rate cut next week turned cautious.  The Dow fell by 128  points to 21,140.  Nasdaq was down 82.  The S&amp;P slid by 15.</p><p>HERERA:  So what will that strong durable goods report and comments from  the head of the European Central Bank mean for the fed when it meets next  week?</p><p>We are joined by Rob Martin, senior U.S. economist at UBS.</p><p>Welcome, Rob.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>ROB MARTIN, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, UBS:  Thank you for having me.  I  appreciate it.</p><p>HERERA:  You are expecting a cut of at least 25 basis points.  Does what  happened in Europe today with Mr. Drahgi`s comments or the durable goods  report change your attitude about what is going to happen?</p><p>MARTIN:  Let`s focus on the data first.  You know, this morning`s report on  durable goods was one more piece of evidence that the U.S. economy actually  really is doing quite well.  It`s growing nicely.  We have had a string of  strong reports.</p><p>So far, the Fed has looked through them but the evidence is accumulating.   That`s going to reduce the risk of a big cut.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And also, Fed Chairman Powell has been mentioning the global  economy, which clearly is slowing down -- China, parts of Asia, and even  Europe at this point.  So a rate cut next week, would that be not just for  our economy but for the global economy as well?</p><p>MARTIN:  Well, it is not so much that they would cut rates for the global  economy.  It is that they worry that whatever is dragging down those other  economies, whatever is weighing on growth in Europe, whatever is weighing  on growth in Asia is also going to affect the U.S. economy, both through  the direct ties through trade, for example, and because the U.S. is subject  to the same kind of uncertainties.</p><p>The Fed already believes there`s a confidence shop working its way through  the economy, the weakness in Europe is one of the reasons they really want  to cut rates, but the strength of U.S. data, the strength of the U.S.  economy makes it difficult for them to go big.  That`s why there`s this  debate between 50 basis points or 25 basis points.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>MARTIN:  We see 50, but 25 is clearly on the table.  Either way, they do  want to provide accommodation.</p><p>HERERA:  A lot of times the market looks to what the Fed says after its  actions.  In other words, the statement.  Are you expecting any major  changes in the language that the Fed uses?</p><p>MARTIN:  No, we think they will be pretty comfortable with their language.   Whether they go 25 or 50, they don`t want to signal that they`re completely  done with rate cuts because they`re still nervous about the outlook.  They  want to wait and see how the data is going to evolve, and so I suspect in  their new language that they will be closely monitoring the economy coming  into the September meeting as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I mean, you have to admit, it is a rather interesting time for  them to be cutting with the consumers so strong right now, the employment  picture the best in 50 years, and yet inflation is not where they want it  to be.</p><p>MARTIN:  That`s right.  So inflation simply refuses to move up to 2  percent.  They`ve got these worries about foreign growth.  They`ve got  worries about that confidence shock.  This is what is driving them.</p><p>So, it feels as if there`s some tension between what they want to do  cutting rates and what we`re seeing in the economy.  But to be fair to  them, that low inflation and those real concerns about foreign growth push  them to some kind of easing in the near term.</p><p>HERERA:  We will see.  Rob Martin with UBS -- Rob, thanks.</p><p>MARTIN:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  More earnings now.</p><p>3M (NYSE:MMM) is feeling the impact of a slowing global economy right now.   The company saw its profits drop more than 30 percent, sales slid as well.   The industrial conglomerate cited weaker demand from China.  In response,  it cut production and reduced inventory, but it did reaffirm its previous  outlook for the whole year, and the stock fell just a fraction in today`s  session.</p><p>HERERA:  The ongoing grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX is rippling  through the airline industry.  American Airlines and Southwest both  reported better than expected earnings, but also said the results in the  second half could be impacted.  Southwest now says it won`t fly the MAX  before January of next year.  That resulted in a mixed finish for the  stocks.</p><p>Phil LeBeau is in Ft. Worth, Texas, for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The 737 MAX headache  for American and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has turned into a problem  that is changing how the carriers will operate the rest of this year.</p><p>GARY KELLY, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  It is not a good situation.   We`re not happy about it.  You saw here in the second quarter it cost us  $175 million.  And that will be more in the third quarter.</p><p>LEBEAU:  With 34 MAX models grounded for at least a couple more months,  Southwest says its capacity will drop in the second half of 2019.  That  makes the most of a smaller than expected fleet, Southwest will stop flying  out of Newark and it will focus its New York operations on LaGuardia  Airport.</p><p>As airlines keep extending how long it will be before they expect to fly  the MAX, they are left with more questions than answers about the  beleaguered plane`s future.</p><p>DOUG PARKER, AMERICAN AIRLINES CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  We remain in limbo as  everybody else does, as we wait to hear from the FAA, as to when they come  to the conclusion that the aircraft is ready to go back in service again.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Boeing (NYSE:BA) will pay billions of dollars for the hundreds of  MAX planes that have been grounded.  For airlines, the money will not be  enough to cure MAX issues, expected to linger well into next year.</p><p>KELLY:  We`re unhappy that it has taken so long and we`re in the dark on  it, just like you are, on a number of technical matters.</p><p>LEBEAU:  American and Southwest believe they will eventually get past the  grounding of the MAX, but it won`t be quick, nor will it be easy, and it  will likely take well into next year to repair the damage of not having the  plane.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Ft. Worth, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, today, an FAA official said there is still no  timeline for the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX to return to service.  The acting  administrator said that when the airplane`s issues are addressed and the  MAX is safe, it will return to service.  And, yesterday, Boeing (NYSE:BA)  CEO told analyst he was confident the MAX could be back in service as early  as October.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and  Downgrades\".</p><p>UPS was upgraded to buy from neutral at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)/Merrill  Lynch.  The analyst cites what he calls ecommerce revolution and the  company`s plan to expand deliveries to seven days.  The price target is  $130.  The stock rose 3 percent to $118.25.</p><p>AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) was upgraded to neutral from under perform at Credit Suisse.   The analyst says video subscriber losses have peaked.  The price target is  $29, and that stock rose more than 1.5 percent to $33.81.</p><p>And Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was downgraded to neutral from buy at  Buckingham.  The analyst cites a lack of catalyst that would drive the  stock in the near term and sees a higher probability of lower earnings  growth.  The price target is $140.  Despite the downgrade though, the  shares rose 2 percent to $134.71.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, if they build it, builders say they`ll come.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I`m Diana Olick in San  Antonio, Texas.  I`ll have a new twist on the fastest growing segment of  the housing market coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  In Washington, the House passed the debt ceiling and the budget  deal.  It sets discretionary spending at about $1.4 trillion.  The  agreement also suspends the borrowing limit for two years.  That measure  now goes to the Senate, which is expected to pass it in the coming days.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Nissan plans to layout more than 12,000 workers.  That`s 9  percent of its global workforce.  The restructuring comes after the  automaker saw profits essentially disappear, falling more than 98 percent  compared to last year.  The company has faced a number of challenges, not  the least of which is the arrest in Japan of its former chairman, Carlos  Ghosn, eight months ago, and the tensions that caused with Nissan`s partner  Renault, which Ghosn also ran.</p><p>HERERA:  It was a rough day in the market for Ford following its earnings  report, which we told you about last night.  The automaker issued a  disappointing forecast for the year.  Analysts are concerned that the line- up of vehicles launched into next year could further delay an improvement  in profitability.  The stock fell more than 7 percent in today`s session.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Clearly, the auto industry is in transition as it cuts back on  the number of traditional sedans that it makes and gets ready to produce  more electric and autonomous vehicles.  What does that do to earnings in  the meantime?</p><p>Joining us is Matt DeLorenzo.  He`s with Kelley Blue Book.</p><p>Matt, good to see you again.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MATT DELORENZO, KELLEY BLUE BOOK SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR:  Great to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  It is a transition period right now.  I mean, Ford is targeting  2022 to be able to introduce some of these electric vehicles that it plans  to produce, but in the meantime what happens?  I mean, they have to cut  back here and there and invest an awful lot of money.</p><p>DELORENZO:  Well, they do.  They`re playing it out in terms of the  transition because of their scale.  Their biggest selling vehicle is a  full-size pickup truck and that`s what the market is demanding right now,  those and crossover SUVs.</p><p>So in the short term they bet heavily on the truck market.  I`m sure  they`re going to see some returns from it because the margins typically in  that part of the market are a lot higher than they are in the traditional  sedan market.</p><p>HERERA:  But as Bill mentioned, they either have to invest a lot of money  or find some other avenue to -- to the direction that the rest of the auto  industry is going in.  Does that mean partnerships?  Does it mean mergers?   What do you think?</p><p>DELORENZO:  I think in the short term or medium long-range term, they are  going to be relying on partnerships.  The deal with VW to use the MEB  platform which will be primarily for the car side of the business, and then  they also have that $500 million investment in Rivian which builds electric  trucks and SUVs.</p><p>So think what they`re trying to do is layoff a lot of development costs and  infrastructure costs in terms of production facilities to these partners  and hope that the demand for electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles  rises to where they can make that switch over internally and develop and  build those vehicles on their own.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You anticipated my next question.  What do you think the demand  will be for those electric vehicles?  I mean I guess -- I don`t know.  It  may depend on how old you are and your experience with those cars, right?</p><p>DELORENZO:  I think that`s true.  I think in the short term, electrics will  tend to move quicker up in sales.  There`s still a lot of regulatory  hurdles that have to be surmounted before we can get to full level five  autonomous vehicles being on the road.</p><p>Once we get to that point, then we look at how the ownership model is going  to change.  And if people stop owning cars or start sharing cars, there  could be a drop in production, and that could have an impact on earnings  down the road.  They could be in a position where they`re not building as  many vehicles because not that many vehicles will be needed.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>DELORENZO:  Since people will be sharing them and they will be returning  around the clock.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So many questions, so many changes coming, we know that.</p><p>Matt DeLorenzo with Kelley Blue Book -- again, thanks for joining us  tonight.</p><p>DELORENZO:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Strong results give Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) a jolt.  And that`s  where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".  The company topped estimates  thanks to increase in same-store sales here in the U.S. and globally.   Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) added about 400,000 members to its U.S. loyalty  program and it raised its full year guidance.  Shares initially rose in  after-hours trading.  They closed the regular session up a fraction at  $90.98.</p><p>Also after the bell, T-Mobile posted mixed results as it beat earnings  estimates but it fell short in revenue.  The mobile carrier saw an increase  in subscription and raised its guidance.  The shares were volatile in the  after-hours and they closed the regular session down a fraction to $79.91.</p><p>AB InBev beat estimates thanks to seeing beer sales grow, the fastest in  five years.  The world`s largest brewer also had more consumers buying  higher-priced products as the company has been trying to sell more  expensive premium drinks.  The shares rose more than 4 percent to $99.49.</p><p>Bristol-Myers topped estimates fuelled by strong sells of its Eliquis blood  thinner and Orencia arthritis treatment.  The drugmaker also lifted its  full year guidance.  Shares rose 5 percent today to $45.40.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) beat earnings estimates but  fell short on revenue expectations.  The company added more customers to  its high-speed Internet service but saw a decline in its video and phone  businesses.  Shares were down a fraction to $44.61, and we need to mention  that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent of NBCUniversal which  produces this program.  Hershey topped estimated.</p><p>Hershey`s topped estimates but the candy maker gave weak guidance due to a  wholesale price increase of its single served products, which affects about  a third of its total sales.  Hersey`s raised prices to offset higher labor  and raw material costs.  Shares rose 2 percent to $149.72.</p><p>An increase in travel bookings helped Royal Caribbean beat estimates, but  the cruise operator lowered guidance partly due to cancelled trips to Cuba  because of the return of those U.S. travel restrictions to that country.   Shares were down almost 2 percent to $113.04.</p><p>And Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) fell short of earnings estimates due to  what the company called a tougher consumer environment and slower sales in  China.  The maker of the Invisalign braces also issued weak guidance.   Shares plummeted nearly 27 percent to $200.90.</p><p>HERERA:  Mortgage rates are close to a three-year low.  According to  Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage average 3.73 percent.  Now,  just a year ago, that average rate was 4.5 percent.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And despite those lower mortgage rates, demand for rental homes  is growing and builders are stepping up to meet that need, redesigning and  reimagining the single family rental.  They`re becoming landlords in the  process.</p><p>Diana Olick is in San Antonio for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>OLICK:  Millennial Taylor Walters and Paree Dilkes want to get out of their  rental apartment and into a larger single family home.</p><p>PAREE DILKES, PROSPECTIVE RENTER:  Yes, we have been looking online for  months now for whether we want to buy or we want to rent, and this is  definitely up our alley.</p><p>OLICK:  This is a brand-new community of 250 detached homes built entirely  as rentals.  While some builders will sell a few to investors as rentals,  it is one of the gated rental only projects.  The brainchild of Mark Wolf,  founder and CEO of AHV Communities partnering with Bristol Group.</p><p>MARK WOLF, AHV COMMUNITIES CEO:  About 93 percent of the apartment stock  consists of studios, one and two bedrooms, few three bedrooms.  We saw a  growing need out of the downturn to provide three and four bedroom homes  for the renter`s society.</p><p>OLICK:  He is basically taking the vertical apartment model and turning it  horizontal, offering three and four bedroom homes with two car garages but  including high-end amenities like a gym, common areas, a dog park and  washing station.</p><p>The rents are comparable to nearby apartments and the maintenance is all on  site, lowering costs for AHV.  Wolf says he does not intend to sell the  homes any time soon.</p><p>WOLF:  We believe in the long term cash flow game.  So if you hold these  properties for ten-plus years or even seven-plus years, the residual cash  flow is worth more than the sale one time.</p><p>OLICK:  Last year about 43,000 homes were built to rent according to the  U.S. census, the highest in nearly 40 years.  Investors are pouring into  the space, which is why big builders like Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and Toll  Brothers (NYSE:TOL) are building to sell to them.</p><p>Renting used to come with a social stigma.  Homeownership was, of course,  the American dream.  But the average income of renters in this new  community is in the six figures.  Many of them can afford to buy a home.   They simply choose not to.</p><p>TAYLOR WALTERS, PROSPECTIVE RENTER:  I`ve done research.  The trend,  different articles on millennials buying houses.  I think the biggest thing  is the hidden costs they might incur.</p><p>OLICK:  The yards here are small and the houses closer together to lower  cost for AHV.</p><p>WOLF:  There`s a lot that goes into the recipe for success.</p><p>OLICK:  Renters here pay their utilities and a landscape fee and the rent,  just the rent.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in San Antonio.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, California`s plan to bridge the retirement savings gap.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We have been reporting quite a bit on the push in Washington to  get more Americans to save for retirement.  Well, several states are also  tackling that problem.  California is the latest.  It now requires small  businesses to either join a state-sponsored retirement savings program or  offer a private plan.</p><p>Sharon Epperson has our story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Twenty-seven-year- old Ramon Gonzalez believes in having a game plan at work, and for his own  finances.</p><p>RAMON GONZALES, RED BAY COFFEE PRODUCTION SUPERVISOR:  Roughly a month, I`m  saving about $250.</p><p>EPPERSON:  A production supervisor at Red Bay Coffee in Oakland,  California, Gonzalez is saving for his future in a new workplace retirement  plan called CalSavers.</p><p>GONZALES:  I will have a nice lump sum when the year is over and going  forward.</p><p>EPPERSON:  Red Bay was one of the first businesses in California to enroll  its 47 employees in the state-sponsored program, allowing private sector  employees to save and invest in an individual retirement account at work.</p><p>FIONA MA, CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURER:  We are open to full and part-time  employees, and soon to those independent contractors or gig workers.</p><p>EPPERSON:  While not a traditional 401(k) plan, it is designed to help  bridge the savings gap for workers who do not have access to an employer- sponsored plan.</p><p>More than 7 million California workers have no retirement savings plan at  work.  Two-thirds are at small businesses with fewer than 100 employees.</p><p>Forty-nine-year-old Maria del Carmen Castillo Vasquez (ph) who cleans  offices in the San Francisco Bay area, is now starting to save for her own  future and her family.</p><p>SARAHI ALMENDRA, MARIA`S DAUGHTER:  She is very happy that she has this  type of savings plan, but she has never had one before.</p><p>EPPERSON: Janico founder and president, Lorenzo Harris (NYSE:HRS), says he  can offer employees including Maria a much-needed benefit that also  benefits the business.</p><p>LORENZO HARRIS, JANICO BUILDING SERVICES OWNER:  It is pretty  comprehensive.</p><p>CalSavers allows us to help to level the playing field when it comes to  attracting and retaining good workers.</p><p>EPPERSON:  Through CalSavers employees can put away a portion of their pay  into an account that works like a Roth IRA.  Contributions are made in  after tax dollars and the funds can be withdrawn tax free in retirement.   The maximum contribution in 2019 is $6,000 or $7,000 if you are 50 or  older.</p><p>KEVIN COX, ASCENSUS HEAD OF GOVERNMENT SAVINGS:  Employees are  automatically defaulted at a savings rate of 5 percent.  That 5 percent  comes directly out of the wages, and an employee can increase that amount.   They can decrease that amount or they opt out all together.</p><p>EPPERSON:  Most of the employees at Red Bank Coffee are participating in  this portable program, and if they switch jobs they can take their accounts  with them.</p><p>Ramon Gonzalez has no plans to leave the company soon, but he does have a  plan in place to build his own financial security.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  So, it feels good to work at a place that is rewarding and also  knowing that I`m going to reap the fruits of my labor later on.</p><p>EPPERSON:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sharon Epperson.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And before we go, here`s a look at the day`s final numbers from  Wall Street.  The Dow fell 128 points to 27,140.  The Nasdaq was down 82,  and the S&amp;P 500 slid 15.</p><p>And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.

California is tackling the retirement crisis with a program to help 7 million workers prepare for the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, July 25th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>A big night for big tech. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), some of the largest companies in the sector, are out with their quarterly results just one day after the Nasdaq hit a record. The group has been a major driving force behind the market`s rally, despite the threat of regulation from lawmakers, and being the target of inquiries from government agencies.</p><p>But let`s start with the biggest of them all, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company`s record profit streak is over. The online retailer reported mixed results, missing earnings expectations but exceeding revenue forecasts. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) cited high shipping costs and weaker than expected growth in its clouds computing business. Investors were disappointed and sent the stock lower in initial after-hours trading.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And then there`s Alphabet, the parent company of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), easily topped earnings expectations and reported a rebound in revenue growth, thanks to strength in its advertising business. Investors cheered in initial afterhours trading tonight, sending that stock sharply higher.</p><p>We have two reports for you tonight. In a moment, it will be Josh Lipton on Alphabet, but we begin with Deirdre Bosa on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big question for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) this quarter was could they reaction re-accelerate growth as it goes into spending mode with price initiatives like one-day shipping? Total sales did grow over the quarter. But at 20 percent, it was still short of the levels of the last few years.</p><p>Meanwhile, profits took a hit, missing Wall Street`s expectation and coming down from record levels. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also telling investors to expect more investment ahead as it continues to implement one-day shipping.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Alphabet stock has been lagging the market this year, in part because of concerns about slowing growth, but the company just said its net revenues actually accelerated, jumping 21 percent.</p><p>Oppenheimer`s Jason Helfstein says a lot of hedge funds were short Alphabet too which could explain the move.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now, here is why these reports are so important. When taken together, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet make up 13 percent of the Nasdaq composite index, and when you add in Dow component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), together they make up 7 percent of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>HERERA: And that brings us to Intel`s quarterly results, which blew past earnings estimates and topped revenue forecast. The semiconductor company also confirmed that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is acquiring the majority of its smartphone business for $1 billion. That sent the stock higher in initial afterhours trading.</p><p>Jon Fortt has more on Intel`s results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) out with a report for the second quarter that beat on the top and bottom line, sales just stronger than expected. That led to an improved outlook for the full year. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Bob Swan saying it was really the growth in data, just data applications, the demand for data, that powered the PC business, as well as the cloud business which uses Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) server chips. And that`s what led to the outperformance in expectations.</p><p>Now, at the same time as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced earnings, also announced it was selling its smartphone modem business, the majority of it to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for a billion dollars. That includes 2,200 employees as well as facilities and patents. That`s a big deal that was expected.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jon Fortt.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: On Wall Street, the Fed was back in focus today as well, with investors growing concerned about the central bank`s next move after this morning`s strong durable goods report and also comments from the head of the European Central Bank. Orders for long-lasting goods rose by 2 percent in June. That was the fastest rate of growth we have seen since August of last year. It was well above expectations, and it could mean an upward revision of GDP forecasts and a less aggressive interest rate cut from the Fed next week.</p><p>Also this morning, the European Central Bank`s president Mario Draghi left the door open for interest rate cut later this year, but he also said there was not a significant risk of a recession in that region. So, investors hoping for a big rate cut next week turned cautious. The Dow fell by 128 points to 21,140. Nasdaq was down 82. The S&amp;P slid by 15.</p><p>HERERA: So what will that strong durable goods report and comments from the head of the European Central Bank mean for the fed when it meets next week?</p><p>We are joined by Rob Martin, senior U.S. economist at UBS.</p><p>Welcome, Rob. Nice to have you here.</p><p>ROB MARTIN, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, UBS: Thank you for having me. I appreciate it.</p><p>HERERA: You are expecting a cut of at least 25 basis points. Does what happened in Europe today with Mr. Drahgi`s comments or the durable goods report change your attitude about what is going to happen?</p><p>MARTIN: Let`s focus on the data first. You know, this morning`s report on durable goods was one more piece of evidence that the U.S. economy actually really is doing quite well. It`s growing nicely. We have had a string of strong reports.</p><p>So far, the Fed has looked through them but the evidence is accumulating. That`s going to reduce the risk of a big cut.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And also, Fed Chairman Powell has been mentioning the global economy, which clearly is slowing down -- China, parts of Asia, and even Europe at this point. So a rate cut next week, would that be not just for our economy but for the global economy as well?</p><p>MARTIN: Well, it is not so much that they would cut rates for the global economy. It is that they worry that whatever is dragging down those other economies, whatever is weighing on growth in Europe, whatever is weighing on growth in Asia is also going to affect the U.S. economy, both through the direct ties through trade, for example, and because the U.S. is subject to the same kind of uncertainties.</p><p>The Fed already believes there`s a confidence shop working its way through the economy, the weakness in Europe is one of the reasons they really want to cut rates, but the strength of U.S. data, the strength of the U.S. economy makes it difficult for them to go big. That`s why there`s this debate between 50 basis points or 25 basis points.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: We see 50, but 25 is clearly on the table. Either way, they do want to provide accommodation.</p><p>HERERA: A lot of times the market looks to what the Fed says after its actions. In other words, the statement. Are you expecting any major changes in the language that the Fed uses?</p><p>MARTIN: No, we think they will be pretty comfortable with their language. Whether they go 25 or 50, they don`t want to signal that they`re completely done with rate cuts because they`re still nervous about the outlook. They want to wait and see how the data is going to evolve, and so I suspect in their new language that they will be closely monitoring the economy coming into the September meeting as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I mean, you have to admit, it is a rather interesting time for them to be cutting with the consumers so strong right now, the employment picture the best in 50 years, and yet inflation is not where they want it to be.</p><p>MARTIN: That`s right. So inflation simply refuses to move up to 2 percent. They`ve got these worries about foreign growth. They`ve got worries about that confidence shock. This is what is driving them.</p><p>So, it feels as if there`s some tension between what they want to do cutting rates and what we`re seeing in the economy. But to be fair to them, that low inflation and those real concerns about foreign growth push them to some kind of easing in the near term.</p><p>HERERA: We will see. Rob Martin with UBS -- Rob, thanks.</p><p>MARTIN: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: More earnings now.</p><p>3M (NYSE:MMM) is feeling the impact of a slowing global economy right now. The company saw its profits drop more than 30 percent, sales slid as well. The industrial conglomerate cited weaker demand from China. In response, it cut production and reduced inventory, but it did reaffirm its previous outlook for the whole year, and the stock fell just a fraction in today`s session.</p><p>HERERA: The ongoing grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX is rippling through the airline industry. American Airlines and Southwest both reported better than expected earnings, but also said the results in the second half could be impacted. Southwest now says it won`t fly the MAX before January of next year. That resulted in a mixed finish for the stocks.</p><p>Phil LeBeau is in Ft. Worth, Texas, for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The 737 MAX headache for American and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has turned into a problem that is changing how the carriers will operate the rest of this year.</p><p>GARY KELLY, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: It is not a good situation. We`re not happy about it. You saw here in the second quarter it cost us $175 million. And that will be more in the third quarter.</p><p>LEBEAU: With 34 MAX models grounded for at least a couple more months, Southwest says its capacity will drop in the second half of 2019. That makes the most of a smaller than expected fleet, Southwest will stop flying out of Newark and it will focus its New York operations on LaGuardia Airport.</p><p>As airlines keep extending how long it will be before they expect to fly the MAX, they are left with more questions than answers about the beleaguered plane`s future.</p><p>DOUG PARKER, AMERICAN AIRLINES CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: We remain in limbo as everybody else does, as we wait to hear from the FAA, as to when they come to the conclusion that the aircraft is ready to go back in service again.</p><p>LEBEAU: Boeing (NYSE:BA) will pay billions of dollars for the hundreds of MAX planes that have been grounded. For airlines, the money will not be enough to cure MAX issues, expected to linger well into next year.</p><p>KELLY: We`re unhappy that it has taken so long and we`re in the dark on it, just like you are, on a number of technical matters.</p><p>LEBEAU: American and Southwest believe they will eventually get past the grounding of the MAX, but it won`t be quick, nor will it be easy, and it will likely take well into next year to repair the damage of not having the plane.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Ft. Worth, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, today, an FAA official said there is still no timeline for the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX to return to service. The acting administrator said that when the airplane`s issues are addressed and the MAX is safe, it will return to service. And, yesterday, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO told analyst he was confident the MAX could be back in service as early as October.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>UPS was upgraded to buy from neutral at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)/Merrill Lynch. The analyst cites what he calls ecommerce revolution and the company`s plan to expand deliveries to seven days. The price target is $130. The stock rose 3 percent to $118.25.</p><p>AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) was upgraded to neutral from under perform at Credit Suisse. The analyst says video subscriber losses have peaked. The price target is $29, and that stock rose more than 1.5 percent to $33.81.</p><p>And Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was downgraded to neutral from buy at Buckingham. The analyst cites a lack of catalyst that would drive the stock in the near term and sees a higher probability of lower earnings growth. The price target is $140. Despite the downgrade though, the shares rose 2 percent to $134.71.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, if they build it, builders say they`ll come.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Diana Olick in San Antonio, Texas. I`ll have a new twist on the fastest growing segment of the housing market coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: In Washington, the House passed the debt ceiling and the budget deal. It sets discretionary spending at about $1.4 trillion. The agreement also suspends the borrowing limit for two years. That measure now goes to the Senate, which is expected to pass it in the coming days.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Nissan plans to layout more than 12,000 workers. That`s 9 percent of its global workforce. The restructuring comes after the automaker saw profits essentially disappear, falling more than 98 percent compared to last year. The company has faced a number of challenges, not the least of which is the arrest in Japan of its former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, eight months ago, and the tensions that caused with Nissan`s partner Renault, which Ghosn also ran.</p><p>HERERA: It was a rough day in the market for Ford following its earnings report, which we told you about last night. The automaker issued a disappointing forecast for the year. Analysts are concerned that the line- up of vehicles launched into next year could further delay an improvement in profitability. The stock fell more than 7 percent in today`s session.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Clearly, the auto industry is in transition as it cuts back on the number of traditional sedans that it makes and gets ready to produce more electric and autonomous vehicles. What does that do to earnings in the meantime?</p><p>Joining us is Matt DeLorenzo. He`s with Kelley Blue Book.</p><p>Matt, good to see you again. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MATT DELORENZO, KELLEY BLUE BOOK SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR: Great to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH: It is a transition period right now. I mean, Ford is targeting 2022 to be able to introduce some of these electric vehicles that it plans to produce, but in the meantime what happens? I mean, they have to cut back here and there and invest an awful lot of money.</p><p>DELORENZO: Well, they do. They`re playing it out in terms of the transition because of their scale. Their biggest selling vehicle is a full-size pickup truck and that`s what the market is demanding right now, those and crossover SUVs.</p><p>So in the short term they bet heavily on the truck market. I`m sure they`re going to see some returns from it because the margins typically in that part of the market are a lot higher than they are in the traditional sedan market.</p><p>HERERA: But as Bill mentioned, they either have to invest a lot of money or find some other avenue to -- to the direction that the rest of the auto industry is going in. Does that mean partnerships? Does it mean mergers? What do you think?</p><p>DELORENZO: I think in the short term or medium long-range term, they are going to be relying on partnerships. The deal with VW to use the MEB platform which will be primarily for the car side of the business, and then they also have that $500 million investment in Rivian which builds electric trucks and SUVs.</p><p>So think what they`re trying to do is layoff a lot of development costs and infrastructure costs in terms of production facilities to these partners and hope that the demand for electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles rises to where they can make that switch over internally and develop and build those vehicles on their own.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You anticipated my next question. What do you think the demand will be for those electric vehicles? I mean I guess -- I don`t know. It may depend on how old you are and your experience with those cars, right?</p><p>DELORENZO: I think that`s true. I think in the short term, electrics will tend to move quicker up in sales. There`s still a lot of regulatory hurdles that have to be surmounted before we can get to full level five autonomous vehicles being on the road.</p><p>Once we get to that point, then we look at how the ownership model is going to change. And if people stop owning cars or start sharing cars, there could be a drop in production, and that could have an impact on earnings down the road. They could be in a position where they`re not building as many vehicles because not that many vehicles will be needed.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>DELORENZO: Since people will be sharing them and they will be returning around the clock.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So many questions, so many changes coming, we know that.</p><p>Matt DeLorenzo with Kelley Blue Book -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>DELORENZO: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Strong results give Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) a jolt. And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\". The company topped estimates thanks to increase in same-store sales here in the U.S. and globally. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) added about 400,000 members to its U.S. loyalty program and it raised its full year guidance. Shares initially rose in after-hours trading. They closed the regular session up a fraction at $90.98.</p><p>Also after the bell, T-Mobile posted mixed results as it beat earnings estimates but it fell short in revenue. The mobile carrier saw an increase in subscription and raised its guidance. The shares were volatile in the after-hours and they closed the regular session down a fraction to $79.91.</p><p>AB InBev beat estimates thanks to seeing beer sales grow, the fastest in five years. The world`s largest brewer also had more consumers buying higher-priced products as the company has been trying to sell more expensive premium drinks. The shares rose more than 4 percent to $99.49.</p><p>Bristol-Myers topped estimates fuelled by strong sells of its Eliquis blood thinner and Orencia arthritis treatment. The drugmaker also lifted its full year guidance. Shares rose 5 percent today to $45.40.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) beat earnings estimates but fell short on revenue expectations. The company added more customers to its high-speed Internet service but saw a decline in its video and phone businesses. Shares were down a fraction to $44.61, and we need to mention that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent of NBCUniversal which produces this program. Hershey topped estimated.</p><p>Hershey`s topped estimates but the candy maker gave weak guidance due to a wholesale price increase of its single served products, which affects about a third of its total sales. Hersey`s raised prices to offset higher labor and raw material costs. Shares rose 2 percent to $149.72.</p><p>An increase in travel bookings helped Royal Caribbean beat estimates, but the cruise operator lowered guidance partly due to cancelled trips to Cuba because of the return of those U.S. travel restrictions to that country. Shares were down almost 2 percent to $113.04.</p><p>And Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) fell short of earnings estimates due to what the company called a tougher consumer environment and slower sales in China. The maker of the Invisalign braces also issued weak guidance. Shares plummeted nearly 27 percent to $200.90.</p><p>HERERA: Mortgage rates are close to a three-year low. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage average 3.73 percent. Now, just a year ago, that average rate was 4.5 percent.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And despite those lower mortgage rates, demand for rental homes is growing and builders are stepping up to meet that need, redesigning and reimagining the single family rental. They`re becoming landlords in the process.</p><p>Diana Olick is in San Antonio for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>OLICK: Millennial Taylor Walters and Paree Dilkes want to get out of their rental apartment and into a larger single family home.</p><p>PAREE DILKES, PROSPECTIVE RENTER: Yes, we have been looking online for months now for whether we want to buy or we want to rent, and this is definitely up our alley.</p><p>OLICK: This is a brand-new community of 250 detached homes built entirely as rentals. While some builders will sell a few to investors as rentals, it is one of the gated rental only projects. The brainchild of Mark Wolf, founder and CEO of AHV Communities partnering with Bristol Group.</p><p>MARK WOLF, AHV COMMUNITIES CEO: About 93 percent of the apartment stock consists of studios, one and two bedrooms, few three bedrooms. We saw a growing need out of the downturn to provide three and four bedroom homes for the renter`s society.</p><p>OLICK: He is basically taking the vertical apartment model and turning it horizontal, offering three and four bedroom homes with two car garages but including high-end amenities like a gym, common areas, a dog park and washing station.</p><p>The rents are comparable to nearby apartments and the maintenance is all on site, lowering costs for AHV. Wolf says he does not intend to sell the homes any time soon.</p><p>WOLF: We believe in the long term cash flow game. So if you hold these properties for ten-plus years or even seven-plus years, the residual cash flow is worth more than the sale one time.</p><p>OLICK: Last year about 43,000 homes were built to rent according to the U.S. census, the highest in nearly 40 years. Investors are pouring into the space, which is why big builders like Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) are building to sell to them.</p><p>Renting used to come with a social stigma. Homeownership was, of course, the American dream. But the average income of renters in this new community is in the six figures. Many of them can afford to buy a home. They simply choose not to.</p><p>TAYLOR WALTERS, PROSPECTIVE RENTER: I`ve done research. The trend, different articles on millennials buying houses. I think the biggest thing is the hidden costs they might incur.</p><p>OLICK: The yards here are small and the houses closer together to lower cost for AHV.</p><p>WOLF: There`s a lot that goes into the recipe for success.</p><p>OLICK: Renters here pay their utilities and a landscape fee and the rent, just the rent.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in San Antonio.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, California`s plan to bridge the retirement savings gap.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: We have been reporting quite a bit on the push in Washington to get more Americans to save for retirement. Well, several states are also tackling that problem. California is the latest. It now requires small businesses to either join a state-sponsored retirement savings program or offer a private plan.</p><p>Sharon Epperson has our story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Twenty-seven-year- old Ramon Gonzalez believes in having a game plan at work, and for his own finances.</p><p>RAMON GONZALES, RED BAY COFFEE PRODUCTION SUPERVISOR: Roughly a month, I`m saving about $250.</p><p>EPPERSON: A production supervisor at Red Bay Coffee in Oakland, California, Gonzalez is saving for his future in a new workplace retirement plan called CalSavers.</p><p>GONZALES: I will have a nice lump sum when the year is over and going forward.</p><p>EPPERSON: Red Bay was one of the first businesses in California to enroll its 47 employees in the state-sponsored program, allowing private sector employees to save and invest in an individual retirement account at work.</p><p>FIONA MA, CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURER: We are open to full and part-time employees, and soon to those independent contractors or gig workers.</p><p>EPPERSON: While not a traditional 401(k) plan, it is designed to help bridge the savings gap for workers who do not have access to an employer- sponsored plan.</p><p>More than 7 million California workers have no retirement savings plan at work. Two-thirds are at small businesses with fewer than 100 employees.</p><p>Forty-nine-year-old Maria del Carmen Castillo Vasquez (ph) who cleans offices in the San Francisco Bay area, is now starting to save for her own future and her family.</p><p>SARAHI ALMENDRA, MARIA`S DAUGHTER: She is very happy that she has this type of savings plan, but she has never had one before.</p><p>EPPERSON: Janico founder and president, Lorenzo Harris (NYSE:HRS), says he can offer employees including Maria a much-needed benefit that also benefits the business.</p><p>LORENZO HARRIS, JANICO BUILDING SERVICES OWNER: It is pretty comprehensive.</p><p>CalSavers allows us to help to level the playing field when it comes to attracting and retaining good workers.</p><p>EPPERSON: Through CalSavers employees can put away a portion of their pay into an account that works like a Roth IRA. Contributions are made in after tax dollars and the funds can be withdrawn tax free in retirement. The maximum contribution in 2019 is $6,000 or $7,000 if you are 50 or older.</p><p>KEVIN COX, ASCENSUS HEAD OF GOVERNMENT SAVINGS: Employees are automatically defaulted at a savings rate of 5 percent. That 5 percent comes directly out of the wages, and an employee can increase that amount. They can decrease that amount or they opt out all together.</p><p>EPPERSON: Most of the employees at Red Bank Coffee are participating in this portable program, and if they switch jobs they can take their accounts with them.</p><p>Ramon Gonzalez has no plans to leave the company soon, but he does have a plan in place to build his own financial security.</p><p>GONZALEZ: So, it feels good to work at a place that is rewarding and also knowing that I`m going to reap the fruits of my labor later on.</p><p>EPPERSON: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sharon Epperson.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And before we go, here`s a look at the day`s final numbers from Wall Street. The Dow fell 128 points to 27,140. The Nasdaq was down 82, and the S&amp;P 500 slid 15.</p><p>And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera.

White House  Chief of Staff Reince Priebus is out with a tweet.  In his place, General  John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Focus on fundamentals.   The Dow closes at a record, despite all the chaos in the capital.  But at  what point will Washington start to really matter to investors?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Up in smoke.  The FDA wants to make cigarettes less addictive, and  that burned a hole in a handful of tobacco stocks.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, July  28th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Developments out of Washington late this afternoon.  President Trump's  chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is out.  </p><p>The president broke the news in his favorite way, over Twitter, writing,  quote: I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary  John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff.  He is a great American, and a  great leader.  John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security.   He's been a true star of my administration.  </p><p>Mr. Priebus is the former Republican Party chairman, and he clashed with  other officials in the White House, including the new director of  communications, Anthony Scaramucci. </p><p>John Harwood joins us tonight on the phone from Washington.  </p><p>John, welcome, good to be with you.  </p><p>How big a surprise, John, is Priebus' departure?  And how big a surprise is  the appointment of Kelly as chief of staff?  </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (via telephone):  Well,  I think the departure of Reince Priebus wasn't a surprise.  The timing was  a surprise.  I had been talking to people during the day who were saying,  you know, sometime in the next couple of weeks, certainly by Labor Day, so,  that wasn't unexpected.  </p><p>John Kelly had been rumored as a candidate for the job.  So had other  people, including Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive.   Deena Powell, also formerly from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).  </p><p>And the real question is what does this mean?  How does it change the  functioning of the White House?  Most things from the Trump administration  have revolved around the president personally, not his aides, but we'll see  whether General Kelly can bring a greater amount of discipline.  </p><p>HERERA:  What more -- what changes, other changes, might be possible?  For  instance, Mr. Bannon was targeted recently by Mr. Scaramucci.  What do you  see ahead, John?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  It is very difficult to predict this administration to say the  least.  The most conspicuous potential change that has been signaled is the  departure of the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Now I don't know if  that's actually going to happen.  The president has suggested as much. </p><p>I had a -- someone close to Trump tell me today they expected Bannon to  stay.  But I don't think you could make a heavy bet on any of this.  </p><p>One thing I think is interesting, though, I was talking to an ally of Paul  Ryan, the House speaker, who said that the departure of Priebus is  essentially un-tethering the Trump White House from the Republican party  and, in fact, predicted that the next phase of the Trump presidency may be  to go to war against the Republican Congress and blame them for his  problems.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, he was Mr. Priebus, certainly, part of the Republican Party  establishment, former chairman of the party.  So what could this change  mean, not only for the operation of the White House, John, but for the  president's policy agenda?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Well, if General Kelly can bring a greater amount of focus and  discipline to the White House, and to the president, for that matter, it is  possible that they could have a better experience with tax reform, which is  the next big reform than they have had with health care reform.  Obviously,  a lot of the problems on health care were inherent to that issue, and I  think a lot of the responsibility lies with the Congress, and not with  President Trump. </p><p>But, General Kelly is not experienced in politics.  And one of the  advantages of having Reince Priebus there was, in fact, you're trying to  get an agenda through with Republicans on Capitol Hill.  And, General Kelly  does not have any track record of doing that.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right, John Harwood, thanks very much, working late on the  weekend night.  John Harwood in Washington.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, while the drama in Washington continues, Wall Street is  blocking out the noise and staying squarely focused on the fundamentals.   Earnings and global growth are all supporting stocks, which saw the Dow  Jones Industrial Average close at a new high.  The blue chip Dow index  advanced 33 points to 21830, the Nasdaq lost seven and the S&amp;P 500 fell  three.  For the week, the Dow was the big winner.  </p><p>Bob Pisani has more on what's driving the market.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The stock market has a  high class problem right now.  An awful lot is going right.  </p><p>First and foremost, earnings have been strong.  We're past the halfway  mark.  Earnings are up more than 10 percent year over year.  Revenues are  up 5 percent.  </p><p>Estimates are strong for the third quarter, as well.  Valuations are  higher, all right.  But the margins are comfortable as long as there is  earnings growth and the economy is improving.  </p><p>And the global economy has been improving.  Money is flowing into European  stocks this year.  The credit markets are in great shape.  Defaults are  low.  And a recession, nowhere on the horizon. </p><p>Next, the dollar's been dropping, providing a tailwind for exporters.  And  rates are low.  And the Fed's reiterated this week that rates will stay low  for a long time and nobody's expecting a rate hike until December.  </p><p>All right.  What could go wrong with this?  Yes, Washington's a mess.  But  the markets don't care as long as tax cuts are somewhere on the horizon.   In 2018 has proven good enough so far.  There's definitely some kind of  premium in the market for a tax cut but we don't know how big this premium  is.  </p><p>Another issue that is sort of puzzling market watchers is geopolitical  risk.  Today, the North Koreans fired a missile into the Sea of Japan but  the markets shrugged it off.  Janus's Bill Gross said earlier this week  that a significant geopolitical event like North Korea would usually carry  a higher risk premium.  But so far, that hasn't been the case. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So what, if anything, will it take for the market to turn its  attention to Washington in a more focused way?  </p><p>Jeff Moore is senior analyst at Global Risk Insights and he joins us now to  discuss.  </p><p>Jeff, how can the stock market and bond markets be so Zen when Washington  is so not?  </p><p>JEFF MOORE, SENIOR ANALYST, GLOBAL RISK INSIGHTS:  Well, I think that the  precedent was set a long time ago as far as the character of this  administration, and the interplay between the White House and Congress, so  there's a little bit of a de-sensitivity issue as far as how that  translates into market risk.  But I think it's going to take something  substantial and maybe some outside the domestic scene to actually introduce  some of that volatility.  </p><p>HERERA:  Would that be -- or might that be North Korea?  </p><p>MOORE:  I think so.  But more than North Korea's actions, I think more  importantly, judged by the market is going to be the reactions of the Trump  administration.  Any escalation as far as military action on the Korean  peninsula will be something that introduces a spike in volatility, that  could really unravel a lot of the complacency that's been going on in the  market so far.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Spike in volatility would be the most favorable outcome it might  well seem, if something big happens on the Korean peninsula.  </p><p>Let's talk a little bit about the GOP agenda.  I don't want to just call it  the Trump agenda.  A big part of it seems to have, for now, gone down in  flames on health care.  It is no easy push to push tax reform through.   Infrastructure, immigration, there are a lot of things standing out there  which of those has the potential to move the needle marketwise one way or  another?  Or the most potential, I should say.  </p><p>MOORE:  Yes, I think tax reform probably has the most potential of actually  following through, because you probably have a high level of consensus  among Congress and the White House of getting some tax reform policies  pushed through and signed into law.  But the question is, how they're able  to do that, when they've got a second or third on the list behind health  care, which so far has been a debacle?  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, Jeff, we just had John Harwood on the phone, and he  mentioned that he was hearing from sources that the next move by the White  House may be to go after Congress, because of the lack of movement on  things like health care.  If we start to get mutiny between Congress and  the administration, what do you think Wall Street's reaction would be to  that sort of a development?  Hypothetical at this point, certainly.  </p><p>MOORE:  Yes.  I think outside of some foreign policy issue that creeps up  and escalates, that open mutiny between Congress and the Trump  administration, if the Trump administration were to go after the Republican  Party, and the Republican majorities in Congress, that could really  escalate to the point of investors really coming to terms with some of  these agenda items, there are possibilities of actually getting passed  really, really sinking.  </p><p>And to this point, none of that has actually been passed through Congress,  and you would think the markets would have reacted negatively to that  already.  But, this kind of open political warfare between the White House,  and Congress, being of the same political party, would be really something  that causes investors to question where this is going as far as economic  policy standpoint.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right, Jeff.  Have a nice weekend.  Jeff Moore with Global  Risk Insights.  </p><p>HERERA: To the economy now, which rebounded this spring after a weak start  to the year.  Gross domestic product for the second quarter was 2.6  percent.  And while that was more than double the revised economic output  of the first three months of the year, it was slightly below expectations.   Consumers ramped up their spending, and businesses invested more on  equipment.  Inflation, though, retreated and wage growth decelerated,  despite an economy that's considered to be at or near full employment.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  It was the best week of the year for oil prices, after rising  today for a fifth straight session.  Domestic crude up more than 8 percent  this week, as crude and gasoline inventories fell more than expected and  Saudi Arabia said it would reduce future oil output.  That alleviated some  oversupply concerns. </p><p>But the price of oil varied widely in the second quarter.  That hurt  ExxonMobil's results but not doing much damage really to Chevron's quarter.   Shares of the country's two oil producers moved in opposite direction.   Chevron (NYSE:CVX) the best performing Dow stock today, Exxon the worst.  </p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Investors weren't  expecting much from ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM).  That's why this earnings miss  really stings.  The wide range in crude prices is partially to blame even  though they were higher than they were a year ago.  </p><p>The other reason is weak performance from Exxon's exploration and  production business.  The downstream business, that's refining, was  stronger but weak here in the United States. </p><p>CEO Darren Woods said the company's job is, quote, to grow long-term value  by investing in our integrated portfolio of opportunities that succeed  regardless of market conditions.  Since Woods took over on January 1st,  succeeding Rex Tillerson, who is now secretary of state, Exxon has faced  accusations of sanction violations, probes into whether the company hid  data on climate change and questions of how it would grow oil output. </p><p>It's a slightly different story for rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the second  largest U.S. driller behind Exxon.  It's swung to a profit thanks to higher  expected output from its wells even as returns from its refining business  shrank.  </p><p>What will be key for both companies is how they proceed going forward with  oil just under $50 a barrel, do they keep drilling or do they pare back and  allow prices to stabilize? </p><p>The U.S. is the swing producer right now. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, profit and performance should mean fewer headaches  for American airlines, right?  Well, that's not really the case.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Billions of dollars in market cap went up in smoke.  Shares of the  big tobacco companies fell after the FDA said it wants to cut nicotine and  cigarettes to non-addictive levels.  Such a move would represent a sweeping  federal effort to reduce smoking since Congress required cigarette packages  to carry health warnings.  Altria and British American Tobacco were hit  hard.  </p><p>Aditi Roy has the details.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Nearly 90  percent of all adult smokers started the habit before they were 18.  And  then became hooked.  </p><p>That's the premise of the Food and Drug Administration's sweeping new plan  to regulate tobacco and nicotine.  </p><p>DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER:  We need to take a fresh look at  nicotine itself.  </p><p>ROY:  The goal is to save lives.  In a statement announcing the news, the  agency said: Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today  will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.  The agency also  reports a direct health care and lost productivity costs stemming from  tobacco use, add up to nearly $300 billion.  </p><p>To meet its goal, the FDA wants to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to  non-addictive levels and will take measures that will, quote, make tobacco  products less toxic, appealing and addictive.  </p><p>GOTTLIEB:  But if the other chemical compounds in tobacco and in the smoke  created by setting tobacco on fire that directly and primarily cause the  illness and death, not the nicotine.  </p><p>ROY:  In other words, the FDA commissioner says by curbing the nicotine,  more people will quit smoking and won't be exposed to the more harmful  elements of cigarettes.  Upon the news, shares of cigarette stocks like  Altria and British American Tobacco plummeted.  </p><p>But some analysts say the regulations could help the market for cigarette  alternatives.  Some tobacco companies like Altria are developing less  harmful products like smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes.  </p><p>JOE AGNESE, CFRA ANALYST:  I think the economics aren't as good right now,  but as the market develops, and perhaps with these changes, there will be a  greater push and acceleration of growth in electronic cigarettes that  longer-term the economics could improve.  </p><p>ROY (on camera):  He adds companies have some time before the regulations  would take effect.  Before the plan can go into motion, the FDA will have a  public comment period.  It's unclear when that will start or how long that  will take.  Then the agency will evaluate the comments before finalizing  the plan.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  American Airlines reported better than expected earnings for the  second quarter.  Like other carriers, demand is strong at the world's  biggest airline and that is pushing up average fares, fees and overall  revenue.  Meanwhile, the company's CEO says American is not backing off its  fight to stop the growth of Persian Gulf carriers in the U.S. </p><p>Phil LeBeau reports from Fort Worth, Texas, where American is  headquartered.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For  American airlines business is taking off, thanks to strong demand and a  industry leading ability to drive greater passenger revenue.  In fact,  revenue per available seat mile is up almost 6 percent.  In part because  about half of the American passengers who buy a basic economy ticket are  paying more to upgrade to a main cabin seat where they have more options to  choose from.  </p><p>DOUG PARKER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AMERICAN AIRLINES:  We had revenue growth,  unit revenue growth of almost 6 percent.  More than the industry is up.   It's evidence to us that the investments we're making in our product and  our people are working.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  For Parker, the profit and performance his team posted last  quarter should mean fewer headaches for American.  But that's not happening  thanks to Qatar Airways.  The Middle East carrier wants to buy up to 10  percent of American, even though Parker has repeatedly criticized Qatar for  using government subsidies to expand flights to the U.S., a practice that  Parker says has hurt American and other U.S. carriers </p><p>PARKER:  We'll see where this all ends up, but the reality is, those three  carriers are subsidized by their governments, and they're competing against  American Airlines, and other U.S. carriers, in an unfair way and it  shouldn't be allowed.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  While American pushes back against Qatar, its core business  remains strong, with a healthy economy driving demand, and international  travel not slowing down.  </p><p>(on camera):  And even as costs rise due in part to new labor contracts,  Doug Parker believes American is poised to fly even higher as it heads into  the remainder of this year. </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Fort Worth, Texas. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Merck (NYSE:MRK) tops expectations, and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The pharmaceutical company said cost cuts and strong demand for its top  selling cancer drug Keytruda led to the higher than expected earnings.   Merck (NYSE:MRK) also said the international cyber attack back in June  which disrupted its manufacturing operations would, indeed, cut into  profits for the remainder of this year.  The company did, however, raise  its sales outlook.  Shares rose slightly to $64.11. </p><p>Goodyear said higher raw material costs and weaker demand for tires hurt  results in the latest quarter.  Despite seeing a drop in profit, the  company reported earnings that were in line with estimates.  But sales  missed the mark.  The company also cut its outlook for the entire unit  sales, and segment operating income.  Shares fell more than 8 percent to  $32.51.  </p><p>The furniture and electronics rental company Aaron's (NYSE:AAN) reported a  better than expected rise in sales as the company kept a tight lid on cost  and benefited from growth in its progressive leasing division.  Earnings  also beat analyst expectations and shares took off, rising 17 percent to  $47.54.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Magellan Health missed estimates as the health care company said  it experienced pricing pressure in two of its commercial accounts.  Revenue  however edged higher and was stronger than expected.  Shares of Magellan  Health off more than 3.5 percent on the session at $75.90.  </p><p>And the online real estate broker Redfin went public on the Nasdaq today.   The company offered more than 9 million shares at $15 apiece.  Redfin  shares -- look what they did? -- soaring 44 percent in their debut.  They  closed the day at $21.70.  </p><p>HERERA:  A quarter of the S&amp;P 500's climb this year is due to five stocks - - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Google's parent Alphabet, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Our market monitor says  some of those big tech names are ones you may want to own.  This is his  first appearance as our market monitor guest, though he has been on the  program before.  </p><p>We welcome back, Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager that BMO Global Asset  Management.  </p><p>Ernesto, nice to see you again.  Welcome.  </p><p>ERNESTO RAMOS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BMO GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  Let's get right to your picks.  You pick Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  You  say they have yet to enter the hot new markets such as virtual reality,  original content, and things like that.  </p><p>RAMOS:  Yes, indeed.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is essentially an iPhone maker,  and they are tapping that market very well.  But, they've not yet really  realized the full potential of other areas of the market that they have  products that they're bringing to market. </p><p>So, we think they have potential for growth in new areas, and they still  have a magnificent cash cow in their iPhone, and the new iPhone 8 release  in September will be a pretty big event similar to what the iPhone 6  release was a couple of years ago.  So, we think the stock is trading at  below market valuation is a very good pick for both its valuation, and its  growth characteristics.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Ernesto, your second choice is another tiny little company that  nobody's heard of that also begins with the letter A.  </p><p>RAMOS:  That's the flip to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), I'm  sure you're talking about.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You bet.</p><p>RAMOS:  And that stock is valued through the roof but it's growth is just  incredible.  They've posted, I can't remember off the top of my head, how  many consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent sales growth and the earnings  fluctuate simply as a function of how much they're investing back into  their business on any given quarter.  So -- </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, that number last night didn't bother you at all?  </p><p>RAMOS:  No.  What we're looking at is the top line growth, and the  disruption that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is bringing to markets, you know, they  started as an online book seller, or actually online book seller but  selling physical books, then they went into other areas of the market, and  now, they're basically trying to enter any area where the consumer might  want to spend money, they want to be present there.  </p><p>HERERA:  Right.  </p><p>RAMOS:  And Jeff Bezos is succeeding pretty much at anything he tries.  So,  we're excited about this company, despite the very rich valuation.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  Let's quickly move on to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), now a major  player in cloud.  They've really shifted their business model consistently.</p><p>RAMOS:  Well, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is sort of a hybrid between Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  They're disruptors in the sense  that they're adapting their business out of the legacy software and  computers into the iCloud, and in particular the hybrid iCloud where users  cannot only tap into the iCloud but leverage their existing infrastructures  to combine the both, which is most of the companies in the U.S., such as  our own company --</p><p>HERERA:  OK.  </p><p>RAMOS:   -- still in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) world and now we have access  to iCloud and that is a new area and they're doing it very well.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Ernesto, thank you.  Ernesto Ramos with BMO Global  Asset Management.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, they're young, they're hip and they're fuelling the  growth of, would you believe it, the RV market.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The treasury secretary tonight sent an update as to when the  country will reach its debt limit.  That new date is September 29th.  Steve  Mnuchin says the nation will run out of cash to meet its obligations on  that date.  </p><p>HERERA:  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) improperly charged more than 570,000 auto  loan customers for auto insurance they did not need or were not told about.   The bank debited the borrower's bank accounts for that coverage.  Members  of the military on active duty were among those harmed.  The bank will make  $80 million in payments to compensate customers.  </p><p>Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was fined $180 million last year for opening as many  as 2 million accounts without customers' permission.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Get your motor running.  More RVs are heading out on the highway  these days.  But it's not retirees who are looking for adventure.  </p><p>Landon Dowdy tells us about the new crop of drivers hitting the road from  Petaluma, California.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LANDON DOWDY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Kyle  Miller is 32 years old and is on his second RV.  He grew up camping and  takes his young family on the road every month in the summertime.  </p><p>KYLE MILLARD, MILLENNIAL RV OWNER:  We picked this one because it has a  bunk house system in the back as well as the outside kitchen.  So, it's  something we can grow family-wise.  </p><p>DOWDY:  A record 9 million U.S. households now own an RV according to the  recreation vehicle industry association.  The industry has traditionally  relied on retirees to drive growth.  But now, younger buyers are getting  behind the wheel.  </p><p>NICOLE WALSH, RV OWNER:  It just allows us to come together in a different  way in sort of this, as you can see, see how we are in a fun way.  But we  also save money, so we can do some things that we might not otherwise get  to do if we stayed in a hotel.  </p><p>KRISTIN BETTENCOURT, RV OWNER:  When we come for Thanksgiving,  specifically, we have probably four to five trailers that come.  And we all  book spots right by each other.  And then we have a couple family members  who like to come but don't have trailers, so they get cabins so that they  can still be with us and enjoy the trip, too.  </p><p>DOWDY (on camera):  Younger buyers are opting more for towable trailers and  come to camp grounds like this one here in California, wine country, to  really experience the outdoor lifestyle trend.  </p><p>(voice-over):  And that has campground owners like Chris Wood investing in  things like Wi-Fi and communal areas for millennials to mingle.  </p><p>CHRIS WOOD, CAMPGROUND OWNER:  For the millennial generation, you know,  we're looking at space here on the campground which was set up for pot  lucks and bingo halls 30 years ago.  And we're setting it up for what we  call third spaces, something kind of like your Starbuckses and stuff.</p><p>DOWDY:  New data shows June towable shipments topped 20 percent year over  year, while motor homes were up a more modest 6 percent. </p><p>RV makers like Thor Industries (NYSE:THO) are taking note of the towable  takeover, offering new models tailored to entry level buyers and updated  with new technology.  </p><p>BOB MARTIN, CEO, THOR:  It's upgrading the electronics.  It's just adding  the features that they're used to.  So a lot of the RVs are compatible to,  you know, an iPhone.  You know, a lot of the app-based things that run your  AC, your awning, your jacks when you get there.  Just makes it easier to  camp.  </p><p>DOWDY:  Martin telling me that once buyers get RV-ing in their blood, they  get hooked.
