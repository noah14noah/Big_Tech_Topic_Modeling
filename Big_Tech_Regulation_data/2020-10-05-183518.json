In related news, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has also begun rolling out an edit button so you can change your video - more on that below. </p><p>But the computer-generated videos can evoke a strong emotional response, and none was more powerful than the reaction of John Berlin, who went on YouTube hoping to catch someone's attention at <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>In his heartbreaking video, which we've re-posted above Berlin fought back tears several times. </p><p>\"You ever do something crazy because you just don't know what to do anymore?\" Berlin said. \"Well, that's what I'm doing right now. I'm calling out to Mark Zuckerberg and <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>You've been putting out these new movies - these one-minute movies that everyone has been sharing, and I think they're great ... My son passed away January 28th, 2012, and we can't access his <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>account ... all we want to do is see his movie.\"</p><p>As he requested, Berlin's friends and family shared the video and it indeed went viral, with more than 1 million views as of Thursday afternoon. Some viewers who in turn moved to create their own versions of \"A Look Back\" for Berlin's family:</p><p>John Berlin's plea worked. One <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>employee saw the original YouTube video and brought it to the company's attention.</p><p>\"I was just contacted by FB by phone and there going to make a vid just for us,\" Berlin posted on his <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>page. \"They also said they're going to look at how they can better help families who have lost loved ones. Ty friends and to FB.\"</p><p>However, in this case, the computerized program that creates \"A Look Back\" couldn't automatically generate a video. Instead, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>employees did one manually using News Feed posts and photos that the younger Berlin had set for public viewing.</p><p>Still, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>says this is a one-time video and that it can't accommodate every request from family or friends of a deceased member because there would be too many.</p><p>However, \"this experience reinforced to us that there's more <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>can do to help people celebrate and commemorate the lives of people they have lost,\" Thaw said in his statement. \"We'll have more to share in the coming weeks and months.\"</p><p>It's not immediately clear whether the Berlin family has viewed the special video. John Berlin, who has not responded to a message requesting comment, said in a <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>post earlier Thursday that he will share the video \"when it comes out.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is rolling out an edit button for members to change the photos or posts selected in their videos, even if the videos have already been shared. Some members won't share their video because it includes photos of an ex or other unwanted post.</p><p>The Edit function gives the option of swapping certain photos, but you can't pick through everything in your timeline. Each section of the video has a limited selection of posts and photos to chose. At least you have some choices rather than relying on the whim of a computer program.</p><h>WHY DOES APPLE CONTINUE KILLING BITCOIN APPS?</h><p>Posted on February 6, 2014 By <url normalizedValue=\"http://cgarling@sfchronicle.com\">cgarling@sfchronicle.com</url> Caleb Garling </p><p>They keep disappearing. In 2012 it was BitPak. Last November it was Coinbase. Earlier in January it was CoinJar. And on Wednesday it was Blockchain.</p><p>Apple has been eliminating apps in its App Store that process or deal with the popular cryptocurrency bitcoin. Cupertino allows plenty of other payment apps like PayPal, Venmo and a variety of banking apps, so the exception for those dealing in bitcoin has raised questions why Apple has been zeroing in on the controversial currency. The US Justice Department has said virtual currencies aren't illegal.</p><p>In typical style, Apple did not return a request for comment.</p><p>But there are two main theories here: the first is that Cupertino wants to eliminate nascent competition for its own payment platform. Apple executives have recently had discussions with outside companies over payments for physical goods and services on its devices, according Wall Street Journal sources. The company has filed for a patent for something resembling iMoney.</p><p>The other theory is that Apple doesn't want to deal with a technology with such a murky legal and regulatory future. When it eliminated Coinbase Apple said it needed to \"comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users,\" an echo of its App Store review guidelines.</p><p>But after its banishing, Blockchain fell into the crush-the-competition camp.</p><p>\"Offering no explanation and no opportunity to address any issues, without any apparent change in circumstances other than the growing popularity of the independent and competitive payment system, Apple has eradicated their payment competition on iOS,\" wrote CEO Nicolas Cary after quoting Apple's famous ode to the crazy ones and the misfits.</p><p>\"We need [bitcoin users] to take a stand against Apple, make noise, complain, and show Apple that there will be consequences to their actions.\"</p><p>Some obliged. A string of videos appeared on YouTube of bitcoin enthusiasts smashing their iPhones. One guy even used a high-powered rifle see below. A Reddit user had promised them a replacement Nexus 5, which runs Google's Android and allows bitcoin apps, if they went through with the protest. It's not clear if the promise was made good.</p><p>But Cary's cry was a noticeable departure from the previous bitcoin apps that had been nixed, which have publicly fallen in the second camp or opted for silence.</p><p>To put it mildly, bitcoin's place in the future of finances is unclear. The government has said bitcoin has benefits and is not illegal, but hasn't taken much action otherwise. But major markets like India and China have expressed greater concerns over bitcoin, and Apple's terms and service do note that an app must be legal whereever it's offered.</p><p>Bitcoin has hit the spotlight over the past year for the right and wrong reasons. It was the only currency accepted on Silk Road, a digital underground marketplace mostly of illegal goods like drugs and stolen goods. But at the same time large corporations like Overstock.com have started accepting bitcoin - though immediately flips it to the more stable dollar. Bitcoin's exchange rate has been, again putting it mildly, volatile.</p><p>The bitcoin ride</p><p>Messaging app Gliph allowed users to attach bitcoins to messages until Apple stepped in and told them to remove the capability. \"There wasn't any negotiation other than them saying what was going to be allowed or not allowed,\" says CEO Rob Banagale. Here's a copy of Gliph's appeal letter.</p><p>Yet despite the one-way negotiation, Banagale doesn't buy the idea that Apple is trying to squash nascent payment competition or hurt the growth of bitcoin. Apple's lawyers have been getting plenty of work these days. The company is fighting a huge intellectual property suit against Samsung. The Justice Department has been pursing Cupertino for collusion on pricing its e-books. The government is starting to take a harder look at offshore tax havens used by big tech companies.</p><p>So with the murky regulatory future of bitcoin, he speculates the company just wants to nip a problem in the bud. When CoinJar was nixed, the company said much of the same. In the grand scheme of Apple's app ecosystem, Blockchain's 120,000 users and a handful of petition signers are a rounding errors.</p><p>\"I think the primary reason is the company has bigger fish to fry,\" Banagale says. But he is a full-throated supporter of bitcoin as part of the future of payments.</p><p>\"It's a little strange to have Apple be on what feels like the wrong side.\"</p><p>San Francisco's Coinbase, which provides the software to manage bitcoins, has recently integrated with financial management software Mint, processes payments for Overstock and has taken over $30 million in investments from Andreessen Horowitz and others. While the future value of bitcoin is highly debatable, this is no fly-by-night operation. The company declined comment.</p><p>You can find other bitcoin apps in the App Store, but the only ones I could find monitored exchange rate - they didn't actually trade the currency, a notable difference. Google's Play Store, the equivalent of the App Store on Android phones, has versions of Coinbase and Blockchain. Though the company has never been known for a long attention span, a recent story in Forbes indicated Google is showing signs that it will embrace the cryptocurrency.</p><p>Though speculation is hot on Apple's opaque motives, it is clear Bitcoin is not going anywhere.</p><p>Here's the dude destroying his iPhone with a rifle.</p><h>HOW MUCH TIME DO TECH BUSES SPEND BLOCKING MUNI STOPS? STUDY HOPES TO FIND OUT</h><p>Posted on February 6, 2014 By <url normalizedValue=\"http://ehuet@sfchronicle.com\">ehuet@sfchronicle.com</url> Ellen Huet </p><p>Tech bus riders: you're being watched.</p><p>Two UC Berkeley masters students want the public to capture video of tech shuttles to find out how long private buses spend blocking Muni stops in San Francisco.</p><p>The study, which asks people to submit videos of buses arriving, stopping, and departing from Muni stops, began just after the city's Jan. 21 decision to let companies that shuttle employees, like Google, <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Apple and LinkedIn, pay a fee to use the stops - the famed $1 per stop, per day.</p><p>\"We would like to find out what it really costs to provide this service, and no data exists to set a precedent for a fair market price for the use of these stops,\" wrote the two graduate students, Dan Howard and Mark Dreger.</p><p>Using the crowd-sourced videos, Howard and Dreger hope to paint a full picture of how the buses use public infrastructure. The study's <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>page has 17 videos so far, most showing a \"dwell time\" of between 1 and 2 minutes.</p><p>It's unclear whether they'll be able to collect enough videos from a wide variety of stops - the main one so far seems to be 24th and Valencia streets - for the data to be useful. Another UC Berkeley shuttle study had some interesting findings about shuttle bus riders, but only had a sample size of 130, which makes it less than ideal considering thousands of people ride the buses every day.</p><p>So don't be surprised if people hold up their phones while the buses are coming and going - but maybe they could be encouraged to capture their reconnaissance in landscape.</p><h>HOW TO REPAIR SOMEONE'S BRAIN USING GADGETS AND VIDEOGAMES</h><p>Posted on February 6, 2014 By <url normalizedValue=\"http://cgarling@sfchronicle.com\">cgarling@sfchronicle.com</url> Caleb Garling </p><p>I'm traveling through Mickey Hart's brain. I look to my left and a blue plum of sparks blaze down the Grateful Dead drummer's corpus callosum. A set of neurons has fired. I travel upward, through a mess of pink synaptic spaghetti, and the two hemispheres of his cerebrum vibrate and banter about some new information. I float back toward his lower brain, where I pass his cerebellum, pulsing softly, and leave through his spinal chord.</p><p>Okay, I'm actually in Dr. Adam Gazzaley's neuroscience lab in UCSF Mission Bay. I'm wearing Oculus Rift virtual reality glasses, holding an Xbox controller and sitting in a comfortable room that could pass for a basement den, if you can afford a new Meyer sound system and two billboard-sized flatscreens. </p><p>This is Gazzaley's idea of modern neurology lab. \"It's not the standard,\" he says with a smile.</p><p>\"What we're going to use it for is still an open question.\" See video at the bottom for more </p><p>Mission control at the Gazzaley lab, where technicians monitor and adjust gameplay for test subjects.</p><p>Hart's brain fires wonderfully, but were there to be problems, Gazzaley's idea is to harness video game technology to improve or heal the brain, and hopes the \"proof of concept\" lab - set to open later this year - will be one of the crucibles. The work has also garnered attention from the tech community: he'll be a keynote speaker at NVIDIA's GPU Technology Conference in March - the titan of graphics processing units makes the engines of video game players and its parallel processing framework called CUDA chews through the huge amounts of data necessary to monitor a brain in real time.</p><p>Patients will wear electroencephalograms EEG, those caps with the electrodes that monitor electrical impulses firing inside the brain down to the cubic millimeter. As Gazzely and team target areas of the brain that need help - damaged, underused, etc - the idea is that the mechanics of gameplay will adjust on the fly to keep those precise areas engaged and, hopefully, strengthen them back to normal or beyond. Current games know how to adjust to a player's skill level, but not with the goal of targeting a very specific portion of the brain.</p><p>Gazzaley, who has also founded a company for neuro-beneficial games, published a Nature cover story last fall that showed playing a car racing game improved multi-tasking abilities. Other studies have shown cognitive benefits for videogames, especially in hand-eye coordination - go here for a rather cautious summary of the benefits of video games - but this sort of intimate brain-and-game feedback loop heralds a cutting edge approach. </p><p>The lab uses a Microsoft Kinect for motion capture when patients engage in full body games. Yet a Kinect doesn't necessarily feel cutting edge - there are expensive motion-capture cameras that would do a far better job. Gazzaley is employing gadgets you might find at Best Buy because if the tests prove successful, he wants these diagnostics available in your living room. If his team can develop games that work with existing home entertainment systems, like an Xbox, these videogame treatments don't require a trip to the hospital.</p><p>\"The minute we show some in-lab validation, we'll move it into people's homes,\" he says.</p><p>This isn't lost on Gazzaley's corporate partners either. \"The holy grail is personalized medicine,\" says Calisa Cole, of NVIDIA's developer relations team. \"Dr. Gazzaley's research is an important component of this goal.\"</p><p>His team of developers have built their own data-crunching backend which runs atop the same NVIDIA chips that powers the Titan super computer. Just down the hall are two MRIs, one for imaging structure, the other for function. Data from the MRI and from the EEG which can already be hacked together at home are combined via clever algorithms to meld the brain's structure and activity into one beautiful traffic model. Think of the MRI as the road map and the EEG as a radar gun. That combination is eventually rendered in a rich 3d model like Hart's brain. </p><p>The brain's ability to adapt and strengthen or weaken depending on conditions, known as plasticity, is still one of nature's greatest wonders. The hundred billion neurons and their thousands of contact points, known as dendrites, create a mind-boggling number of possible connections. The combination of these connections and their firing patterns is what generates things like the memory of trip to New York or a fear of snakes. The Human Connectome Project is attempting to map them all, but devising a reliable guide will be a tall order. </p><p>Recently Hart worked with Gazzaley to show off his synapses while playing the drums. He has also been using images of his brain for backdrops during recent concerts. The architecture of Hart's brain remained on file and that's why I was able to travel through it weeks later. </p><p>And just to get meta with the whole thing, here is Gazzaley's most recent idea: Build a game that lets you travel, Tron-style, around the wiring of your own brain. The areas that need exercises become new levels of the game. After seeing the model of Hart's brain, it's not hard to see how those bridges and pathways could turn into a therapeutic Mario Kart.</p><p>\"If we can determine what's happening in the moment, we can start feeding that neural data back into the game,\" he says.</p><p>\"We think that someone who's had a traumatic brain injury, we could really rewire them in a way we've never been successful with drugs before.\"</p><p>[This article has been updated to clarify there is nothing wrong with Hart's brain. I should have been more clear, as I was trying to demonstrate the overall goal of Gazzaley's lab. For that I apologize to Mickey Hart.]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SFCHRN-U621TFAJ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BK3-XBG1-DYRG-W1B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Francisco Chronicle (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>FINAL Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>February 6, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>BUSINESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>BRAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Social Networking Sites</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJEOEE3NERCMEE5NDAyRTgzQ0QzNTc3MkM3NzI0MUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U2OEYyMDlBMThBNDQxRjg4NkFGM0I4REVDODE1QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp; VIDEO SHARING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DFIV</classCode><className>VIRAL VIDEOS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp; VIDEO SHARING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DFIV</classCode><className>VIRAL VIDEOS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>PE000C5PB</classCode><className>MARK ZUCKERBERG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

We also allow suggestive posts, just not sexually explicit ones,\" the post said.</p><p>That includes:</p><p>\"Nudity in a documentary context, e.g. videos of nude protestors</p><p>Nudity in an artistic context, e.g. nude modeling in an art class</p><p>Nudity that is not sexually provocative, e.g. a mother breastfeeding her child</p><p>Clothed sexually suggestive dancing.\"</p><p>But does that include twerking?</p><h>CONSUMER PRIVACY GROUPS SEEK FTC REVIEW OF FACEBOOK-WHATSAPP DEAL</h><p>Posted on Thursday, March 6 at 3:52pm By Benny Evangelista </p><p>Two consumer rights groups on Thursday petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to block Facebook from accessing the phone numbers and other personal data of WhatsApp's 465 million users.</p><p>The Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Center for Digital Democracy, both based in Washington, D.C., filed the joint complaint seeking review of Facebook's proposed $19 billion deal to buy WhatsApp.</p><p>The FTC and the Justice Department are expected to review the blockbuster deal, which would give the Menlo Park company control over one of the world's most popular mobile phone messaging apps.</p><p>The groups want the FTC to prevent Facebook from tapping WhatsApp's database of mobile phone numbers and other data because WhatsApp users believed the Mountain View app maker would protect their private information.</p><p>\"WhatsApp users could not reasonably have anticipated that by selecting a pro-privacy messaging service, they would subject their data to Facebook's data collection practices,\" the complaint said.</p><h>DOES IT MATTER WHO FOUNDED BITCOIN?</h><p>Posted on Thursday, March 6 at 2:12pm By Caleb Garling </p><p>Who made this? antanacoins</p><p>Newsweek published a story Thursday that appears - appears - to shed light on the origin of \"Satoshi Nakamoto,\" the pseudonym for the person or group of people who created bitcoin.</p><p>Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym, disappeared about three years ago after the controversial and often-misunderstood cryptocurrency got off the ground. Pseudonym-Nakamoto ran chat rooms where cryptographers worked on developing the code behind bitcoin, but then suddenly stopped participating. No one knew why and the question of Nakamoto's identity became one of the greatest sources of online conspiracy theories. Government agent, criminal, employee of a big tech company? All were in play.</p><p>So the potential revelation that he was just an incredibly smart, slightly-odd, aging Japanese-American train enthusiast from the suburbs of Los Angeles sent the bitcoin community in a tizzy. But even though the man that Newsweek found has a name, biography and libertarian values - \"He would say, 'Pretend the government agencies are coming after you.' And I would hide in the closet,\" his daughter reports - that line up almost perfectly with the pseudonym-Nakamoto's online persona, it is still unclear whether he is bitcoin's \"founder,\" what that means, or if it really matters.</p><p>Newsweek says the Satoshi Nakamoto it tracked down is \"The face behind bitcoin,\" but perhaps he's just \"a face.\" Quotes from human-Nakamoto indicate he was involved with bitcoin at some point, but the level of his involvement remains vague at best.</p><p>\"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,\" he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. \"It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.\"</p><p>On the internet, things that look like a duck and talk like a duck aren't necessarily a duck. \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" could still be a pseudonym. As Jason Pontin, editor of the MIT Technology Review, points out, there could still be a group of developers who simply needed a name and lifted it from that very smart man who had helped them with a couple questions.</p><p>One of the chief protests about this Nakamoto being the Nakamoto is that the writing done by pseudonym-Nakamoto doesn't sound like the words of human-Nakamoto. Threads on Reddit and elsewhere point out that pseudonym-Nakamoto used elegant British English during online chats during the cryptocurrency's development. The human-Nakamoto doesn't appear that word again to have the same grasp of the language in his later writings. On top of that, pseudonym-Nakamoto posted during times that lined up with a working day in London - not California. So while human-Nakamoto could have been involved in the start of the project, there is still no additional evidence that he was the one typing on behalf of pseudonym-Nakamoto all those years. He could have passed that work on.</p><p>But all of this winds back to perhaps the most interesting question: Why care? Bitcoin is it's own beast. The origins of Satoshi Nakamoto have made for fun fairy tales, but whether he invented it or not the cryptocurrency is off to the races. The value of bitcoin didn't shift noticeably on the news. The New York Times now calls it \"a brand.\" Governments and regulators are still going to ask all the same questions.</p><p>The one sticking point is that pseudonym-Nakamoto is sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin and human-Nakamoto should probably hire security guards. No one's sure quite why it hasn't been spent, but if pseudonym-Nakamoto were to cash out, it would likely cause bitcoin to fall in value, at least in the short term.</p><p>Another theory is that such a huge transaction could out his identity. Even though it is often characterized as a currency for those who wish to stay anonymous online, bitcoin does have anonymity issues. Outside of being tracked down by reporters.</p><h>FACEBOOK INTRODUCES REDESIGNED NEWS FEED</h><p>Posted on Thursday, March 6 at 12:37pm By Julie Balise </p><p>Facebook is unveiling an updated News Feed in the coming weeks that aims to make its appearance more consistent across platforms, according to a blog post from the company.</p><p>The changes aren't particularly jarring. Images are noticeably larger. Fonts are different. And there's now a light-gray background, which makes the News Feed and right column stand out. The left column is smaller, blending into the background a bit.The \"Update Status,\" \"Add Photos/Video,\" and \"News Feed\" icons have been redesigned.</p><p>A screenshot of the redesigned News Feed is below:</p><p>Facebook's updated News Feed will roll out in the coming weeks. Facebook</p><p>The mobile design will not change.The desktop redesign was based on feedback from an experiment last year where the News Feed featured larger photos and a compressed left rail. The larger photos were popular, Facebook said, while the new navigation was not.</p><p>\"The updated design has the best of both worlds: it keeps the layout and navigation people liked, but offers bigger images and photos, as well as a new font,\" the blog post says.</p><p>The redesign won't change how stories are ranked in the News Feed. Organic stories and ads will be the same size, similar to how images appear on mobile, according to Facebook.</p><p>Marketers do not need to take any action after the redesign, according to the blog post. Creative specs and image requirements will not change, nor will the way companies buy and optimize advertisements.</p><h>GOOGLE BARGE ARRIVES AT PORT OF STOCKTON</h><p>Posted on Thursday, March 6 at 8:48am By Ellen Huet </p><p>UPDATED at 11 a.m.: The Google Barge is expected to dock at the Port of Stockton by late morning Thursday, port director Richard Aschieris said.</p><p>Sacramento TV station KCRA posted a photo as the mystery barge arrived in Stockton. </p><p>The barge was forced to leave its Treasure Island roost because it didn't have the proper permits to stay. It was rumored to be heading to Stockton, but Aschieris said he didn't know for sure until he received a call from his staff about 2 a.m. Thursday.</p><p>The four-story barge sailed away in the early morning darkness toward Stockton.</p><p>Google's representatives agreed to pay between $10,000 to $12,000 per month for a six-month lease of a pier next to port warehouses on Rough and Ready Island, Aschieris said. </p><p>Google agreed to a minimum three-month lease, but the lease could extend beyond six months.</p><p>\"This is a very unique visitor, it's a unique vessel and we're so pleased to have it,\" Aschieris said.</p><p>The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission told Google to leave its berth at Treasure Island because the barge didn't have the required construction permits to remain. Stockton is outside of the commission's jurisdiction.</p><p>Google is keeping its plans for the barge shrouded in mystery. The rumors include a high-tech computer eyewear store, a data storage center and a party boat.</p><p>Aschieris said Google did not disclose details of its plans to the port, which he said is typical for some of the maritime construction work done at his facility.</p><p>\"Some disclose what the project is, some people do not,\" he said. \"Our focus is to provide a secure facility.\"</p><p>- Ellen Huet and Benny Evangelista</p><h>SHARING SHINDIG 2.0</h><p>Posted on Thursday, March 6 at 8:34am By Carolyn Said </p><p>Impact Hub, the SoMA co-working space on the Chronicle's ground floor, usually looks like Hipster Central with folks intent on their laptops or smartphones perched throughout its postmodern industrial open floor plan space.</p><p>Natalie Foster of Peers.org, left, and Rachel Barge of Yerdle.com show off treasures they found at the swap.</p><p>But on Wednesday night, it took on the more retro feel of a church tag sale as a couple of dozen people picked through piles of used clothes on folding tables.</p><p>The occasion: \"PeersSwap,\" a clothing swap held by a variety of technology enterprises that promote various forms of sharing. Peers.org, the industry-backed \"sharing economy\" advocacy group, sponsored a month of swaps worldwide in tandem with Fashion Week. Yerdle, Swapdom and thredup sponsored Wednesday's event, the final of 75 swaps.</p><p>Folks picked through gently used clothing items heaped on tables in the Hub co-working space.</p><p>\"Everyone here tonight has brought a few clothes they don't wear anymore and they're going to go home with some new-to-you fashion finds,\" said Holly Minch, chief storyteller at Peers.org.</p><p>The idea was to show sharing in action. Of course, while a clothing swap - like a library or a babysitting co-op - truly exemplifies sharing, most enterprises in the sharing economy are for-profit companies think Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, Taskrabbit so their versions of \"sharing\" involve exchanges of money.</p><h>REPORT: BITCOIN FOUNDER IS 64-YEAR-OLD SO. CALIF. MAN</h><p>Posted on Thursday, March 6 at 8:31am By Ellen Huet </p><p>Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive founder of Bitcoin, hasn't been heard from in years, has stopped playing an active role in the cryptocurrency's develoment and has always been a mystery.</p><p>But Newsweek's story on Nakamoto Thursday claims that the founder is a 64-year-old Japanese-American man, born with the same name but who changed it to Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto after graduating from Cal State Polytechnic University decades ago.</p><p>This Nakamoto, a quiet libertarian and skilled mathematician and computer engineer who worked on various classified government projects and has a deep love of model trains, didn't confirm for Newsweek that he founded Bitcoin. But most of the known details of the founder's line up with his.</p><p>Even his family didn't know for sure. His children, when approached by Newsweek, said it was shocking but possible, given that their dad is an extremely private man.</p><p>\"My brother is an asshole,\" one of Nakamoto's brothers told the Newsweek reporter, Leah McGrath Goodman. \"What you don't know about him is that he's worked on classified stuff. His life was a complete blank for a while. You're not going to be able to get to him. He'll deny everything. He'll never admit to starting Bitcoin.\"</p><p>Bitcoin enthusiasts have already begun to criticize Goodman and Newsweek for publishing details about Nakamoto, including his home address and the names of his family members, saying they wished his privacy had been respected. Others were still skeptical that the claim about his identity is true.

I watch our younger daughter while my wife works, then we swap. I cheat, though, letting my daughter watch Amazon Prime Video on her iPad while I Slack on mine. Everywhere in the house, the pandemic takes things away and technology offers recompense. My son, a recent college graduate, works upstairs, doing digital marketing on Facebook. My older daughter attends college on Zoom, from her bedroom. We just replaced her pink childhood bed with a queen. Amazon delivered the mattress, which it also manufactured.</p><p><br/>The fusion of technology's rule and the pandemic's chaos felt particularly poignant yesterday, as the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/29/apple-google-facebook-amazon-congress-hearing/\">grilled</url>Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, and Google's Sundar Pichai. The proceedings started an hour late, and the four CEOs all appeared virtually. As I waited for the hearing to start, the feed of the nearly empty room in the Rayburn House Office Building seemed hauntingly apt: Lawmakers mingled, masked amid their nation's pandemic failure, awaiting remote testimony from its industrial lords, who were unmoved by the material world. Photographers knelt awkwardly before the testimony table, pointing their lenses at the empty witness chair, perhaps taking symbolic, meme-worthy photos of its void.<br/>The congressional inquiry wasn't focused on the pandemic, but rather on alleged abuses of monopoly power: Google's dominance in the digital-ad market, Apple's control of software in its App Store, Amazon's treatment of third-party sellers, and Facebook's aggressive pursuit of large competitors. The CEOs mostly danced around or denied these accusations.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/tech-giants-are-dangerous-and-congress-knows-it/614740/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The tech giants are dangerous, and Congress knows it</url>]<br/>Their influence cannot be denied. The technological underpinnings of ordinary life during the pandemic are impossible to avoid, in part because this crisis has made the tech industry only more ubiquitous. By the time the antitrust testimony finally started, I was able to relocate from the kitchen iPad to the office computer, but my younger daughter had begun her piano lesson outside the door (via Zoom, of course, on another iPad we bought from Tim Cook). I joined a last-minute video meeting at my university too, while watching the antitrust hearing, while comparing notes about it in Slack with my Atlantic colleagues. It feels quaint to call this \"multitasking,\" an outmoded walk-and-chew-gum euphemism for the desperate, computerized constancy of daily life. The pandemic is inescapable, but so is technology.<br/>Antitrust law is supposed to ensure market competition, and the technology sector is a worthy target for its intervention-it pervades every crevice of ordinary life. All business is tech business. Banking is computers doing finance. Automobiles are computers spinning drivetrains. Retailers are warehouse pick-and-pack computers connected to freight-logistics routing computers. In his opening statement at the hearing, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin emphasized the need to conduct oversight of Big Tech, but he also praised the tech companies whose CEOs he was addressing. In particular, Sensenbrenner cited grocery delivery among the \"myriad of our daily needs\" that the companies now provide. The coronavirus pandemic has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/how-youll-shop-for-groceries-after-the-pandemic/610135/?utm_source=feed\">finally made that market broadly</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/how-youll-shop-for-groceries-after-the-pandemic/610135/?utm_source=feed\">appealing</url>. But that doesn't put grocery in the tech sector, even if Amazon owns Whole Foods. It just makes technology a ghost that haunts all business, including food shopping.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/how-youll-shop-for-groceries-after-the-pandemic/610135/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The supermarket after the pandemic</url>]<br/>Tech rules in smaller, less noticed ways too. In my video meeting, someone noted that the university assumes that professors teaching online will provide their own cameras, mics, and broadband. This everywhereness of technology pervaded the hearing. A tech CEO testifying from home is no different from what many professionals have been doing for months, but there's something unnerving about seeing these titans of industry presented inside the technologies their industry commands. Seen on screens within the screen, the CEOs seemed impervious to lawmaker interrogation.<br/>At one point, the antitrust subcommittee's chair, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, called a 10-minute recess to fix a technical issue with one of the participants. It might have been Bezos, who hadn't said a word since his opening statement, a five-minute long paean to himself. Radio and television and print work, at scale, almost all of the time. But even despite its wealth and power, technology still fails remarkably often. Amazon Web Services provides <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2019/08/02/amazon-owns-nearly-half-of-the-public-cloud-infrastructure-market-worth-over-32-billion-report/#5a73159e29e0\">almost half</url> of the cloud computing that other technology companies build their businesses upon; <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273735/amazon-down-outage-aws-us-united-states\">outages</url>, though rare, can effectively bring down the whole of the internet for most users.<br/>When Bezos finally spoke again, he fielded questions from Representatives Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015\">Amazon's misuse of data from sellers</url> and its predatory pricing on diapers. A blurry handful of books on a credenza behind the richest man in the world seemed to bear the distinctive orange spine of Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize\"winning book about how European and North American civilizations conquered the globe.<br/>With the pandemic raging outside, we have few places to safely go, because the  government botched its response to the contagion. But Facebook and other technology platforms have probably <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/28/stella-immanuel-hydroxychloroquine-video-trump-americas-frontline-doctors/\">made some aspects of the crisis worse</url>. Inside my home, there's little I can't do, thanks to the profusion of technology all around me. I can write articles to be promoted on Facebook or books to be sold on Amazon. I can make apps and games for Apple or Google devices. I can start a business, \"the next Apple or Amazon,\" perhaps, a future beneficiary of this antitrust inquiry, according to Jayapal.<br/>But instead I'm just scrambling to get through today and every day, hoping for a reprieve. I zeroed the volume on the hearing and unmuted my mic to weigh in on the work video call: \"I think if we're going to do more things, we need to eliminate some of the other things to make room for them,\" I mustered. Antitrust is supposed to do the same thing, except for business: encourage competition by breaking up or regulating companies that grow too large-a demand Representative Cicilline issued. But just as the pandemic's public-health disruption feels endless and out of control, the technology sector's disruptive innovation seems too entrenched to upend easily. In both cases, nothing appears to change, only to persist, even as spectacles like this one demand intervention. Through the speakers of my computer, Representative Ken Buck of Colorado intoned, \"Capitalism is the greatest instrument for freedom this world has ever seen.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-antitrusthearingtechpandemicinescapable614749</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-FSY1-JCG7-V00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1138\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

And while many observers are guardedly optimistic, no one knows for sure yet how this crisis will play out or what sorts of shortages the industry might still face.The big picture: Facebook says it remains short on Oculus VR headsets. Apple is reportedly[1] short of replacement parts for iPhones, while also warning of other constraints. </p><p>In a regulatory filing,[2] Salesforce cautioned that \"the ongoing coronavirus epidemic could potentially disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business.\"Logitech told Axios that its Suzhou, China, factory is operational, as are many of its supplier factories. However, it said in a statement that \"due to the availability of labor and varying timing of component supply recovery, there is potential for delays to new product introductions.\"Qualcomm's CFO said last month that the company sees \"significant uncertainty\" from coronavirus' impact on the supply chain, while Intel has painted a mixed picture. Uncertain demand has helped the company catch up a bit after struggling to meet PC makers' demand for chips. While that's good news for Intel, it indicates there may be supply and/or demand issues in other parts of the computer business. Yes, but: Even as the virus spreads to more parts of Europe and the U.S., the situation in China appears to have stabilized. Apple CEO Tim Cook noted the improvements in a Fox Business interview two weeks ago, but he said they were coming more slowly than Apple had hoped, hence the company's need to lower its financial outlook. \"It feels to me that China is getting the coronavirus under control,\" Cook said.\"You look at the numbers, they're coming down day by day by day. And so I'm very optimistic there.\"Logitech told Axios it expects supply to reach \"near-normal conditions by the end of March or April, barring a worsening coronavirus situation.\" What's next: Industry insiders emphasized that the situation remains fluid, with companies having teams of people monitoring supply chain issues around the clock. \"Anything can still happen,\" said a source at one big tech company. Shipping and delivery could become a new choke point in the industry's operations, especially if more regions end up in lockdowns like Italy's. The bottom line: If China's measures against the virus continue to be effective, the supply chain might resume near-normal capacity just as demand drops, thanks to a virus-induced economic slowdown that dampens consumer and business spending.

Indeed, they are already changing it.</p><p>\"This is a classic missing the forest for the trees, looking at the charters,\" said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics. \"Who needs a charter? They can offer the structural equivalent without one.\"</p><p>Amazon has done more than $1 billion in small-business lending since it first started offering loans. In 2017, it launched Amazon Cash, which effectively allows it to take cash deposits from customers via ubiquitous convenience stores like 7-Eleven and Sheetz. Other tech firms, including Apple and Samsung, offer their own payment apps.</p><p>It's not clear what tech giants have in store next, but they will likely push the limits of traditional finance. It's not hard to imagine the Bank of Alexa, enabling customers to move money and pay bills just by shouting at the Amazon Echo in their living rooms.</p><p>The barbarians aren't at the gate anymore. They're inside the walls.</p><p>Some see a massive break looming in the banking business.</p><p>In a report issued in late 2017, McKinsey &amp; Co. predicted a split between \"manufacturers\" of banking, the core business of financing and lending that is hard for tech firms to replace, versus \"distributors,\" the origination and sales side of the business where outside competitors have an easier time entering the system.</p><p>If banks effectively end up as utilities to larger tech firms, they will lose out. McKinsey forecasts manufacturing will produce only 35% of profits in finance, a return on equity of 4.4%. Distribution, meanwhile, will produce 65% of profits, with a return on equity of 20%.</p><p>\"As platform companies extend their tentacles into banking, it is the rich returns of the distribution business they are targeting,\" McKinsey concluded. \"And in many cases, they are better positioned for distribution than banks are.\"</p><p>Most experts agree that banks still have three key advantages: the sheer ability to manufacture finance, which isn't easy for tech competitors; a mound of data on customers' financial activities; and customer trust.</p><p>\"When it comes to customers' decisions about where to place their money, research shows that banks enjoy greater trust than tech companies,\" the McKinsey report said.</p><p>But tech companies are putting pressure on banks in all three areas. A recent survey by Bain &amp; Co. put Amazon and PayPal nearly as high as banks in levels of customer trust.</p><p>Remember that theoretical Bank of Alexa? More than 25% of U.S. respondents in the Bain survey said they would consider using \"voice-controlled assistants for their everyday banking.\" And Amazon dominates that market. On Cyber Monday 2017 - the largest single shopping day in the company's history - the biggest-selling item was the Echo Dot, its entry-level Alexa speaker. That's a lot of voice-controlled assistants already in bank customers' homes.</p><p>Amazon, Google and Facebook are sitting on their own pile of data that includes everything from what customers already own to what they secretly covet (via searches online). There's no doubt that tech companies are eager to find ways to exploit that information in the financial services arena.</p><p>Some analysts argue that banks have squandered their data advantage.</p><p>\"Who owns the customer?\" asked Petrou. \"Who owns the data? Banks assume they do. They haven't capitalized on it.\"</p><p>So what can banks do in the shadow of Amazon and others' moves into their business?</p><p>For one, they can stop focusing on distracting fights about bank charters. Federal regulators are unlikely to grant one to a Silicon Valley firm in any case - and those firms don't need one to take away business from banks.</p><p>More important, banks must stay in the forefront of customers' minds. In consumer trust, they are still winning. And while that advantage is eroding, it's not gone yet. And for tougher credits, it may never fade.</p><p>\"Small banks succeed because they are in their communities dealing with the tough credit issues that nobody else wants to solve,\" said Howard Headlee, the head of the Utah Bankers Association. \"Amazon and Google aren't going to do that.\"</p><p>Banks also need to continue innovating. Customers want to go to tech firms only if they are offering something they can't get at their own bank.</p><p>Even McKinsey said banks are making strides there. Both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo recently launched mobile-only banking apps with an emphasis on making it easier for customers to interact.</p><p>Through strategic partnerships and a focus on customer service, banks may not be out of the running yet - with or without Amazon or Google trying to enter the business.</p><p>\"It is not too far-fetched to imagine a day when banks will offer a range of services, reach a vastly larger customer base, and succeed at their digital rivals' game,\" McKinsey said in the report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000160-c1ca-dbbf-ab76-ebda80120000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RBG-NW21-JCRW-508M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

They furthered a clich: The doddering American political elite, who sometimes seemed to confuse Messenger with the passenger pigeon, would never have the savvy to keep up with the dynamism of Big Tech, let alone regulate it.</p><p><br/>The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust thoroughly debunked that strand of conventional wisdom today. Hauling the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google to testify together as a unit, the subcommittee produced a hearing that was the antithesis of the Zuckerberg fiasco of 2018.  <br/>Congress gets kicked so often for doltish preening that it seems a great miracle when it actually does its job. David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, has conducted a master class in how to frame an issue and then press a case for action. Having hired the pathbreaking legal scholar <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/lina-khan-antitrust/561743/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvIT5BRCqARIsAAwwD-QO_ofUBTg187rZ9YMinZ2ZPzL-KUvrVPcOhkBkKgl9vO3v2Dtn1CsaAuWREALw_wcB&amp;amp;utm_source=feed\">Lina Khan</url> to his staff, he spent a year subpoenaing documents from the companies, talking widely with their employees (and ex-employees), and interviewing legal experts.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/pandemic-making-monopolies-worse/614644/?utm_source=feed\">David Dayen: America's monopoly problem goes way beyond the tech giants</url>]<br/>By the time the subcommittee called the CEOs, it had amassed deep knowledge and uncovered a damning paper trail. With many of their questions, members seemed to know the inner workings of the companies better than their executives. Asking about anticompetitive practices, Cicilline reduced Google's Sundar Pichai to mumbling incoherently about kettlebells; using specific examples, the subcommittee members Pramila Jayapal and Joe Neguse prodded Amazon's Jeff Bezos into admitting instances of his company's anticompetitive behavior.<br/>Ever since the election of President Donald Trump, which revealed the rampant manipulation of social media, the backlash against Silicon Valley has often felt shapeless. Because these companies have tendrils extended into seemingly every aspect of American life, the complaints against them have sprawled. They have been criticized for an insensitivity to privacy, their role in the proliferation of misinformation, their cozy relationship with China, their creation of addictive products, their tax-avoidance schemes, and so on. With such a boundless litany of attacks, the companies have benefited from their critics' failure to focus their arguments.<br/>But where Zuckerberg suffered a barrage of disconnected complaints, these hearings got to the nub of the problem: The internet has allowed the creation of a new style of monopoly. Nobody escapes the pull of these dominant firms, which have the power to pick winners and losers, in both the economy and the realm of information. The long, familiar list of complaints about the tech giants was distilled to its most essential element-the danger that concentrated market power poses to competitive capitalism and democracy.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/big-tech-pandemic-power-grab/612238/?utm_source=feed\">Franklin Foer: What Big Tech wants out of the pandemic</url>]<br/>Like every other occasion in Trump's Washington, the hearings featured instances of partisan sniping. But what made the proceeding so distinctive is the broad agreement they evinced. Hardly any member was willing to defend the companies with anything close to conviction. Even when Trump's devoted defender Jim Jordan launched into conspiracy theories about how Google aims to strangle conservative opinion, he was mouthing a version of Cicilline's argument. The companies, Jordan was saying, have become omnipotent gatekeepers with the power to invisibly shape the flow of information however they please.<br/>Invoking a dusty name, several Democrats on the committee spoke reverently about the Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who led the anti-monopoly movement of the early 20th century. By conjuring his ghost, they were aligning themselves with an older, more pugilistic strand of antitrust than has been practiced in Washington the past few generations. They were signaling a broader revolt against the long-dominant Chicago school of political economy, under which the government's worries about monopoly narrow to a standard called \"consumer welfare.\" In that paradigm, regulators and courts sought to punish only monopolies that raised prices, which meant that they rarely took any action at all. (And the standard seems antiquated in an era when many tech companies give their products to consumers for free.) But today's hearings represented a return to Brandeisian worries about corporate behemoths, about how they use their size to hurt small businesses, how concentrated economic power can so easily distort the functioning of democracy.<br/>Not so many years ago, the idea that Congress would ask such tough questions of the most revered figures in American capitalism was unimaginable. These hearings contained the intellectual framework and the practical case for a Democratic administration to break these companies into smaller pieces. Such dramatic action is not easy to imagine, given the ideological bent of the courts and the millions that the companies have spent on lobbying. Still, the work of Cicilline's committee, its diligence and its passion, has rendered that radical possibility plausible.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-techgiantsaredangerousandcongressknowsit614740</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-GDR1-JCG7-V000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

At $160bn, it is now worth more than three times more than legacy automaker General Motors and exceeded only by Toyota, which made 9m cars in 2019 compared to Tesla's 367,500.</p><p>Tesla, however, is left in the shade by the true giants of global tech.</p><p>Put together, two of the biggest US tech companies-Apple and Microsoft-are now worth just under $2.8 trillion. That is more than the valuation of the entire FTSE100 (about \u00a32 trillion or $2.6 trillion) and modestly higher than the GDP of Great Britain in 2019 ($2.7 trillion), according to IMF figures.</p><p>Such dizzying statistics prompt an inevitable question: How far are we into bubble territory? And will 2020 be the year of a great unravelling in tech valuations, just as it was back in 2000?</p><p>Complacency would be foolish-but there are important differences this time around that are worth considering.</p><p>The bull-market rally which peaked in 2000 was propelled by real technological advances in the 1990s and the commercialisation of the Internet.</p><p>There were solid, profitable companies involved like Intel, Cisco and Oracle.Others like Amazon and Ebay survived the shake-down and made a comeback a few years later.</p><p>Nevertheless, when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned in 1996 of 'irrational exuberance' in the markets he was onto something. A feeding frenzy was emerging. Powered by cheap money, easy capital and overconfidence, it fuelled a speculative bubble where seemingly any company which slapped a dotcom at the end of its name was able to raise cash-often with the flimsiest of business plans, little real proprietary technology and minimal revenues.</p><p>By January 2000-a few weeks before it raised $82m in an IPO-Pets.com shelled out $1.2m for an advert during the Superbowl which was equivalent to roughly double its revenue in 1999 of $619,000. </p><p>Fast forward twenty years and the situation is rather different.</p><p>Of course, there are still plenty of flimsy tech start-up companies out there-but many of these are in private hands or are controlled by big spending investment funds like Softbank.</p><p>There are fewer IPOs of immature companies now than there were during the last dotcom bubble and all of the stars of the current boom on the public markets are mature companies which earn real money.</p><p>Take Facebook, which at 15 years of age is the youngest of the so-called FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) group of companies-whose combined market value jumped 40pc in 2019 compared with a rise of 25pc in the broader US market.</p><p>In fact, all of the 16 US tech companies worth more than $100bn are now more than 15 years old-and although they are a diverse bunch, they are all financially robust too.</p><p>In the three months ended December 28, Apple for example reported revenues of $91.8bn and profits of $22.2bn. It is sitting on a cash pile of $207bn.</p><p>Even Tesla posted a $105m profit in the fourth quarter on revenues of $7.4bn.</p><p>None of this means these companies may not be over-valued of course.</p><p>In fact, they are-just not by historically distorted levels. </p><p>Apple's shares are currently trading at a P/E ratio of just over 25-slightly below McDonalds at 27.

On July 31st Apple announced results for its third quarter that handily beat analysts' expectations. Revenues rose by 17% compared with the same period in 2017, and profits were 32% higher. The firm's shares jumped by nearly 4% in after-hours trading. But Apple did not quite manage to become the world's first widely held listed company with a market capitalisation of $1trn (see chart).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The near miss is a fitting coda to the latest round of results in techland. Momentum in this most upwardly mobile of industries is unbroken; sales and profits are still rising. But the laws of economic gravity have not been repealed. In fact, the era of the FAANGs\u2014 as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google's parent, Alphabet, are collectively known\u2014may be coming to an end, giving way to a period in which two groups of tech firms follow different trajectories.</p><p>This year the FAANGs and a few other high-flying tech firms provided more than half the returns in the S&amp;P 500 share index. Netflix's share price, for instance, more than doubled between January and July. Twitter's almost did so. Facebook's market value quickly recovered from a low in March, after revelations that its data on 87m users had leaked to a British political-campaign firm.</p><p>With their shares priced for near-perfect results, the firms were vulnerable to bad news. This duly arrived, starting with Netflix, a video-streaming service, which said in mid-July that it had added fewer subscribers than expected. A few days later Facebook gave downbeat guidance about future growth and margins. Then Twitter, a microblogging site, announced that its number of active users had declined. All three firms' share prices plunged by about a fifth.</p><p>News of the wipeout overshadowed the fact that the other tech titans continue to do well, as also evidenced in July. Microsoft, the world's biggest software firm, reached $100bn in annual revenue for the first time. Alphabet shrugged off the $5bn fine recently imposed on it by European trustbusters and posted strong results. Amazon announced a record quarterly profit.</p><p>These diverging results point to a broader development. Throwing all the FAANGs and other big tech firms into one basket has always been lazy. In the future they will probably be seen as two different groups: a consumer-oriented one, which could, somewhat awkwardly, be called \"FATWIN\" (Facebook, Twitter and Netflix) and a more business-to-business group, which some already dub \"MAGA\" (Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Apple).</p><p>The first group shows signs of reaching maturity. It is not that the firms will now stagnate. Facebook's revenues grew by 42%; Twitter's were up by 24%. But signs abound that social media's best days are over. Advertising revenues are not infinite. Users are exhibiting social-media fatigue. And regulators will continue to prod firms to police their platforms (one of the reasons for Facebook's shrinking margins is that it has been hiring thousands of moderators to vet users' posts). The firm's earnings call should be seen as a \"big reset of investor expectations\", says Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets, a bank.</p><p>The second group benefits from the fact that companies continue to embrace cloud computing, particularly as it starts to encompass artificial-intelligence services. Amazon's record profits were generated by its cloud-computing arm, as were Microsoft's expanding revenues. Google, too, is making more money from the cloud, although it still depends on advertising as its main engine. As for Apple, being mainly a hardware-maker, it stands apart. Although it did not ship as many iPhones as expected, it sold them at a higher average price. Its services business, which includes the iTunes music store and the iCloud bundle of offerings, had its best quarter ever, posting revenues of nearly $10bn.</p><p>Overall, tech firms will continue to thrive, says Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research. Yet all bets will be off should America's trade war with China continue to get hotter. Apple is most vulnerable. Not only are most of its devices made in China, but the country is its second-largest market. If Apple gets hit by tariffs, another company is likely to get to $1trn first. But right now, that prize seems within its reach. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-K57DB53</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SY3-GJH1-JBKN-B02D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"719\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

What had happened to make him come and slum it among us mortals in the (badly paid) policy world? Answer: the unit had been shut down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's in this context that you should see the milquetoast response of the tech giants to the government's \"online harms\" white paper published on Monday which the Open Rights Group has called \"state regulation of the speech of millions of British citizens\".</p><p>It's the very same reason that Mark Zuckerberg wrote an article in favour of regulation in The Washington Post last month. It's not so much evidence of the famed startup's recent decision to \"pivot to privacy\", but the logical endpoint of years of triangulation.</p><p>For the first amendment advocates of buccaneering Silicon Valley, times have changed. A nudge here, a concession there, and now a full volte-face. Move fast and break things is out. Regulation is in.</p><p>There is, of course, good business sense in this decision. In fact, that's the problem.</p><p>Facebook, one of the largest companies in the world, isn't trying to protect the consumer - it's protecting itself. It's been an annus horribilis for the social media company, yet its profits continue to grow.</p><p>Now that the tide of public perception is turning, so Facebook and other tech giants are building a regulatory moat to protect their business interests - and it's startups like those we represent at the Coalition for a Digital Economy who will suffer.</p><p>In research we published last year, 86 per cent of UK investors said that policies targeting the tech giants could hit startups harder. We've seen this already with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, and are likely to see it again with the Copyright Directive. Where European watchdogs thought that regulation would balance the market, it has actually tilted it further towards the tech giants.</p><p>In the UK, this conversation about reining in the platforms is coming in many different forms - from chancellor Philip Hammond's digital services tax to the Cairncross review. But top of the list is the online harms white paper. In the words of Sajid Javid this week, it aims to address the \"hunting ground for monsters\" on the internet.</p><p>Strong words, but in short the intention is to make the tech giants face up to the harms their platforms have created. But the scope means that this isn't just about social media - it's about the whole internet. And the challenges of defining harms like misinformation or bullying mean that it's pretty vague too.</p><p>When you build a massive, burdensome piece of ill-defined regulation, the people with the most resources to comply and the fanciest lawyers tend to benefit. Needless to say - those aren't the companies who sit with us in our co-working space in Shoreditch.</p><p>So the question that will define the next stage of tech development is: do we want the digital market to be more like the telecoms or utilities sector, with a handful of regulated, massive players? Or will it allow the chance for organic (hopefully British) competitors to grow and compete with today's tech giants? The government already has an answer to this question from the Furman review into digital competition commissioned by the Treasury and published last month.</p><p>In it, Harvard professor and former Obama adviser Jason Furman and the panel wrote that digital regulation had \"the potential to be complementary, but could also cut across each other if taken forward in isolation\", and the government \"should ensure that pro-competition aims and functions are aligned with others, and that the regulatory landscape for digital businesses is kept simple\".</p><p>They were warning about things exactly like the online harms white paper, which will perversely embed the players who happened to be at the top of the market when the music stopped, and will reward the bad behaviour that the government intended to punish.</p><p>Furman argued for measures to broaden competition in the digital space, not stifle it. At the time, the government welcomed the report. They might want to give it another read.</p><p>\u00a3 Dom Hallas is executive director of the Coalition for a Digital Economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-148177041</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVH-N861-JCBW-N0NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 City A.M.

Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are closing the decade as the world's first <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">trillion-dollar companies</url>. Last year, Apple's revenue was larger than Vietnam's GDP, while Amazon's research and development spending alone is almost as much as Iceland's GDP. Facebook boasts       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">2.4 billion users</url>, a population larger than that of every continent except Asia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big tech may offer much to us as consumers but, as the decade progressed, it became clear that it presents a problem for us as citizens who want elections that adhere to advertising laws and are free from foreign interference. It's also a problem for people who want to live in towns with functioning retail high streets, and where logistics and delivery are secure, proper jobs, not rendered precarious by Amazon's ruthless margin-squeezing. And it's a problem for us as democrats who depend on independent news media to hold our elected representatives to account.</p><p>Companies this size are even bad for capitalism itself. They dominate markets and quash competition: Google and Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">control</url> an estimated 60% of all online advertising, and, in the US, Amazon gets       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">four in every</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">10</url> dollars spent online. Should another tech company show promise, one of these firms just gobbles it up. </p><p>The decade gave us new concepts to account for all this: the political economist Nick Srnicek talks of \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">platform capitalism</url> \", a business model of creating market trading platforms, extracting vast amounts of data and seeking monopoly. Prof Shoshana Zuboff dubbed this \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">surveillance capitalism</url> \", warning of the risks that data poses to democracy and freedom.</p><p>Let's look back at the headlines in 2010. Facebook was under attack for exposing information that users <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">assumed was private</url> ; Google exited China after cyberattacks aimed at human rights activists; Apple had a huge       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">US iPad data breach</url> ; and there was an \"epidemic\" of worker suicides at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">Chinese factories run by Foxconn</url>, which makes Apple products. Amazon meanwhile was found to be selling a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">paedophile advice guide</url> - and was locked in argument with publishers over ebook royalties.</p><p>Researchers at the time warned that something was rotten in the state of California, too. \"Cyberlaw\" scholars Lawrence Lessig and Jonathan Zittrain <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">argued</url> that we must grapple with who would govern cyberspace and how. Prof Siva Vaidhyanathan feared \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">the Googlization of</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">everything</url> \" and Evgeny Morozov       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">railed</url> against \"the net delusion\" - the naive notion that the internet would liberate the world. During Facebook's 2012 IPO, Mark Zuckerberg       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">wrote</url> : \"We hope to change how people relate to their governments and social institutions.\" He should have been more careful what he wished for.</p><p>But if the problems were so evident so early, why didn't governments rein the industry in?</p><p>Big tech moved at a scale and speed that states and regulators couldn't match. As marketplaces, they benefit from \"network effects\", where each additional user improves the utility of a service, producing a positive feedback loop of growth. Running costs barely change as more people join. This has allowed their rise to surpass those of other boom industries in the past, from automobiles to oil: one additional car on the roads, for instance, causes more congestion. </p><p>In the first half of the 2010s, financial crisis was spreading from the US to the eurozone and political energies were directed away from the tech industry. There was a skills gap - career politicians and their advisers lacked expertise to even identify the problems, let alone design fixes. But more than this, governments didn't want to rein tech firms in. They were an engine of growth in an otherwise sclerotic economy. And Barack Obama thought that social media and micro-targeted digital communications had helped him win the 2012 election. (Then Trump thought much the same.) There was no political will for change.</p><p>There is finally momentum growing around regulation: in 2018, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">GDPR</url> made legislative ground for user data protection and privacy, and ongoing EU antitrust rulings are chipping away at monopolistic excesses. Increasing tech employee activism provides a kind of internal regulation, too. The next decade will also see more competition from Chinese firms such as Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu - though this is just more platform capitalism wearing a different hat.</p><p>Are alternatives possible? I would like to be more confident than I am. This decade has seen decentralised social networks such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">Mastodon, Gab</url>, Diaspora and the dark web either sputter out or, in the absence of moderators, fill instead with Nazis and paedophiles. Every so often there's a call for a publicly funded state social media platform - but, with Boris Johnson gunning for the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">BBC licence fee</url> in the UK, this is but a pipedream.</p><p>In the US and UK, with rightwing populists in power, greater state regulation may not go exactly as tech commentators of the early 2010s hoped. There are fundamental tensions in what we are asking of Facebook, Google and Twitter. We fear how far they shape and control the information billions see - but, in seeking action on abusive content and misinformation, we ask that they exert yet more control, not less.</p><p>The social media era is already waning: we're shifting away from public posting towards private and small group messaging. I expect to see tech companies getting better at the small design decisions that discourage hostile digital behaviour - though I hold little hope for decisive action on the big issues of antitrust or curtailing data collection. The tech headlines of 2019 - \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">Facebook revenues soar despite $5.1bn in fines</url> \", \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/apple-becomes-worlds-first-trillion-dollar-company\">Google hit with 'historic' monopoly abuse investigation</url> \" - may well predict the state of things in 2029.</p><p> Jay Owens is a researcher and writer interested in media, technology and modernity</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-59056840</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW4-7XP1-F021-61C6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1003\"/><timeReceived>1:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

See also: GoogleMaps Takes You Inside New York City Restaurants Hidary, 45, on the other hand, is a self-described \"nerd\" who went to computer camp and learned his first computer language when he was 14. And his geek credentials don't end there.</p><p> At 19, as an undergrad at Columbia University, he helped set up the campus network, and posted flyers that said \"Get email! It works!\" to convince people to get an email address. Then, in 1995, he created EarthWeb, one of the first consulting companies for the tech community, which went public in 1998. He later bought tech career website Dice.com, in 1999.</p><p> Hidary is a first-generation web person, and the only candidate running to succeed Michael Bloomberg who has extensive experience in the tech world. \"There's no other candidate that is in the race that has the connections that I have in Silicon Valley,\" Hidary, who is also on the advisory board of GoogleX Labs, told Mashable in an interview at our office in Manhattan.</p><p> Despite being a techie, he knows that he can't run his campaign on technology alone. In fact, he spent most of our interview talking about how to improve schools in New York City - and he's running as part of his own Jobs and Education Party, a name that he says underscores his campaign priorities.</p><p> For Hidary, schools still rely too much on the old, textbook-based model. What schools should do instead is make kids work in small teams, solving problems, even \"tinkering\" as if they were at Maker Faire (the \"festival of invention, creativity and resourcefulness\").</p><p> In other words, and here Hidary draws from his education in neuroscience, \"It's called blended learning, because it's hitting different parts of the brain, not just one part of the brain. It's hitting the visual part, it's hitting the team-based part, it's hitting the problem-solving part - not just memorization and writing some answers down.\"</p><p> A more dynamic, interactive way of learning is not the only change Hidary wants to see in schools. He wants to teach kids computer science starting in elementary school - and give schools fast Internet.</p><p> \"We can not expect our kids to be part of the future if they are stuck in buildings in the past,\" he said.</p><p> Wiring up schools and improving their broadband is also part of Hidary's plan to improve Internet access in the city. The aspiring mayor thinks he can improve access to broadband without waiting for the federal government.</p><p> For Hidary, the easiest things to do would be to \"aggregate demand,\" creating shared workspaces for startups, and convince companies like Time Warner Cable or Verizon to pre-install fiber cables in the buildings. Shared Wi-Fi networks like fon.com can also help improve bandwidth, and even wireless mesh networks are something worth looking at, he said.  See also: Why Monopolistic Telecoms Threaten Internet Equality Shared workspaces are another of Hidary's main talking points. His plan would be to get them to expand past Manhattan, with the goal of helping small businesses in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.</p><p> At the same time, Hidary wants New York to keep pushing in its fight to become a big tech hub. That's something that would benefit the entire city economy, he said, citing a study (. PDF) by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute, which found that every high tech job creates 4.3 jobs in other sectors of the economy.</p><p> One of the challenges in pitching that idea to tech companies will be to convince them that New York is a friendly place for startups that defy the status quo in old businesses like tourism and transportation. Successful startups like Uber and AirBnB have had some trouble in New York City, clashing against lobbyists and old, stiff, regulations.</p><p> \"We need leadership that recognizes that technology sometimes leapfrogs regulations,\" Hidary said, without getting too specific.</p><p> As noted by The Observer, running independently will be an uphill battle for Hidary, not only because he won't have any large party support, but also in terms of financing his campaign. For that reason, Hidary is crowdfunding the campaign through CrowdTilt, where he raised more than $50,000 to open his campaign office in Brooklyn.</p><p> Financing aside, it might be hard for Hidary to convince New Yorkers outside of the tech scene that he's the person suited to lead the city, although he thinks that not being a career politician, like the other candidates, is a point in his favor. But this lack of experience may raise questions about his credentials in other areas, like crime, for instance.</p><p> When asked about the New York Police Department's controversial crime prevention program \"stop and frisk,\" Hidary, perhaps surprised by the question, deflected it. \"I think that in a modified form we will have stop and frisk, but I want to bring these other technologies to fight crime as well,\" referring to high-tech anti-crime technologies like ShotSpotter, a network of hidden microphones that detect gunfire.</p><p> Perhaps simply being the techie in the mayoral race won't give him a significant advantage over candidates like Anthony Weiner (even though he's proven he doesn't understand certain technologies so well), but at least Hidary brings an expertise in technology to the table. Geeks like us, and tech companies like MakerBot, will surely appreciate that.</p><p> Image: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for Hubert Burda Media</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSHNWS-cfe62b840ff414a42a7e429f01b20f1483bc8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C251672A101 MSHNWS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5995-NT81-F0NV-F118-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"984\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Mashable, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

As this \"techlash\" gains momentum, new and more radical ways to curb the abuses of the big tech and social media giants are taking hold. Worried behavioral scientists are also now raising concerns over the impact on our daily lives of growing social media addiction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Proposals that Facebook, Google and other major platforms need the kind of regulation slapped on the financial industry after the 2008 crisis are gaining ground. Congress is contemplating legislation that would require transparency of the sponsors of online political ads. Germany already has laws that impose stiff fines for hate speech and fake news on social media if not immediately deleted. On May 25, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regime, which protects privacy by giving users control over their personal data, will go into effect in the European Union.</p><p>More structural alternatives that directly challenge the big tech business model based on mining personal data and prioritizing virality over trustworthy content are in the works. Among others, the creator of the World Wide Web, <person><nameText>Tim Berners-Lee, </nameText></person>has joined a growing chorus of critics who believe that secure, distributed ledger technologies like blockchain can re-decentralize web connectivity by enabling people to take back control from the platform. \"The web is already decentralized,\" <person><nameText>Berners-Lee </nameText></person>says. \"The problem is the dominance of one search engine, one big social network, one Twitter for microblogging. We don't have a technology problem, we have a social problem.\"</p><p>The WorldPost this week examines responses to the techlash that will help shape the next phase of the digital revolution.</p><p>          Andrew Keen, author of \"How to Fix the Future,\" draws an analogy to the pioneering consumer activist <person><nameText>Ralph Nader's </nameText></person>\"Unsafe at Any Speed\" campaign to make cars safer by calling for a \"safety belt for the Internet.\" \"In the half-century since Nader's book, the car industry has, indeed, been held accountable for its products. But now there is a need for a new kind of safety belt. The contemporary equivalent of the out-of-control American auto industry of the past is today's equally out-of-control big tech industry,\" he writes.</p><p>Keen argues that the regulations spearheaded by the European Union - ranging from challenging Google's search engine monopoly to prohibiting hate speech or fake news on social media to the new rules on privacy - should be a model for the U.S.</p><p>\"Good regulation always stimulates innovation,\" Keen observes.\" The introduction of the GDPR in Europe is already triggering a new wave of digital start-ups that take advantage of this new law to provide consumers with services that protect their data privacy instead of exploiting it. The same explosion of entrepreneurial innovation will accompany effective antitrust regulation that enables start-ups to take on dominant powers.\"</p><p>But beyond regulation, he continues, the safety belts must be designed, and we must wear them. \"Just as with tobacco, fast food or gambling, it's our job as responsible adults with free will to make sure that we are buckled up for the digital journey. This requires self-discipline and personal accountability. It means that we each have to personally confront and master our digital demons. Most importantly, it means that we have to pass on self-regulatory wisdom to our kids and students. However, just as car seat belts were eventually developed in Detroit, our digital seat belts are going to need to be designed in Silicon Valley.\"</p><p>          Wallace Lynch takes on the design challenge. His aim is to use blockchain technology to create an alternative online business model that enables users to control and monetize their own data instead just hand it over to the big platforms. \"Our opinions, our thoughts and our behaviors are valuable. We need to recapture that value by recapturing our data,\" he writes. \"Everyone who spends time looking at ads and commercials should be compensated. Everyone who chooses to let other parties use personal data or digital content should be compensated.\"</p><p>To that end, he and his colleagues created the Alpha Browser. \"A decentralized platform such as this,\" he argues, \"guarantees a personalized,\u00a0secure data space\u00a0- whether a digital file or a physical storage space such as a hard drive on your computer - to which you and only you have access. By ensuring that your data is secure, this allows the content creator to reel in the financial value of that content - whether within one minute or one century from when it is created.\"</p><p>For Lynch, the stakes couldn't be higher. \"We have arrived at a crucial tipping point that will either liberate or further oppress our digital freedom. The solution is simple: to control our fate, we must control our data.\"</p><p>Control of our fate is not only a technical matter. It entails critically detaching from the social media to which many are becoming reliant. Karl Marx famously called religion \"the opiate of the masses.\" \"Homo Deus\" author Yuval Harari has declared \"dataism\" the new god to which we have become similarly dependent. \"If you have a problem in life, whether it is what to study, whom to marry or whom to vote for, you don't ask God above or your feelings inside, you ask Google or Facebook. If they have enough data on you, and enough computing power, they know what you feel already and why you feel that way. Based on that, they can allegedly make much better decisions on your behalf than you can on your own.\"</p><p>Writing from Nottingham, England, behavioral scientists Mark Griffiths and Daria Kuss discuss the detrimental effects of the digital opiate of social media. \"Most people's social media use is habitual enough that it spills over into other areas of their lives,\" they report. \"It results in behavior that is problematic and dangerous, such as checking social media while driving. While the majority of our behaviors around social media may be annoying rather than dangerous, they are nonetheless indicative of a societal problem. Steps need to be taken now, while the number of social media addicts is still small. We shouldn't wait to see if it becomes an epidemic.\"</p><p>To preemptively stem such an epidemic, they call for a range of responses: prohibiting the use of smartphones, as is already done in some places, while driving or in other instances where bodily harm can result; limiting if not prohibiting smartphone use in work places or schools where the focus should be on \"required tasks and activities;\" and educational curriculums that teach digital literacy and awareness of the consequences of excessive social media use.</p><p>\"More controversially,\" they argue, \"social media operators like Facebook could start using their behavioral data to identify excessive users and provide strategies to limit time spent on their products. This is already being used in the\u00a0online gambling industry. Why can't we apply it to social networking sites as well?\"</p><p>Just as with political revolutions, technological revolutions tend to unfold in phases. First comes the liberating breakthrough from the old order burnished with utopian ideals. Next comes the reaction to abuses that inevitably arise from embarking on a new path for which there are no rules, especially for the first movers who become the new masters. Finally, a new governing order is established that sorts out and tempers the mistakes and excesses from the benefits of transformational change.

Yet the tidal wave did not quite break.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The movement has long been predicted: indeed techlash was awarded digital word of the year by the American Dialect Society last January. It also made the shortlist of last year's Oxford English Dictionary words of the year. The word, the OED said, started hyphenated, but was soon blended, \"later settling into its one-word state\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Industry fears of a techlash were all the rage in late 2018 and well into 2019. From the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica scandal to shareholder revolts against Facebook, the phenomenon was perhaps most visible in the repeated grilling of technology chief executives before the US Congress and MPs in Parliament.</p><p>But the techlash faltered before it could truly take hold. </p><p>Facebook was slammed with fines, but they hardly made a dent on its income. The tech giant received a slap on the wrist from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office of \u00a3500,000, the maximum it could receive, for failures related to Cambridge Analytica. When it was slammed with a $5bn fine from the Federal Trade Commission, it barely blinked and its share price went up. In March, Google was hit with its third billion dollar-plus fine by the European Commission. </p><p>Yet collectively, Big Tech has continued to soar this year. Facebook shares are up more than 50pc, Google nearly 30pc. Facebook has continued to pile on new users; it now has 2.5 billion in total. The social networking giant is expected to post revenues of $70bn this year, up from around $56bn in 2018. Hardly signs of a crippling slowdown.</p><p>Following Facebook's fine and an order from the FTC last summer, former Facebook head of security Alex Stamos said: \"This is a natural consequence of the shallow nature of the 'techlash'.\" The real problem, he said, was a lack of meaningful competition against Facebook and a failure of US privacy laws. </p><p>While politicians have railed against technology firms, it can be argued that their grip over users' digital lives has only grown stronger.</p><p>On average, Brits spend three hours and 15 minutes each day online. Despite concerns about \"fake news\", more people are getting their news from social networks. Across the pond, 52pc of US adults get their news from Facebook, according to research from Pew. In the advertising sector, some data suggests that technology giants have actually consolidated their power since new data regulations such as GDPR came into effect. The smallest advertising technology companies lost market share after it was introduced, but Google only grew.</p><p>Thomas Philippon, a professor at NYU Stern and author of The Great Reversal, a book on competition, says: \"In the US, we have seen a steady decline in enforcement in antitrust and regulations. Now there is a shift towards finally acknowledging there is a problem in digital markets.\"</p><p>He adds: \"Everyone understands there is a problem, but maybe some are paying just lip service.\"</p><p>Europe has certainly been ahead of the curve in cracking down on technology giants. While some people accuse Brussels of unfairly targeting US firms, many of its reforms are being copied in the US at a state level.</p><p>\"The one regulator that has taken a more active stance is the EU competition commission,\" says Florian Ederer, a professor at Yale. \"But more radical people argue that its billion dollar fines are just a slap on the wrist.\"</p><p>Philippon reckons there has been a change in attitude in the past year, particularly in the US, where heavy regulatory changes could be on the way. Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren has demanded rules to break up Apple, Google and Facebook, if she is elected President next year. </p><p>Furthermore, investigations into the activities of Google, Facebook and Amazon are under way. The FTC is now thought to be considering an injunction against Facebook to stop its efforts to merge its Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram services - a move that critics claim is an attempt by the technology giant to stop it being broken up.</p><p>Even the Republicans have turned their ire on Facebook and Google, accusing them of suppressing free speech by demonstrating bias against conservative voices.</p><p>\"It's quite an achievement by Facebook that they are one of the only things policymakers in Washington agree on,\" says Philippon. \"They are the only people in the US who can encourage a bipartisan agreement.\"</p><p>If 2019 was a year of sound and fury from politicians about the power of the tech giants, could 2020 actually bring reforms that curb the power of GAFA [Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon]?</p><p>The UK may be heading that way: the Competition and Markets Authority recently launched a consultation on proposals that could break up part of Google. In Whitehall, there are discussions surrounding a new Digital Markets Unit to be a technology regulator.</p><p>Theresa May's Government floated plans for a regulator that could perform a duty of care and tackle malicious content, while Boris Johnson's manifesto in the recent election proclaimed a desire to make the UK the safest place to be online.</p><p>Germany has taken matters further. The Bundestag is currently preparing its digital competition laws - the Digitalisierungsgesetz - which would make control over data a key factor in determining if a company is behaving anti-competitively.</p><p>According to law firm Hogan Lovells, there are as many as 450 pieces of legislation or rules proposed in 2019 that could fall on Big Tech in 2020.</p><p>But as the decade draws to a close, there are perhaps even more pressing challenges - and more radical solutions - that could emerge. </p><p>Calls to break up Big Tech will most likely be a key battleground of the 2020 US election. \"What is weird about this market is it is critical to everyday life and national infrastructure, but it is all funded on an advertising model,\" says Professor Diane Coyle of the University of Cambridge. \"That's not sustainable.\" Even fiercer regulation, such as classing services such as Facebook as utilities, could emerge, she suggests.</p><p>Meanwhile, technology companies are not standing still. Artificial intelligence, autonomous machines, facial recognition and surveillance are playing an increasing role in their power and influence. Regulating these growing technologies and practices may require something far more seismic than this decade's so-called techlash.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-59015591</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVP-3WN1-F021-607V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1077\"/><timeReceived>4:32 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 29, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Amy Klobuchar\u00a0(D-Minn.) is again taking aim at Big Tech -- this time with an audacious idea to tax big technology companies when they share users' data. But critics are skeptical that such a proposal would be feasible.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As privacy scandals mount at firms such as Facebook, Klobuchar is positioning her data\u00a0tax as a way to make technology companies think twice about how they share and profit from\u00a0users' data. Klobuchar floated the idea at\u00a0the South by Southwest festival and a privacy hearing this week\u00a0on Capitol Hill, suggesting that revenue from sucha\u00a0 levy\u00a0could be used to pay for cybersecurity protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             But implementing such an idea might be difficult, experts noted. Taxing data means you have to know what such information is worth, for instance.\u00a0Former Facebook employee Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez says data is often compared to oil, but that's a poor analogy because unlike oil that\u00a0has a clear price, the ultimate value of data is unknown.\u00a0Outside of using data to allow targeted advertising, it's difficult to measure such information's value because that can change dramatically depending on the\u00a0context.</p><p>             \"I think taxing data is a little bit unrealistic and silly,\" Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez said. \"But I can see how people feel like they're being stolen from because I give you all this data and I get nothing in return but a slightly better service.\"</p><p>             Klobuchar's proposal is just the latest sign that Democrats are tapping into that sentiment and trying to elevate regulating the technology industry as a 2020 issue. Her plan and Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) proposal to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook indicate some candidates are eager to put a stake in the ground on privacy issues.          </p><p>             But at these early stages, it's difficult to tell whether these would be actionable plans if either Klobuchar or Warren were to win the White House.          </p><p>In an interview at South by Southwest, Klobuchar acknowledged\u00a0there are many details that need to be worked out regarding\u00a0her plan, and she\u00a0wants input from\u00a0technologists.</p><p>Since they began selling ads, the largest technology companies have operated on the tacit understanding that you get free access to service in exchange for your data -- ranging from the photos you upload to Facebook to the locations you search for on Google. But following incidents such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which showed Facebook data could be leaked to a political consultancy without people's knowledge, that arrangement is under renewed scrutiny.</p><p>             Klobuchar told me\u00a0there's a huge amount of economic value in the data companies collect, and consumers don't know whether they're getting a fair deal.          </p><p>             \"Who says if that's a fair exchange?\" she said. \"Do you think consumers can determine if that's a fair exchange? I don't know if they can.\"          </p><p>To assess value, Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez said policymakers could perhaps look at metric\u00a0tracked by companeis\u00a0related to advertising. For example, my colleague Geoffrey Fowler reported that Facebook gathered $82 in advertising for each member in North America in 2017. But such a figure doesn't break down what information is worth on an individual basis, or its value to the company for other uses, such as developing artificial intelligence.</p><p>             Klobuchar is elevating an issue that has been percolating in the California's governor mansion and halls of Capitol Hill. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0(D) last month proposed a \"data dividend\"\u00a0requiring the large technology companies to pay consumers for their data.</p><p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) is planning to introduce a bill in the coming weeks to require large companies to regularly tell users the value of their data and to report the total\u00a0value of their data holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It's an issue that has been on Warner's radar for months, and he even pressed Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg on the idea in a hearing last year.</p><p>Klobuchar wasn't familiar with the details of Warner's plans, but she said her proposal is \"along the same lines\" as the one offered by Newsom. But while Newsom is proposing a dividend that would go back to people, Klobuchar's wants the government\u00a0 to receive the proceeds of a data tax that then would be used for cybersecurity and also to reduce\u00a0the debt.</p><p>             Klobuchar says such a tax wouldn't just deter companies from excessively using or transferring people's data. It would also force them to better track when they are using people's information.          </p><p>But experts are skeptical that a tax is the right way to accomplish that.</p><p>Dante Disparte, the chief executive of Risk Cooperative, says the United States needs to respond to such\u00a0concerns with privacy\u00a0legislation, similar to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\u00a0overhaul, for data and tech companies.</p><p>\"It's the wrong posture,\" Disparte said. \"We need a more anticipatory framework that doesn't just scare companies away and react.\"</p><p>On Twitter, Georgetown Law staff attorney and teaching fellow Lindsey Barrett said such a plan would just make it more expensive for companies to mishandle people's data, at a time when lawmakers need to outright ban bad corporate behavior:</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>          Social media companies are scrambling to remove videos of a terrorist attack in New Zealand that killed 49, after the gunman reportedly broadcast 17 minutes of the attack, according to the Associated Press.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook said Friday that it took down the footage after being alerted by police. Twitter and YouTube owner Google said it was also removing footage.\u00a0       </p><p>          But the video's proliferation across the services and Reddit raised new questions about the companies' ability to police violent content on their services. From my colleague Drew Harwell:\u00a0       </p><p>As Ryan Mac of Buzzfeed News noted, the video's spread highlighted some of the problems with the companies' current algorithms and content moderation practices:\u00a0</p><p>Even this morning,\u00a0Drew could still find the video on YouTube:</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0Facebook's top product executive, Chris Cox, is leaving the company - marking the highest-level departure at the tech giant as it shifts its strategy toward privacy and messaging, my colleague Elizabeth Dwoskin reports.\u00a0</p><p>Cox, who worked at the company for 13 years, was promoted in a reorganization last year, in charge of the company's \"family of apps.\" The apps he oversaw - Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Facebook - have been distinct services, but this month Mark Zuckerberg announced the company plans to unify them.\u00a0</p><p>\"It is with great sadness I share with you that after thirteen years, I've decided to leave the company,\" Cox wrote in his post. \"Since I was twenty-three, I've poured myself into these walls. This place will forever be a part of me.\" Cox didn't offer any explanation for his departure.</p><p>BuzzFeed's Ryan Mac is reporting that Cox's departure is related to a disagreement over the company's new direction, according to a source familiar with this situation. Chris Daniels, who was recently elevated to head of WhatsApp, is also leaving the company, Facebook said.\u00a0</p><p>The departures were announced amid a tumultuous 24 hours for the company, in which my colleague Tony Romm noted the company also experienced an almost unprecedented global outage as well as a possible criminal probe.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: YouTube has promised for years to police inappropriate content, but researchers, parents and consumers say it's still delivering \"violent imagery, drug references, sexually suggestive sequences and foul, racially charged language\" to children at a high clip,according to my colleague Craig Timberg.\u00a0</p><p>The company's recommendation algorithm doesn't reliably segment content by appropriate age level, and the sheer volume of YouTube content makes it difficult for parents to monitor what their children watch. Advocates for children's privacy say the service's rise represents a significant shift from the highly regulated world of broadcast television.\u00a0</p><p>\"YouTube is the biggest pain point for parents today,\" said James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a San Francisco-based nonprofit group that advocates for families and schools worldwide. \"Kids just stumble into completely inappropriate content constantly because it's algorithmically driven.\"</p><p>             - Technology news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - Technology news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-5852787b48bf4641b7a081712bc234fc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN2-VRM1-DXKP-J3HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1455\"/><timeReceived>12:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A bipartisan pair of senators want the companies to tell you - and regulators.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) will propose\u00a0legislation today\u00a0forcing\u00a0the social media companies to tell users how they are monetizing their data. Their bipartisan bill would also require the companies to regularly disclose the ways consumers' data is being used, as well as file an annual report on the total value of all the data they've collected.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The senators think their proposal will help consumers make more informed choices when they sign up for \"free\" services online\u00a0that make money through ad targeting and other data collection services rather than payments from consumers.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"For years, social media companies have told consumers that their products are free to the user. But that's not true - you are paying with your data instead of your wallet,\" Warner said in a statement Sunday night. \"But the overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they're giving up, who else their data is being shared with, or what it's worth to the platform.\"</p><p>             The senators also say their proposal could help Washington regulators who are increasingly eying the impact Big Tech has on competition. They say the lack of transparency around the companies' data collection practices and the data's value has been an impediment to the Federal Trade Commission as it seeks to crack down on Silicon Valley - and their legislation would help pull back the curtain.\u00a0          </p><p>The pair said putting a price on\u00a0data could make it easier for antitrust enforcers to identify unfair transactions or anticompetitive practices, especially in categories like social media where services are free and regulators can't rely on prices of the service as a means to measure whether the companies' practices are harming consumers.\u00a0The senators are unveiling their\u00a0legislation as antitrust activity is snowballing in Washington, with House lawmakers opening a wide-ranging probe into the tech industry's power and federal agencies considering probes into tech giants including Google. \u00a0</p><p>\"It's also about trying to grapple with the enormous power these companies have,\" Warner said in an interview on Axios on HBO, where their effort was first reported. \"I don't think there was a time in history when companies grew so quickly, had as much pervasive power, and really have as much ability to kind of influence everything about how we do, and how we vote, and how we think than these companies do.\"</p><p>The legislation is likely to face pushback from the tech industry - especially because it could be difficult to come up with a consistent way to calculate data's value when companies might use the same data for many different parts of their business. The bill - officially called the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data or DASHBOARD Act --\u00a0calls on the Securities and Exchange Commission to develop methodologies for calculating data's value, and it encourages the agency to be flexible based on sectors or differing business models. It only applies to companies with more than 100 million monthly active users.\u00a0</p><p>Warner said in the Axios HBO interview that companies clearly have a \"pretty darn good notion\" of how much data is worth based on their ability to strategically make acquisitions. He pointed to Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. \u00a0</p><p>Warner and Hawley are two of the senators most active on tech issues in Washington, and the duo previously teamed up on Hawley's \"Do Not Track\" legislation, which would allow people to opt out of data tracking online, much like they opt out of calls from marketers with the \"Do Not Call\" list.\u00a0</p><p>Amid a broader debate about privacy in Washington,\u00a0there are questions about how much impact the DASHBOARD Act would have.\u00a0As Lindsey Barrett, a staff attorney at Georgetown Law's Institute for Public Representation Communications &amp; Technology Clinic notes, greater transparency might not change tech companies' practices:\u00a0</p><p>David Carroll, an associate\u00a0professor of media design at The New School, noted it could help consumers seek damages against companies:</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Counterfeit books have exploded on Amazon, as the company takes a \"hands-off\" approach to policing the quality and authenticity of the books sold on its platform,David Streitfeld reports in the New York Times.\u00a0Publishers say Amazon's dominant position in the book market --\u00a0where it sells more than half of books in the United States and acts as a platform for third-party sellers -- is to blame. The company often only takes action against counterfeits after someone complains.\u00a0</p><p>\"Being a tech monopoly means you don't have to care about quality,\" said Bill Pollock, a San Francisco publisher who has dealt with fake versions of his firm's computer books on Amazon, told the New York Times.</p><p>The company's activity in the book market offers a window into what happens when a tech behemoth dominates an industry -- which could offer lessons for lawmakers and regulators who are increasingly eager to scrutinize Silicon Valley's power.\u00a0</p><p>An Amazon spokeswoman pushed back on the Times characterization of the counterfeitting problem, telling Streitfeld, \"This report cites a handful of complaints, but even a handful is too many and we will keep working until it's zero.\" The company said it adopted a strict ban on counterfeit products and last year blocked accounts to more than one million suspected bad actors.\u00a0Amazon CEO and owner Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post.       </p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0U.S. trade officials have banned shipments to four Chinese technology companies and one research institute specializing in supercomputing,\u00a0my colleagues Craig Timberg and Ellen Nakashima report.                     The move could harm U.S. chip manufacturers that deal with China, including Intel and Nvidia, and possibly force Chinese companies to excise U.S. chipmakers from their supply chains.       </p><p>          The ban, which cites national security concerns, is another blow as the United States increasingly takes actions aimed at China's rapidly evolving tech sector. \"The timing here is important because China is really just on the cusp of moving away from U.S. dependence to a certain degree of independence in high-performance computers,\" Bob Sorensen, vice president of research and technology at Minneapolis-based Hyperion Research, told Ellen and Craig.       </p><p>          While China and the U.S. have been longtime rivals over supercomputing given the technology's potential to enhance warfare, China has traditionally lagged behind in chip production. The new ban could slow down supercomputing research by the targeted entities, at least temporarily.       </p><p>             BYTES: Hacked                          U.S. Customs and Border Protection                       documents provide \"an unusually intimate glimpse\" of the government's immigration monitoring apparatus,\u00a0my colleague Drew Harwell reports.</p><p>CBP officials have understated the scope of the material taken in the hack - saying that fewer than 100,000 photos of travelers were affected by a May breach. The agency said that none of those photos were available on the \"dark Web.\"</p><p>Instead, Drew found a trove of sensitive information, including schematics and \"extensive detail\" on technology installed at various points of entry as well as at U.S. military bases. Hacked documents showed plans for expanding government \"use of license plate readers and facial-recognition cameras, including such details as how many cameras are focused on which traffic lanes at some of the busiest border crossings in the world.\"</p><p>The hacked documents included plans from Perceptics, the contractor that probably was breached, for a new facial recognition software that could identify obstructed faces at the border.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Lawmakers and advocates are using the breach to warn about the dangers of unregulated government surveillance using emerging technologies.</p><p>\"This kind of breach highlights the dangers of mass collection of sensitive data,\" Rachel Levinson-Waldman, senior counsel at the think tank Brennan Center for Justice, told Drew. \"Large-scale collection of personal information is not costless. Congress must exercise vigorous oversight and demand that agencies limit the sensitive information they collect and safeguard the data in their possession.\"</p><p>             - News from the public\u00a0sector:          </p><p>             -- Trump's trade war is unleashing economic uncertainty on Amazon's army of small merchandisers who make a living selling cheap Chinese goods on the platform,\u00a0Bloomberg News's Shelly Banjo and Spencer Soper report. Sellers looking\u00a0ahead to the holiday season have to decide whether they need to relocate production, reduce stock or hike prices. Any of these options could come with their own trade-offs - and have an upstream impact on Amazon's bottom line.       </p><p>Amazon is paying increased fees to some wholesale vendors affected by the tariffs. Amazon told Bloomberg it was \"working closely with vendors to make this adjustment as smooth as possible.\"       </p><p>             - More news from the private sector:          </p><p>             -- Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, unveiled his latest project.

They are more vulnerable to bias in algorithms used to determine employment and housing decisions -- or even those used to calculate prices of goods sold online, she will warn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to testimony obtained by The Post,\u00a0Collins-Dexter will tell the\u00a0House subcommittee on consumer protection and commerce\u00a0that any future privacy framework must give all people the right to know the basis for any automated decisions made about them.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"Whether intentional or unintentional, the tracking of users across the Web and what happens to that data disproportionately impacts communities of color,\" Collins-Dexter will say, according to prepared remarks Color Of Change shared with The Washington Post.</p><p>             Color Of Change's testimony on the Hill puts a fine point on how civil rights groups are increasingly emerging as challengers of Big Tech.\u00a0Collins-Dexter objects to the fact that previous privacy hearings have been dominated by industry voices: She wants to use her time on the witness stand today to convince lawmakers that ensuring protection for\u00a0minorities\u00a0online is central to any fair Internet.\u00a0</p><p>As a Senate privacy hearing scheduled for Wednesday has been criticized for\u00a0not including consumer advocates or civil rights groups, Collins-Dexter notes:\u00a0\"The frame of privacy has been owned by tech wonks,\" she told me in an interview. \"Really, it's not discussed as the right to feel safe or the right to not be preyed on or the right to not have civil rights violated online.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Today, Collins-Dexter plans to tell lawmakers just how high the stakes are for communities of color.\u00a0She will argue that\u00a0companies can use certain data such as location information as proxies for race to discriminate in advertising or hiring decisions.\u00a0</p><p>\"Right now corporations are able to easily combine information about you that they've purchased, and create a profile of your vulnerabilities,\" she will say.\u00a0\"Algorithms, which increasingly drive consumer and employee access, work as a kind of black box that can drive exclusionary practices.\"</p><p>She'll also make the case that people of color are more exposed to certain privacy abuses because of the unique ways they use certain social media services and smartphones. Communities of color use services like Twitter or Facebook's Instagram at higher rates than white Americans, she'll testify.\u00a0She will also say that \"Black and Brown people regardless of economic status rely more on their smartphones than others as their primary device to use the Internet.\"</p><p>That could leave these groups vulnerable\u00a0to a host of privacy abuses at the hands of the tech giants, who can obtain detailed information about their location, contacts and communications through these devices.\u00a0</p><p>\"This leaves Black and Brown communities grappling with how to engage with platforms not built for, operated by or meant for us,\" she will say in her testimony.</p><p>             Color Of Change wants to see policymakers address these and other privacy-related issues through a comprehensive federal privacy framework that doesn't replace any privacy provisions states pass.\u00a0Here's what the organization wants to see in a federal privacy framework:</p><p>             Lawmakers will have plenty of recommendations to consider from the many different proposals being floated by the tech and telecom industries, privacy advocates and academics.\u00a0</p><p>Color of Change wants to give more enforcement powers to Washington regulators than do some of the industry groups floating proposals around town.\u00a0The focus on regulating how companies build data profiles about consumers could\u00a0also go further to address bias in algorithms than many of the other proposals.\u00a0</p><p>Yet representatives from business trade groups, such as the Interactive Advertising Bureau and Business Roundtable, as well as the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute and the nonprofit Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, are also scheduled to testify at today's hearing.</p><p>\"We are beginning that conversation with the intention of developing legislation with the understanding that this self-regulation just isn't working,\" said subcommittee Chair Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) in a video about the hearing. \"We look forward to having the hearing, and I promise you that I will get the job done.\"</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0The Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal judge to hold Tesla chief executive Elon\u00a0Musk in contempt for breaking the terms of a recent settlement agreement cracking down on his Twitter use,\u00a0The Washington Post's Renae Merle and Drew Harwell reported.\u00a0 The deal Musk reached with the agency late last year requires tweets about Tesla that could move the market to be reviewed before being published. But after\u00a0the SEC inquired about Tweets sent\u00a0on Feb. 19, Tesla told the agency that Musk sent one\u00a0tweet that had not been preapproved.\u00a0</p><p>\"Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\" Musk\u00a0tweeted. Tesla lawyers saw the tweet after it was sent, and they asked Musk to issue a corrective version, the SEC said in its motion. Four hours later, he published another\u00a0tweet\u00a0to amend the first one: \"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.\"</p><p>             The SEC didn't ask for a specific punishment for Musk, who\u00a0tweeted a meme with three words after the news of the SEC's motion.          </p><p>             NIBBLES: Contractors working as content moderators for Facebook experience isolation and anxiety in jobs that expose them to graphic content such as murder as well as hate speech, the Verge's Casey Newton reported. The contractors are also paid much less than Facebook employees: Employees of Cognizant in Phoenix who work as content moderators for Facebook earn\u00a0$28,800 per year. By contrast, median Facebook employees make\u00a0$240,000 per year in salary, bonuses and stock options.</p><p>             \"It is an environment where workers cope by telling dark jokes about committing suicide, then smoke weed during breaks to numb their emotions,\" Newton wrote.\u00a0\"It's a place where employees can be fired for making just a few errors a week - and where those who remain live in fear of the former colleagues who return seeking vengeance.\" Content moderators also say they can end up adopting\u00a0fringe views after being exposed so often to conspiracies as part of their work.</p><p>Bob Duncan,\u00a0vice president of operations for business process services at Cognizant, said the company warns applicants that the job includes graphic content.\u00a0\"We share examples of the kinds of things you can see ... so that they have an understanding,\" Duncan told the Verge. \"The intention of all that is to ensure people understand it.\" Facebook also published a post that provides further explanation about the company's relationship with content reviewers.</p><p>The story prompted many reactions and comments on Twitter. From Newton:</p><p>From\u00a0Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez,\u00a0 a former Facebook employee and author, and Motherboard's\u00a0Joseph Cox:</p><p>From Alex Stamos, former chief security officer for Facebook who now teaches at\u00a0Stanford University:</p><p>             BYTES: Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella defended the company's decision to sell it augmented reality headset to the military following employee criticism,\u00a0according to CNN's Charles Riley and Samuel Burke.\u00a0He said at Mobile World Congress that he would engage with employees on such issues, but he will not \"withhold\" technology from democratic governments.\u00a0</p><p> \"We made a principled decision that we're not going to withhold technology from institutions that we have elected in democracies to protect the freedoms we enjoy,\" he told CNN Business at the conference.\u00a0\"We were very transparent about that decision and we'll continue to have that dialogue [with employees],\" he added during the interview.</p><p>(My colleagues Tony Romm and Drew Harwell\u00a0wrote about employee calls to cancel the contract on the grounds that it could turn warfare into a \"video game\" here.)</p><p>             -- Lime said it found a \"bug\" that can cause \"sudden excessive braking\" while the company's electric scooters are in use, The Washington Post's Peter Holley reported.\u00a0\"While this issue has affected less than 0.0045% of all Lime rides, some riders have been injured, and, although most have been bumps and bruises, any injury is one too many,\" Lime said in a statement.\u00a0\"Like all forms of transportation, there is risk that we work to mitigate but cannot entirely eliminate.\"</p><p>Lime\u00a0said it has started issuing remote fixes for the problem, which reduced the number of incidents. The company also said that the abrupt braking issue usually occurs when scooters are going downhill at top speed.\u00a0</p><p>             -\u00a0Philippine journalist Maria Ressa, who was arrested this month and\u00a0awaits arraignment, said Facebook bears some responsibility for her ordeal, The Post's Dana Priest reported. Experts says her arrest came in retaliation for identifying\u00a0fake Facebook accounts controlled by supporters of\u00a0President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016.\u00a0\"Ressa had intended to write a story about Facebook taking down the accounts,\" Dana wrote. \"But when Facebook did not act, her publication, Rappler, readied a three-part series. An avalanche of threats and lawsuits followed its publication, culminating in Ressa's arrest and overnight detention in a cyber-libel case against her.\"</p><p>             - More technology news from the private sector:          </p><p>             -- A group of 14 Democratic House members demanded that Google and Apple stop hosting a Saudi government app that can allow men to track women's movements in Saudi Arabia, Business Insider's\u00a0Bill Bostock reported. In a letter to Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, the lawmakers said they wanted to\u00a0\"express our alarm\" about the fact that the app, called Absher,\u00a0makes it possible to restrict the movements of Saudi women\u00a0and migrant workers. Democratic lawmakers who signed the letter include Reps.\u00a0Rashida Tlaib (Mich.),\u00a0Ilhan Omar (Minn.),\u00a0Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) and David N. Cicilline (R.I.).</p><p>             \"Keeping this application in your stores allows your companies and your American employees to be accomplices in the oppression of Saudi Arabian women and migrant workers,\"\u00a0the lawmakers said in the letter, according to Business Insider.\u00a0</p><p>             - The odds that Musk's project to build a high-speed tunnel in Chicago will become reality are dimming, the Verge's\u00a0Ryan Smith reported. Musk's\u00a0Boring Company last year planned to build a tunnel between Chicago\u00a0O'Hare International Airport and downtown Chicago that would allow\u00a0high-speed mass transit.\u00a0But no contract for the\u00a0O'Hare Express project\u00a0has been signed yet.\u00a0\"Even if a deal is inked soon, it must cross the desk of a city council recently rocked by a federal corruption scandal, and that appears in no mood to greenlight big projects,\" according to the Verge.          </p><p>             - A group of 11 senators from both parties want the federal government to prevent Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from selling solar energy generators in the United States, Reuters reported. \"Both large-scale photovoltaic systems and those used by homeowners, school districts, and businesses are equally vulnerable to cyberattacks. Our federal government should consider a ban on the use of Huawei inverters in the United States,\" the senators said in the letter, according to Reuters.</p><p>             - More technology news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Amazon named Indra Nooyi, Pepsi's former chief executive, to its board,\u00a0Bloomberg News's Matt Day reported.

They'll remove anything that could be a potential red flag.\"</p><p>             Silicon Valley's stumbles in content moderation -- most recently during the New Zealand\u00a0shooting -- have set the stage for a broader regulatory crackdown on social media companies. Pinterest has largely managed\u00a0to escape policymakers' spotlight -- but it's not immune from the actions they're considering amid a wave of \"techlash.\"          </p><p>             Th             e image-sharing website's expected debut this week\u00a0will be a test for a host of tech companies\u00a0planning initial public offerings this year, and its regulatory filing reveals the risks it faces from a variety of policy changes here and abroad.\u00a0          </p><p>Pinterest warned investors that any changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that gives companies broad immunity from content\u00a0third parties post on its platform, was a risk to its business. U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are talking about changing the law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the provision is \"in jeopardy\" in a recent interview.</p><p>And internationally, as the Europe Union considers regulation that would require companies to remove terrorist content swiftly, Pinterest warned it may have to build custom tools to flag such content. The European Parliament approved a draft version of the legislation on Wednesday evening, the BBC reports, which would require companies to remove offending content within an hour.\u00a0</p><p>\"Any new legislation may be difficult to comply with in a timely and comprehensive fashion and may substantially increase our costs,\" Pinterest wrote.</p><p>Pinterest warned regulations could disadvantage it relative to larger competitors with greater resources to comply with new regulations.</p><p>\"Regulation on any big dominant player will make challengers' lives more difficult,\" said Rett Wallace, co-founder of Triton Research.</p><p>Pinterest hasn't totally escaped the content issues its industry peers have grappled with in recent years. In the lead-up to the 2016 election, people unwittingly \"pinned\" posts disseminated on other social networks\u00a0by Russian operatives to their boards. The website - popular with mothers - also has been a target of people spreading false information about\u00a0vaccines. In February, it took one of the most aggressive actions to curb the spread of misinformation of any technology company when it stopped returning results for searches related to vaccinations, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>But Pinterest could also benefit from the turmoil at its competitors in recent years. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter were surprised by the challenges they have had that hurt users' trust, said Rebecca Kaden, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures. These companies have raced to respond to the rampant spread of disinformation and privacy scandals, among other issues. Pinterest, a smaller and younger company, still has the trust of its users and the benefit of hindsight, she said.</p><p>\"Pinterest can learn from that,\" Kaden told me.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Facebook collected the email contacts of more than 1.5 million new Facebook users since May 2016 without their consent, according to Business Insider's Rob Price. The company said the data was \"unintentionally uploaded to Facebook\" and it's in the process of deleting the contacts.          </p><p>\"The revelation comes after pseudononymous security researcher e-sushi noticed that Facebook was asking some users to enter their email passwords when they signed up for new accounts to verify their identities, a move widely condemned by security experts,\" Price writes. \"Business Insider then discovered that if you entered your email password, a message popped up saying it was 'importing' your contacts without asking for permission first.\"</p><p>             The email contacts were used to improve the social network's ad targeting, build its web of social connections and suggest friends to add.          </p><p>Facebook did not access the content of users' emails, according to a spokesperson.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Microsoft turned down a sale of its facial recognition software to a California law enforcement agency due to human rights concerns,Joseph Menn reports for Reuters. The agency wanted to install the technology in officers' cars and body cameras.\u00a0</p><p>Microsoft declined the deal due to concerns that innocent minorities and women would be disproportionately held for questioning because its systems were largely trained on mostly white, male image sets.\u00a0</p><p> \"Anytime they pulled anyone over, they wanted to run a face scan\" against a database of suspects, Microsoft President Brad Smith said at a conference without naming the agency. After thinking through the uneven impact, \"we said this technology is not your answer.\"</p><p>Microsoft also declined to install its technology in cameras deployed across a capital city of an unnamed country that nonprofit Freedom House deemed not free. Smith said the technology could impact peoples' right to assemble. However, the company did provide the technology to an American prison.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey have had their share of public scrutiny. But YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki has largely escaped the spotlight -- even as her platform is flooded with harmful content, Daisuke Wakabayashi reports for the New York Times.          </p><p>\"Remarkably, for a person who oversees a website with more daily visitors than Facebook, Ms. Wojcicki has managed to keep a low profile and avoid much of the blame,\" Wakabayashi writes.</p><p>Wakabayashi set out to find more about her, and writes his discoveries are both \"reassuring and alarming.\"</p><p>\"At the top of the world's largest and most volatile video platform is a calm, levelheaded person,\" Wakabayashi wrote. \"But her deliberate style may be at odds with the pace and scale of horrors and just plain stupidity that relentlessly arises on YouTube.\"</p><p>YouTube, like other platforms, is under greater pressure to police harmful content on its platform. But Wakabayashi notes that YouTube still has a \"Broadcast Yourself\" culture that is at odds with meeting those demands.

Fowler has a fascinating column out this morning\u00a0that breaks down all the ways these smart speakers have been eavesdropping on you - allowing the tech giant to track you, as he so frankly puts it, \"in more ways than you might want.\"\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Many smart speaker owners don't realize it, but Amazon keeps a copy of everything Alexa records after it hears its name. Apple's Siri, and until recently Google's Assistant, by default also keep recordings to help train their artificial intelligences,\" he writes. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos also owns The Post.)\u00a0</p><p>And Amazon is not alone. \"Bugging our homes is Silicon Valley's next frontier,\" he writes. \"For as much as we fret about snooping apps on our computers and phones, our homes are where the rubber really hits the road for privacy. It's easy to rationalize away privacy concerns by thinking a single smart speaker or appliance couldn't know enough to matter. But across the connected home, there's a brazen data grab going on and there are few regulations, watchdogs or even common-sense practices to keep it in check.\"</p><p>The warp-speed expansion of the\u00a0Internet of Things - tech researchers estimate there will be about 20 billion connected things by 2020 - presents a tricky problem for lawmakers when it comes to protecting consumers' security and privacy. There is no national standard for security on\u00a0IoT devices, leaving it up to each company to determine how best to do so. Congress\u00a0introduced a bill this year\u00a0that would set\u00a0a minimum security standard for connected devices the government uses, but it does not take the broader view on protecting average citizens.\u00a0</p><p>The states have gone further on addressing both Internet of Things security and privacy issues posed by smart speakers specifically. California became the first state of pass an IoT security bill last year requiring companies to provide \"reasonable\" security features to ward off hackers, and there's\u00a0a bill working its way through the legislature that would ban smart home speakers\u00a0from keeping or storing recordings without explicit consent. \"The Anti-Eavesdropping Act, which cleared its first committee [last Wednesday],\u00a0would also ban smart speaker device manufacturers from sharing with third parties recordings of verbal commands or requests heard by the devices,\" per the Mercury News. \"Under the bill, Amazon, Google, Apple and other makers of smart speakers may store recordings only when consumers give their permission in writing.\" Fowler notes the Illinois Senate recently passed a bill on the same issue.\u00a0</p><p>As California has been a leader on security and privacy issues, it's conceivable that Congress start paying more attention to smart speakers as\u00a0lawmakers look for ways\u00a0to crack down on Big Tech.\u00a0\"They are giving us false choices. We can have these devices and enjoy their functionality and how they enhance our lives, without compromising our privacy,\"\u00a0California bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham (R) told Geoff. \"Welcome to the age of surveillance capitalism.\"</p><p>This problem gets only more complicated when consumers\u00a0might not even understand the full extent of the technology they're letting into their homes. These devices can record even when they say the \"wake word.\" \"Alexa keeps a record of what it hears every time an Echo speaker activates. It's supposed to only record with a \"wake word\" - \"Alexa!\" - but anyone with one of these devices knows they go rogue,\" Geoff writes. He reviewed his own history of what Alexa has archived on him in the last four years (and you can, too).\u00a0\"I counted dozens of times when mine recorded without a legitimate prompt. (Amazon says it has improved the accuracy of 'Alexa' as a wake word by 50 percent over the last year.)\"\u00a0</p><p>As Geoff notes: \"Any time personal data sticks around, it's at risk. Remember the family that had Alexa accidentally send a recording of a conversation to a random contact? We've also seen judges issuewarrants for Alexa recordings.\u00a0Alexa's voice archive made headlines most recently when Bloomberg discovered Amazon employees personally listen to recordings to train its AI. Amazon acknowledged some of those employees also have access to location information for the devices that made the recordings.\"</p><p>To be sure, it's not just Amazon. Even Apple, which prides itself on its tough stance on privacy, keeps copies of conversations with Siri. \"Apple says voice data is assigned a 'random identifier and is not linked to individuals' - but exactly how anonymous can a recording of your voice be?\" Geoff writes. \"I don't understand why Apple doesn't give us the ability to say don't store our recordings.\"\u00a0</p><p>             His full column is worth a read here:          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0Facebook\u00a0told the U.S. government it is \"willing to submit to greater oversight of its data-collection practices - from the launching of new services to the decisions of its top executives - to end a wide-ranging federal probe into a series of privacy abuses that came to light last year,\" my colleague Tony Romm reported. The changes, per Tony,\u00a0would come with a multibillion dollar fine the Federal Trade Commission has considered slapping on Facebook. Tony's\u00a0reporting yielded a\u00a0sketch of such a settlement, which would include:\u00a0</p><p>However, Tony notes: \"Any settlement between Facebook and the FTC still could change dramatically. Negotiations are continuing, and the final say belongs to the FTC's five commissioners, three Republicans and two Democrats. If the agency lacks at least three votes - or talks break down between Facebook and the FTC - the result could force the two sides to battle in court.\"\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: The FTC's members are split on the size and scope of the financial punishment for Facebook -- and the degree to which Mark Zuckerberg specifically should be held personally liable for a violation of a past agreement,\u00a0the New York Times reported. The division comes despite Facebook's announcement last month it set aside $3 billion to $5 billion for the settlement and a consensus among the five commissioners that they wanted to pursue a \"historic penalty that would show the agency's teeth,\" Cecilia Kang reports.</p><p>Facebook has fought back against the idea that Zuckerberg, the chief executive, should be held liable for any violation of a 2011 agreement with the FTC in which ir promised to overhaul its privacy practices. The company has said Zuckerberg \"should not be held legally responsible for the actions of all 35,000 of his employees,\" per Cecilia.\u00a0</p><p>The commission is seeking to avoid a decision along party lines. \"The FTC's Republican chairman, Joseph J. Simons, appeared to have the votes of the other two Republican commissioners, giving him the three needed to approve a deal. But a 3-to-2 decision along party lines, which Mr. Simons has said he wants to avoid, could lead to strong rebukes on Capitol Hill,\" Cecilia reports.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: The European Union will launch a formal antitrust investigation into Apple,The Financial Times reported, in the wake of Spotify's complaint that the iPhone maker unlawfully favored its own Apple Music service by abusing its dominance in the App Store.\u00a0</p><p> \"Spotify, which last month hit 100m paid subscribers to its service, is the market leader in music streaming but faces increasing competition from bigger technology players, namely Apple and Amazon,\" Rochelle Toplensky reports in Brussels. \"... Spotify's complaint centres on Apple's policy of charging digital content providers a 30 per cent fee for using its payment system for subscriptions sold in its App Store. The policy applies to Spotify and other music subscription services but not apps, such as Uber. After considering the complaint and surveying customers, rivals and others in the market, the EU competition commission has decided to launch a formal antitrust investigation into Apple's conduct, according to three people familiar with the probe.\"\u00a0</p><p>Tech news from the public sector:</p><p>Tech news from the private sector:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-b2009a411fd34cbfbf2eafaa56e286ae</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W25-BBX1-DXKP-J0RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1384\"/><timeReceived>1:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 6, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and defended its $15 minimum wage for workers after she criticized Amazon chief executive and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos\u00a0for paying people \"starvation wages\" in an interview over the weekend:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's part of a broader pattern: The company has also sought to fact-check statements from\u00a02020 hopefuls in\u00a0between tweets promoting one-day shipping and its Kindle devices. It disputed\u00a0former vice president Joe Biden's comments last week about how much it\u00a0pays in taxes\u00a0and pushed back in April on Sen. Elizabeth Warren's criticism of its\u00a0treatment of competing sellers on its platform.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             This is a marked change from the traditional tech industry strategy to keep an arms-length from the daily political debate and wait out 24-hour\u00a0news cycles.             But\u00a0Amazon appears to be realizing that a quiet playbook doesn't work as the concentration of corporate power becomes a key 2020 issue for Democrats on the campaign trail -- who have no qualms with singling out specific companies.\u00a0          </p><p>\"[Amazon] can't afford to be passive about it,\" said Larry Parnell, an associate professor of strategic public relations at George Washington University. \"Corporate America is finding that engaging in the political process - like it or not - is part of doing business.\"</p><p>Other tech giants such as\u00a0Google and Facebook have also been in politicians' line of fire, but their Twitter accounts have not sought to take them to task on issues of the day. But Parnell says that makes them \"easy prey\" for politicians.\u00a0</p><p>For Amazon, Twitter could be an avenue to quickly set the record straight when they feel prominent politicians are spreading false information about the company.\u00a0</p><p>\"Amazon is simply correcting the record when high-profile candidates or elected officials make statements about the company that are either incorrect or misleading,\" said a person familiar with the company's thinking. \"Errors and misunderstandings become accepted truths if they go uncorrected.\"</p><p>             But there is one person at which, notably, Amazon does not tweet. President Trump has repeatedly taken swipes at the company and Bezos - including to criticize his ownership of The Post - on Twitter since 2015. Amazon has never responded directly to those tweets, which like all of the president's tweets were widely fact-checked by journalists and other third-parties. Bezos himself responded once in 2015 before Trump took office,\u00a0suggesting\u00a0that he would send the president to space via his company Blue Origin.\u00a0</p><p>Yet in the big picture, communications experts say as more of the political conversation moves to Twitter, more\u00a0companies will likely follow Amazon's playbook and respond to politicians.\u00a0</p><p>             \"It's probably the new normal,\" Parnell said.\u00a0\"Amazon is at the forefront of something here that we'll see more of.\"\u00a0          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Health-care providers fielding thousands of spam calls a day fear \"a potential health crisis\" while regulators weigh solutions to tame a growing robocall epidemic, reports my colleague Tony Romm.          </p><p>             Tufts Medical Center in Boston received more than 4,000 calls in the span of two hours on one April day, the center's chief information security officer told Tony. Windstream, the hospital's telecom service, was unable to block the calls which appeared to be designed to scam the neighborhood's Chinese population. A Tampa-based facility has been dealing with more than 6,000 robocalls a day, including calls that spoofed the hospital's own phone number.</p><p>Advocates say these robocalls pose a \"serious threat\" to both consumers who may be duped into thinking a medical provider is calling them and emergency medical providers who lose precious seconds from the disruption.</p><p>\"These calls to health-care institutions and patients are extremely dangerous to the public health and patient privacy,\" Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) told Tony. \"The FCC and [the] Justice Department need to go after these criminals with the seriousness and urgency this issue deserves.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said he didn't know\u00a0whether Facebook should have taken down a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in a Washington Post Live interview with my colleague Tony Romm\u00a0yesterday. \"At the end of the day free speech is\u00a0messy,\" Cruz told Tony, before concluding that \"if something is fraudulent, I think that's a basis for taking something down.\"</p><p>Cruz did not elaborate on whether\u00a0he believed the video of Pelosi met that threshold, but said that there was a \"difference between fraud and not liking what's being said.\" Many other politicians said Facebook should have removed the video, which was edited to slow down Pelosi's speech and make her appear drunk.\u00a0</p><p>Cruz pointed to the \"subjective decision-making\" at fault, citing a \"lack of transparency\" from Big Tech companies including Facebook, Google and Twitter. Cruz has long argued that these companies are biased against conservatives, and he contends that a handful of tech executives should not be making decisions about free speech. There is no evidence that the tech companies have been systematically biased against conservatives.\u00a0</p><p>Cruz also explained why he has defended Infowars host Alex Jones -- who frequently spreads conspiracy theories online and was blocked by several major tech platforms. Cruz said he doesn't listen to what Jones says, but at the same time he came to his defense because he\u00a0doesn't \"like that a handful of Silicon Valley Billionaires suddenly decided this voice should be silenced.\"</p><p>             BYTES: Amazon-owned Twitch, the live-streaming platform popular with video game enthusiasts, is suing to identify users that coordinated spreading a slew of offensive and copyrighted content on its platform last month, Bloomberg News's Robert Burson reported.\u00a0Twitch said that it has been unable to stop streamers \"John and Jane Does 1 Through 100\" from flooding the site with pornography, violent content including footage from the Christchurch, New Zealand\u00a0shooting, and copyrighted materials in the lawsuit filed in California last week. The action seems to be driven by a network of bots, Burson reports. The trolls continued to post content from new accounts after individual bans.\u00a0\u00a0\"We worked with urgency to remove the offending content and suspend all accounts engaged in this behavior, and are taking measures to prevent this from happening on our service in the future,\" a Twitch representative\u00a0wrote in an email to Motherboard.</p><p>As Bloomberg News reporter Ben Brody points out, the suit could have implications for impending debate in Washington over Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives platforms broad legal immunity\u00a0for content third parties post to their sites.</p><p>             --             Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) suggests that lawmakers need to take a hard look at Section 230 to tackle deep fakes.\u00a0          </p><p>\"I think we should have a debate in this area,\" Warner said at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations yesterday. \"If you can cause as much consternation by just slowing down a video of Nancy Pelosi . . . deepfakes are 10 times more challenging.\" Warner, who points out that Facebook and Google provide more than half of Americans their news, said the tech companies have evolved dramatically since the protections were written in the 1990s, when lawmakers thought of the companies as \"common carriers.\"\u00a0</p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News generating buzz online:          </p><p>             - Today:          </p><p>             - Coming soon:          </p><p>A video parodying Boston Dynamics might make you even more worried about an impending robot revolution.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-2ed2f558583248b8a4ecbb1129536f8a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCB-37J1-JB4M-V53S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1359\"/><timeReceived>1:03 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 18, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) called out the company -- as well as the party's longtime target Halliburton -- for not paying corporate taxes after\u00a0moderator Savannah Guthrie pressed him on whether he would single out companies like his rivals. Booker's decision to lump the Seattle titan in with the global oil services company with deep ties to Dick Cheney underscores how Amazon's political position has deteriorated on the left.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that,\" Booker said. (Amazon chief executive and founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post).\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Income inequality has emerged as one of the top issues for Democrats in 2020, and few examples illustrate the uneven playing field in the U.S. more aptly than profitable companies avoiding paying corporate taxes. Amazon emerged as the symbol of that issue after the company received a federal tax rebate of $129 million on income of $10.8 billion last year,\u00a0according to a report compiled by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\u00a0</p><p>Amazon and Halliburton were among 60 Fortune 500 companies that did not pay income taxes last year, according to the same report. The companies on the list represented a diverse range of businesses, including airlines and car-makers. Other tech companies cited by the report include IBM, Netflix and Activision Blizzard.\u00a0</p><p>             Initially progressives like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were leading the drumbeat on corporate taxes, but recently more moderate candidates like former vice president Joe Biden have also blasted the company on the issue.\u00a0          </p><p>Facing an onslaught of criticism, Amazon has had to adopt a new playbook, often responding to criticism from individual candidates and other prominent Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Twitter. The company has not yet tweeted at Booker post-debate, but it did clap back at Biden recently when he levied a similar attack.\u00a0Amazon said the candidate's issue was with the U.S. tax policy, not an individual company:</p><p>Democrats aren't just challenging Amazon on corporate tax issues. They've also slammed the company on its salaries for warehouse workers and\u00a0Warren wants to break up the company.</p><p>The attacks on Amazon come as the Democratic Party's relationship with the tech industry has rapidly grown icy. Tech companies have taken a beating during this primary -- in a sharp departure from\u00a0the Obama era, when the\u00a0industry was a key fundraising source for Democrats and many administration officials went on to take positions in Silicon Valley after leaving the White House.</p><p>             Booker's Amazon name check was especially significant as he has raised significant sums from the tech industry and was a big early adopter\u00a0of its platforms.\u00a0The Stanford University graduate tried to persuade the company to move its second headquarters to Newark, N.J., after the company pulled its plans to move to New York last year. Booker was also among the candidates who received donations from former Obama press secretary Jay Carney, who now serves as vice president for worldwide corporate affairs at Amazon, according to a report by The Intercept. Carney also donated to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Beto O'Rourke and Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\u00a0</p><p>             Silicon Valley issues overall got less air time than the NBC moderators' hot microphone snafu. Other tech companies under immense political pressure, including Google and Facebook, were notably not mentioned by the candidates. When Booker was asked\u00a0about whether he would break up Facebook, Google and Amazon, he did not directly address competition and pivoted toward corporate consolidation, attacking both the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. He later stated his position on antitrust law.\u00a0</p><p> \"And when it comes to antitrust law, what I will do is, number one, appoint judges that will enforce it, number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration,\" Booker said. \"At the end of the day, we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing.\"</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg didn't pull any punches when it came to criticizing the U.S. government for failing to take \"counter-action\" after the 2016 election, in a wide-ranging interview yesterday at the Aspen Ideas Festival with ex-Obama official Cass Sunstein.\u00a0Zuckerberg said it signaled to the world \"we're open for business\" to foreign actors like Iran, who\u00a0have increased their attacks on Facebook.       </p><p>          \"As a private company, we don't have the tools to make the Russian government stop. We can defend as best as we can, but our government has the tools to apply pressure to Russia, not us.\" Zuckerberg said. \"We've ramped up very massively on the security side but there's very little we can do to change the incentive for nation states. That's a little bit above our paygrade.\"       </p><p>Zuckerberg also addressed growing calls for regulation\u00a0in some of his first public remarks about the company's content moderation issues after the social network's decision not to remove a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hit a nerve in Washington. He called the company's response\u00a0 \"an execution mistake,\" standing by the company's\u00a0decision to keep up the video but explaining the\u00a0content moderation system that flags video for moderation action took longer than normal.       </p><p>Facebook is \"currently evolving\" on its policy for\u00a0videos manipulated with artificial intelligence, also know as deepfakes, and is consulting experts, Zuckerberg said.       </p><p> \"We're passed the point where it makes sense for Facebook to unilaterally make decisions,\" said Zuckerberg. Facebook introduced an appeal process for its content decisions earlier this year and will soon be introducing an independent content oversight board.</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0President\u00a0Trump\u00a0said the U.S. government \u00a0\"should be suing Google and Facebook and all that,\" and then went on to say that \"perhaps we\u00a0will,\"\u00a0in an interview\u00a0with Fox Business Network yesterday.                     The president added that legislation was also a possibility to address growing concerns in Washington about the industry. Though he\u00a0didn't dive into a basis for legal action, he took special aim at Google for \"trying to rig the election,\" and alleged that Twitter made it more difficult for users to follow him.       </p><p>          The president's comments came as the White House announced a July meeting for digital leaders to discuss the \"opportunities and challenges of today's online environment\" following the remarks yesterday,\u00a0my colleague Tony Romm reports.\u00a0The\u00a0Trump\u00a0administration has for years rallied his base by alleging the tech industry is biased against conservatives, even though the companies vehemently deny these charges and there is no definitive evidence that the companies are systematically biased against one political group.       </p><p>          Both parties have expressed greater interest\u00a0in regulating Big Tech in recent months but, as Tony points out,\u00a0Trump's reference to lawsuits could anger Democrats who are concerned about the executive office influencing decisions at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission to punish his political enemies.       </p><p>          Antitrust fervor in D.C. and allegations of conservative bias hasn't stopped\u00a0Trump\u00a0from using tech platforms; the\u00a0Trump\u00a0campaign\u00a0took out prominent ad space on YouTube\u00a0yesterday in advance of the Democratic debates.       </p><p>                          BYTES:\u00a0Reddit's\u00a0gathering place for Trump supporters, \"r/The_Donald\" has been\u00a0\"quarantined\"\u00a0after the forum\u00a0permitted\u00a0calls for violence towards police and public officials involved in a legislative dispute in Oregon,                    \u00a0my colleagues Drew\u00a0Harwell\u00a0and Craig\u00a0Timberg\u00a0report.\u00a0\u00a0Today's decision stands to inflame ongoing debates over tech's role in censoring violence and hate speech and fuel allegations that tech companies are biased against conservatives.\u00a0       </p><p>          Users looking to visit\u00a0The_Donald, which has about 750,000 subscribers and\u00a0describes itself as a \"rally\" in support of\u00a0Trump, will now be met with a warning that the section violates\u00a0Reddit's\u00a0rules about content inciting violence.\u00a0In the past\u00a0 users on\u00a0\"The_Donald\"\u00a0\u00a0also encouraged participants to attend events like the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., reports Will Sommer at The\u00a0Daily Beast.\u00a0 But\u00a0this is the first time the forum has seen any sort of strict restriction from the site.       </p><p>          The White House did not respond to a request from comment from the Post, but Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign told Drew and Craig that \"we remain concerned about practices of various social media platforms and their efforts to silence conservative voices and supporters of President Trump.\"       </p><p>          The potential for fringe-platforms like\u00a0Reddit\u00a0to incite online violence has been the subject of Congressional inquiry as lawmakers try to address online extremism.       </p><p>          \u00a0\"It's clear that all social media companies are still not doing enough to counter extremism, misinformation,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.), in a statement to the Post Wednesday. \"Perhaps it's time\u00a0Reddit\u00a0faced some scrutiny as well.\"       </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-64111c37d87b4f238aa7570bfbcff3ba</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF7-TWR1-DXKP-J3N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1666\"/><timeReceived>12:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 27, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002PYP</classCode><className>ACTIVISION BLIZZARD INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

But now that Apple just announced paid subscription services in these industries, antitrust experts are wary of the possibility the tech giant could use its position undercut other businesses that are new rivals.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sally Hubbard, a director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, said she's concerned about how the company could abuse its perch as operator of the App Store to prioritize its own new services over its competitors. \u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"My concern is that it can be the gatekeeper to those industries,\" Hubbard said. \"It can pull little levers and be able to advantage themselves.\"</p><p>\"When you have the actual platform beginning to compete with companies that depend on the platform you have an inherent conflict of interest,\" she said. \"It's not a level playing field for competition.\"\u00a0</p><p>             So far,\u00a0most of Washington's\u00a0focus has been on Facebook, Google and Amazon as a broader conversation about whether current antitrust law needs to be changed to address Silicon Valley's power heats up in Washington. Now Apple\u00a0could find itself drawn deeper into that debate.\u00a0          </p><p>             And depending\u00a0on how Apple approaches the rollout of its new services, its latest moves could raise some of the same questions regulators in Europe have about Amazon's products, Hubbard said.</p><p>The European Union currently has a preliminary investigation in \"quite advanced\" stages into whether the e-commerce giant is using the data it collects from businesses on its platform to inform its own product sales and undercut rivals.</p><p>Apple declined to comment for this article.</p><p>But it's\u00a0already on defense against an antitrust complaint in Europe -- where music streaming service Spotify is accusing the company of abusing its power over the App Store. In a press release announcing the complaint, Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek accused the company of playing the role as both \"player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers.\" Apple then accused Spotify of trying to reap the benefits of the App Store ecosystem without making any contributions to it.</p><p> \"We want more app businesses to thrive - including the ones that compete with some aspect of our business, because they drive us to be better,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>             And antitrust concerns about Apple could gain more prominence in the political arena heading into the 2020 presidential election in the U.S.</p><p>One candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren,\u00a0is increasingly scrutinizing technology companies that act both as the platform that other businesses rely on to deliver their services and also a competitor to those businesses. Though Apple was not one of the three companies Warren singled out in her initial proposal to break up Big Tech, she did tell me in a recent\u00a0interview Apple should \"be on the list.\"</p><p> \"Apple can run the platform or they can sell the apps,\" she told me. \"But they can't compete with other individuals on selling the apps at the same time that they're running the platform and sucking all the information off the platform and making decisions about whose apps are going to be at the top of the platform and who's going to be way in the back where you never find them.\"</p><p>To be sure, Warren's plan to break up Big Tech would require changes to antitrust law, and the senator has not yet introduced any legislation to that effect.</p><p>Apple's own history also raises competition concerns as it pushes into new services, experts tell me. Generally, a company's entrance to new areas of business results in more competition in the marketplace, said Chris Sagers, a professor of law at Cleveland State University. But there can be problems when a company does things to \"ease its entry that restrain existing competition.\"</p><p>\"In fact, Apple has built up a bit of a record of conduct showing that Apple's entry is not always good,\" Sagers told me.</p><p>Sagers pointed to Apple's approach to e-books as an example of this anti-competitive behavior. The U.S. Department of Justice brought a suit against Apple in 2012 for conspiring with publishers to raise the price of e-books. After the Supreme Court declined to review an appeals' court decision in 2016, Apple had to pay a $450 million settlement.</p><p>             BITS: Apple put privacy front and center as it rolled out services ranging from a credit card to a gaming subscription service,\u00a0Buzzfeed's\u00a0Katie Notopoulos\u00a0writes.\u00a0The repeated theme underscored how the iPhone maker was trying to differentiate itself from other technology giants.\u00a0</p><p> \"Apple didn't mention Facebook or Google during the event, but its digs at those companies' privacy and user data practices were clear,\" Notopoulos wrote.\u00a0</p><p>The company emphasized that its News+ subscription service won't share your data with advertisers, or that its Apple Pay-connected credit card won't track data about your transactions. But the companies' new services will accumulate data.\u00a0</p><p> \"So today the company was all about reassuring people: Don't worry, we're still the good guy,\" writes Notopoulos.\u00a0\"Apple has\u00a0long taken a protective stance on privacy, but it's now using its approach to user data as a powerful marketing tool to sell more of its laptops, phones, news subscriptions, and entertainment services.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government is working on new legislation that would penalize social media companies that \"undermine public safety,\"reports Bloomberg's Jason Scott.\u00a0</p><p>Morrison is meeting with representatives from the social media companies on Tuesday following the attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, which left 50 people dead.\u00a0</p><p>The legislation will \"seek to apply criminal penalties to companies that don't act in the interests of the safety of Australians,\" Scott reported that Morrison told reporters. \"What I'm looking for is for these companies to come to the table as responsible corporate citizens and make sure their products are safe here in Australia.\"</p><p>Facebook and other technology companies face increased scrutiny of their efforts to stamp out violence on their platforms after the shooter live-streamed the attack on Facebook. Copies of the video proliferated on Facebook and other platforms like YouTube for days after the attack.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Facebook announced today it removed accounts linked to Iran, Russia, Macedonia and Kosovo, citing coordinated inauthentic behavior. Facebook pulled down 2,632 Groups, Pages and accounts,according to a company blog post.</p><p>Facebook\u00a0did not find links between these sets of activity, but it did say \"they used similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing.\"</p><p>513 of the accounts were tied to Iran, while 1,907 were linked to Russia, Facebook said.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook has been increasingly\u00a0 cracking down on such behavior as it faces increased scrutiny for how foreign powers tried to influence its platform in the 2016 elections.\u00a0</p><p> \"While we are making progress rooting out this abuse, as we've said before, it's an ongoing challenge because the people responsible are determined and well-funded,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook Head of Cybersecurity Policy, wrote in the blog post. \"We constantly have to improve to stay ahead.\"</p><p>Tech news from the private sector:\u00a0</p><p>Government tech news:\u00a0</p><p>- News about tech workforce and culture:</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-b6006fba1c0441c7bf23a3a617172396</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRD-HTP1-DXKP-J4RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1290\"/><timeReceived>12:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Data brokers collect and bundle people's information and sell their profiles\u00a0to other companies, often to enable personalized online advertising. Cook is proposing the government require data brokers to register with the FTC\u00a0 and allow consumers the ability to track how the brokers package and sell their data - and easily delete their data from services for free.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Meaningful, comprehensive federal privacy legislation should not only aim to put consumers in control of their data, it should also shine a light on actors trafficking in your data behind the scenes,\" Cook wrote in a Time magazine op-ed published today. \"Some state laws are looking to accomplish just that, but right now there is no federal standard protecting Americans from these practices.\"          </p><p>Right now, much of the national debate on privacy is focused on technology companies that are household names. Lawmakers are largely focused on cleanup after high-profile data privacy scandals such as Cambridge Analytica's collection of Facebook users' data without their permission or the Google+ security bug highlighted how lax these companies have been when it comes to data security.</p><p>             Cook's op-ed and a recent Motherboard investigation into location data transactions could put pressure on Congress to more specifically target data brokers in national privacy legislation. When lawmakers held a major hearing on privacy to set the stage for national legislation last year, they included many of the major technology and telecom companies as witnesses - but they did not have any data brokers.</p><p>             Some lawmakers are already choosing to take up the issue this year.\u00a0Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.),\u00a0known as a privacy hawk, is planning to introduce a consumer privacy bill in the next few weeks that would give consumers a way to review what data companies have collected about them and who they share it with. The bill would also include a \"Do Not Track system\" that would let people stop companies from tracking them online and then selling their data.</p><p>             But it's unclear whether Senate Republicans would be supportive of such heavy-handed measures. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)\u00a0introduced privacy legislation yesterday\u00a0-- but the American Data Dissemination Act and an accompanying op-ed\u00a0did not mention data brokers. His bill calls on the FTC to draft privacy recommendations for Congress. If Congress does not adopt\u00a0 its own legislation in the next two years, the bill would grant the authority to the FTC to write privacy rules itself.</p><p>However bipartisan scrutiny of the sale and transfer of consumers' personal data is building. Last week, Motherboard's Joseph Cox exposed that phone companies like AT&amp;T, T Mobile and Sprint were selling customers' location data - and he was able to buy that information from a bounty hunter. AT&amp;T and Sprint have promised to stop selling location data to third parties since the piece was published.\u00a0</p><p>Yesterday, top Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a series of letters to the companies involved, including the mobile carriers as well as Microbilt and Zumigo. Motherboard reported that T-Mobile sold the data to Zumigo, a company that aggregates mobile location data, and Zumigo then sold it to Microbilt, a company that does credit and background checks, then Microbit sold it to various clients - including a bounty hunter.</p><p>\"This practice of selling and sharing of location information through multiple entities potentially impacts hundreds of millions of American customers,\" Reps. Greg Walden (Ore.), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), Robert E. Latta (Ohio) and Brett Guthrie (Ky.) wrote. \"We are deeply troubled because it is not the first time we have received reports and information about the sharing of mobile users' location information involving a number of parties who may have misused personally identifiable information.\"</p><p>             Democrats in both the House and Senate are putting pressure on the FCC to investigate the telephone companies' sale of location data. House Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee requested an emergency briefing with FCC Chairman Ajit Pai on the wireless industry's collection of data. Pai declined to participate in the hearing due to the government shutdown, but\u00a0committee chairman Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.) was unsatisfied because he said there's nothing in the law that should prevent Pai from meeting with the committee personally. The FCC told The Hill that it was investigating the carriers' handling of location data, but it was suspended following a lapse in funding for the agency.</p><p>             As lawmakers are shaping national privacy legislation, they're also looking at laws on the books in the states. Already, California and Vermont have passed legislation that would limit data brokers. Under California's new law, consumers would have the right to \"opt out\" from any company selling their data.\u00a0 The businesses still have to give these people the same quality of service.</p><p>Vermont has a law that's somewhat similar to Cook's proposal, which requires data brokers to register with the state's attorney general and to disclose how they collect data and whether they offer ways for consumers to opt out of their services. But the law doesn't go as far as Cook's proposal because the brokers aren't required to let people opt out.</p><p>\"As this debate kicks off, there will be plenty of proposals and competing interests for policymakers to consider,\" Cook wrote. \"We cannot lose sight of the most important constituency: individuals trying to win back their right to privacy.\"</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0             Facebook removed hundreds of accounts, pages and groups \"that engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior on Facebook and Instagram,\" the company announced in a blog post this morning as it continues to try to combat disinformation on its platforms.       </p><p>The company said it removed 364 Facebook Pages and accounts run by a Russian network. Some of the pages were linked to employees of the Russian news agency Sputnik. On a tip from U.S. law enforcement, the company also separately took down 107 Facebook pages, group and accounts and 41 Instagram accounts that originated in Russia and operated in Ukraine.</p><p>\"We didn't find any links between these operations, but they used similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said in the blog post.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Microsoft pledged $500 million toward affordable housing and homelessness initiatives in the Seattle area as the city's recent tech boom drives up real estate prices, according to\u00a0The Seattles Times's Vernal Coleman and Mike Rosenberg. The company's housing pledge dwarfs the $100 million in annual public funding for Washington's Housing Trust Fund.</p><p>Microsoft is trying to address the affordability gap in the region's housing market as real estate is becoming a hot button issue between technology companies and communities in many fast-growing hubs, such as Seattle and San Francisco. Developers are racing to build new housing to keep up with the demand in these cities, but new options mostly target wealthy renters and leave behind middle or low-income residents.</p><p>\"Microsoft officials say it's too early to say exactly how much affordable housing will ultimately result from the $500 million,\" the Seattle Times reported. Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, told the Times the funding would target workers who \"teach our kids in schools, and put out the fires in our houses and keep us alive in the hospital.\"</p><p>             BYTES:\u00a0YouTube is cracking down on dangerous pranks with new guidelines for creators who upload videos to the platform, the Verge's Julia Alexander reported. The company said it updated its guidelines to ban\u00a0\"pranks that make victims believe they're in serious physical danger - for example, a home invasion prank or a drive-by shooting prank,\" according to the Verge. Such dangerous pranks can also include the\u00a0\"Bird Box challenge\" where people perform actions while blindfolded\u00a0or the\u00a0\"Tide Pod challenge\" where people eat the laundry detergent.\u00a0</p><p>YouTube might not shut down\u00a0a user's channel for uploading a dangerous video for the first time but it may crack down if it happens repeatedly.\u00a0\"YouTube's policy is to hand out a strike and remove the video, but that strike disappears after 90 days,\"\u00a0Alexander reported. \"While a creator may lose some privileges within those 90 days, including the ability to live stream, they could technically come back once the strike is removed and perform another dangerous stunt.\"</p><p>             A\u00a0Pew Research Center survey found that 74 percent of Facebook users did not know that the social network creates a list of their interests for advertisers,\u00a0despite recent scrutiny of the company's data collection practices, \u00a0 The Washington Post's\u00a0Abby Ohlheiser reported. \"We consistently find that there's a paradox at the center of generalized privacy research,\" said Lee Rainie, director of Internet and technology research at Pew, according to my colleague. \"Americans, being Americans, say that it matters, but they behave in a way that doesn't indicate that it matters.\"          </p><p>The poll, which was conducted from\u00a0Sept. 4 to Oct. 1, also found that 51 percent of respondents were not comfortable with Facebook gathering this data once they saw the list. \"Nearly 9 in 10 (88 percent) Facebook users found that the social network had generated some material for them on the ad preferences page, and 6 in 10 had 10 or more interests listed for them,\"\u00a0Abby wrote. \"Unsurprisingly, heavy or longtime users of Facebook were more likely to have more interests on their ad preferences pages.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0Amazon isn't just the largest book retailer in the world, it is also reshaping the publishing business, according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg. Amazon Publishing, the company's unit that publishes books such as thrillers and romance novels, has become a tough competitor to other players in the industry. The company can also rely in its publishing activity on in-house tools such as the\u00a0promotion program Amazon First Reads and the e-book subscription service Kindle Unlimited.</p><p>Amazon went from publishing 373 titles in the United States\u00a0in 2009\u00a0when it ventured into consumer book\u00a0publishing to 1,231 in 2017. \"To some in the industry, it is an inherently conflicted structure, in which the most powerful retailer has a competing incentive to favor books it publishes and those from authors using its self-publishing technology,\"\u00a0Trachtenberg wrote. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>             - Facebook\u00a0is expanding its efforts to boost the transparency of political ads and combat election interference to several foreign countries that are holding elections this year, according to Reuters's\u00a0Paresh Dave. The\u00a0new Facebook rules will apply to Nigeria, Ukraine, India and the European Union. Facebook said that starting Wednesday, only advertisers based in Nigeria are allowed to place electoral ads on Facebook in that country. The same rules are\u00a0set to kick in\u00a0in Ukraine next month.</p><p>Facebook will also launch an online searchable archive of electoral\u00a0ads in India and a similar system for the European Union, according to Reuters. \"We're learning from every country,\" Rob Leathern, a director of product management at Facebook, told Dave. \"We know we're not going to be perfect, but our goal is continuing, ongoing improvement.\"          </p><p>             - Apple is continuing to venture further into health care as it has held talks with at least three private Medicare plans to subsidize its Apple Watch for seniors, although no official deal has been struck yet, CNBC's Christina Farr reported. The idea would be to subsidize the watch for use\u00a0as a health tracker by people over 65 years of age. \"Health experts say that seniors are an ideal market for the Apple Watch, which has introduced features that can be used by anyone, but are most beneficial to seniors, including fall detection and cardiac arrhythmia monitoring,\" CNBC reported.\u00a0\"It also makes sense as a business model for insurers, as seniors are a particularly lucrative market.\"</p><p>             - More technology news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - The bad news continue to pile up for Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.\u00a0Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal probe of the company\u00a0for alleged theft of trade secrets from U.S. business\u00a0partners of Huawei, according to the Wall Street Journal's Dan Strumpf, Nicole Hong and Aruna Viswanatha.\u00a0\"The investigation grew in part out of civil lawsuits against Huawei, including one in which a Seattle jury found Huawei liable for misappropriating robotic technology from T-Mobile's Bellevue, Wash., lab, the people familiar with the matter said,\" the Journal reported.\u00a0\"The probe is at an advanced stage and could lead to an indictment soon, they said.\"</p><p>             - Rep. Alexandria\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0(D-N.Y.) is planning\u00a0to share her social media\u00a0savvy with other Democrats today, according to USA Today's Eliza Collins. She is scheduled to join Rep.\u00a0Jim\u00a0Himes\u00a0(D-Conn.) this morning for a session hosted by the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee\u00a0\"on the most effective ways to engage constituents on Twitter and the importance of digital storytelling,\"\u00a0Collins reported.</p><p>             - More technology news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Several investors in the office-space company WeWork said they were concerned by an arrangement in which\u00a0Adam Neumann, WeWork's chief executive, made millions of dollars\u00a0by leasing properties that he owns back to the company, according to the Wall Street Journal's Eliot Brown. The situation could be a potential conflict of interest for Neumann, according to several investors.\u00a0Brown reported that a\u00a0WeWork representative \"said all related-party deals are reviewed and approved by the board or an independent committee and disclosed to investors.\"\u00a0Neumann founded WeWork in 2010 and is the biggest individual shareholder of the company.</p><p>             \"Corporate governance experts say Mr. Neumann's ownership of buildings he leases to WeWork is unusual for a large company,\"\u00a0the Journal reported.\u00a0\"Corporations typically bar executives from similar arrangements, given that companies risk paying too much in rent or leasing buildings they ordinarily wouldn't, they said.\"</p><p>             - John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile, responded on Twitter to a report by The Washington Post.The Post's\u00a0Jonathan O'Connell and David A.

His immigration plans, vows to return manufacturing jobs to American shores and pointed threats directed at individual companies roiled the tech elite.\u00a0\u00a0But a President Elizabeth Warren could also be a complicated commander-in-chief for Silicon Valley. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is predicting a Warren presidency would draw Facebook into a legal battle with the U.S. government.\u00a0          </p><p>\"You have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies ... if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" Zuckerberg said at a July company meeting, according to a recording obtained by the Verge's Casey Newton. \"And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ... But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"\u00a0Zuckerberg's harsh words\u00a0leaked\u00a0to the public as Warren\u00a0continues to gain\u00a0in the Democratic primary, making it increasingly likely she could face off with Trump in the fall. That could be bad news for tech company executives, who are the target of many of her most aggressive plans.\u00a0\u00a0Warren was the first 2020 presidential candidate to release a comprehensive plan to break up the tech companies, which has since been adopted by many other top 2020 contenders. She has bashed Silicon Valley for abusing people's privacy and endangering democracy during elections. Her proposals for a wealth tax on the country's highest earners would undoubtedly personally hit some prominent tech executives. And in the wake of Zuckerberg's comments, she's only stepped up her jabs at the companies. From her Twitter feed:\u00a0</p><p>             Warren's attacks on the tech industry underscore how her candidacy is dividing\u00a0Silicon Valley, especially after the tech industry has largely been united behind candidates like President Obama and Hillary Clinton in recent election cycles.          </p><p>Warren's aggressive antitrust and tax plans could pose a major problem for\u00a0top company executives who would find themselves increasingly under Washington's microscope in a Warren administration. It's also unclear if Warren\u00a0can garner broad support among venture capitalists in the industry. As Paul Graham, the co-founder of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote, most don't agree with her antitrust plans:</p><p>             \u00a0Warren has already shown that she can garner some support among rank-and-file tech employees. The San Jose Mercury News reported that Warren came in second in donations over a three-month period between April and the end of June from employees at Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook and Google's parent company Alphabet, trailing only Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg. She also\u00a0led the field in donations from people who described their job as \"software engineer\" or \"programmer.\"\u00a0</p><p>Max Kaehn, a Google software engineer who donated to Warren's campaign, told me that he thinks she has the most comprehensive policies addressing issues like health care. He also thinks that engineers like himself stand to benefit from Warren's\u00a0antitrust policies.\u00a0</p><p>             \"Creating more competition is good for software engineers because it means we have more potential jobs to go to,\" he told me.\u00a0          </p><p>He's been working in Silicon Valley for 25 years, and he feels these days,\u00a0 there isn't enough innovation. Kaehn\u00a0says so much focus is on the biggest tech companies, and many of the startups are just trying to get acquired by the bigger players.\u00a0</p><p> \"These days all I\u00a0get contacted for are companies doing calendaring or self-driving cars, \" he said. \"They're obviously attempts to create a unicorn that gets acquired by one of the big tech companies.\"\u00a0          </p><p>For other tech employees, supporting Warren remains a complicated decision. From Adrienne Porter Felt, a Google Chrome engineer, on Twitter:</p><p>             BITS: A new incubator focused on tech for conservative campaigns is investing $150,000 across six start-ups focused on digital tools for analytics, outreach and organizing.          </p><p>          Startup Caucus's\u00a0inaugural investments include:           Numinar,\u00a0Voterfied,\u00a0Buzz360,\u00a0Trailmapper,\u00a0Pundit\u00a0and\u00a0Voter Science, the incubator's managing partner\u00a0Eric Wilson told The Technology 202 exclusively. The founders of the companies will also participate in 12 weeks of training and networking with Republican political operatives and funders.       </p><p>          \"Republicans have a big advantage when it comes to the top of the ticket. We're outperforming Democrats online. But we need to keep up the innovation,\" says Wilson, a longtime GOP digital strategist.\u00a0       </p><p>          The companies\u00a0will focus on local, state and congressional races. While many address the same issues facing campaigns across the political spectrum, some have a\u00a0uniquely conservative bent. Voterfied, run by a former congressional candidate,\u00a0will focus on giving candidates a direct platform to reach voters about more localized issues that might not get media pickup. Another, Pundit, will serve as a social-media network for voters. Both could appeal to conservatives who allege Big Tech and mainstream media outlets are biased against them.\u00a0       </p><p>          Startup Caucus is Republicans' answer to Higher Ground Labs, an incubator that backs political start-ups who want to assist progressive\u00a0campaigns. But there's one key difference: operating budget. Startup Caucus has about a tenth of the funding of its liberal\u00a0rival.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"I'm confident once we have this portfolio out in the world, and people see the innovation from Startup\u00a0Caucus, that money will be coming,\" Wilson tells me.       </p><p>          Startup Caucus has an edge with an advisory committee full of a veritable Who's Who of Republicans in tech, including Ginny Badanes, director of Microsoft's Defending Democracy Program, and\u00a0Matt Oczkowski, president of behavioral targeting firm\u00a0Data Propria.\u00a0                 </p><p>          Oszkowski, one of the right's biggest tech stars, comes with significant baggage. He previously worked at Cambridge Analytica, the now- shuttered firm that worked for the Trump campaign and siphoned raw data from 50\u00a0million Facebook users. But Wilson said the blowback following the incident hasn't made candidates gun-shy about taking on data-driven\u00a0tech.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"We expect that all of our companies follow the law and best practices when it comes to using and storing data, especially when they're providing insights to campaigns,\" Wilson says. \"But I don't think any fallout from Cambridge Analytica has dampened campaigns' enthusiasm for cutting-edge campaign tech.\"       </p><p>             NIBBLES: A federal appeals court upheld the Federal Communications Commission's 2017 decision to roll back Obama-era net neutrality rules. But the court's decision could still give consumer advocates and tech companies a path forward because it overruled the FCC's effort to block local and state open Internet legislation             ,\u00a0my colleague Tony Romm reports.       </p><p>                       \"The bright silver lining, however, is that the ruling bolsters existing state efforts to restore net neutrality, and gives a greenlight for other states to join those efforts,\" Chad Marlow, senior advocacy and policy counsel at the ACLU, said in a statement. \"We will continue to work with governors and state legislatures across the country for a fair, free, and open Internet.\"                 </p><p>          Yesterday's court decision makes it clear\u00a0the FCC overstepped when it added a directive in its 2018 resolution saying\u00a0the agency's decision would preempt state laws. The ruling could make it easier to pass net neutrality legislation in 29 states where such bills are pending.\u00a0California, which put its net neutrality law on hold\u00a0pending the outcome\u00a0of yesterday's trial, will now move forward with a court challenge from the Justice Department over whether its law conflicted with federal regulations.       </p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) also pushed for states to keep leading the open Internet fight. Oregon passed its own net neutrality law in 2018.</p><p>Author Tim Wu pointed out, however, that making California the face of net neutrality just adds\u00a0to the laundry list of tech issues the state seems to be tackling before Congress.\u00a0</p><p>Net neutrality could still see its day in Washington, however. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and Communications and Technology Committee Chairman Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) reiterated their call for the Senate to take up legislation to restore net neutrality - which has languished since passing the House in April.</p><p>             BYTES: Amazon sellers and former employees allege that Amazon's dual role as marketplace and retailer has allowed it to profit off sellers while directing sales to its own products,my colleague Jay Greene reports. Many of the sellers have shared their frustrations with the Federal Trade Commission, potentially serving as powerful evidence as federal regulators investigate the retail giant for potentially anti-competitive behavior</p><p>Amazon made $42.7 billion off seller services last year, more than double than what it brought in two years ago.

But the subcommittee has only\u00a0five attorneys and one staff assistant to sift through it all.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, says the small staff -- made up of three Democratic attorneys and two Republicans -- \"is doing the work of a staff three times that size.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"These are extraordinary individuals who are working very long hours to do this work,\" Cicilline said in a recent interview with The Technology 202.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The small staff underscores the David-and-Goliath nature of Washington's antitrust moment. Technology companies in the regulatory glare such as Facebook, Google and Amazon are funneling millions into lobbying efforts and snapping up antitrust experts to round out their internal teams. And Congress isn't even in the same ballpark in terms of its resources.          </p><p>As Cicilline's subcommittee races to compile a report on competition in the tech industry by the \"first part\" of 2020, he says he may need to request additional staff from House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). Its something he hasn't done yet.\u00a0</p><p>\"It may well be that I'll have to seek some additional support to complete the investigation,\" he told me.\u00a0</p><p>Lawmakers are receiving the reams of documents from tech companies after requests for sensitive records -- including top executives' private communications. The subcommittee in September requested Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google turn over \"detailed information about their internal operations, including financial data about their products and services, private discussions about potential merger targets and records related to 'any prior investigation' they have faced on competition grounds,\" my colleague Tony Romm reported at the time.\u00a0</p><p>Lawmakers are studying whether the companies are engaging in anti-competitive practices to secure dominance in search, advertising or e-commerce. The staffers are looking for signs the companies committed wrongdoing by swallowing up or discriminating against rivals -- and to what extent\u00a0the leaders participated in any bad behavior.\u00a0</p><p>To be sure, the\u00a0congressional probe is just one front in Big Tech's antitrust battle, as federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and Judiciary Department open their own investigations into technology companies. State attorneys general are also playing a key role, as dozens open probes into both Google and Facebook. \u00a0</p><p>But there are also questions about whether federal regulators have enough resources to take on Big Tech. Earlier this year, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hosted a hearing on the oversight and enforcement of antitrust law, where Makan Delrahim, the chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, repeatedly referred to the agency's resources as \"limited\" and \"constrained\" in written testimony.\u00a0</p><p>Some Democrats such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) think the government needs to devote more funding to these agencies, especially as the companies increase lobbying spending.</p><p>Facebook, Amazon and Apple are on pace to hit record-setting lobbying expenditures this year, according to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal. Google has been overhauling its Washington lobbying operation amid the fresh antitrust pressure,\u00a0as well.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: 8chan is back online. The message board known for boosting white supremacist and extremist content rebranded and is now operating under the name \"8kun,\"\u00a0my colleague Rachel Siegel reports.\u00a0</p><p>Site administrator Ron Watkins - the son of 8chan owner Jim Watkins - said rising traffic paired with cyberattacks caused some initial issues yesterday, and it wasn't immediately clear how many of 8chan's millions of users tried the service. But, he said, \"We are alive.\"</p><p>8chan faced scrutiny in Washington after the service was used\u00a0to announce attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand; a synagogue in Poway, Calif.; and a Walmart in El Paso. Suspected attackers have published screeds to 8chan's /pol/ subforum. Yesterday, Gizmodo\u00a0reported\u00a0that subforum was missing from 8kun.</p><p>The site\u00a0claims that anything deemed illegal in the U.S. will be removed. 8chan has struggled to stay online in recent months as web infrastructure companies have taken a stand against supporting the website. A British-based\u00a0provider of server hardware kicked 8Chan offline in August.\u00a0</p><p>\"We took a clear pledge in making the Internet a safer place for all, and we would continue to cut entire infrastructure for any party we identify as facilitating mass shootings and extreme hate speech with intolerable consequences,\" Maria Sirbu, an executive at Voxility, the tech firm that blocked 8chan from the computer servers that powered the site, said at the time.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Executives from the video app TikTok have declined to testify at a congressional hearing Tuesday exploring privacy and security concerns posed by Chinese technology,my colleagues Tony Romm and Drew Harwell report. Their refusal comes on top of mounting political scrutiny from Washington for the app's Chinese parent company, potentially giving U.S. social media companies struggling to come up with a competing product a big break.</p><p>TikTok's decision not to attend the hearing was confirmed by a source familiar with the matter who spoken on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it on the record, Tony and Drew report. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0</p><p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a cross-government group that reviews foreign transactions involving American firms, is\u00a0investigating the 2017 acquisition of American karaoke app Musical.ly, by Bytedance, TikTok's parent company, Drew and Tony reported Friday.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, American Internet companies including Facebook are struggling to compete with TikTok 's surge in popularity with U.S. teenagers, Jack Nicas at the New York Times reports. Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg called out TikTok's growing influence in the United States a potential threat against free speech and American values online in a speech last month, has flailed in its efforts to find a product that can compete with the rising Chinese giant. Facebook's Instagram and YouTube may also be working on competitors, Jack reports. Snap\u00a0has also started listing TikTok as a competitor on its investor filings.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Google is staying silent as rivals Facebook and Twitter publicly clash over how to handle political advertising,Jennifer Elias and Megan Graham at CNBC report.\u00a0</p><p>Google says on its website that it doesn't allow \"ads or destinations that intend to deceive users by excluding relevant information or giving misleading information about products, services, or businesses,\" CNBC reports. \u00a0Yet Google rakes in millions of dollars from the Trump campaign for advertising, including for the notorious ad targeting Joe Biden with false information that ignited criticism over Facebook's policies, they report. The Trump Make America Great Again Committee is Google's largest political advertiser, paying more than $8 million to the company, and the Trump campaign heavily advertises on YouTube.</p><p>A Google representative\u00a0declined to comment.</p><p>Twitter announced last week that it would cease all political advertising, sparking some criticism from advocacy groups and putting Facebook on the defensive\u00a0about its policy to not fact-check advertisements from politicians. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has argued it's not the platform's job to censor political speech, but critics say the company is giving politicians including President Trump a powerful tool to spread misinformation.</p><p>             -- A group of civil rights leaders\u00a0will meet with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and senior Facebook officials at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., this evening to discuss alleged\u00a0voter suppression and other civil-rights concerns on the platform leading up to the 2020 election.\u00a0The meeting comes as civil rights groups express renewed concerns\u00a0over\u00a0Facebook's handling of civil rights on its platform, especially in light of its policy to not fact-check ads from politicians.\u00a0</p><p>Representatives from\u00a0Muslim Advocates,\u00a0National Urban League, NAACP, NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law, will all be in attendance, according to news releases.\u00a0The\u00a0meeting will\u00a0likely touch on Facebook's ongoing civil rights audit, which the company committed to last year after extensive lobbying from some of the groups attending today's meeting.</p><p>             -- Accounts with ties to China, Russia and Iran have all directed thousands of tweets at President Trump's Twitter account - some of which he has\u00a0retweeted - according to asweeping investigation by the New York Times's Mike McIntire and Nicholas Confessore. Trump's habit of retweeting unverified accounts and conspiracy theorists could make the White House vulnerable to foreign manipulation, experts say.</p><p>Trump's constant exposure to social media gives users an \"amazing opportunity to game the president,\" former FBI agent and cybersecurity expert Clint Watts told the Times. \"You are very clearly capable of using Twitter to entice and influence this president,\" he said. \"You can distort the guy's views from your house.\"</p><p>State-sponsored accounts trying to attract the president's attention \"frequently promoted conspiracy theories or support for Mr. Trump's policies,\" making them hard to distinguish from authentic users, Mike and Nicholas report. One of the state-sponsored accounts retweeted by Trump wrote, \"We love you Mr. President!\"</p><p>Trump has retweeted at least 145 unverified accounts that push conspiracy or extremist content, more than two dozen of which have been suspended by Twitter, the Times found.</p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News about tech workforce and culture:          </p><p>Instacart Shoppers will be walking off the job through Tuesday\u00a0to protest a recent pay cut and ongoing labor disputes with management, according to an open letter to the company's founder and CEO Apoorva Mehta.\u00a0</p><p>\"Every year we push back as our pay spirals further down the drain, and Instacart's valuation swells by the billions, and your net worth skyrockets. When will enough be enough?\"\u00a0the workers wrote on Friday in an open letter signed by more than\u00a0200 Instacart shoppers. \"Because of your greed or inaction, or lack of concern, Shoppers now struggle to put food on the table and a roof over their families' heads.\"</p><p>Instacart workers have protested in previous years, most notably against the company's decision to use tips to subsidize wages. While the company ceased that practice under public pressure, shoppers say that the company has continued to tweak its compensation structure to disadvantage workers and lower wages.

As chairman of IAC, a tech holding company that encompasses brands such as Angie's List, Vimeo and Care.com, Diller has become intimately familiar with Big Tech. The chairman of Expedia says his businesses rely on companies such as Google for distribution to the screens of consumers around the world, but at times they also compete with these same companies.    Diller says Washington hasn't yet stepped up to regulate the tech industry, but he's confident that's changing. The Justice Department is expected to bring a landmark antitrust suit against Google as early as next week, and just yesterday the White House held a gathering with state attorneys general to discuss allegations of anti-conservative bias in the industry (which the tech giants have denied).   My colleague Rachel Lerman and I spoke with Diller recently about his views on tech regulation, and he specifically raised concerns about the search giant's dominance. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.   What kind of regulation would you want to see the government impose [on the tech industry]?  Google is a monopoly, without question. It\u2019s the only absolute monopoly. What Google has invested every day, year to improve their product on behalf of consumers is absolutely fantastic, and they have vast profits from that. However, they have gone beyond the line in all respects doing what monopolies do. Regulation must set a relatively level playing field, which mean s that the monopolist cannot compete against its advertisers, primarily, which is what it has been doing without question for several years now.  Are there specific examples of times that Google has acted anti-competitively toward companies in your portfolio?   There\u2019s no question. Expedia is in the travel business. Expedia spends between $4 [billion] and $5 billion a year advertising its services on Google. Fine, happy to do so. However, when Google has begun to compete with our services, which they have done because they targeted the travel vertical to get closer and closer to the transaction itself.    Google is essentially competing with our services while taking our money.   It's not only that we have to advertise, which advertising for clicks is our world. That's an acceptable path, but when Google continues to restrict our advertising in replacement for ads that are more remunerative to Google, that's a problem.    I\u2019ll give you another example. We have a company called Home Advisor. Google decided it would open up the vertical of home services and asked us to be a founding member. However, all the data belongs to them and they would not let us literally advertise the name \u201cAngie Home Advisor\u201d inside that service because they did not want to allow another brand other than Google to have prominence.   What about this interesting relationship that companies like yours have with Google where they thrive on advertising on Google, but also sort of have this competition with Google. What would you like to see [Google] look like?  I don\u2019t want the person I\u2019m spending billions of dollars with to compete directly against me. I want them to take my advertising money and give me the best return for it.    As I\u2019ve said to most senior leaders at Google, \u201cWe all are serfs in your universe, in your land. We\u2019re serfs on your property. But it\u2019s wise to treat your serfs well, which i think you are increasingly not doing. Because if you let that go on for too long, the serfs tend to rise up and attack in hordes.\u201d  When you think about that relationship where you\u2019re relying on that platform and also competing with it, do you have that concern with Apple as well?   Yes. We have huge concerns with Apple and their App Store 30 percent hostage payment that they\u2019re demanding from anybody who accesses their service. They\u2019re a distribution platform where you access the App Store and download the app for which they provide some small services.    Take our Match dating services. I think we pay between $400 [million] and 500 million a year to download the app through the App Store. There's nobody who pays this 30 percent tribute that does not believe it's absolutely egregious.   [Apple did not comment on Diller's remarks, but the company has said the App Store required a \u201ctremendous investment over a decade\u201d to build and run.]  What would you like to see Apple do?   What Apple should do is stop their absolute policy of 30 percent, and they should reduce it to a reasonable distribution fee. Nobody in the world thinks paying 30 percent to simply be listed in an App Store is fair trade.   Apple is so misguided to me. Apple has a good relationship and imagery everywhere. I think they endanger it by this continued obstinance on this particular policy. It would be wise to reconsider.  Our top tabs TikTok is asking a federal court to halt Trump's ban of the app.   The move suggests TikTok and the Trump administration may not reach a deal this week, Rachel Lerman reports . TikTok is racing to finalize a deal by Sunday, the date that the ban is set to go into place. Trump has said he won't make a deal if TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance is still involved with the company, but it seems unlikely that Beijing would consent to a deal that cuts out the Chinese owner.   The Justice Department already countered that the emergency stay is unnecessary because only downloads of the app and updates will be banned at that time.     The White House has expressed concerns TikTok's Chinese ownership would allow the Chinese government to compel it to share U.S. user data. TikTok says it has never been asked by China for U.S. user data and would decline to provide it if asked. In the company's filing yesterday, its global chief security officer added it has safeguards in place against any large unauthorized downloads.   A coalition of WeChat users, another Chinese-owned app, recently won a court injunction on Trump's proposed ban.  The White House is looking at \u2018concrete legal steps\u2019 against social media companies allegedly silencing conservatives.   The threat ratchets up the president's ongoing attacks against platforms that have increasingly sought to limit his controversial and potentially violence-inciting posts, Tony Romm reports .    Trump called on nine Republican state attorneys general in attendance at his remarks yesterday to launch their own investigations into political bias against conservatives.    \u201cThe concern we have is the large amount of anecdotal evidence that supports the idea some of these private companies may be treating certain groups differently,\u201d Alan Wilson, the Republican attorney general of South Carolina, said after the gathering. He said the focus of the event, which was partially closed to the public, was on the state's roles  in combating alleged political bias.   The president has long accused Facebook, Twitter and Google of being biased against conservative content, though he's provided little evidence to support the claim. The companies have denied the allegations by Trump and other high-ranking Republicans.   Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was also in attendance:  Researchers say Facebook content inciting violence and praising the suspected shooter in Kenosha, Wis., is still getting millions of views.  Facebook committed to take steps to remove content explicitly linked to militia and extremist movements in recent months. But researchers at global nonprofit Avaaz found dozens of pages still sharing content inciting violence or glorifying Kyle Rittenhouse, a self-identified militia member suspected of killing two people at a protest in Kenosha, Wis.   The shooting came after Facebook failed earlier in the day to remove an event calling for armed people to \u201cprotect\u201d citizens during the protests.    As of yesterday, Facebook had removed four pages and two of the groups flagged by Avaaz. The remaining 71 groups and pages boast more than a combined 25 million interactions since the beginning of the month.    Facebook is still reviewing the content, spokesperson Sarah Pollack said.   But Facebook's reactive approach isn't getting to the heart of the problem and addressing what happens once users are radicalized by the content, Avaaz campaign director Fadi Quran said. Instead, such activity just moves to new groups and pages. Just this week, Avaaz found a post featuring an image of Rittenhouse with a caption calling for a violent civil war over Trump's nomination for a new justice to the Supreme Court.    (Facebook confirmed the post was removed last night.)   It's an issue that's likely to be front and center as members of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection meet today to discuss the effects of social media platforms on Americans.   Republicans are preparing to reignite accusations of anti-conservative bias at the event.    \u201cIs Twitter a fair and safe platform free speech and the battle of ideas \u2026 or a platform where content bias is acceptable as long as it influences the election in favor of the political whims of the woke mob?\u201d Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, will say in opening the hearing.    She will point to examples of Republicans being doxed and harassed on the platform.  Rant and rave  Twitter will begin testing voice DMs in Brazil, the Verge reports . \u201cDo they even care what users want anymore?\u201d the Internet wondered.   Tony Romm:   And then there's the whole harassment issue. Researcher Jane Manchun Wong:   Gen magazine's Andrea Gonz\u00e1lez-Ram\u00edrez found a silver lining.  The digital race to 2020 YouTube will add information panels to videos about voting by mail.  The company has used a similar strategy to provide context for subjects ripe for misinformation, such the moon landing and the novel coronavirus, according to a blog post from YouTube's parent company Google . Any videos that discuss mail voting will have an information panel underneath directing viewers to information from the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank.   Information panels will also show up for queries on how to vote and about specific candidates.   YouTube, like Facebook and Twitter, will also start pushing reminders about how to register to vote and how to volunteer at the polls   More digital campaign news:  Inside the industry Tesla is suing the U.S. government over a Trump tariff on parts from China.   The electric-car maker is seeking a refund with interest on the parts subjected to additional tariffs by Trump in 2018 and 2019, CNBC reports . Tesla's lawyers are arguing the U.S. Trade Representative did not provide a meaningful opportunity for outside comment before the decision was made and failed to consider relevant factors when making its decision.\u201d   Tesla was granted several waivers to the tariffs on some parts, but not the car's computer and screen.

But early Super Tuesday election tallies show their neighbors feel differently.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          The Vermont senator's lead as of this morning in the California primary was bolstered by many Bay Area counties that are home to major tech companies and tech workers. He either won or had a lead in San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and Alameda counties, according to The Washington Post             's election tracker this morning.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             It now seems likely that employees at some of the major companies Sanders has attacked on the campaign trail are contributing to his success. There's a growing divide between tech executives and rank-and-file employees who support the self-described Democratic socialist, said Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents Silicon Valley and serves as Sanders's campaign co-chair.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          \"Look, most of the executives do not want Bernie Sanders,\" Khanna told me in a recent interview. \"But what surprised me is that there are hundreds of employees at Google, at Apple and at Facebook who are Bernie's supporters.\"       </p><p>             It may seem counterintuitive that Sanders's crusade against billionaires and corporate power would resonate so strongly in the cradle of some of the world's most powerful companies. But skyrocketing costs of living in the region are hitting all Bay Area residents.\u00a0          </p><p>          Khanna said many tech workers - even at major companies known for lofty salaries - are feeling financial stress and finding that Sanders's policies resonate with them. \"They're part of an anxious middle class,\" Khanna said. \"Because being part of the anxious middle class in Silicon Valley is you can be making $100,000 or $150,000, as hard as it is to believe, and still be very anxious given the costs of housing, the cost of education and costs of health care in our area.\"\u00a0       </p><p>          \"I think that what appeals to them [about Sanders] is they have health care bills, and they have kids who want to go to college,\" Khanna added. \"They recognize the rising cost of housing.\"\u00a0       </p><p>             Sanders has been trying to speak directly to those anxieties on the campaign trail             -             even the local housing crisis. Last year, he criticized Apple after it pledged $2.5 billion to address the California housing crisis. He argued that the company helped create the crisis while raking in taxpayer subsidies and for not paying enough in taxes.\u00a0       </p><p>          The senator has also campaigned on Medicare-for-all, a           single-payer, national health insurance program that would expand health care coverage to all Americans. He supports providing free college, as well as wiping out\u00a0 $1.6 trillion in existing student loan debt.\u00a0       </p><p>             There's data that shows these policies are popular among tech industry workers. Sanders received the most in donations, from the highest number of individuals of any presidential candidate among employees of Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, Uber, Tesla and SpaceX, Oracle and Microsoft, according to a recent analysis of recent Federal Election Commission filings by The Guardian's Julia Carrie Wong.\u00a0</p><p>             But despite that support, he's             no friend of Big Tech             . A Sanders presidency would almost certainly result in greater antitrust scrutiny of the tech giants. He said at a Washington Post Live event last year that a Sanders administration would \"absolutely\" have a Justice Department that would seek to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon.\u00a0       </p><p>          And his tax plans - especially his recent proposal to increase taxes on some start-up employees - have Silicon Valley venture capitalists worried.\u00a0       </p><p>          Of course, Sanders's lead in California was largely overshadowed by former vice president Joe Biden's sweep of the South, as he threatens to outpace Sanders among delegates. Biden's next test in Silicon Valley will be             whether             he's able to win over some of the tech executives and investors who had previously supported other moderate Democratic candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg, Sen.             Kamala D. Harris             (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.).                     Bloomberg's lackluster performance on Super Tuesday could also lead some venture capitalists and tech executives to reconsider which candidate they're supporting.       </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: An Amazon employee in Seattle tested positive for the coronavirus as concerns escalated over its spread in the United States,CNBC's Todd Haselton reports. The employee worked in one of the e-commerce giant's Seattle office buildings.\u00a0       </p><p>              We're supporting the affected employee who is in quarantine,\" the company told CNBC. \"The employee is based out of Amazon's Brazil office building in Seattle, WA.\"\u00a0       </p><p>          The company notified employees of the diagnosis in a memo, saying, \"The employee went home feeling unwell on Tuesday, February 25 and has not entered Amazon offices since that time.\"       </p><p>          \"We notified the employees who we know were in close contact with this employee,\" the memo said, per CNBC. \"The risk of transmission for employees who were not in close contact with this individual is assessed to be low.\"\u00a0       </p><p>Amazon encouraged other employees experiencing symptoms to stay home and seek medical attention. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also owns The Post. The virus's spread has been particularly acute in Washington state, as well as Silicon Valley's Santa Clara County, according to my colleagues.\u00a0       </p><p>Facebook, Google and Apple, announced several protective measures, canceling employee travel and events involving large gatherings, increasing office cleaning and asking employees to work remotely. Twitter became the first major technology company in the United States to advise employees to work from home earlier this week.       </p><p>             NIBBLES: The Texas secretary of state's office warned voters yesterday not to fall for robocalls trying to spread misinformation about the state's primary. An undisclosed number of calls tried to con voters into thinking voting was scheduled for Wednesday, not Tuesday             , Merritt Enright, Ben Collins and Matthew Mulligan at NBC News             reported.          </p><p>The Secretary of State's office made clear on its Twitter account that Tuesday was voting day for all voters.</p><p>Claire Barnett, a Democratic candidate for Texas State House District 122, received one of the fraudulent calls on her way out of a polling station. \"It was a local number in San Antonio. (The call) seemed designed to suppress the vote,\" she told NBC News.\u00a0</p><p>Other recipients reported a similar phone call in Spanish and from a different Texas area code. It's unclear whether the two were related.</p><p>Authorities were \"proactive\" in addressing the calls, Stephen Chang, director of communications for Secretary of State Ruth Hughs told NBC News, but did not specify what was being done.</p><p>             BYTES: There are new efforts underway in Washington to hold social media titans accountable for content that harms or abuses children,\u00a0             my colleague Tony Romm reports             . Lawmakers and Justice Department officials are preparing to unveil proposals that could escalate the battle over a decades-old law that protects tech platforms from liability for content on their services.\u00a0          </p><p>Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) could release legislation as soon as today that, if passed, would set up a commission at the Justice Department to craft a set of voluntary guidelines for tech companies to follow to combat child sexual exploitation, according to a copy of the measure obtained by The Post.\u00a0</p><p>But without adopting them, companies would lose legal protections, opening the door for the government to hold Silicon Valley directly accountable for facilitating child sexual exploitation, experts told Tony.</p><p>Meanwhile, Justice Department officials are set to unveil 11 \"voluntary principles\" tomorrow that target child sexual exploitation, Tony reports. The agency and Facebook are clashing over the company's plans to expand its encrypted services - something law enforcement argues will make it harder to detect child abuse online.</p><p>Facebook expressed concerns that Blumenthal and Graham's \"EARN IT Act\" would give the Justice Department ammo in its quest to stop Facebook's plans for encryption.</p><p>\"We're concerned the EARN IT Act may be used to roll back encryption, which protects everyone's safety from hackers and criminals, and may limit the ability of American companies to provide the private and secure services that people expect,\" Facebook spokesman Thomas Richards said in a statement.</p><p>- Telecommunications companies\u00a0AT&amp;T, Verizon and Juniper wrote to Senate Commerce Committee members in support of             the Utilizing Strategic Allied (USA) Telecommunications Act             ahead of a hearing on 5G supply-chain security today. The bipartisan legislation would provide\u00a0more than $1 billion to invest in Western-based alternatives to Chinese equipment providers Huawei and ZTE.          </p><p>\"Promoting leadership and innovation by telecommunications and networking suppliers in the U.S. and Europe is a critical part of the effort to maintain a secure and trusted global 5G supply chain,\" Verizon's Robert Fisher and AT&amp;T's Tim McKone wrote. \"[This act] would foster U.S. innovation in the race for 5G, help shape global 5G network deployments, and drive the adoption of more secure network infrastructure.\"</p><p>             -,              Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, is             urging Vice President Pence             to create a website that combats disinformation about the coronavirus. The letter comes in response to an unreleased State Department report that identified 2 million tweets peddling coronavirus conspiracy theories, first reported by my colleague Tony Romm.       </p><p>- Election year politics could drive lawmakers and President Trump to pass privacy and antitrust legislation, predicts Bruce Mehlman, who previously worked on tech policy in the George W. Bush administration. Mehlman said both House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Trump will need to show they're getting things done to succeed in the 2020 elections.\u00a0          </p><p>\"The conventional wisdom is, 'after impeachment, they can't negotiate anything together,' \" Mehlman said on Technology Policy Institute's\u00a0Two Think Minimum podcast. \"But reality is that the fourth year [of a presidency] has always seen more legislation than the third.\"\u00a0</p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Facebook may be retooling its Libra cryptocurrency project to woo reluctant global regulators,\u00a0             Joe Light, Benjamin Bain and Olga Kharif at Bloomberg News report             . The Facebook-led digital currency consortium stalled under scrutiny from regulators in the United States and abroad who worry the social media giant's foray into finance could destabilize bank-backed currencies.\u00a0          </p><p>The new plan could reimagine Libra as a payment network that uses multiple currencies, including the U.S. dollar or euro. A pivot toward a payment network, rather than a single cryptocurrency, could ease some regulatory pressures. But it could also make it harder for Facebook to differentiate Libra from service providers such as PayPal.</p><p>Members of Libra denied reports it was scrapping plans for a currency.</p><p>\"The Libra Association has not altered its goal of building a regulatory compliant global payment network, and the basic design principles that support that goal have not been changed,\" Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, said in a statement to Bloomberg.</p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Today:          </p><p>             -Coming up:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-d2182bab3a684cf2bc1ef18fef77656a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBS-NRV1-JB4M-V22V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2054\"/><timeReceived>2:24 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 4, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Bernie Sanders's narrow             victory in New Hampshire             means there will be even more attention paid to his calls to rein in corporate power and billionaire advantages in what he decries as a rigged system.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \u00a0And his message should worry Silicon Valley elites.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The senator from Vermont's top target in the industry is already going on the defensive: Amazon spokesman Jay Carney wrote an op-ed in the New York Times earlier this week titled \"Why Bernie Sanders Praised Amazon.\"\u00a0The e-commerce giant's decision to respond to Sanders's long-running criticisms shows they're taking the senator's threats more seriously as Sanders becomes the putative front-runner in the Democratic primary.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Carney recounted a call he had with the self-described Democratic socialist shortly after the company hiked its minimum wage for workers to $15 per hour following intense public pressure. Carney urged critics to acknowledge: \"When it comes to creating jobs, raising wages, providing benefits and training employees for higher-paying jobs, Amazon is doing many good things - for the economy, and for American workers.\" (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Some tech investors, too, are concerned about Sanders's economic message, though they've largely been quiet publicly even as he touts policies such a wealth tax. Hunter Walk, a partner at Homebrew has supported Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg per campaign finance records, said he has his doubts about Sanders.</p><p>\"From an economic point of view, I'm a believer in fair markets with a citizen safety net strung below including health care, job training and such. Sanders has seemed to suggest that he's skeptical of market-based economies in general, so that concerns me.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Here are some of Sanders's             tech-specific policy positions that could spell trouble for the industry:          </p><p>- The senator would \"absolutely\" try to break up Big Tech.          </p><p>Sanders said at a Washington Post Live event earlier this year that Facebook has \"incredible power over the economy, over the political life of this country in a very dangerous sense.\" He also said Amazon is \"moving very rapidly to be a monopoly.\"</p><p>\"I think we need vigorous antitrust legislation in this country because you are seeing - you name the area, whether it's pharmaceuticals, whether it is Wall Street, whether it is high tech - fewer and fewer gigantic corporation owning those sectors.\"\u00a0</p><p>He also said he would appoint an attorney general who \"would break up these huge corporations.\"</p><p>- Sanders is homing in on the industry's prized legal shield.          </p><p>Sanders has signaled he would take a close look at Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants tech companies legal immunity for the content people post on their platforms. He told Vox.com the companies \"should not be shielded from responsibility when they knowingly allow content on their platforms that promotes and facilitates violence.\" He indicated it's time to reevaluate the provision to address the proliferation of hate speech online.</p><p>\"Section 230 was written well before the current era of online communities, expression, and technological development, so [I] will work with experts and advocates to ensure that these large, profitable corporations are held responsible when dangerous activity occurs on their watch, while protecting the fundamental right of free speech in this country and making sure right-wing groups don't abuse regulation to advance their agenda.\"</p><p>             \u00a0- He's scrutinizing working conditions at major e-commerce companies such as Amazon.          </p><p>Sanders has long advocated for better treatment of workers at these companies, and he was among a group of senators who recently wrote a letter to Bezos criticizing the e-commerce giant's safety record as \"dismal.\" The letter cited recent media reports chronicling workplace injuries.\u00a0</p><p>\"We urge you to overhaul this profit-at-all-costs culture and take the immediate steps identified in this letter to ensure Amazon's managers treat your workers fairly and do not require them to risk their own health and safety in the course of doing their jobs,\" the senators wrote.\u00a0</p><p>- Sanders brings a critical eye to tech companies' tax payments.          </p><p>The senator has criticized Amazon and Netflix for paying $0 in taxes in 2018 under President Trump's tax law. But more moderate Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden, have embraced this criticism on the campaign trail.\u00a0</p><p>Amazon has pushed back, noting that it pays every penny it owes and that the problem is with the law, not the company itself.\u00a0</p><p>- The senator is challenging the gig economy, supporting a law that could force companies to reclassify their contractors.\u00a0          </p><p>Sanders supported AB5, a California law that seeks to compel companies like Uber, Lyft and Postmates to treat workers who meet certain requirements as employees. The senator said gig economy workers are \"being denied basic workplace protections and a fighting chance to obtain higher wages.\" He accused employers of deliberately misclassifying workers as contractors so they didn't have to comply with basic labor protections.\u00a0</p><p>\"A slick app may enrich tech companies and their CEOs, but that doesn't mean those CEOs have a right to rip off their employees,\" Sanders wrote in a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed last year.\u00a0</p><p>Sanders continues to enjoy some financial support among rank-and-file Silicon Valley employees. Vox.com reports he's raising more money from employees at large tech companies than any other 2020 presidential candidate. Meanwhile, many of the high-level, executive donors are throwing their support behind Buttigieg.</p><p>Even though some Silicon Valley\u00a0people concerned about Sanders's economic policies, they view him as a better alternative to Trump. \"I'm going to fall in line and enthusiastically support whomever emerges as the Democratic nominee,\" Walk said.\u00a0</p><p>Sanders's \"genuine concern for citizens, even if it involves policy approaches I might not always agree with, is still unquestionably better than Trump's bigoted kleptocracy,\" Walk added.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang dropped out of the presidential race after a disappointing showing in New Hampshire last night,             my colleagues David Weigel and           Amy B Wang             reported             .                     Yang's campaign emphasized the threat of automation to American jobs, and he consistently put a spotlight on emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, on the debate stage.       </p><p>          Yang's signature policy was a form of a monthly $1,000 \"Freedom Dividend,\" a proposal based on the concept of Universal Basic Income that some Silicon Valley figures have embraced. Yang garnered support from tech industry titans such as Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey.       </p><p>          Reddit co-founder and investor Alexis Ohanian, a proponent of UBI, tweeted that Yang had \"a good run.\"\u00a0</p><p>          The entrepreneur's unlikely run was bolstered by a strong online following of supporters, who took on the moniker #YangGang.           Yang has yet to endorse another candidate.       </p><p>             NIBBLES: The Federal Trade Commission announced it will review past acquisitions by Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft to examine whether they may have violated antitrust laws,             my colleague Tony Romm reported             . The new effort will force the companies to hand over a trove of information about how they have gobbled up rivals over the past decade and what data they gained from the deals.          </p><p>Records about the acquisitions, many of which were below the threshold that merits government inspection, could guide the FTC's thinking as it evaluates concerns about anti-competitive practices in the technology industry.</p><p>\"All of our options are on the table,\" FTC Chairman Joseph J. Simons said yesterday. That could include \"unwinding\" anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions. It could also spark investigations, shape tougher punishments or prompt the commission to seek greater enforcement powers from Congress, Tony reports.\u00a0</p><p>Justice Department officials have also launched a wide-ranging probe into dominant tech companies. Officials will be in Palo Alto, Calif., today for an antitrust workshop with venture capitalists. The House antitrust subcommittee is also probing the competitive practices of tech companies.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: The Chinese telecommunications company Huawei covertly maintained access to mobile phone networks through           \"             backdoors          \"             meant exclusively for law enforcement, U.S. officials say, according to             Bojan Pancevski at the Wall Street Journal             . That's the most serious and specific charge U.S. officials have leveled against the Chinese company, which they're trying to restrict from the next generation of super-fast wireless networks known as 5G.\u00a0       </p><p>          Officials declined to say whether the United States observed Huawei using this access, but they said classified intelligence shows it has had the capability to do so since at least 2009. The company also failed to disclose that access to customers or to intelligence services in nations where it operates, officials told Bojan.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"We have evidence that Huawei has the capability secretly to access sensitive and personal information in systems it maintains and sells around the world,\" national security adviser Robert O'Brien said.       </p><p>Huawei denied the story, saying that it \"has never and will never do anything that would compromise or endanger the security of networks and data of its clients.\"\u00a0</p><p>          Washington privately shopped the classified intelligence to allies for months as it ramped up efforts to convince other nations to ban Huawei from their 5G networks.       </p><p>          Some privacy advocates, meanwhile, pointed to the story as evidence that law enforcement backdoors into technology can be exploited far too easily by criminals or other nations - a dig at the Justice Department, which is pushing for similar special access to encrypted communications.\u00a0</p><p>          Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation:       </p><p>             -- Social media companies are getting more aggressive at taking down             Iran-backed information             operations             aimed at swaying public opinion in the United States and abroad. Now it's the U.S. government's turn to step up, says             a new report out today             .          </p><p>\"In January 2017, the Official of the National Director of Intelligence attributed a significant foreign influence operation to Russia. In nearly three years since, dozens more disinformation campaigns have been publicly identified and attributed - but only by corporations like Facebook, Google, and Twitter,\" the report's authors write. \"U.S. intelligence services should work with social media companies to attribute future foreign influence operations.\"</p><p>The report comes as Facebook and Twitter announced today that they took down a number of accounts linked to Iran, my colleague Tony Romm reports.\u00a0</p><p>          The report urges the Department of Homeland Security to create an intergovernmental agency that would attribute and publicize foreign influence operations. It's the kind of naming-and-shaming that American intelligence agencies have shied away from when it comes to cyberattacks. But the transparency could help demystify Iran's ongoing information warfare campaign against the United States, which has taken on new meaning in a time of extreme political tensions between the United States and Iran.       </p><p>          \"This U.S. government has struggled profoundly to come up with a coordinated response to these threats,\" Emerson T. Brooking, resident fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council and co-author of the report, told our researcher Tonya Riley. \"The stakes are too high for these kinds of attributions to be left to the private sector alone.\"\u00a0</p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             -- Twitter\u00a0             released its plan             to tackle misinformation about the 2020 Census today, months after lawmakers wrote to the social media giant asking it to elaborate on how it would address the issue. Twitter already bans misleading information about civic events, including the census and elections. It's now taking those efforts a step further with a new tool that prompts users searching for information on the census with a link to the official census site.</p><p>Users can also use a reporting feature the company introduced last month to streamline the reporting of election misinformation to flag census misinformation.</p><p>             - More news from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Coming up:          </p><p>The Washington Post's Geoffrey A.

Collins (Ga.), the House Judiciary Committee's top Republican, to grant publishers a four-year safe harbor from antitrust laws so they can get better content licensing or revenue sharing deals with the tech platforms.\u00a0</p><p>\"It grows out of a recognition that we need to do something to give local media, local news publishers the ability to survive,\" Cicilline said of the legislation at a recent Post Live event.</p><p>             The House panel's decision to focus on the tech industry's threat to local news in its first hearing about Silicon Valley's impact on competition signals that lawmakers are striking a bipartisan tone as they begin to probe Big Tech's power.\u00a0Even at a time when large national media companies like CNN are under unprecedented attacks from the Trump administration, Republicans and Democrats are signaling they're willing to work together to protect local news.\u00a0</p><p>Kevin Riley, the editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution who will also testify today, says he has faith that lawmakers will realize the future of news shouldn't be an issue divided by party lines.\u00a0</p><p>\"I'm really hoping what people can see that this is not a partisan issue,\" Riley told me. \"Politicians tend to complain about the media, but they tend to like their local media.\"\u00a0</p><p>But while lawmakers from both parties appear to be in agreement that it's time to protect local news, key stakeholders will not be at today's hearing. No tech companies are on the witness list.\u00a0Other witnesses include Public Knowledge president Gene Kimmelman, Open Markets Institute director of enforcement strategy Sally Hubbard, Computer and Communications Industry Association vice president of law and policy Matthew Schruers and News Corp general counsel David Pitofsky.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection says photos of travelers were compromised in a \"malicious cyberattack,\"\u00a0my colleagues Drew Harwell and Geoffrey A. Fowler\u00a0reported yesterday. The images were exposed during an attack on a\u00a0federal subcontractor.       </p><p>          The agency says the images included license plates and faces. CBP captures vehicle photos at border crossings and airports, and it is currently expanding a facial recognition program at airports that monitors the identities of people coming and going from the country. The agency says fewer than 100,000 people were impacted and that no other identifying information -- including passports or other travel documentation -- was impacted.\u00a0       </p><p>          Lawmakers are demanding answers from the agency, especially as worries mount on Capitol Hill about the government's increasing use of facial recognition technology.\u00a0\"This data breach raises serious concerns about the Department of Homeland Security's ability to effectively safeguard the sensitive information it is collecting,\"\u00a0said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), top Democrat on the security subcommittee of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\u00a0\"It only underscores the urgent need for the Department of Homeland Security to pause its deployment of facial recognition technology until it has instituted enforceable rules prioritizing cybersecurity and protecting travelers' privacy.\"\u00a0</p><p>Top Democrats in the House shared his concerns.\u00a0\"Government use of biometric and personal identifiable information can be valuable tools only if utilized properly. Unfortunately, this is the second major privacy breach at DHS this year,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security. Thompson said he intends to hold hearings on DHS's use of biometric information next month.       </p><p>          So far, none of the images in the database have shown up on the \"dark web,\" according to a CBP statement.\u00a0CBP disclosed the breach just hours after Geoffrey           wrote in a column           detailing the growing use of facial recognition at U.S. airports -- and the privacy tradeoffs that arise when people opt to use their faces as their boarding passes.\u00a0\u00a0       </p><p>             NIBBLES: Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg tried to reach out to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to discuss how his company is responding to misinformation, but Pelosi hasn't returned his calls,\u00a0my colleagues Robert Costa and Elizabeth Dwoskin report.\u00a0</p><p>Pelosi's cold shoulder highlights how frustrated she is with Facebook's decision to not remove an altered video, which was manipulated to slow down Pelosi's speech to make her appear drunk, according to people familiar with the exchanges who were not authorized to speak publicly.\u00a0\"According to the people familiar the matter, Pelosi has not been eager to hear Zuckerberg's explanation for the company's actions,\" my colleagues wrote.\u00a0</p><p>Pelosi signaled her frustration with the company last month as she stepped up her attacks on Facebook, calling the company \"willing enablers\" of the Russian operation to influence the 2016 election.\u00a0</p><p>The tension between the country's top Democrat and one of the world's most powerful businessmen highlights the broader strain between Facebook and the Democratic party.

Facebook declined to comment.</p><p>             BYTES:\u00a0President Trump escalated his attacks on Silicon Valley during aninterviewwith CNBC yesterday -- suggesting \"there is something going on in terms of monopoly\" when asked about the giants' concentrated power. The president did not specify how he thinks regulators in the U.S. should address that potential monopoly power -- but he did have plenty of criticism for European regulators who he suggested\u00a0have been profiting off multibillion-dollar fines against American tech companies in recent years.       </p><p>          \"They get all this money. We should be doing that - they're our companies, so they're actually attacking our companies. But we should be doing what they're doing,\" the president told CNBC host Joe Kernen.       </p><p>          Trump criticized E.U. regulators for going after \"easy money\" by suing Apple and other tech giants. The bloc slapped Apple with a $15 billion fine related to illegal tax benefits in 2015, and it hit Google with several multibillion-dollar fines in relation to antitrust violations.          </p><p>          Trump did not elaborate on what complaints the U.S. might bring against American tech companies but suggested that U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr would \"look at it differently\" from\u00a0E.U. regulators.       </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             -- Users searching for the \"Mueller Report\" yesterday morning found an information box calling the 448-page investigation\u00a0\"fiction,\"my colleague Drew\u00a0reports. The search error was fixed by 1 p.m., but Google did not offer an explanation as to why the result had appeared or how many users saw the result.\u00a0       </p><p>Google surfaced the \"fiction\" classification in an information box that is powered by the company's \"Knowledge Graph,\" which pulls live information from a number of sources across the Web. It's challenging to know how the error originated because the Knowledge Graph pulls from a variety of changing sources - including news reports and Wikipedia pages. The Wikipedia page for the Mueller document refers to it as an official report, Drew noted.       </p><p>          This isn't the first time that Google's Knowledge Graph has been criticized for surfacing false or misleading information to users. Google spokeswoman Lara Levin said in a statement to The Post: \"The Knowledge Graph is our systems' understanding of the people, places and things in the world. While we strive to always present accurate information, errors can occur. When we're made aware of inaccuracies, we work to fix them quickly.\"       </p><p>Critics on social media slammed the company's response as insufficient.

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) will introduce legislation this morning that would overhaul a key legal provision that grants tech companies broad immunity for the content people post on their platforms.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It would only allow companies to keep that immunity granted under\u00a0Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act if they submit to an external audit by the Federal Trade Commission that\u00a0\"proves by clear and convincing evidence that their algorithms and content-removal practices are politically neutral,\" his office said in a news release.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"With Section 230, tech companies get a sweetheart deal that no other industry enjoys: complete exemption from traditional publisher liability in exchange for providing a forum free of political censorship,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, big tech has failed to hold up its end of the bargain.\"</p><p>             Hawley's bill sets the stage for a showdown with Silicon Valley tech companies who view this\u00a0immunity as critical to their businesses and have largely defended Section 230\u00a0against any changes in Washington. It's also the first concrete attempt to change the law specifically because of\u00a0charges from President Trump and prominent Republicans that tech companies are unfairly silencing conservative voices on the platform.\u00a0          </p><p>             Technology companies were immediately on the defensive,\u00a0warning that such changes\u00a0could hinder their ability to moderate harmful content, such as\u00a0hate speech, extremism\u00a0or harassment.\u00a0</p><p>The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google and Twitter, noted that Section 230 is also the provision that protects the companies from liability for decisions they make to remove content they view as objectionable.\u00a0</p><p>\"This bill forces platforms to make an impossible choice: either host reprehensible, but First Amendment protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism,\" Internet Association president and chief executive Michael Beckerman said in a statement. \"That shouldn't be a tradeoff.\"</p><p>And the Silicon Valley companies have long denied that their actions or algorithms are politically motivated - and there is no evidence that they have made decisions systematically in favor of one political party or another.</p><p>\"Internet companies share Senator Hawley's goal of ensuring online platforms are somewhere individuals can freely and safely share their views,\" Beckerman said.\u00a0</p><p>Hawley's bill, called\u00a0the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, clearly targets Silicon Valley's largest companies. It only applies to companies that have 30 million active monthly users in the U.S., more than 300 million active monthly users worldwide or who have more than $500 million in global annual revenue.</p><p>Companies of this size would have to prove to the FTC that they're politically neutral, and they would only be granted legal immunity under a supermajority vote by the commissioners. The companies would be responsible for the costs of the audits, and they would be required to conduct such audits every two years.\u00a0</p><p>Some critics are wary that the bill could set the stage for the government to play an outsized role in policing speech online. Americans for Prosperity, the main political arm of the conservative Koch network, called lawmakers to reject Hawley's proposal.</p><p>\"Senator Hawley's misguided legislation sets the table for stricter government control over free expression online,\" said Billy Easley, a policy analyst for\u00a0Americans for Prosperity. \"Eroding the crucial protections that exist under Section 230 creates a scenario where government has the ability to police your speech and determine what you can or cannot say online.\"</p><p>Hawley's legislation comes as Democrats are also setting their sights on Section 230 - but for very different reasons. There's a growing push for debate over whether the law should be changed to ensure the companies are taking greater responsibility for disinformation and other content on their sites.</p><p>Earlier this week, Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) suggested it might be time to debate the future of Section 230 as the U.S. confronts new disinformation threats, like deepfakes, or videos manipulated with artificial intelligence to make it appear someone is doing something that never happened. \u00a0</p><p>\"I think we should have a debate in this area,\" Warner said at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this week.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Regulators at home and abroad are scrutinizing Facebook's new cryptocurrency project, known as Libra.\u00a0One top Democrat wants Facebook to put the project on hold until regulators and Congress have a chance to review the company's plans.          </p><p>          \"With the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users,\" House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said in a Tuesday statement.       </p><p>          She also called on Facebook executives to testify in front of her committee about the project. There's bipartisan interest in calling a hearing.\u00a0Rep. Patrick T.

That's up almost 17 percent from the previous year,\u00a0when it spent more on federal lobbying than any other company. Amazon spent\u00a0$14.2 million, Facebook spent $12.6 million, Microsoft $9.5 million and Apple\u00a0$6.6 million.\u00a0Their disclosures, released ahead of a midnight deadline, showed the Big Five\u00a0invested to sway the Washington debate\u00a0on a wide range of policy issues, ranging from privacy to election security to antitrust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             This\u00a0drastic increase in lobbying cash\u00a0could prove a\u00a0formidable hurdle to advocates and privacy hawks in Congress trying\u00a0to pass a tough federal privacy bill.\u00a0Lawmakers are insisting that 2019 will be\u00a0the year they\u00a0finally pass a national\u00a0framework --\u00a0and privacy advocates are increasingly\u00a0concerned that\u00a0tech companies' well-funded lobbying machine could outweigh consumers' voices on Capitol Hill.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"The big concern is that the lobbying influence will result in a debate focusing on the wrong questions,\" said ACLU senior legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani. \"The central question should be, 'What is good for consumers?'\"</p><p>             The eye-popping sum comes as the tech companies find themselves clashing with Washington more than ever.\u00a0Lawmakers and regulators have been sounding the alarm about companies' lax data practices and the misuse of consumer information by third parties since the public learned of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal,\u00a0in which a political consulting firm that did work for the Trump campaign used people's data without proper permission.\u00a0They're also scrutinizing whether the companies have done enough to crackdown on disinformation campaigns after Russia used social media platforms to spread fake news and information\u00a0during the 2016 campaign.\u00a0</p><p>Microsoft\u00a0 and Apple largely managed to avoid the Washington spotlight in 2018, and Apple's spending on lobbying last year decreased as compared to 2017.\u00a0</p><p>Technology companies are now coming to the table for the first time to help craft federal privacy legislation that would likely supersede a stringent new state law in California, which has been signed by the governor and will\u00a0take effect in 2020. The law will give consumers the right to know what information companies collect about them, what they're doing with it and who they share it with.\u00a0This\u00a0new California law could pose a serious challenge to many of the companies'\u00a0data collection practices and create serious impediments for businesses that rely on targeted advertising. And several other states are looking to\u00a0 considering their own actions on privacy this year.</p><p>A federal privacy law that preempts state level legislation would be\u00a0\"a bad deal\" for consumers, Singh Guliani told me.\u00a0\"We need baseline standards, but states need to have the flexibility to respond to new privacy threats,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>In addition to lobbying, privacy advocates are already on alert for signs that the technology industry is dominating the debate. In the fall, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation held a major privacy hearing, intended to kick off discussion about privacy at the national level in the wake of California passing its own privacy law. The hearing featured executives from several major technology companies, but it did not include\u00a0consumer privacy advocates. The move sparked criticism, and the committee later held a hearing that featured such advocates.\u00a0</p><p>\"We wouldn't want that perspective to dominate the debate,\" Singh Guliani told me.</p><p>As my colleague Tony Romm reported this morning, the increased oversight of the industry is not likely to go away in 2019.\u00a0</p><p>\"When you come of age as an industry, as we have, and you make so many things possible, you're also going to be under scrutiny for all of the consequences of that, too,\"\u00a0Linda Moore, president of the trade group TechNet, told Tony.\u00a0</p><p>It's not just the companies' spending on lobbying that could sway the privacy debate\u00a0in Washington. Their increased influence is also a reflection of the former high-profile policymakers and regulators who many technology companies have hired in recent years.\u00a0Jeff Chester, the executive director for Center for Digital Democracy, told me that there's been a \"revolving door\" between both Republican and Democratic administrations and the technology industry lobby.</p><p>\"There is ultimately a huge conflict of interest,\" he told me, as Congress seeks to pass privacy legislation.</p><p>He's not optimistic that Congress will be able pass legislation with serious teeth, and he's instead focused his efforts on grassroots privacy campaigns.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's very likely the federal bill is going to be a weak one and not really do anything,\" he told me.</p><p>Though the privacy debate has heated up in Washington since California passed its law, the Center for Democracy in Technology's Director of the Data Privacy Project Michelle Richardson tells me it's still early innings. Senate Democrats have floated some national privacy legislation, and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) introduced a privacy bill last year. But she's expecting bipartisan privacy bills to be introduced in the spring.</p><p>Technology industry trade groups have been pushing frameworks for what a federal privacy law should include. The Internet Association sent me a statement that says it supports a privacy bill that would provide Americans \"meaningful control over the data they provide to companies across all industries, including the ability to access, correct, delete and download data.\"\u00a0</p><p>Richardson said at this early stage, it's hard to judge whether the industry groups will support legislation that has many of the tough enforcement provisions that privacy advocates are seeking.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's hard to judge them in detail,\" she said. \"We'll have to see how all of these are going to transform into actual legislative language.\"</p><p>             BITS: Some businesses try to manipulate the company-ratings website Glassdoor by posting positive reviews to boost their ratings and appear more attractive as employers, according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Rolfe Winkler and Andrea Fuller. In their attempts to cast themselves in a positive light,\u00a0some firms enlist employees to flood Glassdoor with high ratings. Some of the businesses that have seen a surge in reviews on the site include tech companies such as LinkedIn and Slack, though companies in other industries have also seen spikes.\u00a0Elon\u00a0Musk's\u00a0SpaceX\u00a0encouraged employees\u00a0to post reviews with the goal of having the company be included in Glassdoor's\u00a0\"Best Places to Work\" annual ranking.          </p><p>\"In the Journal's analysis, five-star ratings collectively made up 45% of reviews in the months where the number of reviews jumped, compared with 25% in the six months before and after,\"\u00a0Winkler and Fuller reported. \"While it isn't possible to determine from the data alone what caused each spike, a statistical test shows the likelihood that so many would skew positive by chance is highly improbable.\"          </p><p>             NIBBLES: IBM chief executive Ginni Rometty warned that while governments seek to protect the \"privacy of\u00a0consumer data,\"\u00a0an overreaction could damage the digital economy, according to CNBC. \"Every government is itching to regulate, and I think the risk we all have is that there's a great overreaction and the casualty is the whole digital economy,\" Rometty said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\u00a0</p><p>She also advocated for specific regulations that would be akin to precision medicine. \"Really what we have to protect is consumer privacy, and that's consent, opt out, ability to delete, and that is what I would call almost like precision medicine - precision regulation. So I'm pretty vocal about that,\"\u00a0Rometty told CNBC. She added that privacy is paramount for IBM. \"We're 108 years old, and we have always lived by that view, that we exist because clients trust us with data,\" Rometty said.\u00a0\"So I think every company now has to do that, when everyone's looking to benefit from it. If you're going to benefit from it, you have to live by those rules.\"</p><p>             BYTES:\u00a0 Two top U.S. industry groups are warning that China is forging ahead with its Made in China 2025 plan that aims to establish the country as a leader in tech domains including electric vehicles and robotics,the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Bob Davis and Lingling Wei reported. China has sought to downplay the importance of the plan.

Their picks range from fiction from legendary black authors to recent business books that address diversity issues.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's The Technology 202 summer reading list, compiled from those recommendations:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Beloved          </p><p>By Toni Morrison</p><p>             Luke Thompson             , investor at Maschmeyer Group Ventures:\u00a0 \"It is full of complicated love that makes the reader confront what it means to be human. Like all of her work, it is importantly Black and never overtly \"political.\" Morrison, with subtlety, ties the slave experience with what it means to be a modern Black American. Once you do, if you can, exist within the commonplace terror of the slave experience, you will delight in the endless familial love that exists in the traditional, white, nuclear-American family, but also the familial love between Black Americans that exists today. Lastly, her writing succeeds in a vacuum. The language, the plot, and the sensation are perfectly brutal and beautiful.\"       </p><p>             Black Software: The Internet &amp; Racial Justice\u00a0          </p><p>By Charlton D. McIlwain</p><p>             Brandi Collins-Dexter             , senior campaign director at Color Of Change: \"Dr. McIlwain tracks in rich detail the 50-year history of the Black tech pioneers, innovators, and organizers at the vanguard of building and defining the Internet, the ways they were cut from history, and how computing technology and Silicon Valley was built to undermine Black agency.\"       </p><p>             Heart Talk: Poetic Wisdom For A Better Life          </p><p>By Cleo Wade</p><p>             Sarah Kunst, managing director of Cleo Capital: \"Wade is an experienced political activist and savvy businesswoman, but her profession is poetry. Reading this book of life and career advice in the form of poems and essays feels a bit like if 'Chicken Soup For the Soul' was written by the Harvard Business Review. We all know how to do our jobs, this is a great reminder of why we do our jobs and in these uncertain times it feels more prescient than ever.\"\u00a0       </p><p>             An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States</p><p>By Roxanne Dunbar</p><p>             Julia Collins, founder and CEO of Planet FWD and co-founder of Zume Pizza: \"This meticulously researched history of the United States presents a version of our history that is seldom if ever presented. The truth of our history as a country dedicated to the destruction of an entire population in the name of land acquisition, gives a very good framework for understanding the vast inequality and lack of justice that we currently face. Perhaps in learning the truth of how our country came to be, we can begin to understand how to fulfill the promise of who we want to become.\"</p><p>Collins also recommends \"Farming While Black\" by Leah Penniman. She adds: \"Any discussion of reforming our food systems is incomplete without understanding the story of Black American farmers.\"       </p><p>             It's About Damn Time          </p><p>By Arlan Hamilton with Rachel L. Nelson</p><p>             Hamilton, founder of Backstage Capital: \"          When I wrote 'It's About Damn Time' a year ago, I could have never imagined it would be released in the middle of a global pandemic or a national revolution. However, the book's themes about overcoming your circumstances and thriving in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds couldn't ring more relevant or relatable as it does today. I think of it as a self-help business book about harnessing the power of being underestimated.\"       </p><p>             Parable of the Sower          </p><p>By Octavia E. Butler\u00a0</p><p>             Ifeoma Ozoma, former Pinterest public policy and social impact manager: \"'All that you touch/You change.' I've thought a lot about this verse over the last week, year, and decade. In this time of pandemic and an ongoing reckoning with the varied harms of racism, we all would do well to be even more mindful of the ways we impact those around us. With incredible prescience, Octavia E. Butler laid out a world that looks frighteningly like our current one, and yet provides a hopeful path forward for us as individuals.\"       </p><p>             Race After Technology          </p><p>ByRuha Benjamin</p><p>             Sherrell Dorsey, founder of the Plug: \"As we become a more ingrained socio-technical society, understanding the harsh implications of not checking how bias shows up in the tools we ultimately use in our everyday lives will be to our detriment. 'Race After Technology' provides a framework in which we can collaboratively think about technology for justice and visibility for those who are traditionally left out of its design.\"       </p><p>             Reset          </p><p>By Ellen Pao</p><p>             Brian Dixon, partner at Kapor Capital: \"Ellen's book focuses on how to build culture in tech with an intersectional lens on gender and race. This book is a must-read for anyone who is already working in tech or aspiring to work in tech, either as employees, founders, and/or investors.\"       </p><p>             The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration          </p><p>By Isabel Wilkerson</p><p>             Erica Baker, director of engineering at GitHub, recommends this book for readers \"beginning to understand more deeply what happened to Black people in America post-slavery. A good starting point to branch into other research.\"       </p><p>          She also recommends \"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son\" and \"James Baldwin: Collected Essays.\"</p><p>             What books are you reading right now? Let me know at             <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cat.zakrzewski@washpost.com\">cat.zakrzewski@washpost.com</email>             or             @Cat_Zakrzewski             on Twitter.          </p><p>Black employee groups are under pressure to fix their companies' race problems for free.\u00a0</p><p>\"Employee resource groups\" for black, Latino, LGBTQ and female workers have been exploited by employers in lieu of company-led diversity initiatives, my colleague Nitasha Tiku reports based on interviews with 17 current and former leaders of ERGS.\u00a0</p><p>\"The dependence on ERGs has stifled the industry because it gives a false sense of progress,\" said Dominique Hollins, a veteran of Google and eBay. \"We joined the ERG because we needed help, but we became the help.\"</p><p>Twitter, Slack, Facebook , GitHub and Eventbrite are just some of the companies where employees have organized these groups. But leaders of the groups say that their duties went well beyond informal camaraderie to being asked to serve their companies as brand ambassadors, diversity strategists, recruiters and to work on company policy with few resources. Some expressed concerns their involvement had held back their careers.\u00a0</p><p>Now there's a spotlight on the treatment of these groups</p><p>\"If you, an employer have deferred the work of supporting the black community to the black employees without recognizing them beyond empty platitudes, or pointed to your black employees to absolve yourselves, maybe reassess that?\" Raki Wane, who previously led Twitter's employee resource group, Blackbirds, wrote on Twitter.</p><p>TikTok is scaling up its presence in Washington with new hires.</p><p>          Several new hires will help build out the social media company's \"Transparency Center\" in Washington, which the company launched to provide policymakers a closer look at its content moderation and user privacy decisions. The company is facing growing scrutiny from lawmakers over its ties to its owner, China-based ByteDance.       </p><p>\"TikTok is going to be the industry leader in transparency,\" Hayes said in a statement to The Technology 202. \"They're committed to ensuring that user data is treated with dignity and giving policymakers unprecedented insight into how they moderate content. I'm thrilled to join the company at this pivotal time and to help lawmakers and experts take a look under the hood of TikTok, where so many American families are finding joy in these difficult times.\"</p><p>A growing number of Republican politicians are flocking to a Twitter alternative in a rebuke of Big Tech.</p><p>Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas uploaded a video yesterday announcing he was joining the Parler app in an effort to \"end the Silicon Valley censorship.\" Tech companies have repeatedly denied they make content decisions based on political ideology, and there is no credible research to support the GOP accusations of censorship.\u00a0</p><p>Parler, which was founded in Nevada in 2018, boasts freedom from the \"ideological suppression and privacy abuse\" of major platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Republicans have been promoting it as an alternative to Twitter since the company issued a series of labels on President Trump's tweets for violations, including manipulated media and threatening harm to a group.</p><p>The Trump campaign has also discussed moving to Parler or even building its own app as Twitter, Snap and Facebook continue to rebuke the campaign, the Wall Street Journal reports.           Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale already use the platform,           according to the Hollywood Reporter          .\u00a0       </p><p>Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Rick Crawford (Ark.), Lee Zeldin (N.Y.), Jodey Arrington (Tex.) and Andy Biggs (Ariz.) also joined this week. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has been a member since last summer.</p><p>It's unlikely Republicans will decamp from Twitter entirely and even less probably they'll stop using Facebook, which has become one of the biggest political advertising platforms. Parler claims to have more than 1 million users, but that's not much compared to the more than 200 million Facebook boasts in the United States alone. A representative for Cruz told Politico he would user Parler in addition to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.</p><p>Parler even bans some of the same practices as Twitter. David Kaye, U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression:       </p><p>There could be some disappointments in store. Sasha Moss, senior director at Insight Public Affairs:       </p><p>Amazon released plans for a sign that would rename Seattle's New Arena as \"Climate Pledge Arena.\" My colleague Tony Romm on the purchase:</p><p>The New York Times's Kate Conger is still processing:</p><p>CBC's Michelle Ghoussoub:</p><p>But seriously:</p><p>             Democrats introduced legislation banning federal government use of facial recognition.          </p><p>          The bicameral legislation responds to growing concerns over law enforcement's use of biometrics and warnings that flawed algorithms could contribute to discriminatory policing.       </p><p>          The bill\u00a0                       would also prohibit                     the federal government from using voice recognition.\u00a0          It would require state and local entities to ban use of the technology if they want to receive federal funding. Any information collected violating the measure would be prohibited from use in federal judicial proceedings.</p><p>          \"Facial recognition technology is fundamentally flawed, systemically biased, and has no place in our society,\" said Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), who introduced the legislation alongside Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) in the House. \"Black and brown people are already over-surveilled and over-policed, and it's critical that we prevent government agencies from using this faulty technology to surveil communities of color even further.\"       </p><p>             Sens. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) introduced the legislation in the Senate.          </p><p>          More than a dozen groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation are backing the bill, called the Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act.       </p><p>Verizon joins as the largest company partaking in an ongoing advertising boycott of Facebook and Instagram.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're pausing our advertising until Facebook can create an acceptable solution that makes us comfortable and is consistent with what we've done with YouTube and other partners.\" Verizon's chief media officer John Nitti           told CNBC           in a statement. Verizon spent nearly $2 million on Facebook and Instagram ads in the past month alone, CNBC reports.       </p><p>          So far 92 companies have joined the temporary           boycott organized by the NAACP and other civil rights groups in response to Facebook's ongoing failures to moderate hate speech and misinformation. Activists are encouraging more to join.\u00a0       </p><p>\"Facebook's leadership can withstand regulatory, legal, and media scrutiny because of the billions of dollars the company receives in advertising,\" Color of Change president Rashad Robinson said in a statement. \"Major corporations that have publicly shared their sympathies for the struggles Black Americans face can and should go one step further by taking our pledge to halt the funding of racism and hate.\"</p><p>          Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is slamming a mobile data company for spying on protesters.       </p><p>          Mobilewalla publicized its surveillance in a report about protester demographics in four cities that analyzed more than 16,000 protesters' mobile phones,                        BuzzFeed News reports                    .\u00a0 It's unclear how accurate the analysis is, but advocacy groups say the practice could undermine freedom of assembly for protesters who weren't aware they were being tracked.       </p><p>          \u00a0\"This report shows that an enormous number of Americans - probably without even knowing it - are handing over their full location history to shady location data brokers with zero restrictions on what companies can do with it,\" Warren said of the report.       </p><p>          \u00a0Warren recently joined with the House Oversight Committee to launch an investigation into another major data broker, Venntel, that works with government agencies.       </p><p>             Tech companies are slamming a bill that would require them to help law enforcement access their users' encrypted data.\u00a0          </p><p>          The \"Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act,\" introduced this week by Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and other Republicans would threaten the sensitive data of billions of tech users,                        the Reform Government Surveillance Coalition argues                    .The group's members include major tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"The global pandemic has forced everyone to rely on the Internet in critical ways, making digital security more important than ever before for our economy and national security,\" the group writes.       </p><p>          The Internet Society also blasted the bill, saying its passage would be \"utterly devastating\" for personal security.       </p><p>          \"Preventing crime is important, but we can't achieve that goal by making everyone more at-risk to the criminal activity we're trying to address,\" the group said in a statement. It boasts more than 100 tech companies as members including Amazon and the Swedish telecom Ericsson. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.)       </p><p>\u00a0Nicol Turner Lee has been named the new director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, according to a news release.</p><p>Like and subscribe.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\u00a0have made the case that breaking up Big Tech will benefit smaller start-ups. But some of the very venture capitalists and entrepreneurs they say stand to benefit are wary of the antitrust frenzy in Washington.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Anytime someone from Washington claims to be here to help the rest of us, you're going to find a lot of skepticism from me,\" said Bob Ackerman, founder and managing director of the venture capital firm AllegisCyber Capital. Politicians \"don't understand tech, don't understand the environment and don't understand the ecosystem,\" he added.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Roger Dickey, a serial entrepreneur and the founder and chief executive of the early-stage start-up Untitled Labs, said\u00a0antitrust action aimed at tech titans such as Google and Facebook could be a \"slippery slope.\" It could lead to broader regulation that impacts the entire industry - and eventually even antitrust scrutiny of\u00a0smaller tech companies, said Dickey, who previously founded Gigster and the Facebook game Mafia Wars.</p><p>\"If you break up all the big guys, eventually you're going to be the biggest one left,\" Dickey said. \"Then the government can come after you too.\"</p><p>             Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs' criticism underscores how deeply intertwined the industry's upstarts are with tech behemoths - as well as a\u00a0             fear that politicians eager to go on a trustbusting spree don't understand that.          </p><p>Those in the tech industry who are cheering the latest antitrust scrutiny say venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are hesitant about jumping on the bandwagon because their end goal is getting bought out by the big guys. Luther Lowe, the vice president of policy at Yelp who has advocated for greater antitrust action, says venture capitalists are\u00a0focused on building \"shiny objects\" to capture the attention of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon for a quick sale.\u00a0</p><p>\"These guys are all in on the take,\" Lowe said. \"They don't want to alienate these guys that could be potential acquirers.\"</p><p>             There's also concern policymakers' focus on reining in\u00a0Big Tech's power could result in broader regulation - which could ultimately introduce new barriers for launching start-ups.             \u00a0Dickey noted that if you wanted to start a restaurant in San Francisco, you would have to obtain licenses and go through lengthy process to deal with local laws. But none of that exists when you start a website or an app.\u00a0</p><p>             \"A lot of entrepreneurs have been blissfully unaware of regulation as a threat,\" he told me.\u00a0          </p><p>But that's changing, according to Ackerman, who says the environment in Washington is impacting the calculations venture capitalists make when weighing investment decisions.\u00a0</p><p>\"For the very first time it introduces the concept of political risk into anything we're building,\" Ackerman said. \"Historically the regulatory environment hasn't affected us at all, because Silicon Valley has been a 'no go' in Washington.\"\u00a0          </p><p>To be sure, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs\u00a0do recognize there are serious competition issues in Silicon Valley. And they admit there's a general hesitancy in the industry to invest in companies that compete directly with the tech giants today.\u00a0Many refer to \"kill zones\" surrounding the big companies. If a small start-up wades into these areas, they're at risk of being squashed, imitated or acquired by a bigger giant. Venture capitalists\u00a0won't touch them with a ten-foot pole.</p><p>But while venture capitalists like Ackerman are concerned about these competition problems, they're not sure 20th century antitrust laws and politicians who have displayed broad ignorance of the industry in hearings last year will be the ones to fix it.\u00a0</p><p>\"Don't try to regulate things that you don't understand,\" Ackerman said.          </p><p>Yet Warren says the dependency of the start-ups on the large tech companies and kill zone fears\u00a0are exactly why her plan to break up Big Tech is needed. When I asked her how she would avoid unintended consequences on innovation as she tries to break up Big Tech in an interview earlier this year, she told me the current system is an unintended consequence.\u00a0</p><p>\"The giants are destroying competition in one area after another,\" she said. \"It's the job of law to enforce the rules to stop them. That's how competition will flourish in this marketplace. The country had to do this 120 years ago. We need to do it again.\"\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: YouTube announced yesterday that it will ban white-supremacist content and conspiracy videos alleging, for instance, that the Holocaust did not happen. The new policy draws a hard line at banning videos \"alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation, or exclusion,\" as my colleague Elizabeth Dwoskin reports</p><p>YouTube said the policy overhaul will result in the removal of thousands of channels and tens of thousands of videos.\u00a0The Google-owned company is the latest social media giant to draw a finer line against white-supremacist content under public pressure.\u00a0Facebook announced in March that it would widen its ban against white-supremacist content to include white nationalism and white separatism. However, the social media platform\u00a0still allows other types of conspiracy content.</p><p>Conspicuously absent from the pack is Twitter, which has refused to ban white-supremacist\u00a0and white-nationalist\u00a0content from its platform. The company is debating banning the content and has launched an in-house research project to evaluate how white supremacists and nationalists use the site,\u00a0Motherboard reports.\u00a0</p><p>As Kevin Roose of the New York Times pointed out, YouTube's ability to enforce its rules is lacking:</p><p>YouTube overhauled its\u00a0policies as it was embroiled in controversy over its content moderation practices. YouTube announced yesterday it would demonetize a channel run by Steven Crowder, a conservative commentator and comdedian who Vox reporter Carlos Maza says harassed him with racist and homophobic taunts on the platform for years. The company appeared to base its decision on\u00a0T-shirts with homophobic language\u00a0that Crowder sells, according to The Daily Beast's Kelly Weill. It was a partial reversal for YouTube after it faced widespread criticism for saying the videos Maza reported did not violate its policies and would not be taken down.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) is putting the spotlight on China's efforts to export surveillance technology. He wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking the department to examine what could be done to prevent the China from potentially exploiting its telecommunications industry to further repressive government action in other countries          </p><p>\"The spread of sophisticated and authoritarian mass surveillance within China in itself is problematic, but its export to other governments poses a worldwide threat of repression,\" Markey said in his letter. \"Beijing is actively exporting methods of control that any authoritarian can implement, eroding freedom in every recipient country and undermining an international order built on open societies.\"</p><p>A Chinese state-run defense manufacturer created a highly networked domestic surveillance system that is being used to track and detain ethnic minorities in the country, according to a New York Times report cited by Markey. Markey also questioned witnesses at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing yesterday about the dangers of the Chinese technology.</p><p>The use of surveillance technology to suppress Uighurs and other groups in China was raised as an issue of concern by both experts and lawmakers at a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing last month on facial-recognition technology.</p><p>             BYTES: Russia's campaign to manipulate\u00a0Twitter ahead of the 2016 election \"was larger, more coordinated and more effective than previously known,\"\u00a0according to a report from Politico's Tim Starks, Laurens Cerulus and Mark Scott. The infamous Russian troll farm not only had more sway than previously known -- but it might have even generated income from some of its phony accounts,\u00a0 the cybersecurity firm Symantec found.\u00a0</p><p>Their research examined a large data set that Twitter released in October 2018 on about 3,900 suspended accounts and 10 million tweets. It found that the average time between account creation and first tweet was 177 days and the most retweeted account picked up 6 million retweets, and less than 2,000 of those came from other accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency.\u00a0</p><p>The long lag between the creation of an account and the initial tweet points indicates the Russians focused on preparation, and the high number of retweets shows many accounts not associated with the IRA helped blast the Kremlin's message.\u00a0</p><p>The Politico team notes these findings underscore the clock is running on efforts to secure the 2020 election. It also highlights how difficult it is for lawmakers to understand how the platforms are policing content.\u00a0\"Our response to bad content on social media is generally to say it should be taken down. That's because that's something we as politicians who are not technical experts understand,\" Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), former assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, told Politico.\u00a0</p><p> \"What we've had a harder time grasping is the virality machine that's built into the social networks through the algorithms that determine what news we see on a daily basis,\" he said.</p><p>             -- Tech news from the private sector:          </p><p>             -- Tech news from the public sector:          </p><p>             -- Tech news generating buzz online:\u00a0          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-40ad7b5d473345318fa78ee698667949</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8S-F5B1-JB4M-V3VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1639\"/><timeReceived>1:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 6, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Corporate brands should be on alert for \"deepfakes\" too, experts are warning.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chief executives including Apple's Tim Cook, Tesla's Elon Musk and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg have already been targeted in deepfakes published online, according to an analysis from CREOpoint, a firm that helps businesses filter and contain the spread of disinformation. Many deepfakes\u00a0also impersonate celebrities, who frequently act as brand ambassadors for corporations and spread company messaging.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"The lines between fake or fact are constantly being undermined,           resulting in an alarming destabilization of corporate reputations and societal and political norms,\" said Jean-Claude Goldenstein, CREOpoint founder and chief executive.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             If business leaders step up pressure on Big Tech             to make a bigger investment in detecting and limiting the spread of deepfakes             , they could be powerful allies to politicians who are increasingly concerned that the spread of misleading videos could hurt their elections.\u00a0          </p><p>             Brands concerned about deepfakes might be able to move faster than lawmakers on Capitol Hill to address the issue. Earlier this week, House lawmakers passed legislation that aims to increase research on developing technology to improve detection of manipulated media. But the legislation awaits action in the Senate.\u00a0       </p><p>             Not all of the deepfakes CREOpoint identified were malicious. Many are parodies or are clear fabrications. But experts say the rapid evolution of the technology could easily be abused by bad actors. For instance, deepfakes could be used to spread information meant to move a company's stock price or undermine a company's relationship with customers.\u00a0</p><p>Guillaume Chaslot, a former YouTube engineer who is\u00a0a Mozilla fellow, tells me that brands that customers rely on for safety are particularly vulnerable to this threat. Take self-driving carmakers, for instance: One doctored video of a fake crash could decimate consumers' trust in a brand.\u00a0</p><p>\"Everyone is extremely worried about this, especially when truth matters to your business,\" Chaslot said.\u00a0</p><p>             Goldenstein says brands concerned about their reputation on social media should be honing in on the deepfake threat.           He conducted an analysis of 50 popular doctored videos, which included deepfakes as well some videos that were doctored without machine learning, known as \"cheapfakes.\" He found that 65.4 percent were impersonating brand ambassadors and entertainers, and 1.2 percent were targeting company executives. Meanwhile, 16.9 percent were targeting politicians.\u00a0</p><p>\"Meaningful brand-safety investments are a must-have given the total market cap in trillions of impacted brands,\" Goldenstein told me. \"Significant market value is at risk from even a small drop in brand equity resulting from the disinformation amplification on social platforms.\"       </p><p>             There are already signs of how damaging deepfakes could be to a company's bottom line. While much of the focus has been on videos, Axios                        reported                     earlier this year that deepfake audio has emerged as a significant threat. Symantec identified at least three successful audio attacks on companies earlier this year, where scammers impersonated CEOs or chief financial officers' voices, requesting an urgent transfer of funds. Millions of dollars were stolen from each business, whose names were not disclosed.\u00a0       </p><p>             Deepfakes are one of the most technically complex challenges confronting Silicon Valley social media giants as they race to ensure they've invested enough in election security ahead of 2020. But some are concerned the technology companies haven't invested enough, given the scope and complexity of the problem.\u00a0          </p><p>Earlier this week, Facebook and Microsoft kicked off their deepfake challenge, a $10 million investment aimed to spur more research on detecting the doctored videos. But critics say that's just a drop in the bucket for some of the richest companies in the world, and it doesn't match the stakes of the challenge. \u00a0</p><p>\"A measly $10 million? Seriously? To fix one of today's most globally alarming issues?\" Goldenstein said. \"That's truly a drop in the ocean of fake news and just half a day of Facebook profits. These companies have the responsibility to invest several orders of magnitude more to develop reliable and transparent fixes, far beyond tactical detectors scanning for signs of facial manipulation.\"       </p><p>          The companies are also racing to develop policies to address deepfakes on their platforms. Twitter recently                        released                     a policy draft and requested feedback.\u00a0       </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS:             The Federal Trade Commission has considered seeking a court order against Facebook that could block the social media giant's plans to integrate its apps,my colleague Tony Romm confirms.\u00a0The legal move would mark a major new threat for Facebook as the regulatory agency forges ahead with an inquiry into competition concerns at the company.</p><p>Officials worry that allowing Facebook to follow through on its plans to further integrate its products would make it harder to eventually split up the company in an antitrust case, as\u00a0John D.

The decision could result in a clash with the California government over enforcement of the law, which goes into effect Jan. 1.</p><p>Facebook argues that the way it transfers user data to third parties does not constitute \"selling,\" meaning it does not have to provide consumers tools to opt-out of collection as required by the new law. The company claims that publishers can also adjust their settings to block its Web tracker, \"pixel,\" for users who opt out.</p><p>But privacy advocates disagree.</p><p>\"To the extent that the pixel is sending back information to Facebook that Facebook can then access without any restrictions, that absolutely is a sale,\" said Alastair Mactaggart, the real estate developer who funded initial efforts to get the landmark privacy law on the books.</p><p>Other players in digital advertising could adopt Facebook's argument, Patience reports, causing complications for California's attorney general tasked with reining in violations by the\u00a0$130 billion U.S. digital-ad industry. Google, in contrast to Facebook, has introduced new tools to comply with the law's mandate to allow users to opt out of data collection.</p><p>             BYTES: One of MeetMe's\u00a0most prominent\u00a0streamers rose to popularity just weeks after being released from prison for a sex offense involving a minor, despite the social media company's policy of screening for registered sex offenders,             my colleague Reed Albergotti reports.             MeetMe's ongoing struggles to keep predators off the app underscore\u00a0how ineffective popular apps are at stamping out harmful content and behavior.26-year-old Deonte Fisher, who streamed as \"Yogi Bear,\" amassed about $50,000 worth of virtual gifts on the site, was invited as a VIP to company-sponsored events\u00a0and received payment from Meet Group, which owns MeetMe. But even after another user outed Fisher as a registered sex offender, the company allowed him to continue streaming.MeetMe\u00a0removed Fisher's account only after The Post contacted the company. MeetMe said it will now check names on banking records when it pays streamers such as Fisher and check whether the names in email addresses conflict with the names users provide the company when they create an account. There's no evidence that Fisher displayed any unwanted sexual behavior on MeetMe.</p><p>A 2014 lawsuit brought by San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera alleged MeetMe had been used by predators to target minors. But even after a settlement, which included updating its privacy policy, MeetMe continued to see user misconduct. In June a user pleaded guilty to molesting an 11-year-old girl he met on the app. The company is currently being sued for wrongful death and false advertising after an adult user was killed by his date.</p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News about tech workforce and culture:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>New York Times reporter Mike Isaac provides a humorous lesson in mobile ordering:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-fec5262e074941ae95b9ae97e9c91406</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR9-2GW1-DXKP-J2RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1634\"/><timeReceived>2:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 13, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Tech experts and civil rights advocates say there's far less awareness of the role extremist enclaves such as 8chan -- which does not appear in Google search results and is blocked by many corporate firewalls -- play in stoking hate and violence online.\u00a0          </p><p>\"The consequences of such a concentrated echochamber of hate has played out multiple times around the world,\" Oren Segal, the director of the ADL's Center on Extremism, told me. \"At this point, we believe that if certain companies can't take responsibility to regulate themselves, to protect their users, to protect others, then perhaps it's time for policymakers to step in and to regulate them.\"</p><p>In a tweet over the weekend, 8chan said it took swift action to remove the post connected with the attack. But in\u00a0the aftermath of the New Zealand attack, experts in online extremism said\u00a0white supremacists' discussions on the forum appeared similar to online activity typically tied to Islamic militants,\u00a0my colleagues Drew Harwell and Craig Timberg reported.\u00a0</p><p>Some\u00a0experts are calling for the website -- which describes itself as the \"darkest reaches of the Internet\" -- to be monitored like a terrorist recruiting website, so law enforcement would intervene\u00a0more when chatter becomes violent, my colleagues wrote.</p><p>While the House held a hearing on white nationalism\u00a0last month, experts said there wasn't nearly enough attention paid to these fringe sites.\u00a0</p><p>\"These digital hate rallies are leading to violence on the ground,\" Segal told me. \"If we can't try to understand the role of social media in not just encouraging hatred but spreading violence now, when will we be prepared to?\"</p><p>             The message is trickling to the campaign trail.\u00a0Brianna Wu, a software engineer who is running as a Democrat for a House seat in Massachusetts, told me she is \"angry\" that law enforcement has not done more to rein in 8chan, which has also been connected to the circulation of child pornography and is a place where people are frequently doxxed.\u00a0</p><p>After\u00a0Wu herself was targeted on the website\u00a0in 2014 with death threats during the Internet culture war known as Gamergate, she says she says she documented \"tons of illegal activity\" on 8chan and shared her findings with the FBI. She believes it's possible the recent shootings could have been avoided if\u00a0law enforcement took greater action, she said, and wants\u00a0to increase funding for the FBI to investigate online crime\u00a0if elected to Congress.\u00a0</p><p>\"We need to fund a specific task force within the FBI that is very tech literate and tasked to prosecute these types of online crimes,\" she said.

Senior personnel or board changes would also have to be approved, among other nonpublic disclosures.\"</p><p>A judge still has to approve the agreement. The agency is seeking stricter limits on Musk's use of Twitter after they say Musk violated their earlier agreement in February, when he tweeted that Tesla would delvier half a million vehicles this year.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: Apple has removed or restricted at least 11 of the 17 most-downloaded screentime monitoring apps since launching its own competing app last year,\u00a0Jack Nicas reports in the New York Times.\u00a0</p><p> \"In some cases, Apple forced companies to remove features that allowed parents to control their children's devices or that blocked children's access to certain apps and adult content,\" Nicas reported.\u00a0\"In other cases, it simply pulled the apps from its App Store.\"</p><p>Some of the apps shut down, while others say their future is in jeopardy.\u00a0</p><p> \"The screen-time app makers are the latest companies to suddenly find themselves both competing against Apple and at the mercy of the tech titan,\" Nicas writes.\u00a0\"By controlling the iPhone App Store, where companies find some of their most lucrative customers, Apple has unusual power over the fortunes of other corporations.\"</p><p>The company defended its decision to remove or restrict the apps. Apple spokeswoman Tammy Levine told the New York Times that developers could gain too much access to people's devices through the monitoring apps and that the timing was unrelated from the company's own screentime app launch.\u00a0Philip W.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that the state's probe into Google was not \"slowed down by the coronavirus pandemic.\"\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          It's a sign that Big Tech's halo effect as it assisted the government during the coronavirus crisis may already be fading.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          It hasn't changed the companies' images in Washington: Potential litigation, calls for hearings and scrutiny of big deals are moving forward even though many tech experts believed the pandemic could be a turning point.\u00a0       </p><p>The tech industry has been actively partnering with federal and state officials to tap their vast data troves to better track the spread of the coronavirus - and of course keeping government operations running and many Americans connected during widespread lockdowns. Many prominent tech executives - including Bezos, Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai and Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg - served on the White House's bipartisan executive groups focused on reviving the economy. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\u00a0       </p><p>          But tensions were on full display this weekend. Here are the recent developments to watch:\u00a0       </p><p>          1. Regulators are taking sharper aim at the search-and-advertising titan.       </p><p>          Federal regulators could bring litigation against Google as soon as this summer, Tony reports. And the Wall Street Journal writes that Paxton says he wants to have the investigation into Google wrapped up by the fall. Any charges would be a significant reversal of state and federal officials' findings seven years ago that the tech titan had not violated any antitrust laws.\u00a0          </p><p>The Journal reports that Attorney General William P. Barr has continued to prioritize the Google probe even as the pandemic has \"complicated\" the work, devoting many resources to the probe. The Justice Department began taking a closer look at Google again last year when they opened a broad review into the tech industry's power, and first requested documents from Google in the fall. It's not yet clear what alleged wrongdoing the Justice Department's case might focus on.</p><p>\"I'm hoping that we bring it to fruition early summer,\" Barr told the Journal in a March interview. \"And by fruition I mean, decision time.\"</p><p>The company says it's continuing to engage with investigators. \"Our focus is firmly on providing services that help consumers, support thousands of businesses and enable increased choice and competition,\" Google spokeswoman Julie Tarallo McAlister told Tony.\u00a0</p><p>          2. Amazon sets the stage for a showdown over whether Bezos will testify on Capitol Hill.       </p><p>          Lawmakers requested for Bezos to testify in the House antitrust investigation into large tech companies. But the company's response made no promises about whether the chief executive would testify, David McCabe reports for the New York Times.\u00a0       </p><p>Amazon doesn't mention his name in a three-page letter. Instead, it said it was \"prepared to make the appropriate Amazon executive available to the Committee to address these important issues.\"\u00a0       </p><p>          That could ratchet up Democratic lawmakers' pressure on the company. They previously have threatened to subpoena Bezos if he does not voluntarily appear. Bezos - unlike the top executives at Facebook and Google - has never testified on Capitol Hill.       </p><p>\"We appreciate the response,\" Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement to the Times. \"As we said in our letter, we expect Mr. Bezos to testify when called and to fully cooperate with this investigation.\"</p><p>          The tensions follow Journal reports that Amazon used data amassed from its third-party sellers on its platform to develop its own products, despite telling lawmakers it did not engage in such practices. Lawmakers have raised concerns the company committed perjury during its initial testimony.\u00a0       </p><p>          3. Facebook faces new backlash from lawmakers for making an acquisition during the pandemic.\u00a0       </p><p>          Lawmakers from both parties are sounding the alarm about Facebook's announcement that it would acquire Giphy, a search engine for animated, viral images known as GIFs. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Democrats Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) expressed skepticism about the deal, The Verge's Makena Kelly writes.\u00a0</p><p>Hawley said Facebook shouldn't be snapping up more companies while it's under antitrust investigation at both the federal and state level.\u00a0</p><p>\"Facebook keeps looking for even more ways to take our data,\" Hawley said in a statement to The Verge. \"Just like Google purchased DoubleClick because of its widespread presence on the Internet and ability to collect data, Facebook wants Giphy so it can collect even more data on us.\"</p><p>Warren said the deal underscores the need for Democrats' legislation that would institute a moratorium on large companies' acquisitions as the coronavirus wreaks economic havoc.\u00a0</p><p>\"Facebook's acquisition is yet another example of a giant company using the pandemic to further consolidate power - this time it's a company with a history of privacy violations gaining more control over online communications,\" a Warren spokesperson told Makena.</p><p>Klobuchar called for federal regulators to investigate the deal. \"Many companies, including some of Facebook's rivals, rely on Giphy's library of shareable content and other services, so I am very concerned about this proposed acquisition,\" she said in a statement.\u00a0</p><p>          4. More White House opposition could be on its way as President Trump escalates his Twitter attacks on the industry.\u00a0       </p><p>It's not immediately clear what action Trump was referring to, but it's a sign attacks on the tech industry could continue during a heated election year. The president has long accused the tech giants of being biased against conservatives, even as tech executives promise political leanings do not influence the decisions they make about content. The president himself is one of the most prominent users of Twitter, and his campaign is running a broad digital campaign for his reelection.\u00a0</p><p>Tech billionaire Peter Thiel may be pulling back his support of Trump because he disagrees with his coronavirus response. \u00a0</p><p>The Facebook board member's involvement in Trump's 2020 campaign has been virtually nonexistent, more than a dozen top officials and sources close to Trump's campaign told Lachlan Cartwright, Asawain Suebsaeng and Lachlan Markay at the Daily Beast.\u00a0</p><p>Thiel's company Palantir has profited off federal contracts during the Trump administration, including a recent deal assisting with coronavirus data analysis. But sources close to Thiel told the Daily Beast he's \"frustrated\" with Trump's public response to the pandemic.</p><p>Despite being one of Trump's most prominent donors in 2016, Thiel has yet to donate to the reelection campaign or Republican National Committee, according to federal elections filings.</p><p>          \"He ghosted us,\" a senior 2020 Trump campaign source told them. \"If anything [new] has happened, I haven't heard about it.\"\u00a0</p><p>European officials are beginning to embrace Google and Apple's contact tracing technology, despite the company's restrictions.</p><p>          Countries have switched to the software giants' approach after failing to create their own systems in some instances, Sam Schechner and Jenny Strasburg at the Wall Street Journal report. The aim is to build public health apps that would track whether people came in contact with someone who tested positive for covid-19.\u00a0       </p><p>Germany, Italy and Ireland have switched to a system compatible with Apple and Google's technology in recent weeks. Even the European Union's top tech watchdog, Margrethe Vestager, has encouraged members to embrace a decentralized approach so that the region can have a common approach that will allow for some travel.       </p><p>             Meanwhile, officials in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada continue to clash with Apple and Google over their contact tracing restrictions.          </p><p>          Public health officials say the companies are refusing to share location data that could help them stop the spread of the coronavirus, Reed Albergotti and Drew Harwell report. Company officials argue their technology was never built to digitize contact tracing and that sharing location data would violate users' privacy.          </p><p>          That has left public health officials in limbo. Governments in North Dakota and Alberta, Canada, that have tried to build independent apps that collect more data than Apple and Google allow have run into functionality issues. Deploying enough human contact tracing volunteers is also a challenge.       </p><p>          \"We're sort of at the point where we just can't do traditional contact tracing.

A video of his death shared online sparked protest, and two white men were arrested and charged in the shooting.\u00a0</p><p>White nationalists have created an alternative online narrative to support their claims of anti-white bias in society.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who represents Silicon Valley.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             But it's tricky terrain. If the industry doesn't tread carefully - especially to preserve users' privacy - companies risk coming out of the crisis looking like villains rather than heroes.\u00a0          </p><p>Khanna cautioned: \"The project of technology needs to be managed in a way that has everyone benefit, that has everyone have access and that it has to be shaped by democratic values.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Here are some of the ways Silicon Valley is helping:          </p><p>             But these efforts are already under scrutiny by the tech industry's top critics - and there will be little room for any missteps.\u00a0          </p><p>\"I'm glad that they're willing to help, but I hope they're actually helping and not using this as an opportunity to drum up business for themselves,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) to reporters gathered at the Capitol yesterday.\u00a0</p><p>Hawley is particularly concerned about a new virus screening tool that Verily, a subsidiary of the Google parent company Alphabet, launched earlier this week. The site, which is so far only available to some Bay Area counties in a pilot, is designed to determine whether people need to get tested and find local places to do so. But it requires users to have a Google account to use the service. They also have to give the company permission to share their data with health care professionals, public health authorities and tech companies such as Google.</p><p>\"I've got a big problem with that,\" Hawley said. \"I don't think that this ought be an opportunity for these tech companies to harvest consumers and customers when people are in desperate straits.\"          </p><p>             The news that the companies are exploring ways to use people's highly specific location data to combat the virus - even in an anonymized, aggregated form - is also sparking privacy concerns.\u00a0          </p><p>\"Privacy is the first to go when there are national security issues,\" Ashkan Soltani, a former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist, told my colleagues yesterday.\u00a0</p><p>          Other countries - including China, South Korea and Israel - have been more aggressive in using location data to curtail the spread of the virus, prompting concerns among privacy advocates who say location data can be particularly invasive. Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that Israel was tapping a secret trove of cellphone location data. Multiple sources stressed to my colleagues that the discussions in the U.S. are not about building a government location database.       </p><p>             Lawmakers are also ratcheting up the pressure on the companies to address rampant coronavirus misinformation and price-gouging on their services. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) slammed Google in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission yesterday for allowing ads that capitalize on coronavirus fears, such as peddling products such as medical masks. The company said it would ban such ads.\u00a0</p><p>The lawmakers urged the FTC to intervene if consumers cannot rely on the company's representations of its business practices. \"These misrepresentations generate direct harm to consumers, exploiting their legitimate fears over the covid-19 outbreak to overcharge them for products,\" the senators wrote. \"They also create widespread social harms to our nation's response to this crisis, such as by contributing to shortages of products essential to the health care workers on the front lines of the covid-19 response.\"</p><p>             There's also been increased scrutiny of the companies' treatment of their most vulnerable workers, particularly contractors and in warehouses, even as they dedicate resources to hiring or bonuses. Amazon warehouse employees have raised concerns that the company is not doing enough to protect them, especially after Amazon workers in Spain and Italy tested positive for the virus. And according to The Intercept's Sam Biddle, Facebook will not provide its bonus to contractors who keep its apps running.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Facebook appeared to be marking posts and articles about the coronavirus from reputable news sites as spam yesterday,\u00a0             my colleague Derek Hawkins reported in a\u00a0live blog             . The system glitch adds to scrutiny of the platform's ability to moderate coronavirus-related content.          </p><p>Users flagged that the company had marked\u00a0articles from the Atlantic, Politico and BuzzFeed News for removal,\u00a0Cameron Wilson at BuzzFeed News reported.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook vice president of integrity, Guy Rosen, said in a tweet that the glitch stemmed from a bug in the anti-spam system. He refuted speculation that the removals were the result of Facebook sending thousands of its moderators to work from home.</p><p>A Facebook representative did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>The posts were restored by 9:30 p.m., but NBC News journalist Brandy Zadrozny pointed out how the incident highlighted the power of Facebook:</p><p>             NIBBLES: The Trump administration yesterday\u00a0temporarily suspended rules that restricted doctors' communications\u00a0with patients via phone or video apps, my colleague             Joseph Marks reports             . The new order could be a boon to national efforts to increase the use of telemedicine during the coronavirus pandemic.          </p><p>The loosened data protections under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), allow doctors to use free commercial tools such as Apple's FaceTime, Google Hangouts, Microsoft's Skype and Facebook Messenger's video chat feature to consult with patients.\u00a0</p><p>The unprecedented move could greatly expand access to telemedicine, but it could make patients' information more vulnerable to hackers. Some cybersecurity experts tell Joseph it's worth risking that trade-off.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're in a different environment today with this pandemic ... Putting a patient in front of a doctor is what's important,\" Curtis Dukes, a former top National Security Agency official who's now executive vice president of the Center for Internet Security, told Joseph. \"Given where we are today with covid-19, this is a prudent step by the administration.\"</p><p>Telemedicine companies say they're used to meeting strict data security requirements, and deregulation will make it easier for them to reach patients.</p><p>\"I think it's a balance. For decades the telemedicine industry has been overregulated,\" Jon Peace, CEO of telemedicine company Zipnosis, told Tonya. \"On the flip side, I do think we need to make sure any telemedicine providers are held to basic protections. Generally deregulating it and making it easier for patients to access it is great.\"\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: There will be           \"             severe ramifications          \"             if the United States finds that a foreign government was behind a hacking and disinformation campaign to spread panic about the coronavirus,             Attorney General William P.

That might sound like a steep punishment, but at $5.7 million, critics say it's actually a relatively paltry sum for a Silicon Valley darling that was acquired by the Bytedance (the Chinese maker of\u00a0TikTok) for close to $1 billion.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             That penalty\u00a0for illegally collecting data -- such as location information -- from\u00a0children under 13 must be higher to properly enforce\u00a0the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act,\u00a0according to Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass).\u00a0          </p><p>             \"While this fine may be a historic high for a COPPA violation, it is not high enough for the harm that is done to children and to deter violations of the law in the future by other companies,\" Markey said in a statement.\u00a0\"I urge the FTC to make COPPA enforcement a top priority and protect the privacy of a uniquely vulnerable class of Americans - our children. That means making companies pay higher monetary penalties that will actually incentive COPPA compliance.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>COPPA\u00a0was written in 1998, when dial-up ruled and apps that would allow children to upload videos from their phones were still about a decade\u00a0away. But the FTC fine against Musical.ly and the ensuing criticism could bring greater attention to the need to update children's privacy laws in Washington -- and ratchet up pressure on regulators to scrutinize if there are other companies that may be in violation of federal law.</p><p>             Privacy advocates say Musical.ly isn't the only company taking advantage of children online and that tougher enforcement and protections are needed.\u00a0          </p><p>\"TikTok\u00a0and others have been failing to comply with COPPA for years, and the FTC has been reluctant to challenge the privacy invasive practices of the companies that target children,\" Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, told my colleagues Craig Timberg and Tony Romm. \"This is too little, too late.\"</p><p>The Musical.ly case is a particularly glaring example of how children's privacy can be exploited online.\u00a0Musical.ly, the music video app TikTok merged with in 2018, has a long, well-documented history of attracting users under 13. In 2016, the New York Times reported that the app had many users in grade school, and it was using their location data to suggest people nearby follow them.\u00a0</p><p>             Yesterday's fine was a rare instance where the FTC has been able to enforce COPPA on a general-interest app. COPPA provides broad privacy protections to children under the age of 13, prohibiting online services from collecting data about kids without their parents permission. But as Craig and Tony pointed out, the law only applies to services that have \"actual knowledge\" that the users are underage or services that are specifically directed at children.\u00a0</p><p>In the Musical.ly case, the FTC was able to show that many of the children using the app had their true ages written in their profiles, and Musical.ly still did nothing to limit their access to the app.\u00a0</p><p>\"The operators of Musical.ly - now known as TikTok - knew many children were using the app but they still failed to seek parental consent before collecting names, email addresses, and other personal information from users under the age of 13,\" FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a news release. \"This record penalty should be a reminder to all online services and websites that target children.\"</p><p>             The TikTok case could give the agency the precedent to probe other general-interest apps causing concern among children's privacy advocates, such as Google's YouTube\u00a0or the video game Fortnite.\u00a0\u00a0          </p><p>             The agency has already received a complaint about Google's YouTube          . Over 20 advocacy groups           filed a complaint last year           that said YouT          ube is violating the law because it is collecting data about children          \u00a0watching videos on the service without getting permission from parents. They say YouT          ube knows of this because of the high-number of child-directed channels on the service.           The FTC wouldn't tell my colleagues yesterday whether it was actively investigating YouTube.\u00a0       </p><p>Common Sense Media, one of the groups that filed the complaint against YouTube, weighed in: \"It is no secret that tech companies are illegally and knowingly collecting personal information from children,\" Jim Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, said in a statement to my colleagues. \"Musical.ly wasn't the first company and they won't be the last, which is why we need the FTC to continue to regularly enforce the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and hold companies accountable in a big way.\"</p><p>TikTok promised to require new users to verify their age. It also launched a separate app for people under the age of 13 that complies with U.S. privacy laws and will delete all data about children it previously collected.\u00a0</p><p>\"We care deeply about the safety and privacy of our users,\" TikTok said in a blog post. \"This is an ongoing commitment, and we are continuing to expand and evolve our protective measures in support of this.\"</p><p>             BITS: Uber and Lyft are planning to give some of the most active or longest serving drivers money to buy stocks in their upcoming initial public offerings,\u00a0the Wall Street Journal's Maureen Farrell reports. The companies are planning to give drivers a cash reward that can be applied toward stock.</p><p>          \"          It is typically hard for an ordinary investor to buy a company's stock at its IPO price before it begins trading on an exchange, so this move would give drivers access they likely wouldn't have had otherwise,\" Farrell writes.\u00a0       </p><p>          Uber, which has 3 million drivers globally, plans to give a \"significant portion\" of its drivers around the world a cash bonus or stock, based on a sliding scale determined by length of service or number of trips. Uber has long tried to provide drivers with company shares, but \"had encountered a roadblock because of securities laws that make it challenging to give private shares to independent contractors,\" Farrell wrote.\u00a0</p><p>Lyft will give drivers that have given at least 10,000 rides $1,000 in cash that can be applied to IPO shares.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: Republicans and Democrats debated\u00a0during a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee\u00a0whether a federal privacy law should override state legislation, the Hill's Emily Birnbaum reported. Almost all Republicans\u00a0on the panel supported the idea that federal privacy\u00a0legislation should replace state laws to prevent differing\u00a0rules between states. Democrats wondered whether Republicans' position aimed\u00a0to circumvent a new state law in California that seeks to restrict tech giants' data-collection practices and is scheduled to go into effect next year.</p><p>             \"Are we here just because we don't like the California law and we just want a federal preemption law to shut it down?\"\u00a0said Sen. Maria Cantwell (Wash.), the\u00a0committee's ranking Democrat, according to the Hill. \"I find this effort somewhat disturbing . . . This is the first thing that people want to organize here in D.C. is a preemption effort.\"</p><p>But senators from both parties did agree when it came to chiding representatives of the tech industry at the hearing.\u00a0\"We now realize this data-sharing is not a bug,\" said Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), according to Birnbaum. \"It is a business, it is a business model, and big tech has made a whole lot of money by exploiting the use of this data.\"</p><p>             BYTES: Amazon is rolling out a new program that will allow brands to delete listings for imitation products on its platform,\u00a0the Wall Street Journal's Laura Stevens reports. The anticounterfeiting program, called Project Zero, has been in testing with about 15 companies, and Amazon is now inviting other brand owners to join.\u00a0</p><p>In addition to giving brands more power to monitor fake products on the platform, the company is rolling out a tool that will allow Amazon to verify a product's authenticity when it enters a warehouse via a unique code that companies can print or stick on to their packaging. Amazon engineers are also refining algorithms that can detect counterfeit goods on the service.\u00a0</p><p>\"In shifting some monitoring duties and authority to brands themselves, Amazon is taking an unusual step,\" Stevens wrote. \"Other tech companies use outside contractors to help monitor their platforms but don't generally let users remove content.\"</p><p>             -- Most of the anti-vaccination content that is broadly circulated on Facebook is produced by a relatively small group of pages on the social network, according to the Atlantic's Alexis C. Madrigal. Therefore, the reach of anti-vaccination messaging could decrease if Facebook moved to shut down only a few of such pages on the platform. Madrigal reported that an analysis with the social-monitoring tool CrowdTangle showed that seven anti-vaccination pages were behind almost 20 percent of the top 10,000 posts about vaccination since 2016.</p><p>             -- The company\u00a0OneWeb wants to send a constellation of satellites to space that could\u00a0bring Internet access to remote parts of the world, The Washington Post's Christian Davenport reported. The company's\u00a0satellites would be about the size of a refrigerator and would connect to stations on Earth. OneWeb, which was founded by\u00a0Greg Wyler, has received investments from SoftBank, Qualcomm,\u00a0Richard Branson's Virgin Group, Coca-Cola and others. \"The ultimate goal is to connect every school in the world, and bridge the digital divide,\" Wyler told my colleague. \"We're bringing connectivity and enabling it for people around the world, and in rural populations.\"</p><p>             - Amazon is backing out of a skyscraper under construction in its hometown of Seattle, GeekWire's Monica Nickelsburg reported. The company doesn't plan to occupy offices that it had leased in the tower but will instead sublease them. Just as Amazon faced opposition from local politicians and activists in New York over its now-scrapped plan to open headquarters there, the company has also faced criticism in Seattle. \"It's not hard to draw a line between the battles; two Seattle City Council members traveled to New York to warn Amazon opponents about what it's like to have the company in your backyard,\" Nickelsburg wrote.

But experts are skeptical that the agency's new tech-focused task force will result in tough action -- such as breaking up\u00a0Facebook and its subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For those consumer advocates who think Facebook should be stripped of its largest acquisitions, the announcement of a new agency task force on competition is a far cry from the strong crackdown on Silicon Valley they would like to see. As the\u00a0technology company is under fire for broad abuses of users' data, they say the company's strategy of\u00a0buying\u00a0up its most promising competitors have left it with no serious challengers and outsized power -- and the FTC still isn't doing nearly enough.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Matthew Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, said:\u00a0</p><p>             The fact that the FTC is creating a task force focused solely on competition in the tech industry - and dedicating a whopping 17 attorneys to it - shows that the agency is hearing calls for it to police tech titans at a time when lawmakers are concerned about Big Tech's outsize power. But there are many reasons why experts say the move will do little more than pay\u00a0lip service to the issue.\u00a0          </p><p>             First, any effort to bust up tech companies would likely result in costly and lengthy legal battles that the FTC may be unwilling or unable to take on.          </p><p>From CNBC's editorial director of technology coverage:</p><p>             Second, consumer advocates pointed out that reviewing current and previous mergers is already the FTC's job -- and that it shouldn't need a new task force to take this kind of action.          </p><p>\"Obviously, we are glad that the FTC is looking more closely at competition in the tech sector, but the creation of the task force is not a substitute for overdue enforcement action,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The group\u00a0has called on the FTC to use its authority to break off Instagram and WhatsApp from Facebook.</p><p>Bruce Hoffman, the director of the FTC's competition bureau, wouldn't say in a call with reporters whether it would specifically look into Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, saying it couldn't comment on \"any pending investigation or specific plans for investigations.\" But Hoffman did say that if FTC were to review completed mergers, it would \"have the full panoply\" of remedies at its disposal, which could include breaking up companies or spinning off companies.</p><p>But of course, the agency would have to meet legal standards that would hold up in court - and that\u00a0would be no easy task.\u00a0</p><p>             That's because there are legal questions about how existing competition rules should be applied to the tech giants.\u00a0The task force is emerging as some congressional Democrats are reviewing existing competition laws - which have traditionally focused on whether monopolies set\u00a0unfair prices that harm consumers. Some believe the laws may have to be updated to apply to free digital services such as\u00a0Facebook and Google.\u00a0</p><p>             These lawmakers took the new announcement as a sign the FTC is taking their work seriously. Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the House antitrust subcommittee chair, has been a leading voice on tech competition\u00a0in Congress. He applauded the new task force\u00a0on Twitter:</p><p>             To be sure, the time is ripe for change on antitrust laws -- as there is strong political pressure on both sides of the aisle for the FTC to take a harder look at Silicon Valley companies.\u00a0Though Facebook took the spotlight yesterday, President Trump has previously said that his administration is also looking at Amazon and Google for antitrust violations. Google's acquisition of advertiser tool DoubleClick and Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods are two other tech mergers that critics say skated by antitrust regulators with little scrutiny.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Tim Wu, the author of \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,\" who has built the case for a breakup of Facebook and Instagram, said he's hopeful the task force could result in change in Silicon Valley:\u00a0</p><p>             It's too early too tell if Silicon Valley companies should be shaking in their boots, said David Vladeck, a former\u00a0director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. The task force is an unprecedented initiative, he said, and it shows the agency is serious about taking a closer look at the tech industry. Even if the FTC doesn't go so far to break up existing tech mergers, retrospective analysis could give the agency insights that may be useful when reviewing future deals.\u00a0</p><p> \"This will give the agency a better sense of where companies like Facebook and the next Instagram stand,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>             BITS: A federal appeals court upheld AT&amp;T and Time Warner's merger, The Washington Post's\u00a0Brian Fung reported. The court\u00a0said the Justice Department, which opposed the merger, did not prove its claim that a lower court failed to apply \"fundamental principles of economics\" when it examined the potential effects of the merger on consumers. \"While we respect the important role that the U.S. Department of Justice plays in the merger review process, we trust that today's unanimous decision from the D.C. Circuit will end this litigation,\" AT&amp;T said in a statement, according to my colleague.          </p><p>             The decision by a three-judge panel also represents a setback for\u00a0Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust chief at the Justice Department.\u00a0It's the second time Delrahim has lost in court in an attempt to block the merger.\u00a0\"But while the decision could mean the end of the AT&amp;T-Time Warner battle, it probably will not settle a growing debate in Washington about the adequacy of America's antitrust laws and whether regulators have been too meek overall in challenging mergers,\" Brian wrote.</p><p>             NIBBLES: A congressional hearing on online privacy marked the start of what Democrats on Capitol Hill vow\u00a0to be a campaign to hold Silicon Valley companies accountable, The Post's Tony Romm reported. Democrats advocated for enacting federal privacy legislation and scrutinizing tech firms during a\u00a0House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on\u00a0consumer protection and commerce hearing. \"Without a comprehensive federal privacy law,\" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), the subcommittee's chair,\u00a0said, \"the burden has fallen completely on consumers to protect themselves, and this has to end.\"          </p><p>             Democratic lawmakers also plan to\u00a0examine how social media platforms police abusive content and explore tech giants' effects on competition.\u00a0Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said his panel intends to take a look at social media sites. \"The argument that these are immature industries, and need to be given free rein - I don't think that applies there now among the most capital-intensive, successful businesses on the planet,\" Schiff told Tony in a recent interview. \"Vigorous oversight is now the new normal.\"          </p><p>             BYTES: Major tech firms such as Facebook and Apple are opposing efforts in several foreign countries to require companies to hand over data that authorities may be unable to access, the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Robert McMillan and Dustin Volz reported. Governments that seek to get ahold of data in investigations or to prevent threats may be unable to do so when devices or products are encrypted. Britain in 2016 passed legislation that can require tech companies to turn in data to law enforcement. India is also mulling rules that would give authorities access to some WhatsApp data, the Journal reported.</p><p>Australia has also passed a law that critics say could result in weakening encryption. \"On Thursday, a coalition of civil society groups, trade associations and nine tech companies, including Facebook Inc., which owns WhatsApp, Apple, Google, Twitter Inc. and Microsoft Corp. filed comments with the Australian government warning that the law, passed in December, could create back doors into technology products,\" the Journal reported.          </p><p>From Volz:</p><p>             - Twitter suspended far-right activist Jacob Wohl for creating fake accounts to allegedly seek to manipulate the 2020 presidential election             ,\u00a0my colleagues Tony and Brian reported. In a story published by\u00a0USA Today\u00a0on Tuesday, Wohl said he intended to create \"enormous left-wing online properties\" and use them \"to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.\"</p><p>             - Some investors and supporters\u00a0are getting tired of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk's tweeting habits, which have drawn scrutiny from regulators, The Post's\u00a0Renae Merle and Drew Harwell reported. \"He's hurting the shareholders, his company - and for what? Twitter isn't that important!\" Ross Gerber, whose investment firm\u00a0Gerber Kawasaki owns about $10 million in Tesla shares, told my colleagues. \"That's the part that's starting to bother me. It's like, enough of this crap.\"</p><p>             A federal judge has ordered Musk to prove that he didn't break a settlement agreement with the\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC\u00a0\"has accused Musk of not seeking preapproval of any potentially market-moving tweets about the car company as he promised,\" Renae and Drew reported.</p><p>             - Facebook banned British anti-Muslim activist\u00a0Tommy Robinson from its platform, The Post's Hamza Shaban reported. Aside from deleting\u00a0the Facebook\u00a0profile and page of Robinson, the company also took down his Instagram account. \"Tommy Robinson's Facebook Page has repeatedly broken these standards, posting material that uses dehumanizing language and calls for violence targeted at Muslims. He has also behaved in ways that violate our policies around organized hate,\" Facebook said in a blog post, according to my colleague. Robinson, a founder of the English Defense League, had millions of online followers.</p><p>             - More technology news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will raise money in San Francisco next month,\u00a0Recode's Theodore Schleifer reported.\u00a0\"The names on the host committee are not narrowly in the tech industry, but it's fair to expect some tech names to drop by the event being held at Spruce, the high-end restaurant in San Francisco's Presidio Heights neighborhood, on March 19,\" Recode reported.</p><p>             - The Democratic Party chairs of four early-primary states want presidential hopefuls to commit not to use online disinformation tactics against their opponents, Politico's Natasha Korecki reported. The effort\u00a0by the chairs of the Democratic Party in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina seeks to establish rules on disinformation and cybersecurity\u00a0that campaigns would have to respect. \"I think after what happened in 2016 and what we saw of the foreign state actors play in the race, we want to make sure our process is as fair and transparent as possible,\" Troy Price, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, told Politico.          </p><p>             Under such potential agreement, candidates would have to refrain\u00a0from using hacked material, spreading disinformation or resorting to fake accounts on social media platforms. \"If we know the campaigns aren't doing it, it's going to be much easier to find it and make it go away. If this becomes widespread, it will become truly impossible to root out what's coming from foreign powers,\"\u00a0Simon Rosenberg, who led the\u00a0Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's efforts against disinformation during the\u00a02018 midterm election, told Korecki.</p><p>             - Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai told phone companies to step up the fight against unwanted robo-calls or face regulation, CNBC's\u00a0Matthew J. Belvedere reported. \"Recently I told the industry, 'Look, we need to adopt call authentication, essentially a digital fingerprint, for every single phone call this year. We need to have it now or otherwise it's going to be regulatory intervention,\" Pai said in an interview on CNBC.          </p><p>             - More technology news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News about tech workforce and culture:          </p><p>             - Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Today in funding news:          </p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Coming soon:          </p><p>Cohen testimony: 5 things to expect.</p><p>Pharma CEOs admit U.S. has \"some of the highest prices\" for prescriptions in the world:</p><p>\"Thinking Out Loud\" vs. \"Let's Get It On\": Does Ed Sheeran's song sound too similar?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-ad195173e67e46dcb4bd0a3bdd326d07</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHN-GCM1-JB4M-V1T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2133\"/><timeReceived>2:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

David Cicilline is working on legislation targeting Facebook's policy of allowing politicians to lie in ads, insisting that Congress has a \"responsibility to prohibit\" the social media giant from making money off information it knows to be false.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Rhode Island Democrat at the helm of the House antitrust investigation into Big Tech says it's \"not acceptable\" for Facebook to\u00a0insist\u00a0it won't fact-check or remove politicians'\u00a0ads\u00a0even when they\u00a0contain false information.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is\u00a0\"shocking,\" Cicilline said in an interview,\u00a0that the company sees \"no responsibility\u00a0in ensuring that that platform is not being used to completely mislead or lie to the American people on the most critical issues of the day.\"\u00a0He's particularly concerned about the broad reach of Facebook's platform, which could allow such falsehoods to reach its billions of users.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Legislation would mark a significant escalation in Democrats' criticism of Facebook's policy, which has been building since the company's decision to allow President Trump to run an ad with false claims about former vice president Joe Biden.          </p><p>             It's also a signal that Democrats were not satisfied with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's defense on the issue that\u00a0emerged as a key point of contention\u00a0during his six-hour grilling on\u00a0Capitol Hill earlier this week.\u00a0          </p><p>Zuckerberg, whose company has long insisted it does not want to be a referee for political speech,\u00a0told lawmakers that Facebook has little business incentive to not fact-check politicians' ads.\u00a0\"From a business perspective, the very small percent of our business that is made up of political ads does not come anywhere close to justifying the controversy that this incurs for our company,\" Zuckerberg said. \"So this really is not about money. This is\u00a0on principle, I believe in giving people a voice.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Any attempt by Congress to regulate Facebook's approach to political ads\u00a0is likely to\u00a0spark a debate about what government's role should be in shaping a private company's decisions, especially because Zuckerberg has sought to position the policy\u00a0as a matter of free speech.</p><p>Cicilline is anticipating that pushback, but he tells me the First Amendment is \"not a basis\" to allow Facebook to profit off lies.\u00a0\"Rather than being a First Amendment issue, it's really a kind of revenue generation issue for a business,\" he said.</p><p>But Republicans may not agree. Rep. Garland \"Andy\" Barr (R-Ky.) commended Zuckerberg's position on ads in this week's hearing.\u00a0\"I do find it highly troubling that politicians are trying to bully you to be a fact checker and to be the speech police especially in politics at the core of the First Amendment,\" Barr said during the hearing.\u00a0</p><p>Cicilline said that any policy should err on the side of caution when it comes to information that's subject to interpretation or an open question. But he draws the line at statements that are\u00a0definitively false. He took issue with\u00a0Zuckerberg telling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) that she \"probably\" could run ads that falsely claimed Republicans were supporting the Green New Deal.

Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) wrote a letter asking\u00a0U.S. intelligence officials to assess whether Chinese-owned social media company TikTok poses a threat to national security,my colleagues Tony Romm and Drew Harwell report. They're concerned that the increasingly popular app could be a \"potential target of foreign influence campaigns like those carried out during the 2016 election on U.S.-based social media platforms.\"\u00a0</p><p>Schumer and Cotton are just the latest lawmakers to express concerns that the Chinese-owned company's U.S. operations may be influenced by the Chinese government. The lawmakers questioned whether Chinese law could compel the company to share the locations and other data of U.S. users or to \"support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.\" Researchers have raised concerns that the app continues to censor content critical of the Chinese government in the United States, Tony and Drew reported earlier this year.</p><p>\"We are not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government,\" TikTok responded in a blog post\u00a0yesterday. The company said that all U.S. user data is stored in the United States and Singapore and is not subject to Chinese law. The company also says it has never been asked to remove any content by the Chinese government and \"would not do so if asked.\"\u00a0</p><p>Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) raised similar national security concerns earlier this month when he called for the Treasury Department to review the acquisition of U.S.-based Musical.ly by ByteDance, TikTok's parent company.</p><p>             BYTES: A popular algorithm used to guide medical care for ill patients vastly underestimates the health needs of black patients, according to a recent study,\u00a0my colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson reports. The findings highlight the ubiquity of racial biases in the algorithms that help shape even the most critical areas of our lives.</p><p>While the study focused on just one tool from a company called Optum, bias probably exists in tools across the private and public sectors that help manage the health care of more than 200 million Americans, researchers reported in the journal Science.</p><p>\"It's truly inconceivable to me that anyone else's algorithm doesn't suffer from this,\" said Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of computation and behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who oversaw the research. \"I'm hopeful that this causes the entire industry to say, 'Oh, my, we've got to fix this.' \"</p><p>Optum is working on a fix that could more than\u00a0double the number of black patients the algorithm can identify, but it's hard to say how many algorithms for medical care have similar issues since their inner workings are often shielded from researchers. Some lawmakers have even introduced legislation to force companies to take accountability for such biases - intentional or not. Many experts also believe the onus to find biases should be on technologists, not users.</p><p>\"I am struck by how many people still think that racism always has to be intentional and fueled by malice,\" Ruha Benjamin, an associate professor of African American studies at Princeton University, told Carolyn. \"They don't want to admit the racist effects of technology unless they can pinpoint the bigoted boogeyman behind the screen.\"</p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News about tech workforce and culture:          </p><p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey shaded\u00a0Zuckerberg at the Twitter News Summit yesterday,\u00a0Sarah Frier and Kurt Wagner report.

The controversy is likely just the start of a year-long standoff between tech companies and lawmakers about the publishing and sharing of altered videos and photos.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who represents Silicon Valley, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who helms the House antitrust investigation of Big Tech, and a longtime Pelosi staffer were among the prominent voices who called for Twitter and Facebook to take action against the Pelosi clip.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The video was edited to make it look like the House speaker was ripping up a copy of Trump's State of the Union speech right after he paid tribute to various special guests --- including a Tuskegee airman and a military family being reunited. (Pelosi did tear up the speech, but at the conclusion of the president's remarks, not in response to any individual guest.)</p><p>From Khanna:</p><p>And Cicilline:</p><p>From Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff:</p><p>             The tech companies have been bracing for this clash: They recently have been             outlining             more             specific policies             about how they plan to limit the spread of certain manipulated videos and photos as election season gets underway, but this particular video of Pelosi appears to fall into a gray area in the ongoing debate about what responsibility they have to limit the spread of falsehoods on their platforms. Experts are split on how they should approach an unsophisticated fake that shows actual events, just out of the order they happened.          </p><p>Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive of PEN America, a free-speech advocacy group, said:</p><p>Dave Karpf, a media and public affairs professor at George Washington University, told my colleagues Drew Harwell and Tony Romm that the video was clearly meant to be misleading. \"We all know the difference between editing something to make it more clear and editing something to make it more deceptive,\" he told them. He said while it may not violate the companies' policies, it should should still draw public outrage as \"gross and disturbing and a sign of what is probably more to come.\"</p><p>The companies have differing approaches to handling edited or doctored media. Facebook told Drew and Tony the Pelosi video did not violate its policies, and spokesman Andy Stone defended the company's decision not to take action:</p><p>Twitter told Drew and Tony that its new rules on manipulated media had not yet gone into effect, so it could not comment on the video. A company spokeswoman told the New York Times           that Twitter would start applying labels reading \"manipulated media\" to heavily edited videos like Trump's once the new rules take effect on March 5.\u00a0       </p><p>             One thing's for sure: Social media firms should brace for more controversies like this one as election season progresses, especially if Trump continues to rely heavily on edited videos and photos as ammunition against his political opponents.\u00a0          </p><p>          The Trump campaign told the Times over the weekend the video was clearly a parody.       </p><p>          \"If Nancy Pelosi fears images of her ripping up the speech, perhaps she shouldn't have ripped up the speech,\" Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, told the Times.       </p><p>          Republicans seized on the controversy to help the video gain traction. From Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who has called for Pelosi to be censured for tearing up the speech:       </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) plans to introduced             a proposal today             to overhaul the Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with policing privacy and antitrust issues. Hawley's longshot pitch is the latest sign that lawmakers in Washington are growing concerned the more than 100-year-old agency isn't equipped to regulate modern tech.          </p><p>Hawley wants to essentially dismantle the FTC and house it within the Justice Department. But he has yet to introduce specific legislation, and it's unclear whether other lawmakers would support such an aggressive overhaul. But the freshman GOP senator is sending a message to tech companies that he wants to lead a crackdown on their practices.\u00a0</p><p>Hawley contends the new structure would ensure the agency is more accountable to Congress and spends less time engaging in unnecessary disputes over jurisdiction. These skirmishes have escalated over the past year as the agencies have opened probes into several tech companies, as the Wall Street Journal previously reported.\u00a0</p><p>\"The FTC isn't working. It wastes time in turf wars with the DOJ, nobody is accountable for decisions, and it lacks the 'teeth' to get after Big Tech's rampant abuses,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"Congress needs to do something about it.\"</p><p>Hawley's proposal would scrap the FTC's five-person commission in favor of a sole director who would be accountable to the associate attorney general. The FTC would no longer have the authority to review mergers; instead the proposal would grant the agency the authority to create penalties for first-time civil offenses as well as to create and enforce \"rules for interoperability, data portability, and data minimization.\"</p><p>Hawley's plan stands in sharp contrast to efforts among Democrats, who\u00a0have proposed creating a new agency regulating privacy issues.

The new restrictions add to growing concerns the outbreak could force organizers to cancel the annual event, one of the world's biggest gatherings for the telecommunications industry.          </p><p>GSM Association, an international forum for the wireless industry that organizes MWC, said\u00a0it will ban all travelers from Hubei, the Chinese province that is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0All visitors from China must show they've been outside the country for 14 days before the event, and all attendees will have to pass a temperature screening.</p><p>Visitors from China comprise only about 5 percent of attendees for the annual event. Potentially more worrisome is the growing list of high-profile companies no longer attending.

That question is dividing the Democratic Party\u00a0and becoming a litmus test for 2020 presidential candidates on how they see the future of work.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several candidates including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u00a0cheered on the California Senate as it passed a bill late Tuesday that could convert thousands of\u00a0contract workers in the state to full-time employees, who receive benefits and wage protections. The high-profile state bill could give them ammunition in tonight's primary debate as they address economic inequality\u00a0-- an issue amplified by drivers' protests across the country.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Sanders, for his part, wants the protections in the bill known as AB5 enshrined in federal law. \"Sen. Sanders...\u00a0is pleased that the California legislature stood up to reject a reality in which a tiny handful of Americans become extraordinarily wealthy by paying their workers starvation wages,\" Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said. \"For too long, so-called 'gig economy'\u00a0workers across the country were denied a living wage, the right to organize, and basic workplace protections. The war against the working class, fueled by the greed and corruption of the corporate elite, will end when Sen. Sanders is in the White House.\"\u00a0</p><p>From Warren:</p><p>             But the most prominent moderate Democrat in the race, former vice president Joe Biden,\u00a0was notably silent. Biden declined to take a position despite\u00a0multiple requests\u00a0from me and my colleague Faiz Siddiqui.\u00a0</p><p>             It's possible that top-polling candidates -- who are finally appearing on the same stage togther tonight in Texas\u00a0-- will seize the California bill\u00a0as a way to distinguish their economic positions.\u00a0It's especially hot-button given the wide-ranging stakes for the future of the American economy: It could pose an existential threat to the business model of gig economy companies.\u00a0</p><p>             A national spotlight on drivers' rights\u00a0would be bad for Uber and Lyft, and the technology industry is already bracing for possible questions about the future of the gig economy and going on the defensive.\u00a0Last night, the industry group TechNet, which represents Lyft and Uber, put out a blog post reminding 2020\u00a0candidates that the gig economy \"has created new jobs and income opportunities in virtually every corner of the country.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"It is imperative that policymakers work closely with innovators in this space and other stakeholders to ensure that these opportunities can continue to expand, remain flexible, and meet consumers' demand,\" TechNet executive director for Texas David Edmonson wrote.</p><p>             The classification of gig economy workers is no longer such a\u00a0wonky topic. Compared to past political cycles,\u00a0Uber and Lyft are now much more mature companies.\u00a0Their recent initial public offerings highlighted the divide between their drivers' wages and protections and the financial gains of early company employees and investors.</p><p>             Biden is in a complicated position: Many Obama administration officials such as former senior adviser Valerie Jarrett\u00a0are in roles at the ride-sharing companies now, Faiz notes, and some Democrats working for the companies\u00a0have even publicly tussled with the party's prominent liberal stars over the future of gig economy workers. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) last month\u00a0called out former California Sen. Barbara Boxer on Twitter for serving as a Lyft adviser and writing an op-ed that was critical of AB5.</p><p>             Others have no issue taking a stand.\u00a0Sanders has been active on this issue since 2018, when he introduced the Workplace Democracy Act, which would expand the definition of employer in the U.S. Warren wrote an op-ed in support of AB5 last month. Buttigieg has made the issue key to his economic plan, and he's stood alongside Uber drivers as they protest for better working conditions. California Sen. Kamala D. Harris and Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Joaquin Castro have also said they support the bill.\u00a0</p><p>             There could be fireworks if the issue comes up tonight, because some 2020 candidates supportive of AB5 aren't happy with industry's response. Uber announced yesterday that even when AB5 takes effect in 2020 of next year, it will not automatically reclassify its drivers as employees. Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer, told reporters that the law requires companies to show that contractors are performing work that is outside the core function of the business. Uber, he argued, can meet that qualification because it's a technology platform for several types of marketplaces, though he expect the company's position could be challenged in arbitration and courts.\u00a0</p><p>But candidates like Buttigieg and Sanders are taking issue with that position.\u00a0Sanders tweeted:</p><p>             Watch The Washington Post's debate analysis, starting at 7:30 p.m., and tune in afterward for The Fix's winners and losers.

The bill, which still needs to clear the state assembly, would make California the first state in the country to enact such a ban and set a new precedent for regulation of the rapidly expanding technology.</p><p>\"Body cameras have been used as a tool to build trust between communities and law enforcement and to provide more transparency,\" Democratic California Assemblyman Phil Ting, who wrote the bill, told Reis. \"Putting facial recognition software into those body cameras helps destroy that trust. It turns a tool of transparency and openness into a tool of 24-hour surveillance.\"</p><p>Ting was one of 26 lawmakers\u00a0Amazon's Rekognition software incorrectly matched to a police mugshot in a test run by the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California last month.\u00a0\u00a0While Amazon said the test \"misrepresented\" how police used the technology,\u00a0the stunt\u00a0highlighted widespread concerns over the technology's accuracy. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.)</p><p>The potential abuse of facial recognition, alongside its demonstrated discrepancies in identifying persons of color, has a coalition of 30 civil rights groups asking for an all-out federal ban on police use of the technology.\u00a0San Francisco, Oakland, and Sommerville have all already nacted all-out bans on police use.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.),\u00a0Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.)\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0slamming\u00a0Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0over the\u00a0removal of content shared by an activist claiming abortion isn't medically necessary. The senators say the incident is the latest example of Big Tech's refusal to admit it discriminates against conservative content.</p><p>The senators allege that the involvement of \"two pro-abortion activists with significant ties to abortion-rights advocacy organizations\" in the fact-checking of the content violates Facebook's commitment to independent and nonpartisan fact-checking. They're asking the company to issue a correction, remove any restrictions placed on the page's traffic and submit to an external audit.</p><p>\"Posts by Live Action and Lila Rose were fact-checked by a third party, independently certified by the International Fact Checking Network. We have been in touch with the IFCN which has opened an investigation to determine whether the fact-checkers who rated this content did so by following procedures designed to ensure impartiality,\" Facebook representative Andy Stone wrote in a statement. Stone says Facebook has removed the fact checks that appeared with the posts\u00a0while the case\u00a0is being investigated.</p><p>An independently conducted audit into alleged conservative bias at Facebook released in August provided no evidence of the long-standing claims by Republican lawmakers that the company discriminates against conservative views. As a result of the audit,\u00a0Facebook did remove advertising restrictions on imagery showing human bodies attached to medical tubes, a response to complaints from antiabortion activists.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES:             The Food and Drug Administration is readying new regulation of flavored e-cigarettes after a recent spate of lung illnesses linked to vaping and rising use among teens,my colleague Laurie McGinley reports. The proposed ban would require any companies seeking to sell non-tobacco-flavored vaping products to seek approval from the FDA first.</p><p>\"We can't allow people to get sick. And we can't have our kids be so affected,\" Trump said in an appearance alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. A recent HHS study found that 25 percent of high school students reported using an e-cigarette in the past year, a 5 percent increase from last year. Most reported using fruity or menthol flavors.</p><p>The action from the White House has received bipartisan support.\u00a0\"Vaping targets kids, and these flavors - mint, menthol, gummy bear, Unicorn Milk, lung candy - have been essential to the industry luring children into this new addiction.

Dick Durbin (D.-Ill.).</p><p>             Executives from tech companies such as Twitter, Yelp and Reddit were among a group of 145 chief executives who penned a letter to the Senate calling lawmakers to act on gun violence,my colleague Rachel Siegel writes.</p><p>The letter is the latest sign that corporate America -- and particularly Silicon Valley -- is increasingly becoming a social and political force influencing hot-topic public policy issues such as immigration. \"As leaders of some of America's most respected companies and those with significant business interests in the United States, we are writing to you because we have a responsibility and obligation to stand up for the safety of our employees, customers and all Americans in the communities we serve across the country,\" the executives wrote.</p><p>The executives want lawmakers to implement stronger \"red flag\" laws, which allow for the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. They also demanded an expansion of background checks to all firearms sales.</p><p>             - More news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Today:          </p><p>             - Coming soon:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-2b0ad01a025e4da9ae5533f7f10d143a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1N-K1R1-JB4M-V2V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1788\"/><timeReceived>1:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

They're criticizing the Federal Trade Commission's decision last week to reach a $5 billion settlement with Facebook that could end the agency's investigation into the company's privacy practices, my colleague Tony Romm reported\u00a0Friday.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Though 200 times the size of the previous record fine, critics say it will draw little blood from the company that recorded nearly $56 billion in revenue last year. Facebook's stock price jumped about 2 percent following the first report of deal\u00a0- fueling criticism\u00a0the penalty didn't go far enough.\u00a0</p><p>             The FTC's wide-ranging probe into Facebook's privacy practices was broadly seen as a high-stakes test of whether the federal government's top consumer privacy watchdog had the legal authority and resources to hold Silicon Valley companies to account. Unsatisfied with the commission's decision, Democrats say the FTC's fine signals it's time for Congress to step in on consumer privacy.\u00a0          </p><p>From Mark Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee:</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), chair of the House antitrust subcommittee, said:\u00a0</p><p>The debate over the settlement could spill over into\u00a0tech hearings on the Hill this week, most notably a hearing Cicilline's panel is hosting Tuesday with executives from large technology companies, including Facebook executive Matt Perault. Tomorrow's hearing is part of a broader probe Cicilline's committee has launched into competition and power in the technology sector. While the committee has promised to probe the tech giants, lawmakers say the investigation is also going to review the government's oversight of them, including the FTC.\u00a0</p><p>The fine sets in motion the long-awaited conclusion of the FTC's wide-ranging investigation into Facebook's privacy practices, which began in 2018 after\u00a0reports the political research firm Cambridge Analytica accessed the\u00a0personal data of 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge, which the company's critics said violated a 2011 agreement between\u00a0Facebook and the\u00a0FTC to improve its privacy practices. In addition to imposing a fine, Tony notes\u00a0FTC's settlement could result in unprecedented federal oversight of Facebook. He writes:</p><p> \"The tech giant may have to document every decision it makes about data before offering new products, keep closer watch over third-party apps that tap users' information, and require its top executives, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, to attest that the company adequately has protected privacy. Facebook had agreed to broad contours of those terms as part of confidential settlement talks with the FTC, the Post reported earlier this year.\"</p><p>But many critics worry these remedies don't go far enough\u00a0and were especially concerned that the settlement was approved in a party-line vote, in which the commission's two Democrats voted against the fine.\u00a0</p><p>             But some tech policy experts are pushing back on the lawmakers'\u00a0criticism, contending Congress is to blame for handing Facebook a weak punishment. Some experts noted in the absence of a federal Internet privacy law, the FTC has limited authority to impose legal remedies. From Justin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and policy at Consumer Reports who previously worked at the FTC:\u00a0</p><p>The fine is likely to ramp up pressure on Capitol Hill to pass a national privacy law, which both Republicans and Democrats have said is a key policy priority this year. But as Politico's John Hendel reports, lawmakers face a time crunch with only two weeks to go before the August recess and debate over the bill\u00a0 ismired in partisan divisions.\u00a0Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) blasted the delays during a hearing last week.\u00a0</p><p>\"We've been talking for what, two years about a privacy bill? Haven't seen one, don't know if we'll ever see one,\" Kennedy said. \"We need a microwave, not a Crock-Pot here.\"</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>                          BITS: U.S. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) today\u00a0will send a letter to the FTC asking the agency to investigate how major tech companies curate content.                     The letter sets the stage for a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing focused on allegations that Google censors conservatives, hosted by Cruz tomorrow.       </p><p>          \"Big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter exercise enormous influence on speech,\" Hawley and Cruz write in the letter. \"They control the ads we see, the news we read, and the information we digest. And they actively censor some content and amplify other content based on algorithms and intentional decisions that are completely nontransparent.\"       </p><p>          The senators are hoping\u00a0the FTC can use its regulatory power to compel Facebook, Twitter and Google to divulge their moderation guidelines. Both Cruz and Hawley have accused social media companies of censoring conservatives, claims the White House\u00a0elevated during a summit last week\u00a0that brought together right-wing figures and lawmakers.\u00a0Tech companies have consistently denied claims of bias against conservatives.       </p><p>          The new letter, in addition to recent actions by President Trump, indicate that Republicans may be ramping up attacks on alleged social media bias as the 2020 election nears.       </p><p>          \"Companies that are this big and that have the potential to threaten democracy this much should not be allowed to curate content entirely without any transparency,\" the senators write. \"These companies can greatly influence democratic outcomes, yet they have no accountability to voters.\"       </p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee are considering introducing legislation to\u00a0prevent tech companies with $25 billion or more in revenue from acting as financial institutions, Bloomberg Law's Lydia Beyoud reports. The draft legislation is being circulated ahead of back-to-back Hill\u00a0hearings this week on Facebook's cryptocurrency project Libra, showing how Facebook's foray into financial services could serve as a lightning rod for greater regulation of Big Tech's banking ambitions.</p><p>If enacted, the legislation would bar tech giants from \"offering banking or other financial services, including lending, taking deposits, operating alternative trading systems, or acting as investment companies,\" Beyoud explains.\u00a0</p><p>One key concern seems to be\u00a0cybersecurity risks. \"Facebook intends to manage and hold a detailed digital repository of social, financial, and government data, which may further increase their hacking risks,\" House Financial Services Democrats wrote in an accompanying memo. \"Facebook has had issues with safeguarding its users' information in the past,\" the authors added, pointing to the company's recent $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0over exposing the data of 50 million users as well as several other instances.</p><p>             BYTES: Tech investor and Facebook board member Peter Thiel said at a conference on Sunday nigh that the FBI and CIA\u00a0need to probe Google for allegedly aiding the Chinese military,\u00a0according to a report from David McCabe in Axios. Thiel said there are three questions the federal government needs to be asking the search giant:\u00a0</p><p>1. \"Number one, how many foreign intelligence agencies have infiltrated your Manhattan Project for AI?\"2. \"Number two, does Google's senior management consider itself to have been thoroughly infiltrated by Chinese intelligence?\"3. \"Number three, is it because they consider themselves to be so thoroughly infiltrated that they have engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military... because they are making the sort of bad, short-term rationalistic [decision] that if the technology doesn't go out the front door, it gets stolen out the backdoor anyway?\"</p><p>Google has been under fire, especially from conservatives, for its decision last year to pull out of a key contract with the Pentagon, known as Project Maven, after employees\u00a0protested building artificial intelligence for warfare. The company faced broad backlash for the decision, especially after The Intercept revealed\u00a0Google\u00a0was working on a censored version of its search product -- internally called \"Project Dragonfly\" -- to allow the company to expand its business to China. Google has since said there are no current plans to launch the search engine, but The Intercept reported some employees believe work on the project is continuing.\u00a0</p><p>Thiel is the most prominent supporter of the Trump administration in Silicon Valley, and his comments came at\u00a0the National Conservatism Conference, a new event that bills itself as being focused on Trump-era nationalism, McCabe writes. Thiel's speech did not touch on Facebook, but McCabe notes that company's political headaches could be in the spotlight as critics like Hawley are scheduled to speak later this week.\u00a0</p><p>             -- The Trump administration is scrambling to broker a trade agreement with European lawmakers to develop an international system for taxing digital profits, the\u00a0New York Times's Jim Tankersley and Alan Rappeport report. The Treasury Department faces increased pressure to reach an agreement as the\u00a0U.K. is mulling its own revenue tax of 2 percent on large tech companies with users in the region.\u00a0       </p><p>          That's creating jitters among U.S. tech companies in the wake of France's decision to adopt a digital tax last week.\u00a0French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has said the country would be willing to reconsider the 3 percent tax it imposed on U.S. tech companies last week if the Group of 7 can reach an agreement in Chantilly this week, the Times reports. The French tax has been blasted by U.S. tech companies and trade groups, which are looking to Washington for protection.       </p><p>          Republicans in the Senate are trying to smooth the way for trade talks by voting on a quartet of international tax treaties that have been in limbo for nearly a decade. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department, which is investigating the French tax,\u00a0told the Senate Finance Committee\u00a0it is \"considering a range of options,\" the Times reports.\u00a0       </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             Tomorrow:          </p><p>             Coming Up:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-7169bd8c45ae475aaeb758a8594ecda8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK3-9B41-JB4M-V02H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1798\"/><timeReceived>12:57 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), said it's time to look at carefully at any future tech mergers -- and \"supercharge\" the agencies to crack down on monopolies.</p><p>The Technology 202 on Saturday interviewed Warren backstage at the Moody Theater, in a dressing room where photos of rock legends lined the walls.\u00a0Here's our conversation, edited for clarity and brevity:\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>             Technology 202: Google and Amazon are very popular businesses. Why do you think this proposal to break up Big Tech will be a winning strategy with voters?          </p><p>             Warren: \"This is about keeping markets competitive. My proposal will still let any consumer go to Amazon and order a coffee maker for delivery within 48 hours, go to Google and look up the capital of North Dakota and go to Facebook and check out what their old college friends are up to. I propose to separate that platform that consumers use from the ancillary business products that Amazon and Google are able to unfairly promote and that has the consequence of stamping out little businesses, medium-size businesses, start-up businesses. I want to protect competition. The giants can't use the advantage of the platform to wipe out all the competition for what gets sold on the platform.</p><p> \"It's like in baseball. You can be the umpire; that's like the platform. Or you can own the team; that's one of the businesses. But you don't get to be the umpire and own the team in the league.\" (Note: Amazon CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Post.)\u00a0</p><p>             Tech 202: Let's take Amazon first. How would you propose to break Amazon up?\u00a0          </p><p>             Warren:\u00a0It's not even hard. Right now 49 percent of all [online] retail sales come to Amazon. For comparison, about 9 percent of physical retail sales go to Walmart. Any small business that wants to do online retail pretty much has to be on Amazon. They go to Amazon right now, and they're on the platform and Amazon sucks up information about every buyer and every seller. When it spots a profitable business, it has the option of moving in on that profitable business's space, undercutting them - maybe only temporarily\u00a0- on price, moving where they appear on the platform back to page 9, and killing off the competitor business and sucking up the business for themselves.\u00a0</p><p>My proposal simply says, you can operate the platform. But\u00a0platform does not own the auxiliary businesses. They have to be spun into their own businesses. It's actually not that hard to break them apart.\u00a0</p><p>             Tech 202: But for consumers, if Amazon is offering a lower price . . .          </p><p>             Warren:\u00a0Are you sure it's a lower price, did you check page 6?</p><p>             Tech 202: You just said that they can undercut on price.\u00a0          </p><p>             Warren:\u00a0Temporarily. That's what they did with Diapers.com. This is another feature of the problem.</p><p>             (Note from Tech 202: Though Warren's focus has been on small businesses who sell via Amazon's website, she used an example of Diapers.com, a would-be\u00a0e-commerce competitor, to show how Amazon cuts prices to compete.)          </p><p>             Warren:\u00a0It's not on the Amazon website, so this is a little bit of a different example of what goes on.\u00a0It lowers its price to below cost. There's no way Diapers.com can survive it.</p><p>The business strategy [from Amazon] is to lower our price enough that Diapers.com just can't make it. After they make this announcement, they offer to buy Diapers.com. Diapers.com agrees because they have two choices, get sold or die. They let themselves get sold, they make some money on the sale, and Amazon no longer has a competitor. The price of diapers goes back up.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>             Tech 202: Do you expect to introduce legislation in the Senate on this?          </p><p>             Warren:\u00a0Yes. I've been working on antitrust issues for years. This is part of an extension of other legislation that I've introduced, other speeches that I've given, other policy papers I've put out. It's part of a much larger piece about protecting competition and not permitting industry giants to snuff out competition.\u00a0</p><p>             Tech 202: When can we expect you to introduce legislation?\u00a0</p><p>             Warren:\u00a0I don't know.</p><p>             Tech 202: You called out Facebook, Google and Amazon. Why not Apple?\u00a0</p><p>             Warren:\u00a0They should be on the list. There's no special reason. These were the three where it was easiest to make the example. Apple it's true as well. Apple can run the platform or they can sell the apps. But they can't compete with other individuals on selling the apps at the same time that they're running the platform and sucking all the information off the platform and making decisions about whose apps are going to be at the top of the platform and who's going to be way in the back where you never find them.\u00a0</p><p>             Tech 202: What about the telecom providers?          </p><p>             Warren:\u00a0Yup, I'm already on record on that. These are all related to each other.\u00a0</p><p>             Tech 202: How does this impact your position in Silicon Valley? Do you still plan to raise money and have campaign events there?\u00a0          </p><p>             Warren:\u00a0I'm not in Washington to work for the billionaires. I'm in Washington to try to make government work for everyone else.\u00a0</p><p>             Tech 202: But they've played a crucial part in funding Democratic candidates so how does that impact your path forward?\u00a0          </p><p>             Warren:\u00a0You know I'm not doing closed door fundraisers with millionaires, but I already announced that policy.\u00a0</p><p>             Tech 202: In your post, you raised a lot of the privacy concerns that come up with Facebook. As you think about that, how does that affect how your campaign uses social media and tools like Facebook?\u00a0          </p><p>             Warren:\u00a0We use the same tools as everyone else, and we worry about those tools the same way as everyone else.</p><p>Facebook is an example of the problem we've got.</p><p>Facebook looked over and saw that people were migrating off Facebook over to WhatsApp. They had two choices, they could get better, which is what happens in a competitive market. Or they could use their enormous size to buy WhatsApp and then suck all of the data out of WhatsApp. They chose the second path. I propose that merger be unwound. That would give consumers an option.\u00a0</p><p>Venture capital right now refers to the area around Facebook, Amazon and Google as the 'kill zone' because small businesses and start-ups that get too close and look like they might compete with those giants for business get killed. Investment is going down.\u00a0</p><p>             Tech 202: There is some concern that these ecosystems are very intertwined. The\u00a0companies invest in start-ups, they're also acquiring start-ups which puts more money back into the venture capital system. How do you avoid unintended consequences on innovation if you break the companies up?\u00a0          </p><p>             Warren:\u00a0I think what we have right now is the unintended consequence. The giants are destroying competition in one area after another. It's the job of law to enforce the rules to stop them. That's how competition will flourish in this marketplace. The country had to do this 120 years ago. We need to do it again.\u00a0</p><p>Warren's proposal to break up Big Tech sparked heated debate on social media, where many technologists criticized her proposal.\u00a0</p><p>From Andreessen\u00a0Horowitz's Benedict Evans:</p><p>Several venture capitalists circulated a criticism of the proposal from the blog Truth on the Market. From Andreessen's Steven Sinofsky:</p><p>Mathew Ingram, of the Columbia Journalism Review, is skeptical whether this is an issue most Americans care about:</p><p>But others in Silicon Valley came to Warren's defense. Kim-Mai Cutler, of Initialized Capital, said:</p><p>             BITS: As 2020 candidates like Warren\u00a0take aim at Facebook, Google and other tech giants, it's             \u00a0opening up a new rift between the Democratic party and the industry it's been courting for much of the last decade,\u00a0my colleagues Tony Romm and Brian Fung report.          </p><p> \"The senator's threat sent shock waves through Silicon Valley, where for years, tech companies enjoyed close ties to national Democrats who wanted to burnish their digital credentials and benefit from tech executives' deep pockets,\"\u00a0\u00a0my colleagues wrote.\u00a0</p><p>Warren's proposal and other 2020 candidates' criticisms of the industry\u00a0highlight how these companies have fallen from grace in recent years. In the early days of President Obama's 2008 campaign, he famously appeared at Google. Whether or not any current Democratic primary candidates make similar pilgrimages will be telling.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: President Trump told Republican donors it was \"fake news\" that he called the chief executive of Apple \"Tim Apple\" at a White House event last week,according to Jonathan Swan of Axios.\u00a0Two donors told Swan they didn't understand why he would make such a claim, especially because the incident was captured on video. \"Republican donors in attendance called it one of Trump's weirdest lies ever,\" Swan reports.\u00a0</p><p>\"Trump told the donors\u00a0that he actually said 'Tim Cook Apple'\u00a0really fast, and the 'Cook'\u00a0part of the sentence was soft,\" Swan reported. \"But all you heard from the 'fake news,'\u00a0he said, was 'Tim Apple.'\"</p><p>As we wrote in last week's newsletter, the moment was a viral sensation. Apple chief executive Tim Cook took the moment in jest, and his\u00a0Twitter handle remains Tim Apple.</p><p>             BYTES: Facebook sued two Ukrainian developers for stealing users' data and injecting advertising into their News Feeds with quiz app plug-ins,the Verge's Adi Robertson reports.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Competition concerns about tech titans are growing around the world, with European regulators taking the lead on antitrust issues that could have significant implications here at home.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The British government released a report yesterday stating the country needs to overhaul its antitrust and merger enforcement rules to adapt to the changing digital economy. The report, ordered by the country's top treasury official, recommends the United Kingdom establish a new digital markets regulator charged with policing the conduct of large technology companies\u00a0such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. (Amazon chief Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"These policies would create substantial benefits for UK consumers, businesses trying to start up and scale up in the UK, and greater predictability for the major digital companies,\" wrote Jason Furman, chair of the digital competition expert panel. \"Effective implementation in the UK could also serve as a model for the many governments around the world wrestling with these same questions.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.K.'s new antitrust recommendations aren't the only reason tech\u00a0companies need to watch what's happening on the other side of the pond. Yesterday Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple with\u00a0the European Commission.</p><p>             Together, these actions mean Silicon Valley should perhaps be more worried about the regulatory climate in Europe than what's happening in its own backyard. The U.K.'s report offered tangible and enforceable recommendations that British policymakers might be able to put into action much more quickly than any effort to break up all the country's largest technology companies, such as the one Warren is proposing.          </p><p>Even if Warren does manage to secure the White House, there are still big\u00a0questions about how she would carry out her broad plan to bust companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook. The Massachusetts senator\u00a0has not yet introduced legislation on the subject. And as we've seen with the Trump administration's challenges to the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, trying to break up big companies\u00a0would likely result in tough court battles.</p><p>The E.U.\u00a0is arguably the toughest global regulato\u00a0on tech issues, doling out record-setting fines in antitrust cases against companies such as Google. And its competition chief is hard at work to make sure the E.U. is prepared to address fresh antitrust concerns,\u00a0scrutinizing issues like data collection.\u00a0</p><p>During her visit to the South by Southwest festival, Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.'s competition commissioner, said by the beginning of April, her special advisers should also publish a report recommending how to modernize the E.U.\u00a0playbook in the era of Amazon, Facebook and artificial intelligence.\u00a0</p><p>Vestager's term is set to end this fall, but if she becomes competition commissioner again, she said the E.U. may\u00a0need new laws to deal with new digital trends.\u00a0</p><p>Vestager is worried that big tech companies\u00a0with broad control and access to data will have unfair competitive advantages. She's also concerned about the nature of technology platforms like Amazon that act\u00a0as both a host to\u00a0other sellers and a retailer competing with those sellers.\u00a0</p><p>In an interview, Vestager acknowledged her work could influence other regulators around the world. Right now, U.S. regulators are grappling with some of the same questions, and the Federal Trade Commission is hosting a series of hearings on how it needs to adapt to 21st-century competition issues.\u00a0</p><p>\"Inspiration --\u00a0I think sometimes that travels much, much faster and much, much further than having one global regulator,\" Vestager said.</p><p>             In its complaint with Vestager's commission\u00a0against Apple, Spotfiy accuses the phone-maker of abusing its influence over its App Store and unfairly \"taxing\" apps such as Spotify that compete with the phone-maker's own streaming service.          </p><p>\"Apple has introduced rules to the App Store that purposely limit choice and stifle innovation at the expense of the user experience - essentially acting as both a player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers,\" Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek said in a statement on the company's website.</p><p>In filing this case with the European Commission, Ek is effectively bringing a U.S. debate to Europe in a decision that could have broad global implications. Last weekend, Warren told The Technology 202 that Apple should not be permitted to play both roles and should be on the list of companies broken up.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation into Facebook's data-sharing deals with other large technology companies, according to the New York Times's Michael LaForgia, Matthew Rosenberg and Gabriel J.X. Dance.\u00a0A grand jury in New York has subpoenaed records from at least two smartphone makers that had partnerships with Facebook, which gave them broad access to the data of hundreds of millions of people.\u00a0</p><p> \"We are cooperating with investigators and take those probes seriously,\" a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. \"We've provided public testimony, answered questions and pledged that we will continue to do so.\"</p><p>The phone-makers were among more than 150 companies, including Amazon, Apple and Sony, that had data-sharing deals with Facebook, first reported by the New York Times last year. Many were phased out over the last two years.\u00a0</p><p>Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) praised the investigation on Twitter:</p><p>             NIBBLES: Many members of the Paypal\u00a0mafia became more successful after leaving the company. Now as Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest, Lyft\u00a0and a host of other prominent tech startups prepare for initial public offerings, venture capitalists are bracing for a wave of new startups that these companies' departing employees will create,reports Erin Griffith of the New York Times.\u00a0</p><p> \"It's part of Silicon Valley's often-incestuous circle of life,\" Griffith writes. \"The start-up world projects a meritocratic image, but in reality, it is a small, tightknit club where success typically hinges on whom you know. In this model, employees of tech start-ups frequently leave the companies once they have been enriched by their firms' initial public offerings. Then networks of alumni from these companies - called mafias - support their peers' new businesses with hiring, advice and money.\"</p><p>As the New York Times writes about the new mafias, it also resurfaced an incredible photo of the PayPal folks.

But Europe's competition commission is already taking action.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The European Union's antitrust enforcer announced yesterday\u00a0it\u00a0would launch a formal probe into whether Amazon is abusing its dual position as both a platform for individual sellers and a retailer of its own products, my colleagues Rachel Siegel and Jay Greene report. The bloc's competition authority plans to look into whether Amazon is using the data it collects from the third-parties that sell through its platform to undercut competitors.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The E.U.'s top competition chief Margrethe Vestager said increased online shopping has brought more consumer choice and better prices - fostering more competition.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We need to ensure that large online platforms don't eliminate these benefits through anti-competitive behavior,\" Vestager said.\u00a0Amazon told my colleagues in a statement it would cooperate fully with the E.U. \"and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\" (Amazon chief executive founder and owner Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>             The moves in the European Union signal that despite more activity in Washington aimed at reining in big tech, it's still mainly noise and the real center of activity is still across the Atlantic.          </p><p>The E.U. announced its probe just a day after Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.),\u00a0the chair of the House Judiciary subcommittee focused on antitrust, blasted U.S. enforcers on Tuesdat for not doing enough to rein in the technology industry as executives from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google testified on the Hill. He said the lack of regulatory scrutiny of competition in the tech industry in the United States has created \"defacto immunity\" for the tech platforms..\u00a0</p><p>\"This trend is not the inevitable consequence of technological progress,\" Cicilline said at a hearing on Tuesday. \"It is the result of policy choices we are making as a country.\"</p><p>Cicilline's criticism of the top U.S. antitrust enforcers - the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice - come on the heels of a flurry of antitrust activity in Washington. His committee has launched a broad, bipartisan probe into competition in the technology industry. Meanwhile, Amazon is under closer watch after the FTC and DOJ divvied up oversight of the e-commerce giant, Facebook, Google and Apple.\u00a0</p><p>             Meanwhile, action\u00a0in Europe has\u00a0escalated. In a similar but separate case yesterday, Germany's competition agency, the Bundeskartellamt, said it reached a settlement with Amazon that will result in the company making changes to its dealings with sellers. The agreement will wind down the authority's eight-month probe into the company, and require Amazon to give sellers at least 30 days notice before suspending their accounts.</p><p>Vestager has also already levied more than $9 billion in fines against Google for antitrust violations. She's also forced other companies like Apple to pay back billions in taxes. The E.U. competition authority is also reportedly probing Apple following a complaint from Spotify that the company's Apple Music service has an unfair advantage over other competing music streaming apps.\u00a0</p><p>             But yesterday's announcement is\u00a0a reminder that the E.U. and Washington have similar concerns.\u00a0 Amazon and Facebook bore the brunt of the scrutiny this week in Washington.</p><p>The heightened look at Amazon was highlighted by one\u00a0particular attendee. As Cicilline pressed Amazon executive Nate Sutton, observers noted that Lina Khan, a legal scholar who has been called Amazon's \"antitrust antagonist,\" was sitting behind him.\u00a0</p><p>Cicilline suggested Amazon's current business model could give the company an unfair advantage and pressed\u00a0Sutton on how it uses the data it collects from third-party sellers.\u00a0</p><p>\"You are selling your own products on a platform you control and they're competing with products from other sellers,\" Cicilline said.</p><p>Sutton argued that Amazon was engaging in the same tactics that many physical retailers do in selling its own products. He also denied the company uses data it collects to benefit its own sales.\u00a0</p><p>\"The difference is Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data on millions of purchases and billions in commerce and can manipulate algorithms on its platform and favor its own product. That is not the same as a local retailer,\" Cicilline pushed back.</p><p>Matthew Stoller, an Open Markets Institute fellow who has advocated for breaking up the tech giants, said:</p><p>Amazon faced a lot of heat during Tuesday's hearing, while a committee Republicandefended the positive benefit the company had in her community -- underscoring how U.S. lawmakers may be much more wary of cracking down than European regulators.\u00a0Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) said he comes from a rural area where there is little access to big box retailers.\u00a0</p><p>\"So when we're talking about competition and all of this, I also think we've got to remember at no point in time, from my house in Dickinson, North Dakota, have I had more access to more diverse and cheap consumer products,\" he said. \"Things that often would require a plane ticket or a nine-hour car ride to buy can now be brought to our house. So I think, when we're talking about consumers, we need to remember that side of it too.\"</p><p>             Correction: A previous version of this article used an incorrect gender pronoun to refer to Armstrong.\u00a0          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Regulators and industry leaders worry that Telsa's race to launch untested and unregulated self-driving technology could result in \"crashes, lawsuits and confusion,\" my colleague Faiz Siddiqui reports.</p><p>Tesla's critics say its plans to forgo\u00a0complex sensor technology standard in the industry and allow users to use autonomous driving in complex city landscapes could result in significant danger. \"And because autonomous vehicles are largely self-regulated - guided by industry standards but with no clearly enforceable rules - no one can stop the automaker from moving ahead,\" Faiz writes.</p><p>Tesla has pointed to its track record of safety with its Autopilot program, but watchdogs at Consumer Reports and the National Safety Council say that the company's semiautonomous driving system has also resulted in major accidents and reckless behavior from drivers.</p><p>\"If the regulators don't do something about it, then the next place there's going to be a challenge will be in the courts when somebody gets hurt,\" one former transportation official told Faiz. \"Those mistakes are going to make a skeptical public even more skeptical and are going to delay the implementation of a technology that could save up to 40,000 lives a year.\"</p><p>Tesla competitors Waymo and\u00a0Uber have a much more cautious timeline for\u00a0testing driverless vehicles, limiting their tests to states that have approved the technology and shutting down experiments after accidents. Tesla is one of the few major car companies with autonomous vehicles to decline to voluntarily report its safety findings to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Google's political ads database continues to have inaccuracies nearly a year after launch,the Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer and Patience Haggin report. The company has failed to catalogue recent ads for both presidential and congressional candidates for both parties, raising concerns that the company could also be missing attempts by foreign actors to influence the 2020 election.</p><p>While the Journal was unable to identify the exact extent of the discrepancies, reporters found multiple instances of political advertising that was mislabeled or not labeled at all. In the spring, Google listed ads from Trump, Sen. Kamala D.

Her team is probing whether Amazon uses the data it collects from businesses that sell products on its platform to inform its own product sales and undercut its competitors.\u00a0\u00a0(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.\u00a0Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Since it's not given that I can continue for the commissioner for competition, I would like to take more decisive steps before I have to go,\" Vestager told a small group of reporters at South by Southwest. \"We're pushing it for obvious reasons.\"\u00a0</p><p>             As Europe seeks to crack down on Big Tech, Vestager is especially focused on the competition issues that arise\u00a0when companies are both\u00a0marketplaces that host other sellers -- and retailers competing to peddle their own products. Vestager wants to make sure the biggest players that drive the digital economy -- a la Amazon -- are not abusing their market dominance and hurting consumers as they use data from competitors\u00a0to inform their own business decisions.\u00a0          </p><p>A\u00a0formal case against Amazon\u00a0could set the tone for how policymakers across the world -- even in the U.S. -- might treat the issue.\u00a0</p><p>          It extends\u00a0far beyond one\u00a0e-commerce giant, Vestager told me.\u00a0\"Amazon is not the only one,\" Vestager said.\u00a0\"Google also has this nature because they also are being the navigation tool to find a lot of businesses, businesses that they themselves compete with.\"\u00a0       </p><p>Vestager said Google Shopping is another example of her worries. In 2017, she fined Google for steering customers to its own service that lets people compare products from around the Web over competing online shopping services.</p><p>             That\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0fine and others\u00a0have built Vestager's reputation as Silicon Valley's top nemesis across the pond.\u00a0And\u00a0at a time when many American politicians are just\u00a0talking about antitrust and reining in Big Tech, Vestager has built a record on taking action. She\u00a0also fined the search engine a record-setting $5 billion for forcing Android phone manufacturers to pre-install the Google search app and Chrome Web app on the phones. She's also fined Amazon and Apple for failing to pay taxes.</p><p>             As 2020 Democratic presidential candidates steered the conversation at South by Southwest toward how they would regulate the technology industry, there was perhaps no more approporiate year for Vestager to attend the festival.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>But her approach differs from that of\u00a0presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who gave an impassioned pitch at the festival for her plan to break up Big Tech.\u00a0</p><p>When I asked her about Warren's plan, Vestager said Europe could also try to break up the companies through legislation.\u00a0\"It would for us be an issue of the very, very, very last resort,\" she said.\u00a0          </p><p>Warren (D-Mass.) and Vestager\u00a0are concerned about the same competition issue, though.\u00a0In our interview, Warren said she wanted to break up Amazon so it could not unfairly use the data it collects from sellers to compete with them.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's like in baseball.

However, it's unclear whether they will actually be effective in changing these private companies' behavior - especially because they don't seem to have a plan of action beyond today's hearing.          </p><p>A spokesman for the committee told me he was not aware of any plans to introduce diversity-related legislation.</p><p>And a spokeswoman for the Congressional Black Caucus did not respond when I asked if there were any plans\u00a0this Congress for legislation addressing the issue. The CBC previously\u00a0led efforts in Congress focused on diversifying the tech industry, such as the Tech 2020 initiative, making trips to Silicon Valley to meet with tech leaders and pressure them to diversify their boards and workforces.</p><p>             Although diversity advocates say they welcome new forums to discuss the pressing issue - and acknowledge policymakers can draw needed attention to it - many are skeptical it could result in immediate change.          </p><p>\"It's not clear what Congress's role could be and how practical, honestly, that is as an immediate term or short-term driver of change,\" said Joelle Emerson, founder and chief executive\u00a0of Paradigm, which consults with technology companies on diversity issues.</p><p>Even Luckie's prepared testimony offers few specific suggestions.</p><p>He will, however, thoroughly outline what he sees as the problem. He will testify that a lack of diversity throughout technology companies' ranks is contributing to oversights that result in high-profile slips that impact minorities or women. He'll point to an Amazon algorithm that preferred male candidates to female candidates for technical roles, or Google's Photos app automatically labeling images of African Americans as gorillas. And when Apple released its Health Kit app in 2014, it tracked a wide range of vital functions - including, even, copper intake - but it did not track menstrual cycles. (Amazon's founder and CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>\"There are a number of reasons some of these oversights happen, including overreliance on algorithms, teams without diverse voices, or lack of input from communities of color,\" he will say. \"Most of these oversights can be mitigated by employing and retaining staff from diverse backgrounds in an environment that welcomes all voices. Statistically, tech companies are not doing that.\"</p><p>             And some potential solutions may just be too complex for Congress to take on - at least in the near term.          </p><p>Another witness, Nicol Turner Lee from the Brookings Institution, will suggest that Congress should modernize civil rights laws to address issues such as bias in artificial intelligence. But technologies like artificial intelligence are so quickly evolving that\u00a0it may be difficult to put specific new laws on the books.\u00a0Yet even if that were to happen -- especially in a Democrat-controlled House,\u00a0the party may struggle to push any updates through a Republican-controlled Senate and White House.\u00a0</p><p>There could be something Congress could do with the laws it has now:\u00a0Turner Lee says in her testimony that tech products shouldn't be above existing laws protecting against discrimination, and she thinks lawmakers should look at how employment and housing law will be applied to new technologies.</p><p>             Absent action from lawmakers, employees are taking action into their own hand. Luckie, who wrote his memo right before leaving Facebook, is an example of the intense pressure that employees can put\u00a0on Silicon Valley leaders from inside the companies.          </p><p>For almost five years, many of the technology companies have released annual reports on the diversity of their workforces, following a blog post from a former Pinterest engineer called, \"Where are the numbers?\" More recently, employees at Google walked out\u00a0in November to protest the company's handling sexual harassment claims, creating pressure for the company to change its policy that requires employees to settle such claims through private arbitration.</p><p>             As he takes the hot seat today, Luckie's most effective strategy might be to challenge the companies to change directly. Though no companies are testifying in today's hearing, their hefty Washington operations probably will be watching.</p><p>Luckie plans to advise them to have more focus groups with diverse communities so they can avoid some of the oversights they've made in the past. He'll also warn them there's a cost to their failure to address diversity.</p><p>\"Our shine cannot be denied,\" he'll say. \"Tech companies need to recognize the greatness or risk losing some of the industries' most brilliant minds.\"</p><p>             He won't just be using his testimony to spotlight the issue.

Posts and pages selling or promoting the drugs appeared across a wide range of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, according to research by\u00a0Internet safety nonprofit Digital Citizens Alliance and cyberintelligence firm GiPEC shared exclusively with me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even as recently as this week, more than a dozen Facebook pages, YouTube videos and an Instagram account were selling or promoting prescription steroid and appearance enhancing drugs were still live on the platforms. After a Washington Post inquiry, the social media companies removed the pages and posts violating their terms of service, which prohibit illegal drug sales.</p><p>             Lawmakers in Washington and around the world are escalating their pressure on\u00a0social networks to do more to stamp out harmful content on their platforms -- from accounts illegally selling opioids to violent extremism, like the recent\u00a0videos showing the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre. Congress is this week expected to scrutinize the tech platforms' content moderation efforts as the Senate Commerce Committee hosts a hearing on \"Mass Violence, Extremism, and Digital Responsibility,\" where executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google will testify about the companies' efforts to remove violent content from their platforms.\u00a0          </p><p>             Under pressure, the companies are making greater investments in hiring human moderators and developing artificial intelligence to detect problematic posts. But some say the persistence of accounts pushing illegal steroid sales raises questions about the efficacy of those investments.\u00a0          </p><p> \"The model of moderation that platforms use is structurally inadequate to the task,\"\u00a0Roger McNamee, a Facebook investor who has emerged as one of the most prominent critics of Big Tech, told me. \"It appears that the moderation is not actually designed to eliminate those things, it's designed to eliminate the political blowback.\"          </p><p>The technology companies say they are trying to address the issue of problematic content.\u00a0Facebook said it removes content that violates its policies as it finds it. \"Our Community Standards make it very clear that buying, selling or trading drugs, which include steroids, is not allowed anywhere on Pages, in advertising, or anywhere else on Facebook,\" said Facebook spokeswoman Crystal Davis.</p><p>YouTube said it removed 90,000 videos for violating its \"harmful or dangerous policy\" in the second quarter of 2019, and the company works closely with experts including emergency room doctors and pediatricians to develop its policies. \"We've been investing in the policies, resources and products needed to live up to our responsibility and protect the YouTube community from harmful content,\" YouTube spokesman Farshad Shadloo said.</p><p>Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough pointed to the company's existing policies, which state Twitter can't be used for \"any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of illegal activities.\"</p><p>Pages, groups and videos pushing steroids could be found through searching for keywords like Human Growth Hormone or Humatrope. Once users land on one of those pages, dealers push using the drugs and may include a way to contact them, like an email address or WhatsApp number.</p><p>In some cases, the content surfaced to researchers as \"Suggested Pages\" or \"Recommended Videos\" they might like due to their searches. While YouTube has recently launched features attempting to reduce illicit content, it only works on English-speaking videos. The researchers found suggested steroid videos alongside videos in foreign languages like Arabic, according to screenshots reviewed by The Post.</p><p>In one example, a Facebook page called \"Landmarkchem Raw steroid powders,HGH,peptides &amp; semi-finished for sale\" offered a variety of steroids via Facebook's \"shop\" function, which is intended to help merchants sell products.\u00a0The researchers contacted Landmark through an email address found on Facebook, and they were offered a wide range of drugs that are supposed to require a prescription, according to emails I reviewed.\u00a0</p><p>The researchers purchased two vials labeled Human Growth Hormone, a substance that is often abused to enhance muscle mass or athletic performance, and three vials of an anabolic steroid known as Deca Durabolin, which is only available with a prescription due to potential side effects such as liver damage. The researcher paid $360 for the drugs via the PayPal-owned platform Venmo. (Such a transaction violates Venmo's terms of service). Drug testing showed that the Deca Durabolin appeared to be legitimate, but the HGH was not - leaving questions about what they were sold.</p><p>Digital Citizens Alliance director Tom Galvin says the continued presence of steroids on the platforms underscores that the tech companies'\u00a0approach to content moderation has been too reactionary. He said the companies have been doing more work to stamp out opioid sales following research last year that showed how those drugs were being sold on platforms like Instagram, but he says there hasn't been as much public pressure in recent years for them to address steroid and other performance enhancing drug sales.\u00a0</p><p>             \"The platforms tend to only act when faced with pressure, whether that's advertiser pressure or regulatory pressure,\" Galvin said. \"It's a game of Whac-a-Mole.

ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, is based in China, which requires social media companies operating in the country to block news and content that goes against state ideology.</p><p>Researchers pointed to Beijing's use of Douyin, the Chinese-version of TikTok, to spread state propaganda about the recent Hong Kong protests as a key example of how the app is used to manipulate public perception.\u00a0\"They are making the commercial media repost or reproduce what has been produced by state media,\" Yaqiu Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, told Drew and Tony. \"And they are forcing censorship to create a narrative in the sense that this is not what happened.\" On TikTok, Drew and Tony found just 11 posts with hashtags related to the protests, a significantly small amount than the thousands of posts on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>TikTok's parent company ByteDance, told Drew and Tony\u00a0it had a U.S.-specific moderation team for the app and did not apply any Chinese laws to its moderation. But researchers still find\u00a0 troubling the limited amount of information the company provides on the removal of\u00a0U.S. content, especially given China's recent influence campaigns on Twitter and Facebook. \"If they're willing to do this on Twitter and Facebook, of course they're going to want to do it on their own platform,\" said Elliott Zaagman, a writer and co-host of a popular podcast on the Chinese tech industry.</p><p>             NIBBLES: The Senate Intelligence Committee is expected to release a report in the coming weeks on\u00a0ways to improve U.S. defenses against disinformation in 2020,the Wall Street Journal's Dustin Volz and Deepa Seetharaman report. But a recent meeting between big tech companies and U.S. national security officials highlighted troubling divisions between the 2020 election's two lines of defense against foreign influence and disinformation.\u00a0</p><p>At the core of the conflict is intelligence agencies' push for information that could put tech companies afoul of mounting government enforcement over privacy violations, they report. Both social media companies and government agencies have increased their efforts to police\u00a0election disinformation since 2016. But\u00a0tech companies still remain wary of\u00a0cooperating with security agencies more than six years after former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed the extent of the industry's partnerships with government, Dustin and Deepa report.</p><p>\"This is such a complicated space,\" April Doss, a former intelligence lawyer at the National Security Agency, told the Journal. \"Our traditional models of public-private interaction really don't have a template for how to handle this.\"\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: House lawmakers are surveying consumers as part of a wide-ranging investigation into the business practices of Big Tech,Bloomberg News's Spencer Soper reports. The eight-page survey, reviewed by Bloomberg, asks consumers who they consider the top providers of services \"such as mobile apps and app stores, search engines, digital advertising, social media, messaging, online commerce and logistics as well as cloud computing\" and what they spend with each company, Spencer reports.</p><p>While the survey doesn't name any tech companies, the release follows requests to Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Apple seeking information about their acquisitions and business. The survey could provide key insights to lawmakers in the House as they weigh how to best enforce and possibly update antitrust regulations with regard to digital competition. \"If the panel finds competition is so scant that the customers of big technology companies have no viable alternatives, it justifies further scrutiny of business practices as well as mergers and acquisitions,\" Spencer adds.</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Coming soon:          </p><p>Trevor Noah interviews Microsoft's Brad Smith:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-822d4527d1e64accbecb15f93d36fd7e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2H-FRJ1-JB4M-V02C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1716\"/><timeReceived>12:55 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) and a law firm - showed no evidence of that bias, but that didn't stop Republicans and left-leaning civil rights groups\u00a0alike from slamming it for being insufficient.\u00a0Facebook commissioned the report last year, and Kyl and his team met with more than 130 conservatives to compile their concerns. However, critics said that the report would have been more effective if it relied more heavily on internal data provided by the company.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has emerged as one of the most vocal opponents of the tech industry on Capitol Hill, blasted the report. He challenged the methodology of the third-party audit, which relied heavily on interviews with conservatives about their concerns.\u00a0</p><p>\"Merely asking somebody to listen to conservatives' concerns isn't an 'audit,' it's a smokescreen disguised as a solution,\" Hawley told me in a statement. \"Facebook should conduct an actual audit by giving a trusted third party access to its algorithm, its key documents, and its content moderation protocols. Then Facebook should release the results to the public.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, civil rights groups on the left were also critical of the report,\u00a0with the group Muslim Advocates also calling it a\u00a0\"smokescreen\" - for very different reasons. The groups accused the company of pandering to conservatives and argued that the report could undermine efforts by Facebook to address other content problems on its platform - including hate speech and disinformation.\u00a0</p><p>\"This review is a make-believe solution in search of a phantom problem,\" said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, in a statement. \"Rather than allowing baseless allegations of so-called anti-conservative bias to distract them, Facebook officials should focus on the civil and human rights problems and white supremacist propaganda overrunning its platform.\"\u00a0</p><p>             The swift blowback\u00a0highlights the fact that\u00a0Facebook seems to\u00a0consistently find\u00a0itself in lose-lose positions in Washington as it tries to appease both political parties on a host of issues, from privacy to content moderation to disinformation and the scope of its power. Skepticism of the tech industry is increasing on both ends of the political spectrum - but the parties have very different motivations for targeting tech that can often conflict.\u00a0          </p><p>Republicans are most worried about perceived anti-conservative bias, while Democrats on the Hill and running for president\u00a0are primarily concerned about addressing election-related disinformation and online extremism, especially as social media's role in recent mass shootings is increasingly in the spotlight.</p><p>Facebook is not the only tech company navigating this tension.\u00a0Google and Twitter have also denied repeated allegations that they're censoring conservatives while facing criticism from the left they're not doing enough to stamp out problematic content. But Facebook is the only prominent company to proactively try to address these concerns and announced it would tweak an ad policy in response to its report.</p><p>As my colleague Marie Baca noted yesterday, the report highlighted the fact that Facebook has the power to limit free speech, although there isn't evidence that it has. The report also said Facebook has taken some small steps to address conservatives'\u00a0concerns, including loosening its policies around shocking and sensational content to allow\u00a0the appearance of\u00a0some antiabortion ads showing infants receiving medical treatment.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook noted the\u00a0study began well before headlines about anti-conservative bias increased in recent weeks. President Trump has been escalating his accusations against the industry, recently hosting a \"Social Media Summit\" at the White House where he blasted tech companies for silencing conservative voices. None of the tech companies attended the event.</p><p>It doesn't appear the report will slow down Team Trump's attacks on Big Tech. Hours after Facebook rolled it out, Donald Trump, Jr., was on Twitter criticizing Facebook's power, apparently in response to the company's new news curation feature. From Twitter:</p><p>Republican anger threatens to boil over on the Hill, though threats don't always mean tangible action. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), one of the lawmakers most concerned about anti-conservative bias, has suggested Congress may need to consider changes to a key legal shield that protects companies from lawsuits for content others post on their websites. He's also floated the possibility of\u00a0antitrust action, which is something Democrats and the Trump Justice Department are also examining. Cruz did praise\u00a0the report for accurately identifying many of the concerns he has about bias at Facebook.\u00a0</p><p>\"It is good to see Facebook is taking those concerns seriously,\" his office said in a statement. \"Sen.\u00a0Cruz\u00a0looks forward to seeing how Facebook's announced policies will be implemented, and for future reports and installments from Sen. Kyl.\"</p><p>Here in Aspen, a top Justice Department official signaled the administration's review of competition in the tech industry is intensifying. Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim also expressed support for a review of the legal shield that protects the tech companies, known as Section 230, but noted it wasn't an antitrust issue.\u00a0</p><p>\"I don't think back when that law was passed the type of online information services that we see today was anticipated by Congress,\" Delrahim said. \"But we should take a look, at almost I think every law, but particularly this law, to see does it make sense?\"</p><p>\"I'm not a huge fan of private lawsuits ... but to the extent that companies internalize externalities of their offerings and make them improve and be more responsible, that can be a positive thing,\" he said. \"So I think a review of Section 230 by those people who care about it is perfectly appropriate.\"</p><p>             To readers: The Technology 202 will publish on Tuesday, Wednesday\u00a0and Thursday\u00a0this week and will take a break the week of Aug. 26 before returning full time after Labor Day.          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             NIBBLES: The Justice Department is intensifying its review of potential antitrust violations by online platforms,\u00a0Delrahim indicated at a tech policy event in Aspen, Colorado,my colleague Tony Romm reports.</p><p>The Justice Department has released few details since announcing its probe of the tech industry in July, but Delrahim said that next steps of a typical investigation could include seeking \"documents and information from parties who might be affected,\" including legally compelling witnesses to provide information if necessary. Delrahim has not officially named any companies targeted\u00a0 by the probe, but Google, Amazon, and Facebook are all likely targets.</p><p>The federal government is also coordinating with states attorneys general, who are exploring their own investigation according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. Delrahim says that \"more than a dozen or so\" have expressed interest in investigating competition in the tech industry.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Facebook is rolling out its long-anticipated \"Clear History\" tool. But while the new \"Off-Facebook Activity\" will offer users the ability to limit what information Facebook collects from other apps and websites, it's a far cry from what many imagined when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans last year to build a data-clearing tool,my colleague Tony Romm reports.</p><p>The new tool \"disconnects information from being identified to a specific user\" but \"isn't deleted outright.\" Furthermore, the controls don't prevent Facebook from reporting to advertisers when users act on an ad targeted to them.</p><p>Despite its limited function, the company has pegged the tool as a way of rebuilding trust with consumers after Cambridge Analytica. \"We expect this could have some impact on our business,\" Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, told Tony \"but we believe giving people more control over their data is more important.\"</p><p>But as the Wall Street Journal's Christopher Mims points out, the tool - which initially rolled\u00a0out in Ireland, Spain and South Korea - may also be a way to placate regulators. Facebook recently settled with the Federal Trade Commission for $5 billion dollars after a 16-month investigation into its privacy practices.</p><p>             BYTES: Gun resellers are flocking to Facebook's Marketplace, raising scrutiny over the tech giant's ability to police its e-commerce services, Parmy Olson and Zusha Elinsonreport for the Wall Street Journal. Facebook's sales feature, which reaches more than two billion users, explicitly bans the sales of guns but sellers have skirted the policy by only listing items as cases and signaling their real content by inflated prices, the Journal reports.</p><p>In one case, a seller who listed a gun case for $950 - nearly three hundred times its normal retail price - admitted to Journal reporters over Facebook Messenger that he was selling an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.The seller said within two hours he had received over 30 messages about the item. An analysis by social media research firm Storyful found dozens of similar listings across 10 major U.S. cities when searching for \"gun case\" earlier this month.</p><p>Facebook isn't alone in struggling to regulate the sales of banned firearms and accessories on its platform. A Washington Post investigation earlier this month found that both Amazon and Google struggled with sales of gun parts, a violation of their respective policies.

He called on American and European regulators to \"turn off the white noise\" and pay attention to the fact that countries like China are writing the \"new rules of the internet themselves.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Great Firewall of China means great swaths of what we think of as the internet - Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp included - are unreachable by its citizens and much of the content they can access is heavily censored,\" Clegg said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             These remarks could provide a preview of how Facebook may try to defend itself in Washington as House lawmakers open a wide-ranging probe into competition in the technology sector, and federal regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department signal increased scrutiny could be coming to Silicon Valley as they divvy up oversight of top companies.\u00a0          </p><p>             Clegg's defense also underscores how rapidly the social network's political situation and ambitions have evolved in recent years as Facebook has been battered with controversies, ranging from privacy mishaps to foreign influence during the 2016 election. Just a few years ago, the company looked to China as the next natural market where it could continue its rapid global expansion. But now the company's top leadership increasingly describes China's\u00a0burgeoning tech sector as a formidable threat.\u00a0          </p><p>\"Describing China as a strategic competitor is a far cry from where they were just a few years ago, when [Facebook chief executive Mark] Zuckerberg was posting pictures of morning jogs in Tiananmen Square,\" Peter Singer, a strategist and senior fellow at the New America Foundation, told me. \"It shows just how much has changed, both in politics and in the corporate strategy.\"</p><p>Facebook's China warnings have extended to the company's highest ranks, with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg making similar arguments.\u00a0</p><p>\"Let me share with you something else I heard in my meetings in D.C. And I heard this in private meetings from both sides of the aisle, that while people are concerned with the size and power of tech companies, there's also a concern in the United States with the size and power of Chinese companies, and the realization that these companies are not going to be broken up,\" Sandberg said in an interview with CNBC.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook's characterization of China as a competitor also underscores how the company has forgotten its once intense efforts to expand into the world's largest country. Zuckerberg famously learned Mandarin and even joined a Chinese business school's board, as BuzzFeed's Ryan Mac noted, but the company has now backed off.\u00a0</p><p>Even companies who have been weighing their options in China are invoking nationalism as a defense in Washington. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai hasn't called out China specifically, but in a recent interview on CNN warned that overregulation could benefit tech companies in other countries.\u00a0</p><p>\"There are many countries around the world which aspire to be the next Silicon Valley, and they are supporting their companies, too. So we have to balance both,\" Sundar Pichai said in a June interview. \"This doesn't mean you don't scrutinize large companies, but you have to balance it with the fact that you want big, successful companies, as well.\"</p><p>Some Democrats active on tech policy appear to share some of Silicon Valley's concerns. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) has been sounding the alarm about China's threat to the U.S. tech sector, and while he says more needs to be done to introduce competition in Silicon Valley, he\u00a0also remarked\u00a0earlier this year that breaking up Big Tech could give China a boost.\u00a0</p><p>\"These are now companies that don't exist in an American-only vacuum. These are all global companies,\" the senator told CNBC.\u00a0</p><p>\"I have some concern, as somebody who is very concerned about the rise of China, that if we were to kind of chop off the legs of Facebook and Google, that they might be replaced by Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent - companies that are totally enmeshed with the Chinese government in their global economic plan,\" he added.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0Federal law enforcement is mining drivers' license databases to run facial-recognition searches without consent, according to an investigation by my colleague Drew Harwell. The findings add to growing concerns from both Congress and privacy advocates over the unchecked use of facial recognition technology by the government.</p><p>Records sent to The Washington Post showed that with as little as an email, Federal Bureau of Investigation and\u00a0U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were able to quickly gain access to state Department of Motor Vehicles\u00a0databases that include the photos of millions of Americans, including undocumented immigrants in some states.</p><p>A government watchdog report last month revealed the FBI conducted nearly 400,000 facial recognition searches using state and federal databases in the past five years. But the agency has offered little information about how the searches are used or their rate of success, Drew reports.</p><p>The potential for misuse of the technology, which research has shown can lead to false matches, especially for people with darker skin, worries advocates.</p><p>\"The public doesn't have a way of controlling what information the government has on them,\" Jacinta Gonz\u00e1lez, a senior organizer for the advocacy group Mijente, told Drew. \"And now there's this rapidly advancing technology, with very few guidelines and protections for people, putting all of this information at their fingertips in a very scary way.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0Former defense secretary Jim Mattis met privately with an Amazon executive in charge of selling its cloud computing - just before initiating a contract bidding process that Amazon's critics say favored the company,\u00a0new emails surfaced by the Wall Street Journal's John D. McKinnon reveal. The details could bolster Oracle's\u00a0pending lawsuit that claims the Pentagon unfairly skewed requirements for an eight-figure cloud computing contract toward Amazon.</p><p>Both the Pentagon and Amazon have denied wrongdoing. A government watchdog report also cleared the contract of any foul play earlier this year, but members of Congress have continued to raise questions about the bid process and the pending lawsuit has stalled Amazon from netting the lucrative contract. This week a federal court will begin hearings in the lawsuit, and Oracle has no intention of backing down.</p><p>\"It is highly irregular that the Secretary of Defense attended a small, private dinner for 'off-the-record' discussions with an Amazon sales executive,\" Kenneth Glueck, who runs Oracle's Washington office, told the Journal.</p><p>Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, also owns The Washington Post.</p><p>             BYTES: Advocates are calling for Facebook to better enforce hate speech policies in private groups,my colleague Elizabeth Dwoskin reports. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has hailed private groups as the future of the company, but advocates believe the pivot is \"on a collision course with Facebook's stated goal of cleaning up its platform ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election,\" Elizabeth writes.</p><p>\"Large private groups remain unmoderated black boxes where users can freely threaten vulnerable populations,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, told Elizabeth. \"Without any AI or human moderators, it's easy to orchestrate harassment campaigns ... As Facebook moves to more and more private communication, we're concerned about this delinquency.\"</p><p>Facebook's failure to moderate private groups has raised concerns about several issues: use by white supremacists, the spread of medical misinformation, and most recently abusive content from law enforcement.</p><p>Facebook representative Jen Ridings told Elizabeth that the company uses both human and AI moderators for\u00a0group content. \"There is still more we can do, and we continue to improve our technology to detect violating content,\" Ridings added.</p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - The White House has not invited Twitter or Facebook to attend its social media summit on Thursday,according to CNN's Oliver Darcy.\u00a0People who spoke to CNN on the basis of anonymity told CNN that it wasn't surprising and said the event \"would amount to a\u00a0a right-wing grievance session and was not aimed at seriously discussing some of the issues facing large technology companies.\" The White House declined to comment.
