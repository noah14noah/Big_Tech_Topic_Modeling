other's exports prices are rising for American consumers Argentina applied controls on the amount of foreign currency businesses can buy and the new President of the European Commission finalises the list of people who head Department of the EU's executive and executive body but will usher Le Fondre land reform lobbying system in Brussels that gives big business influence over EU policy when we look at the highs and so if you concentrate just under a really heavy hitters like being then we see that the issue is understood regulation data protection for the really big tech companies this is becoming increasingly one of the most upbeat issues more from Brussels shortly but first Sunday brought a new round of tit for tat tariffs as China and the United States started imposing new taxes on each other's goods the US will begin collecting duties of 15% more than 125 billion $ worth of Chinese imports including smart speakers Bluetooth headphones and shows as part of its retaliation Beijing is imposing 5% tariffs on US crude oil the first time American oil has been targeted since the world's two big economy started their trade war more than a year ago now Sally Z O ahead of Hong Kong's textile council told the BBC how the trade dispute to convince Chinese manufacturers to move abroad China's Labour costs and all the social cost have become quite a lot more expensive than neighbouring countries and so things have been migrating up China and stature closure is not a new story that trade was only a salary at that pace and make things below faster China's not the only one that is under threat who knows a precedent could easily is declared care on Vietnam other places next year so for buyers I think the only viable strategy is to be as personal as adaptive as a cat the tariffs come as both sides are expected to resume talks to end their dispute President Donald Trump says the Chinese are paying a heavy price but several US industries such as clothing and footwear are also facing challenges Steven Mark is executive vice president of the American apparent footwear Association these attacks is that we're gonna start to be collected if not monopoly money extra money you have to pay the us government it is not the Chinese when the Chinese companies that pay these taxes these taxes paid by American companies and ultimately rules up to the American consumer I know people don't want to do that in one race crisis on consumers which have to pay the tax system some place that means you're paying taxes from your investments and from your profits from the salaries of the workers so as companies seek costs rise especially in the United States where they swallow it or pass it on to consumers by increasing prices a question put to Freya Beamish chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics we've seen so far is that their been tariffs placed on other types of goods but not consumer goods until now apart from a very few limited examples one of these examples is washing machines otherwise known as laundry equipment and the price of laundry equipment shot up very fast in America last year because China is such a large producer in may dominate markets all of the other producers look to China for price settings of China is seeing pressures because of these tariffs then that will permeate through the entire supply chain and push up prices for Americans on these types of goods Donald Trump has claimed a trade war is costing China a lot of money but is that really the case when you bear in mind the Chinese yuan currency has dropped in value against the dollar therefore the impact of the Additional taxes or tariffs on goods exported to the US might actually be mitigated by the Chinese products getting cheaper it is not China that pays these tariffs it's partly Chinese producers taking a hit on their margins It's partly US producers taking a hit on their margins but I think now the were interred several rounds of tariffs these

private option people really do want choice in the search market if they can get it we found that about 50% of people said they would really like to try and search engine if it were a sort of personal information but also our own use of this tens of millions of people used to go and most of the people who would like a private options areas have never heard of us and It's been challenging to get the word out because of Google's practices say do you think consumers won't mind if for example Cech has become a bit more complex perhaps prices rise as a result of this I think searches need to become more complex or prices rise work the deal remedy from our perspective it is when you set up the device it gives you a choice of what to engineer like queues and we think many people would prefer to choose private option if that choice was given to them arguably consumers do have a choice because we can go on a number of search engines they just choose the likes of Google perhaps being because they are the biggest well-known and possibly the most efficient search engines available well I enjoyed it actually has been extremely challenging over the past years for people to choose a girl even if they wanted to do for example in Chrome which is the browser that is worshipped in one under the fine it was impossible to set he used a dead girl in Chrome had been told last year more would you like to see changed for Woakesy years the ability for users to really change serious attention so Google like to say it's one click one app done away but the reality is the school was built in to Android and there's no way to change the default search provider so each Android phone chips with jet and you can't change that Google which led to another attention this belt and Google is no facility and dreaded change that and inside Chrome this list of search engine options were not so would really like to see is more toys given to users are there for change provider that's built and Android and to be clear this is available in iOS iOS is the default search engine said we are on the list AK and people still opt to go on Google people not to go I go up to go conduct a girl and our market share on iOS is much higher than a dozen Andrade simply because the choices easier to make iOS it depends on the country but it's between half and 1% in the tablet market for the hire or closer to 1% and high and Moab all were closer to you have 4% but Ireland in dried its lower than that in iOS is closer to 1% is just the case that Google is just bigger brand all round and say therefore people have heard of Google used Google is familiar and say even in the case of iOS where people do have a choice they overwhelmingly choose Google is that really a choice is built them as the default and so most people dot potential defaults and don't even realise that there is a choice even eyewear as the to go into that and change it and yet when we surveyed people people are fed up with the ads fine run internet because of Google search and he would like to try and prise an option but the blue really don't even know we exist when they can give that option today not changed the default because they have a problem with the default I always find that a lot of people do and we think there was a choice in the odd to be able to use of private option we think we could be easily get 5 to 10% of market go up if it changes aren't made what will that mean for your business it would mean probably excess we've been growing organically over time year after year and we think eventually were going to get to that 5 to 10% market share but these practices have been very hard to get the word out to consumers the leagues that's how his game Real wine bag I don't want to come cheap fast or less there is clearly a difference here and how Europeans approach competition policy in comparison to the US in the States are regulators just a little bit more sympathetic towards big tech well I think the the us approaches a little bit more elicit fear relationship with firm with think enterprise and free and present general and I think it's you know from looking at these fines from the us perspective it certainly feels more and more like the EU is a hotbed of political risk and that you know the carrot and stick approach that the EU regulators are favouring one is inclined more sticks and that's creating quite a lot of uncertainty as far as technology is concerned I think this find sets the stage against the backdrop of things like GDP are in and it's increasingly complicated for companies when a company like Google on the name is also the verb Michael Burr is a verb 0 axing as a verb for making a photocopy</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

together in front of Congress we've seen some of them like Mark Zuckerberg and sooner Pichai testify individually on separate occasions but getting them all together like this that was truly a big deal on this was through some of the questions and the themes now because people really wide-ranging you are never sure when members of Congress were going to go next so let's go through what stuck out for for you from each of the CEO's start with Mark Zuckerberg Facebook sure so big so guests from Mark Zuckerberg today was the reasoning and tactics behind Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and really just acquisition strategy in general and the committee is is really trying to get that whether it's Facebook buys smaller companies purely just to eliminate the competition and also whether or not they copy or threaten to copy features from competitors as part of that process and Zuckerberg didn't really have much of an answer other than to say no then there was a really common knowledge that the company he was working on camera features that are similar to those offered by Instagram at the time that he acquired it which should not be that surprising that they would look to acquire is to acquire a company like Instagram but and it's really important because that the behaviour highlighted and some of the document cited by the committee really suggest that that Facebook might have acquired Instagram just to eliminate competition and that's exactly the kind of behaviour is that they are trying to prevent cash in again through the 4 of them each of them had their their tough areas that they were quizzed on and I did feel an added whether you agree with this the CEO of Apple Tim Cook didn't seem to get grilled quite so much Yeah that that's absolutely true and Tim Cook definitely that the fewest questions on though he did take some heat towards the end of the hearing a big focus there was weather at all and you know when it makes it on iPhone apps weather has to abide by the same rules as developers and Apple has guidelines that are in place and a lot for a lot of different reasons but one of those is to prevent copycat apps and apps from just purely copying other apps in the app store at the same time Apple has been accused of making its own apps that compete with others third party apps in the app store and then in some cases temporarily removing those apps that is a big area of focus and Tim Kaine he really just handled that by hammering Hong this idea that you know there are 1.7 million apps in the app store and Apple all the operates 60 of them and trying to emphasise why the app store is good for business and so really give a straight answer to those concerns and then just kind of tried to emphasise that there is a lot of competition in the industry and just very very briefly Lisa in the atmosphere was it it was quite tense Yes it was any other town did seem pretty aggressive Adam the gate C Immediately started with some pretty pointed questions and so does we were holding back no I think maybe with with some of the technical issues they had a suavely the the irony of these big for tech giants on this one and we had to wait a few times as well only adding the build-up of the atmosphere at least Ed Chico the senior tech correspondent business insider in new York Thank you very much for joining us on this will get the views from my guests in a moment but let's take a look at the bigger picture author David day and the editor of the political website the American prospect his new book monopolised looks at the rise of big business I spoke to him earlier to get his thoughts on this I think there are a number of ways you can attack this problem I think there is a silver bullet I think you can talk about break-ups and you can talk about I testing a certain business lines maybe Facebook and Instagram our very best to one another or Emerson and Amazon web services for good draw and a double play Kurds and attack components but could also see some regulatory action taken to clear around a predatory pricing or around the reason which these and these compete with the third parties that they let onto its platforms so I think there's a variety of ways that committee could make recommendations of course then it would be up to the regulators and perhaps the next administration to carry that we saw a tweet from President Trump earlier he was tweeting threatening to regulate the sector with executive orders and critics say what that politicising something that shouldn't be competition markets and tight trust and everything should be away from politics think President Trump has railed against big tech not necessary just these big for me Q think what we are seeing with this almost politicisation of that</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

seals like Tim Cook getting more engaged in political discussions as a result because a trillion dollars However one one calculated is larger them the GDP of many Asians it it makes it almost a kind of country or state itself it certainly has the economic power of many of the nations of the world more than many of the nations of the world and true that requires ultimately a lot of assessment understanding reflection and understanding that if you are a team of course you are CEO one of these large companies have enormous responsibility in addition to your shareholders and society at large but also in the any negotiation with States you can say look I have this much money this much investment this much power that puts them on a level where they the boot is if you like that on the other foot they are about some ways more powerful than campuses they are blood most of these organisations were talking about you have competitors thing there is an alternative to build on almost all circumstances so even now as the world's most valuable company does not compete with Android phones which represent 85% of the worlds of arts so yes they are negotiating but it's not unchecked competition is still a safety valve correct Professor David you're feeling of Harvard business school you think this moment the trillion-dollar Monis is a cause for celebration or are you a little bit concerned and worried I think in the last couple of months but take Hewitt the issues surrounding Facebook we've seen that them there are there are concerns with the enormous power of these tech companies but I also think and as David Orr said that there is that there's a counterweight in terms of government regulation nationally there was a story yesterday and South Korea that and their increasingly thinking about taxing global companies which they have no way of doing at the moment because the legal framework just does not provide for so I think their governments around the world thinking about how to tackle the problem and also in the case of Apple and I think one particularly important thing to look at as the restaurant trade war and because their market in China is one of the biggest markets and they produce a lot of the components that and if they get hit by tariffs and that might solve the problem of its then so's that maybe powerful though a lot more powerful if you like I suppose the nation states conducting this trade will be every County mean Galbraith the movement you think is this idea of of the world dominated by huge corporations is coming true is that we have the new industrial state was written when I was a boy I read Yeah Rhona's an undergraduate and I met Galbraith at that time by the way I came I would say in their own time Rolet to the size of the economy that Apple is no bigger tennis probably less threatening than was an exciting when it was the largest American economy or general Motors when it was the largest American economy Apple doesn't have the kind of sway over the US economy there are some other companies do recently I was here to will be the first trillion-dollar company is going to be how the bed there's going to be and Cian Healy is gonna be excuse me at all and I said the most significant car company this bunch workers and Zion because Amazon does so many different things and does a very efficiently and does it very well that it has become the GE a worry to choose another iconic company us for on bed times it doesn't like to leave the trillion do well the thing is it dead then that Apple got there first but that doesn't necessarily mean these other companies are going to be there but air and missile has a very pervasive prove the case of consequences for many sectors of the economy and its branching out into many sectors of the economy and it's throwing around its weight in ways that have people that write about in tow trust writing about it and that's the way it begins whereas people are particularly concerned because there is a Samsung there is a well we've there is a GTE It's a big global economy in a lot of ways you know Apple as a very successful Kompakt company whereas Amazon has tentacles everywhere you look they beat neck and zone for example developer told cloud system for internal use and then beat the heck out of the other big tech companies worth of it routinely poses a threat to its own suppliers Campbell doesn't OK it is interesting the way these companies work but term but the prize if its name bribes significant prize judge on so it's nice to be different this year it is something I put on the wall Let's take a break there and bring ourselves with the very latest headlines Jerry Smith</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

firms market makers and what the EU was construed as anti-competitive is what the strategy is called for creating a barrier to entry and saving the US view of this well maybe less fair and and that these firms get all that take we have their from Gaby L and at best his company has 1% of the market is it perhaps a good thing to level out the playing field well I mean I guess I think if you think about what people are of course trying to achieve when using Google's services they are trying to get through a search process police for isolating to the search process trying to get answers relatively quickly for which Google obviously has massive market advantage given its scale but it spent 20 years building their business model or and now all effectively people want the same shelf space when in fact when in fact I think you asked the question is is Google also benefiting from brand equity and sort of the presumed safety and quality of the search results will provide the hour so it's It's complicated Angie how Asian regulators feel about the likes of Google and other big tech companies and their dominance well obviously is a rather different out here and things particular dominated by China where a very different sort of system operates in China a company called by to dominates search Google is largely is quite difficult to get hold of Google in China now so a different sort of approach in a different sort of mentality I think in China not so much worried about competition in fact I think in many ways quite like to see a dominant company like applied to controls search of course what they are more concerned about in China is censorship things like that and what you can actually find using search engines there are also concerns there have been cases in the past where idea has been criticised because some of the search results leads websites can have harmful impacts for example there have been some cases where people found but bad medical websites the give bad advice and by do has got into trouble through that so it's more of a concern around that rather than anti-competitive behaviour that that dominates thinking particularly in the end in Asia's biggest economy and in the best interest of the casino because even with this far in to concede that this might even mean higher prices for someone that is on Google on search engines and using it companies like that the the big technology companies Yeah I think that goes to the heart of the different approaches in the US and the EU as well as well as what onto this red going in the US and this sort of approach says well you know we can take the sort of action that the EU has but it might lead to high Higher prices because for example mobile phone companies might have to pay the Google more to use Android will pass on the cost to consumers so Unite will find our handsets a slightly more expensive so the US will look and say will you know ultimately who does it benefit became main benefits mother smaller companies but doesn't actually affects all benefit consumers so he knows it's a different approach we are seeing around the world but as on this is what the EU decides is important because Europe is such a big market and UK will leave it there for now let's get the News update now dead grass Turkey has lifted the state of emergency imposed after a failed coup attempt two years ago thousands of people in north-west Syria are being evacuated overnight from two pro-government towns besieged by rebel forces for the last 3 years Donald Trump has significantly revised his attitude to Vladimir Putin saying he now holds the Russian leader personally responsible for interference in 2016 US elections and Britain's luxury carmaker Aston Martin has unveiled plans for a

research group Nielsen figures show the music industry is experiencing a growth spurt with major label groups recording revenues not seen in 15 years and more money comes in from services like Spotify

Trump talks about the attack but when push comes to shove he lets them do whatever they want President Trump's one of his major achievements was the USMexico and Canada agreement which was the updates NAFTA and included and that agreement was an extension of this so-called section to 30 legal immunity for the telecoms for anything that happens on their websites that was put into that trade agreement from the very first time there was a trade agreement what that means is that the US tries to change that what ever for income knees from Canada or Mexico or even the United States can say what that is a trade deal and that you are not allowed to make that change because if you make that change violating trade agreement President Trump negotiated and signed that trade agreement do you think any of these for could be subject to intimidation I think they use intimidation on a regular basis and that's what we've heard today intimidation is something that is used routinely by these large corporations to keep their rivals under their thumb and and that is anti-competitive the Euro and I think he certainly did a very good job for these large firms would have a real We ask it would be at the hands of the federal trade Commission or the justice Department and seemed unconcerned need all this information that the committee had was available to the justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission for years and they did nothing with this hearings on was an indictment of the justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission for their failure to rein in these companies before they got too big and too powerful and hopefully this hearing trained the regulators into actually doing the job cuts David this is not just big tech though we see these these these big huge all powerful companies in that even have a Congress managed and and the regulators there's a four-week GoogleFacebook and Amazon and Apple tomorrow we still have a major problem in the United States of America whether you talk about the airline's pharmaceutical companies are hospitals which are very concentrated America even down to things like peanut butter and jelly I wrote this book that talks about Napoli in baby Formula and also talks about a monopoly in coffins in the funeral so you're really talking about cradle to the grave it we have a serious problem because we have stopped enforcing the anti-trust laws in this country over the last 40 years and big business got the message that they had free rein to team up and exert their market power to must sort out rivals in competition so to the extent that this this particular report that the sub committees can I help provide a road map for the attack it needs to go abroad and provide a road map for how you're going to end the monopoly problem along all walks of life author David day and speaking to me a little bit early let's get the views of my guests on this one I'm gonna get around Silva who's in Toronto in Canada wealthy it feels like somebody has got to stand up for big tech here they are getting a very hard time sure I can do that for a fault I think that's important to note that size does matter in his particular types of businesses because you need billions of people to make sure you have diversity diversity of the morning later in the show but it's a very important element and Caspar organisations a tendency to have just a very small groups of like-minded people so the diversity things a big issue so I would say is that is it really the fault of these companies or is it really a symptom of poor for our lawmakers and I would argue that it is in fact the second is that lawmakers are blaming these organisations because they haven't put laws in place to regulate them specifically lost around free speech and this one really bothers me is because they are complaining that the companies are regulating free speech and there are commercial entity so the government wants a commercial entity for profit organisation to determine what free speech or a tea tray and I think that's fundamentally wrong lawmakers have to step up and say this is what you can do and which chance to there was a lot more than in in these conversations than just about free speech so many different areas of different business practices and different accusation being levelled at least for big firms me is it is it too late to regulate and legislate now for for anything they were being accused of that they didn't they they denied any improper business practice but is it too late to go back and regulate

to understand is how strong with these companies and people there are with vast economic problems they have been through a lot and they can handle a lot of these these issues briefly Daniel how important is that it appears the international monetary fund is standing behind the government in Buenos Aires it's a blessing on one side because it keeps some of the spotless sees a live-in in gives that the government some breathing room but it is a problem for them on the other hand because of a lot a lot of Argentinians suspect that there's the government and the IMF are reduced to you you know trying to help for investors or domestic investors are not really thinking about the people that at least the way that the opposition has been trained this government and its message there from the election primaries we saw it is widely being heard in Argentina saw the the IMF every time it helps Argentina It's also saw a damaging the government's prospects of of being re-elected challenging times down Argentina away and South America business correspondent Daniel Gallas the new President of the European Commission should bond Lions starts work for money in Brussels on Monday first task finalising the list of people nominated the European commissioners these the officials who will run the various sections of the EU's executive body departments like trade or transport well is version of bond land Speaking on Friday in the Bulgarian capital Sofia if we banned lap our strength in Europe we will be successful and there it is very important for me to rebalance the European Union and we need to tell Wayne more together and to exchange way more knowledge and views because the challenges ahead of us are enormous Ursula Von the line takes office with a commitment to reform the way the European Commission works one of the big challenges will be reducing the power of lobby groups hired by major corporations or even trade unions to influence EU policy Margarita Silva is a researcher with corporate Europe Observatory a group that campaigns against the influence of multinational corporations in the EU she's been telling me that lobbying is big business in Brussels the official register of lobbying groups working on your policy says editor above 11000 and we estimate that in terms of individuals we have above 25000 individuals loving the EU there's a About 30000 people working for the Commission so we have on the situation of one love this for one official and when it comes to Parliament becomes much more and earns and the lobby group's kind of issues are they trying to gain influence with the European Commission on there's a variety of a lovely groups corporations are businesses that will be trying to of course in their address issues the regulations affect the business model of things like this and then on top of that you have trade unions trade associations is really wide universe of organisations when we look at the high spenders so if we concentrate just under a really heavy hitters like being then we see that the issues on digital regulation data protection also competition for the really big tech companies this is becoming increasingly one of the most upbeat issues chemical regulation is still one of the top top issue that appears when its pesticides plastic chemicals in the are sunscreen things like this and of course always the financial industry the a new President of the European Commission version of on the lion and I suppose many might be thinking new head of the Commission may be a new start could we see the influence of these lobbyist curtailed the good sign here is that during her nomination process the new president has already committed and promised to working on a few specific pieces of regulation that could help curtail some of the more nefarious part of love being we talking here especially about issues like a conflict of interest because she has promised to work on a new independent ethics body but could become responsible for overseeing and monitoring and sanctioning whenever there is non-compliance that would be really important there were already quite a diminished some of the worst aspects of lobbying and she has promised that she will keep working on lobbying transparency which is something actually that President Yunker had been doing medal because of a lack of co-operation from national governments and in part as well from the European Parliament we never actually got deliver the reform of the transparency rules have any confidence that this system which allows so much lobbying to gain influence will be reformed with this new Commission weather on Monday the commissioners</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Ukraine the man expected to be Britain's next Prime Minister says he's confident he can renegotiate the terms of Brexit but has provided little detail and brother of the president of Senegal has resigned from his government post following a BBC investigation into corruption Eileen thanking Facebook has announced not for the first time that it should be the ultimate rule maker for advertising content published on its platform Facebook's head of global affairs said Nick Clegg former British deputy prime minister made it clear it would prefer States to set rules for all social media platforms the BBC's Nick Robinson asked Seneca he was really saying to government please regulator us Yes not just Facebook but the online world Hall has developed so fast in such a short period of time I think we are somewhat breathlessly trying to catch up with that pace of growth and now put a guardrail in place rules in place and it's not for private company however big or small to come up with those rules it is for Democratic politicians in the Democratic world to do so on privacy on how elections are conducted on hateful content all those kind of thing I want to talk through some of those areas but let's talk about the principle first of all because the cynics might say here is Nick Clegg effectively PR man for Mark Zuckerberg had a lot of flak saying look this is your problem not our problem if you're worried about these things you do something about it don't ask us to do something about well have had not provided a PR gloss is since my new job I'm responsible for how the policy's asset mayor very substantive on how to tackle terrorist content online how to protect elections outside interference to summit was and if you're saying don't blame us we Nothing we can do if you think is a problem you go and sorted out but I think the issue of blame I think it is absolutely right that companies like Facebook acknowledge the mistakes they have made and of course mistakes have been made it is just that I don't think it is in any way conceivable more than I actually think it's all right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important portent as how technology serve society and in the end this is not something that big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own I want to see companies like Facebook play an increasingly mature role not shunning regulation but actually advocating it in a sensible way Facebook's head of global affairs Nick Clegg that welfare but the chief of the economist intake is listening to this alongside Professor Peter Rosie in Washington DCI Sarah what do you make of this appeal the government by Facebook to think it's passing the buck Col maybe an acknowledgement that it needs help Stephanie place the government as they are thinking about doing it to regulate social media the need for that has been highlighted very clearly in the past few years However I think Nick Clegg's interviews that struck a slightly difficult time given that Facebook has really seemed to sit if not take any responsibility for a lot of the problems that have been highlighted with fake news on its side its or interference in elections by people using it sort of algorithms to get post to go viral the fact the NSA government should be doing is does not have the moon doesn't go down so well when they seem to be somewhat denying their role in actually sort of regulating themselves Interestingly he's right populism around before social media but it's a huge jump defying effect in I think is underplayed in that interview a lot of the role of social media in pushing these fake news and popular narrative works is interesting piece of it is Facebook said its plans for same currency do think it needs to restore trust in keeping people's data safe before expect people to trust its with Man\u00e9 were Yes that then certainly the case this ruin to levels of problems here one is that what standards do used to century thanks to decide what gets on Facebook what doesn't get on Facebook who gets allowed to participate who gets excluded because it just two extremely disruptive or frankly dangerous and then and Facebook really shouldn't be doing that it's demonstrated that it has a bias but any organisation that dinner I was running the organisation people beating complaining about Rees's Conservative bias that's one problem the other is getting it done I guess could consider the broader story just broke about GoogleGoogle maps and Inc Google maps certainly doesn't want to have this has all kinds of fraudulent darts power but if I put your address and one fine restaurants around you get a lot of restaurants that don't really exist worse if I need a plumber in your neighbourhood</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

work that have linked market power true levels of inequality and financial instability it is becoming a policy focus when you talk about the regulators there's regulators across the world regulators here in the EU the US as well and so this is a global challenge that is facing some of these tech companies I think to end up being global most of the focus today has been on the taxes that they pays I think it's more a question of whether they actually pose a threat like to the global economy and we've even seen other tech companies are looking at some of the big tech companies and and claimed the way they operate is unfair we are we've got a legal battle between fortnight and Apple do you think that some are saying that this could be a bit like the dotcom boom of the the 2000's we could see a lot of these companies in trouble a different space now is these companies the big ones making huge half if you look at the second quarter of this year when obviously the global economy was really suffering because of the pandemic Apple's revenues rose by 11% Amazon's revenues rose by 41% said they clearly are benefiting from the environment we are now winning but at the expense of many other companies are laying off staff so I think that there is a political focus on whether this level of market power is excessive you mentioned before the market cap of Apple compared to the FTSE100 these are extremely powerful companies now more powerful and some government some would say is it possible to stop there right now well I think that there is a political will to try to police control how far that they are able to exploit their monopoly power to-date the argument has been that consumers have been gaining By virtue of the services of the products that they are providing because they are getting hit a lower price what you're now saying is that because they've got this monopoly power they're raising their prices increasing their profit margins and said the levels of consumer welfare of reducing and that's I think where the political will come in and say hang on a moment we now have to step in and try and reduce its members that antitrust investigations and States particular have been declining since 19 seventies for this will be a major turnaround if they decide to take these companies on economist Michael Hughes that the key to how quickly countries will recover economically from the Corona virus could depend on how solid the digital Foundation says with many sectors now relying on people working from home and children also studying online the most technologically advanced societies could be the ones with the brightest futures Anders Borg is a former Swedish finance minister and now a senior adviser at IPC after a company developing artificial intelligence systems I would think that the course you have a positive factor from technology and be normally that implies that you have a more flexible economy in general one of the problems then that we may see particularly Europeans there's already a divide some of those countries that you're talking about are economically more advanced and some of those in southern Europe easy gonna be there 7 European countries will struggle I think so of course the tourist industry is much larger in those countries but also in countries with highly educated Labour force a lot of people can actually work from all I know for example that you always talks about 35% that can work from home but in Swindon It's well above 40 cell so the more technologically advanced Yoran and further tap into the knowledge economy the Syria is full of companies for people to just why is it that countries like Sweden so far ahead in the infrastructure that they have when it comes to ideas in this simple case but they've invested a lot more than countries like Spain and Italy I think probably had an advantage in the Nordics the fact that Eric on not the are are situated here but you also have a very vivid population I noticed that older people in Sweden are estimated to ask ordinary people lorry in Spain we have liked it the fight some that do their banking did Italy everywhere and will carry you have a full-fledged mobile networks but also very with Wi-Fi and all families have computers I mean for us to have our children doing they are calling from Hall is not that much of an effort they have computers have the connectivity there is a fear that what we may see following the pandemic is a move towards more automation that some believe will mean there'll be less jobs is it as simple as that I'm sad to say that it probably so we will have more reassuring words fragile supply chains are coming back to Europe but what I've seen in a large Swedish manufacturing companies this that means very few jobs you're basically all for robotics and automation in production and if you look at the service sector and its cryptic clear that the combination of AI cloud compute and was a new consumer

is at the centre of this whole debate whether tech companies being based at our meeting a difference in the debate saw the legal route between the us Let's take the UK in the EU in this case there is a very big difference the EU our particular has been much more at the forefront of tackling daddy issues when it comes to big tech companies and there's been a big backlash from the tech companies they've really been pushing the us government action later get involved and say they're there the EU regulations the UK regulations have gone too far and in particular because this is how these companies make money they collected dad and they sell it and that's a big part of how they become a billion-dollar companies to a new start to regulate they will start to change the way they do their business in the us there has been some progress the US government US regulators have tried to hold these companies accountable but that this real regulation and legislation hasn't been as forthcoming in the US as it is in the UK and the EU Ceri Thomas that Alison you're there in Silicon Valley knocking again of obvious into the legal complexities this particular case but let's look at that issue of children and the internet and should companies Be doing more to stop my kids are going to sites that they say they shouldn't be on or visit are responsibility and your kids are grown up a little bit so they probably would listen to you now if you to get off the internet but for those younger kids it is a difficult balance isn't Yes it is interesting that is always said that you know the kids of today they have to grow up with the internet I mean it is up to appearance to monitor how much they're spending on YouTube for example what exactly they are watching on YouTube and there are and we is of restricting for your kids see on on on the internet and you know to be devils advocate you could say what is substantive injury to the kids you know this data that the collectors anonymised It's not like they're saying you are a bully your kids are you on and down and then monitoring them and now we are specifically teach your kids but term at the same time means seeing that YouTube to say that they want YouTube kids that and kids under 13 shouldn't be using YouTube as a bit of a cop-out to so Yeah I see both sides of the issue it easier the debate and you are having in China you've obviously got WeChat tick-tock their for you I think it is a struggle I think that their parents should should her response critics I think these are easier my kids listen to me do you listen to you all day doing that he is very hard to get to supervise they know where the kids here when we watched Sam see DC something pop up then they go somewhere else you can wash them all the time I think it's really hard in the EU these companies and businesses Mali's be some free contact there are any of sending your data still without a government regulations I think everything is just a a manageable situation week I think the government and the parents and the company using the company's new need to walk out solution dead easier high up is not helpful right now I think it's just a good it is just a point to the bottom anything always shine I think I am not sure a disco for kicked Eid is enough and says that everyone needs to get together to get a solution that is unlikely to happen isn't Alison when you look at the us and the whole debate about privacy and data as we move towards the elections it do you think tech companies are sitting there thinking will if the Democrats are coming in our life could be a little bit more difficult here I think that is when the real issues that the Dems and the Democrats and Republicans are united against big tech right now another Liza is on now and there there is certainly a lot of energy in the Democratic party against big tent and they want to do more regulation it was the war owners has been the sort that and Biden I think has taken some of her recommendations on board bad turn your time will tell whether the political will all remain there are so many issues thanks to call it that and the federal government needs to tackle and I saw likely that this is not gonna be a high priority issue because going back to my point what is substantive injury the kids are facing It's not is no light this YouTube this year</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

in behind epic to add to the fun partly because it uses that technology itself partly because it said it was critical technology for the whole industry it so where are we now if I talk to Professor Margaret O'Mara she's a technology historian and columnist and asked to explain how this dispute had started off we may not have heard of epic but you might have heard a fortnight which is again It's very very popular game it's created that is has many many fans worldwide and and that epic like other gaming companies also suffer company and makes a lot of products that are not just a game so early the trigger for us was this old that Apple's app store and a 3% cut it takes for anyone who would like to appear on its app store are at this is one way that Apple makes a tremendous amount Money quite a two trillion $ evaluating valuation company right now and and epic said no we're not going for a beer they tried to tread did get around that and AppleItalian kicked the Mall the app store which of course it there thereby had suffered oxygen in many different ways Cannon EPIX survive I mean as you said cuts of Hoxton its current owners perhaps to spite its face with what had companies quite this large and quite the stamina to be one of the year the dynamics that shape both the policy conversation in the EU and the United States and around the world as is that the scope of these platforms and the bigness of them and there then the antitrust enforcement spent going I'm particularly in the EU since 19 90s against companies like Microsoft and Apple but really now there's a large and down and of course their market competitors Microsoft is Snatchers stir suffer company it also says it is has Xbox has its gaming company its it's got a lot of different fingers in different pies and so part of this market competition part of their Isas you know good old very good old-fashioned in our company's liking out to see who is who is gonna come out ahead is epic the only one that's a fight for a spot on its most prominent one but I think that this is the head this is really think we may see more of this and that is interesting in a way it's a test case of a prominent test case again a very popular a company with a name-brand it's very familiar to a lot of people in a fortnight and end it also has it been one of the reasons Microsoft entered the fray it's is was are arguing that if you and Apple kind of in retaliation for what I was doing I also had an hour from the and iOS platforms development platform the availability of ABL talls to build other types of software which Microsoft set to axe is hurting at us because we rely on some of the things that epic create eights in order to do are things so you see it in relatedness of all of these companies and then the other dimension is that there are international that there are enough unlike say the car companies which are global companies rate but they have different models of a mile you would buy I'm in the UK versus what you buy in France but first you by the United States so different enable adapt to fuels standards in different countries for example and for the world of tech its CEO week obese Yes you may see a different Google's search engine depending on where you are the world but really it's the same products and this these lightly regulated companies American companies when they go onto the world stage Ken come in renters headwinds is this a problem for Apple I mean it is by market capitalisation the biggest company in the world is really just 3 items a minor irritation it is really interesting it could be your could not be clearly it's a bit of a PR problem me know that no one knows no tech company likes to be seen as a Goliath they like to always think of themselves as a scrappy outsider cigarette packing up against the system and but the other dinner there is a very real that the regulatory conversation United States is gathering momentum so it is something of a dangerous game but also Apple they're not doing things rashly their very careful strategic company and end the app store Amman all has an absolutely critical of to its business I think it is gambling that it's become so essential that people may grumble about the big cut it takes but they can't get away Professor Margaret Morrow talking to me earlier Peter we are coming you think I suspect this as I did that interview to a standard oil moment a big tobacco moment a telephone moment when the antitrust authorities not just Russia and America but possibly around the world really get to grips with some of these big tech companies Yes when the cream is because they We haven't seen anything this big said my goodness standard oil I mean they someone a global

their citizens lives now a new technology impacts network based universities around the world will look at how to regulate the tech giant's that billion dollar question I spoke to one of those behind it Professor Julia Powles director of an injury Tekken policy lab at the University of Western Australia I asked why their work is needed when new walking around the house we don't usually expect there will be someone sitting there scribbling down everything you say listening to everything so watching everything you do and yet we assume that now and in the digital realm and way we are taking that same concession now into physical spaces into the the course Kerry asks them machines we put in our bodies into their homes and streets and and workplaces and it's just remarkable concession I think and that that frame the consumer frame that we can all somehow make those trade-offs and that's appropriate I think this is really now very outdated it is very fragile 0 can be very serious consequences if we don't change what could we do you think about people not really appreciating the value of their data we see tech companies getting very rich off the back of other people's data but it's so difficult to quantify you know how much house where you know how much you pay for your neck to see watch or whatever but you don't really know what it's worth putting on a social network where they had lunch well this implicit in the question the idea that I am to validate it means to be transacted we need to put a dollar figure and I think the whole value of information is that weekend situated in a context that when I got to my hotel and give information that information relevant to me saying the hotel is not relevant for the next 20 years so that kind of value of being able to make choices about the context within which information shared I think is just immeasurable and with head to Rick resign ourselves and say honestly it's not therapy would rank here it feels like there's an alternative am I Mark my late friend and I think a number of people we are working with this that shouldn't be a decision that relate to individuals because Iran's tolerance for these issues is different and the Hall and Cambridge Analytica story to me tales that one person gambling democracy for for whether or not there are certain personality types shouldn't be a trap a transaction that individuals can make the should be we have standards that that protect all of us just like in the physical world we have there are building rules and codes and standards we expect them to be upheld and when that is a scandal and we just don't have anything like that some equivalent in individual spaces but as you point out there are so many examples of this Cambridge Analytica perhaps Being one of the biggest and is it too late to shut that door has the horse bolted was really optimistic about their creative responses we can have we saw with than I am with the recent U.S. Congress inquiry on anti-trust competition more that is a real appetite for asking hard questions but we don't have the language in the torso to be a really respond private CN competition so inadequate I think for a lot of the challenge we're talking about we're talking about big questions of privatisation power public-interest and we need to invent I think in many cases new concept because the words have been stolen we don't have ways of really capturing what is going on I mean I'm an IP lawyer and can reach me and is not other intangible asset where we have argued that has value at this point of origin except for data that two individuals it's worthless but then it seems to be an asset of the most valuable companies plan that just doesn't check out at the I think there's a lot we can do in in really Yes finding in existing frameworks the kind of protections we need am and I definitely don't think the horse has bolted back there's a level of responsibility that society one Professor Julia Powles now it's been 9 years since the last edition of the very popular she inquired dictionary in China as authoritative as the Oxford English dictionary as in the UK it's fair to say an awful lot has changed since 2011 the BBC's China media analyst Kerry Allen talks me through some of the new tech related words that have made it into the latest tame metre try saying them I can only apologise China's new media has developed such a massive Ray 9 years ago the social media scene is absolutely nothing compared to what it is today so a lot of these terms were already widely used on platforms like Weibo and WeChat but Yeah it's the first time they actually officially reached the dictionary and I can't stress enough</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Commission here in Brussels there are also investigating now for see have the Department of Justice of the European Commission both line after Apple and they're looking at whether or not there is a problem with this 30% fee they charge in Arsal whether it's a level playing field so for instance you charge 30% for these in app purchases for let's say Spotify but then it does iTunes have seemed Churchwell on Nell and that's one of the big supporters of of epic is Spotify so did not alone there are a number of companies that are really gone after all over this issue and I think it's gonna come to ahead very soon ease this case will be a game changer for us I think so I think this is really emblematic of where we are with Appstore see you automatically see a different team Google and Apple here app all it is is an American falling over its apps or 4 years Google is is that less at stake because the axe the offer to download apps on other platforms other stories seem might see this the idea that consumers are going to start noticing why we start with one store or why we have only good that Thor and it's really about the popularity of these songs in their whole ecosystems you are we going to live in a world where there's only two major ecosystems Apple and then the Google Android and so this could be the start of a change but this will take regulators to intervene or in the case of epic they will have to wait for a judge to rule on a case that neatly years so in the meantime we get to see this May's public relations fight between the over core Apple and then the upstart epic which tries to paint them as this start your company that does not change Matthew Newman there from and L E X market intelligent Peter two-week catchy one fortnight sometimes now haven't I am an early adopter of the games of techno and technology but now I haven't tried out for a night but I have a lot of sympathy for it the games because if you think about term a Google and Apple and Facebook These the and the rail roads of the 21st century and the absolutely massive pay our they head in determining the world if you want pure pure Choi AP distributed the got to do it on our terms you'd do it on our platforms it will give us the cast over of watch getting so the big Tech's seen perhaps as a greedy monopolists here and it's all their distribution and payment and whether or not this comes down to greed or bullying is another thing that as we heard there really can be something that term regulators are going to have to get right onto the course it's going to be an ongoing problem yet but we know that the regulators in the US and the EU are looking at this Let's stay with that analogy that you brought up so beautifully that the problem is a train needs a Railtrack and and those are the only real tracks out there at the moment as we've seen this with the impact of GoogleApple but also Facebook on traditional media and newspapers here in Australia the air regulator the Australian competition and consumer Commission is it has determined that they believe that if Google or Facebook for example one user traditional content or digital content from Australian newspapers or and digital all broadcasters he like and the Australian broadcasting corporation oil they should pay end so that's a big fight at the moment and regulators will be pushing very very hard on the Big tick and keep in mind too big tech has a lot to pay our though I've been driving the sharemarket gain since February so there are of course investors who want to see big kicker can increase the pair are monopoly and this is going to be you know one of the big 4 used the term Bacall's really over the next a few years isn't it between big tech and regulators who you see coming out on top will earn him a big takeover got the that the financial fire pair are probably in excess of the government's bid regulators year as you mentioned in the United States and Europe but also here in Australia appeared to take them on two one not to protect but to ensure that the playing field is level but also that ultimately consumers are protected because in the end this maybe big games the big

sees people surprised Cambridge Analytica for every couple of weeks is one of these scandals it seems obvious now don't put things on the Internet you don't want to be taken but Stephanie we will keep doing it we know the effort to our data is being used and abused but we love playing the games well some people love playing the game saving and James represents a constituency of people who I happen to agree with it as their careful about what they put on did learn that might also be generational young kids growing up today might not fully be aware our understanding of the order users might understand there might be people who think I've got nothing to hide have nothing to fear I don't care they have me anyways or nothing games they are just using the internet and their devices which is your smartphone is effectively tracking monitoring device now in every possible way the question really is what's alternate is your hand you need to be able to assert things online you need it most people are in need to have smart found their working the modern economy tick the information economy you don't have to be on Facebook you don't have to use Google you can use dark Tower go for instance some somebody on rising search engine to privacy privileging said tension there are some alternatives but it's not a great market at the moment for privacy and data protection that is where regulation could potentially change things that we need lawmakers to do something near what was grass James about regulation same question I really aster our guest earlier why is it that term internet companies are just so far ahead of the government say in controlling this we know it is happening but nobody seems to stop well might be because there's not a major constituency you're pushing for you obviously a very loud voices in the media I have some lobby's what 9 but I think the average person's room they really care about you just look at the usage numbers of of Facebook I think more than half of the planet is army is on it then in the numbers for go on Twitter and Instagram are the others are and massively huge as long as people keep on joining at times it's hard to see where the political movement is to to crack down I guess everyone the problem is having the developers say in this case everything is a blow he deleted with a couple of days we have no way of knowing if that's the case now we have no reason to trust any of these companies meaning are lying through your teeth have time we found this out whenever there's an accidental data leak or breach or perhaps so I think we can look at curing the European Union for instance to the General data protection regulation GDPR that has required some of these companies to change their business model and operating practices United States does not yet have a really strong privacy legislation that affects digital companies in the same way as an interest Newest tech companies are having to dance to the EU's tune that could change we see it on the state level certain us States are trying to push a greater privacy agenda but I don't know if I don't think the prospects are good thing James is right there isn't a sort of strong constituency lobbying for the problem is that the tech companies are lobbying for the got so much money that they are pouring in Washington DC and James there's another development on this isn't just move away from the specifics of private Syria Mattis said in his fights with the European Union US President Donald Trump has increasingly come out in favour of the big tech companies because they are American Yes it is interesting to see how he often attacks them for being opposed to Conservative and Liberal bias one night confetti just believe he tweeted the other day after Peter Teal called for the FBI and the CIA to crack down on global for allegedly working with the with two Chinese military President Trump basically endorsed the said we're gonna look look look into this sell as many things with with President Trump southernmost careering up the must conclude consistent policy and courses all the year added excitement of biometrics Stefan I mean this is an area where again depending on what stage you live in the United States if you live in my home state of Illinois for instance you enjoy some of the greatest a greatest biometrics protections in the Union and feel no one's it's a bit premature free for all that's really happening to be honest around the world people again don't really seem to understand what it means yet I'm afraid this seems to be one of those issues where they want to understand the significance of what they've lost until it's too late OK well we stay with the internet in a way because say how do you get your dream start up a business from nothing to a 1.4 billion $ valuation in 4 years the answer is to use a fashionable term he got to disrupt the industry once went about

to plans to government agencies to hedge funds that use the data to figure out whether stores are brands are doing particularly well for later in uniform the investment decisions and in the case of Mastercard which is what Apple card runs time they even have we now know a business with a Google where they're taking deer about transactions putting it into a special double why database which uses to prove that people use are certain ads online from Google ended up buying products like that in the real world so I thought it was a pretty great irony in the fact that you have this Apple privacy credit card was going to help feed Google's ad business absolutely amazing so this just drilled down a bit on that date set when you are and anonymised as part of a wider group of data and how big or how small is that means is that there are you identifiable in any way if only by deduction that's a really good question there is a lot of academic research going into this question of is any anonymised data really anonymous I think there's a lot of questions we can ask about that the short answer is we don't really know but we do know that these are for example told me that it would it would sell Dido down to set people as small as 50 people so we have that could be just a couple of blocks in the neighbourhood where you live so it would be possible for somebody to type that together back to you a contractually entry visa and MasterCard don't allow that but where it is possible for somebody to do maybe so let's try to wrap this up Jeff in terms of stuff that's comeback tea you'd use things connected to this could you estimate how many companies how many advertisers family pictures you've had come at you because this banana purchase I found at least 6 categories of companies but her axe Yes to the idea at the moment I swiped my card and those companies could have shared that information with a lot of other companies could share it with even more companies so the numbers get very large very quickly and ever was able to get to a final big number but I suspect it's quite a lot nephew start at 6 and spin that as a like a tree it if it rises exponentially very very quickly does Jeff Fowler of the Washington based been to from San Francisco Let's reintroduce Cernych sugar Parling Bloomberg Ralph Silva of the silver research network in Toronto and Matias in Hong Kong and the she did did any of that surprise you read something that know because living next door to China where data privacy is not that they did have a deal and actually there then there are the forefront of AI technology because The year ago and I would say care less about privacy but have regulated less on privacy and the government as a big consumer pro and Princeton surveillance technology no it doesn't surprise me and if you look at online lending platforms for instance there's a lot of sharing a Deidre information the kind Jeff are talking about that happens with these small banks and lenders and peer to peer lenders and they are by Dida from me now the big tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent for a few cents are a few of and but that's really interesting that's another haul strand that really we didn't get into with Jeff because we were talking primarily about commercial information commercial data where you what you're saying obviously the contest China is that it becomes state controlled data it is useful for security monitoring centre Yes definitely I mean if you're looking at this for instance a company that will list in Hong Kong soon card mag view which does facial recognition and one of its biggest clients is the Chinese government so there's definitely an interplay of a Chinese tech companies and and Dida and had the is that an AI and governments it's it's it's much more complicated scenario that say hang on correct me if I'm wrong you've got a company makes the witches which is it is gonna sell shares in Hong Kong territory where the demonstrators have demonstrated extreme scepticism about this kind of area two hours with Yes so and in fact urban the weekend there are some of the demonstrators tore down a lamp post which they said were had facial recognition and AI capabilities so Yes there's definitely pushed back but the feeling of a lot of Chinese tech companies that a listing is dead at this moment is you want foreign currency actually Hong Kong may be better then listing in the US where there's definitely a pushback against</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

less about people's Congress said Catherine had before we get into what they might do about these competition measures whether they might modify existing law with night to Aly Baba another just remind us who whose meeting when where what was she doing thing to be doing and then we get into the business side shorter people's Congress starts on the 18th was scheduled to start on the 18th of October goes for approximately a weakened the Congress's happens every 5 years and what the market and and commentators looking for indications of who's going to be the top aides and advisers and potential successor President Xi Jinping it's really important we look at what happened this year in terms of China the messaging for the Germans really been about the stabilisation of growth and you may or may not hear some News about corporate tax or income tax earlier this year we actually did see the government come out and provided tax exemption for as a dimension these Hi tech companies smaller companies because again I go back to the US if the US government is able to implement lower tax rates its court 20% and there would be lower than the standard text read in China have 25% are question marks there for about competitiveness will obviously rise month one last thing in terms of China's relationship with with other big tech centres in the region is it would you expect it Chinese companies always to kind of big foot the others or other VietnameseFilipino equivalents that sort of fighting back in the sector it different stages of the cycle but there's a real emphasis in terms of the made in China 2025 campaign said to be smart manufacturers It's really fascinating figure when we speak to companies all across different segments in China his management teams are really focusing on the edge of becoming a lot more innovative and moving away from just being the largest factory in the world to climbing we call the value chain it right listen before we leave the text out how would we read the beginning of the show as asking Diane about Symphony innovate some newbie moderating during the day you're talking about attempt at these apps that well I think the phrase used was Bloomberg killing is a phrase the email killer but basically said he started as the big banks are getting together and finding an ultra it sort of messaging app and it's very much become this rich ecosystem right thing they now have 55 partners the bringing content in it so it's quite a battle you've got Skype you've got slack you've got Bloomberg you've got a Symphony and financial services is an interesting incubator because it's highly regulated It's not a place we can just come and bring the slack to Rafa's because people trade unease some chat platforms so very interesting I think it's an interesting tipping point and the questioners and they will get the traction with the become the dominant go to platform in this sector so what does that mean for everyone else stupid question what kind of content is being traded on the platform there's an old naturally trades the same way that on Bloomberg chat people you know traders will communicate with each other assorted bridge bringing together the by side in the south side real-time no real time stuff and also within companies no one of the things of Bloomberg It's I said 20000 that actually low compared to ours but Gilbert 20000 dollars per user you know that's a real issue for companies this is a much cheaper lower cost you alter and for the enterprise Aziz slack Aziz some of these other are ultra owners and so it's a real battle financial services extremely lucrative in part because lots of for Bob messaging critical of the business and second they've got money and that's sad that sometimes a weird thing these days sell you know it it's quite a ban on symphonies a very interesting tipping point where Certainly what I saw today I think they're getting a huge amount of traction so I'm curious to see where they will be this time next year do you see parallels that Catherine and in China or if not yet it's only a matter of time perhaps in terms of just the communication the exact new kinds of vehicles for very fast trading very fast contact very fast numbers change changing hands it's definitely growing you know and financial witches the financial services arm move about Obama I'm in it it is really stepping up and of FinTech space and the winners in this context base of the likes of 10 sent an alley Obama not so much the banks so yes definitely growing area thanks both to get to Australia just a second this time yesterday we were talking some length about gun control in America we asked for your thoughts on the issue It's quite difficult to pick these but I'm gonna just going to read a couple because they kind of give us both sides of the argument I think from listeners perspective anyway his curt in Madison Wisconsin the unaired

companies that are in line with your values that could be I think very valuable because it's tough right now there is no transparency really offer how your buyer from whom you are in for a lot of people that matter so it could make that easier the question is whether or not the companies will sort of give us that level choice silver what they're serving up to us essentially this sensible with that son as a with we're talking about regulation will come regulation will come round but who can make the regulation because these companies are transnational and can you what Britain can barely agree on anything in the in one country let alone having some kind of agreement with with a 50 60 other big countries in order to restrict leasing them that's the problem isn't Yes and you know having learnt now that that they can actually significantly influence the outcome of elections and other events on this all began with with with marketing with a desire to understand how consumers why consumers make decisions and to influence those decisions starting off with the desire to sell more stuff to people and it evolved to a point where large numbers of people could be significantly influenced by repetitively serving up a particular perspective over and over again directly into a device that they've got in their hands and and that a that has been in it increasingly influential in a number of electoral outcomes recently and of course as you say the problem this is not clear the incumbent political party actually have a desire to change this is a very interesting discussion we do indeed Diana America is the only country really that could lead the way on this is any appetite in the Trump administration the well I know about the Trump business but certainly that it took a call and in no way that these things have been handled is to break company's up and that's really a way you can sort of Trident March dictate good behaviour but in the end when companies are too powerfully essentially either regulate them like utility would they not bikes not very profitable or you force them to break up and there are certainly a rich history of doing that in this country I'm assuming that's probably the way things are going to go for the big tech companies well be interesting to see if there is even let it happen come to a country but let's take a break then bring us up to speed with the latest News now with Stuart Mackintosh British members of Parliament again failed to back any of the alternative proposals to that of the government's Brexit plan to financial traders from Barclays have been jailed for conspiring to rig interest rates during the height of the financial crisis and Uruguay and defence minister for others have been sacked after being accused of covering up human rights abuses during military rule in the 19 70s thank Stuart now the amount of bread link-up with one of our reporters around the world It's indie scene joining us live on the line from Taipei Taiwan silly bit of a military confrontation going on now with China the man you Has quite a serious development in tensions between mainland China and Taiwan are basically on Sunday a two Chinese fighter jets crossover immediate lined the middle line of the Taiwan Strait which is a body of water separating the two size and because the two sides have never signed a peace treaty since the end of the civil war the Chinese civil war 91 nights they have a tacit agreement basically to not cross over the median line which would align the other side but this Sunday two Chinese fighter jets crossover medium line ended the Taiwanese military sent several fighter jets up in the area to try to to to order these Chinese jets to leave the area and endeavours but it but they refused at first and it was 10 minutes care enough between these two sides military aircraft eventually two Chinese military planes did cross back over to their side of the media line on but does this is quite tense and you know do you have any military spokesman said that this is the first time since present time when from the pro-independence party was elected came to office 2016 that this happened but Ashley local media have gone too far back and say this is the first time that China has done this so intentionally in the in the past 7 years basically since the end of the Chinese civil war this is quite a new escalation of 10 she is we've never seen before so why are they doing now wine out right and very good question China basically is feeling increasingly alarmed by this new president of Taiwan is not that you ever took two years to have years and she's basically I'll build a much closer relationship with the United States and she's been very capable of convincing us that China is a threat that China is the one who has rocked the bold basically has upset the status quo that is basically China is the aggressor now but in the US has Ashley bought

the force that is actually holding people responsible when they are trying to make media so seriously theorists that are going on on the Radio in spelling haul of conspiracy is it then maybe changes an election or performance or something to that effect performance racial war or some other kind of a sectarian violence it like that is a real possibility but you know it it's up to civil society to crowd out and push down when you're talking about changing elections no one slightly interesting thing about this movement is we have a situation where elections are being fought an online space their companies are paid by candidates to analyse voter behaviour online and target them accordingly the for a so-called data harvesting is that something that worries you I think I think the big media is always and and and big tech is always a worry Tory whether it's and supporting and state repression you know I think you guys covered left-wing website there was organising a protest for the inauguration of Trump there was an attempt by the Department of justice here to see all 1.3 million people who actually visited the website so there's a very real threat of that kind of thing there's a very real threat of whether it's not in use and claiming they want to tell you what you want to know exactly what kind of quest reward to be able to suggest the crackling deal or a partition who's going to know how to live better to look because they now know exactly what kind of OK skirt like by names and David do you see that happening I think Apple why I don't think so and I think maybe Jose is giving the general populace too much credit sometimes not to be able to discern what is real News and what is actually a fake News and what is wrong what I would call fake reviews and some people will express views about certain things which chart which is neither News not anything that is related to fill and what is really happening in the real world just simply because somebody has a view about something doesn't actually make it real and are out her views are on hate but this this is the change you see because work well when does a view become something that is incendiary when Wenders view becomes something that is dangerous and I know we're all entitled to our views but the moment you start hearing it on social media and then you suddenly find a small group of people agreeing with you that is when it becomes you know I think once again I am not saying that I advocate total censorship of of of the press and of social media but I don't I think we're at the early stages of social media and this explosion of ways in which people can express what they want to say but the danger of courses we don't quite know how to regulate it yet we don't know how to regulate Twitter we don't have to regulate Facebook and so we are allowing people to find Ways in which they can use social media but until such time that we have proper regulations in place maybe you know that there is some reason why the government should actually is a step in and I hate to use the word regularly I can't find a better regulate they could you not Re educate people to be more sceptical of stories like have but the problem is you are relying on people being able to differentiate between what is real just simply because they read it and what is actually a fake and I don't think sometimes people are able to do that and and unless you have a free press that is able to do well a free press that is not controlled by the big conglomerates how are you going to be able to do that I find it very very difficult and that the 3 of us are intelligent enough sometimes to actually see this intense and trying question that story saying that is it is a real is it really true that I think there are some people who may not actually be able to differentiate between what is real and what is fake and that is when it becomes very dangerous well with naysaying used to its Kiddicare and they were connected

shouldn't be left to draw lines on their own the risk is if they don't make it more Democratic he will just have a repetition of the power dynamics that exist in our physical an analogue world now so if we look at other people were running most of the companies are making technology they really tend to come from certain socio-economic background over certain gender may be certain that the cities are only representative for all of society that all of us on this planet are going to be on the receiving end of this technology but a very very small minority of us were to shape it and then there's of people to do the regulating that's the same thing for alarm makers you just stick NATO etc how on Earth would you even feed up to Nato how people are feeling about things every country is going to be terrified if they don't go down this path another country will not be left behind and actually putting their people in jeopardy It's going to have to be something on the site with nuclear weapons or by chemical weapons were we all agreed there are certain things were not going to build we don't get alarmist that playing with live ammunition here number of building AI powered weaponry and there's a real risk that with a humorous and sort of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein again we could very well create something that quickly eclipses our control Stephanie hare ending that report while talk about it with my guests in just a moment back and just gone a quarter to Let's get the latest News headlines with Stuart Mackintosh the most senior Democrat in the US house of representatives Nancy Pelosi has accused Donald Trump of trying to cover-up details of a phone call he made to the President of Ukraine the Trump administration is to cut to a record low the number of refugees allowed into the United States and the first group of African migrants to be evacuated from camps in Libya has arrived in Rwanda Stuart Thank you say are artificially intelligent machines used in warfare what my guests make of this Lulu Chan who's in Hong Kong James Cook she coos in Washington uneasy and trouble all saw in the words of one of those interviewees to find it truly terrifying Lulu what are your thoughts think Aamer said summoning the demon anything be a scenario which you describe it plus mortar rounds probably fits that James along the same lines I agree and I think with the only weapons we really be able to control or nuclear weapons and that's because the deadliest in was demonstrated their usual once again all work to clear that point to the reduced weapons not really the only weapons and be able to have any sort of really mean for arms control agreements about and in It's not as if other countries that have nuclear weapons without trying to stop them but they had been released with the superpowers of the Soviet UnionRussia there are Means of controlling these weapons between the United States and its adversaries are really worried that near these weapons there should below that threshold and it might take some sort of use of them in some way before we ever reach any kind of arms control the would then that will follow them the time to try and do something would be now right at the very beginning author maybe someone suggests of is it is actually already too late for that when you have you look at the attack on the the Saudi oil refineries alarming He also wonders who owns the technology mean it in we have the big tech companies getting involved in this sort of area Yeah that's a really good question I think the main tube concern two main concerns that came out of that report she is number one interval being military technology like this as a reinforcement of only existing social dynamics and nose and control and power so the questioners were authoritarian governments Wednesday show combine AI facial recognition technology with advanced weaponry it reinforces their hold on power its end that hands I think when experts saying that early in development you need to have discussions about how to democratise technology not put into place as certain mechanisms those conversations and Thatcher be happening right now the other question is the issue of net identifying people when you combine something like official recognition technology words and automated command for a row but her take orders and execute orders like killings and killings through and possible our survival and and and some cases and so it is an issue that should be discussed it Yeah I did during the report was also said North

produce other but they would say that generic industry York the copycat industries it's called doesn't provide original drugs in order to be able to fight things like superbugs and up that apps actually that's absolutely correct it is a catch 22 when I think I mean you're you do have to appreciate the problem faced by big Pharma companies core investor AB literally millions and billions of

many existing controls for example apartment blocks here in Australia are regulated by committees in the new government policy would have stopped them from banning air BnB in their buildings so the very last minute minister cancelled a press conference and that no one really knows what the policy actually means it is once again an illustration of how difficult it is for the authorities to govern these ever changing sharing economy sectors put Yes on things things I suppose like Uber as well being another area that people are concerned about the Australia is a sense that the people really want these things they don't want them regulated even if the people who traditionally provide these services probably do but it all depends who you speak to for example Ukip have investors who own apartments and there are many many new apartment blocks being built not just here in Sydney but elsewhere if you speak to an investor who has a number of these properties and they want to make money a return on their investment air BnB is a good option for them they'll probably say but if you live next door to one of those properties they have thumping music in the middle of the night maybe you would have a different view and it is very difficult for ministers to try to strike that balance between the rights of property owners and their neighbours and perhaps the confusion here in new South Wales really does highlight that difficulty and confusion I'm sure will be a lot of areas as well Phil thanks very much indeed Phil Mercer of their lives on the line from Sydney now many homes have one of those devices that responds to voice commands these days Amazon's Alexa course Google's home hub Apple's HomePod it's that box that you can talk to order a takeaway or I ask you to ask them to tell you about tomorrow's weather right now of course these things Just listen to the words sometimes they get it Terry spectacularly wrong the big companies However moving to get these boxes detect her own and mood as well and be generally kind of more human but where could this lead Trevor Cox Professor of acoustic engineering at Salford University Northern England says the risk is that they could also end up making prejudiced assumptions I think the language is less of a concern because the smart speakers like Amazon Echo are picking up words and doing searches with we know that's going on but what we might not be so aware of his future will stop picking up our tone of voice of course we give lots of information away which is not about words how we say them about how we field who we are and do we want these tech firms to be picking up on I saw things took the example of the problems that might arise work kind of thing you might get you might get some then picking out something about you earn is so we give information about say when you're working class or middle class save from North and South of England these kind of things and it could start contextualising your search results depending on Yeah how they feel your voice sounds but as we've seen in other areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms in many ways quite done it will make a start making decisions and talks start making suggestions too which might been not what you expect at the moment though they only listen to the words down the right yet though with a silly coy about saying what they're doing we know that people Amazon talk about trying to work out if you're frustrated or not you can imagine you're trying to get that device working new anger and anger is it doesn't respond she said you can see kind of anger being something I want to pick up on and maybe some may experience less frustrating always had in other domains like image domain is these big tech firms making mistakes I don't think it's acceptable now to make a mistake in anger or cracked afterwards I think they need to be thinking about what the voices what it betrays their forwards those pitfalls of match hugely difficult thing to do is it because interpretation of tycoon of of context that that that's a very big ask Yes and the vocal signals we give out are ambiguous a really good example of that is lying Wacha rather good line we think we are not terribly good line but actually we do it all the time because I don't I am honest I think the most the day but we do give there's little white lies I don't need to sort of kind of smooth their social interactions some joy look fat in that dress you apply with the honest answer or do you kind of give the diplomatic answer so you can start thinking about then picking up on things like whether we're telling that to the truth or not and they can't get it right we humans can't let alone and she is an impossible thing really just the tone of voice Yes I mean Yeah sometimes you betray when you're lying or not but actually the different tells that might be that there's a secret signs match individual to people and then there's a very famous people and and Lesley people like a lion hide the facts if you watch back to a video of an Oh Lance Armstrong lying about taking drugs the

star Terry Jones has died at the age of 77 what was he like We'll speak to one of his best friends and fellow Pythons Michael Palin the care quality Commission admits he was wrong not to publish a report into the abuse of patients at Morton Hall hospital in Durham the mother of a teenager who died in a similar NHS units as a system of oversight is broken I've been writing all he is not saying how they act on this is a flag in the ground you know we have the choice now to make sure we change practices that we act on these failings and on one out for myself saying it's the most the Chancellor says the government will press ahead with a tax on tech multinationals despite the threat from President Trump and now his Treasury secretary to if people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on digital companies will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies and what's it like in will harm the city in lockdown because of the Corona virus people who are dear to come out so it's all wear masks shopping moles are abandoned its streets are quite empty BBC News is read by Chris Aldridge the Chancellor's Sajid Javid has insisted the UK will press ahead with plans to introduce a new tax on big technology firms in April despite opposition from the United States Speaking at the world economic Forum in Davos Mr. Javid said the new tax would be a temporary measure until an international deal was agreed but the us Treasury Secretary Steven an ocean warned that Washington would retaliate our economics editor Faisal Islam reports from Davos it was rather public introduction to the UK's new role as an independent power in these tough neighbourhood of world trade Sajid Javid was told by his US counterpart Stephen Deuchar on a public panel at the world economic Forum that he would have to re-negotiate commitment to tax big tech firms or the US would consider taxing car exports Mr. Mitchell warned that if necessary the issue would be kicked upstairs to their bosses if people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies that plan to tax 2% of the UK digital sales of the likes of FacebookAmazon and Google has been in place for two years it's in the current finance bill and was referred to in the Conservative manifesto the Chancellor said the UK still planned to introduce the tax but Britain is also under pressure from the international body the organisation for economic co-operation and development which has told the government to hold fire on its plans the regulator of health and care services in England has been criticised for failing to publish an inspection report which raised concerns about a private hospital where a BBC Panorama investigation later uncovered patients being taunted and intimidated an independent report commissioned by the care quality Commission says it has found no satisfactory explanation for why details of the inspection of world and Hall in County Durham were not made public in 2015 Here's our social affairs correspondent Alison Holt Walton Hall hospital care for patients with autism and learning disabilities last year undercover filming by Panorama showed some staff taunting and mistreating patients after the programme was broadcast ban Rhys Stanley Wilkinson a former CQC inspector told the BBC he had led 2015 inspection which identified a worrying culture at the unit the report was never published and left his job after feeling his whistleblowing complaints had led nowhere this independent report says while the inspectors saw no actual abuse they found numerous areas of serious concern and the failure to publish inspection findings was a missed opportunity it also points to critical gaps in the documentary evidence the CQC has kept and says this must be improved the regulator says it is determined to use the findings of the report to get better at spotting abuse in the services it regulates for vulnerable patients the Monty Python star Terry Jones has died aged 77 the actor and comedian who had dementia also directed some of the group's most popular works including the film life of Brian his family said their last warm creative and truly loving man the world health organization's emergency committee is meeting in Geneva to decide whether to declare the outbreak of a new respiratory virus from China an international emergency measures to stop the spread of Corona virus are being put in place at Heathrow airport flights from will wear the illness originated will be met by health officials the Chinese authorities have told 11 million residents not to leave the city in an effort to contain the virus 9 people are now known to have died and more than 400 have been infected our

behind the scenes in the run-up to Parliament resuming in mid October hours Jessica Parker South Korea says the North has fired two unidentified projectiles into the sea if confirmed that would be the North Koreans tend to launch since may it comes just hours after Pyongyang said it was willing to resume Dean nuclear rise Asian talks with Washington our correspondent Laura Bicker is watching what's going on from so when she joins us now so first of all what we know about these projectiles well within the last few minutes just had more work through the South Korean military see that these were two unidentified short range projectiles film Colin the missiles at this time it were fired from get John City a year aides said Pyongan province they were fired eastwards for about 130 kilometres and and landed in the Sea of Japan is still another missile launch it seems at this stage short range perhaps Ed there are still analysing the launch but the have said certainly says Queen military saying that this is a strong concern and are urging North Korea to stop these kinds of threats eye on the Korean peninsula now the timing is interesting isn't it because it this is just hours after Pyongyang said it was willing to resume its denuclearisation talks a few hours ago here are the potential that we got a surprise announcement a surprise statement from Pyongyang from the vice foreign minister chest increase his said that North Korea was willing to re-start resumed talks with the United States now we wondered whether or not Pyongyang was good to issue a statement of this kind and in the near future we know all that North Korea has issued a deadline to the United States they want a deal by the end of this year or the sea the choose a new path what a new path interiors were not quite sure so here we have an offer of talks but it is a condition North Korea is saying that it will speak it will talk in in late September at a time and Cleese agreed between both sides but it has urged Washington to presents a new approach a new deal or it says the talks could fall apart again as for where those talks could take place as a lot of speculation here and saw all the timing is interesting because we're September is around the same time as United needs Nations general Assembly it could be that new York would make a good venue a good time any good place for both sides to meet Laura Thank you Laura Bicker in sold to us now where legal officers from across the country have announced a collective investigation into allegedly anti-competitive Practices by Google the declaration on behalf of 50 attorneys general made on the steps of the Supreme court in Washington said the aim was to protect the free market and consumers our US business correspondent in Washington is Samira Hussain its core coalition a 50 state officials both Democrats and Republicans are coming together to launch this investigation into Google and specifically whether looking at is the practices by the search engine so if you think about it when you do a search on the internet more after 9 you're going to be using the search engine Google in fact 90% of all searches online happen through Google and what this investigation wants to look at is whether and deep search engine itself as release of pushing Google's own products all over other kinds of products that means it would really need to push any searches to Google type thinks and that ultimately end up stifling competition makes it really difficult for other people to train get the staff seen by people who make Google search as soon as Google say said that it is going to co-operate with any kind of investigations and it is open to answering these questions by regulators and anybody else who wants to have a better understanding of these practices that said of course they are in denial that they do anything of that sort and you mentioned that the Democrats and the Republicans are both involved in this investigation this is just one of a number of challenges is it too big technology firms absolutely so we have this particular investigation that was announced and then last week in new York with state officials there have launched an investigation into the business practices a Facebook and whether they also stifle competition and made it more expensive for advertisers and the Department of justice here in the United States continues its investigation into all of these big tech companies and there are still other investigations that are ongoing so big tech is really in the

country I think folk systemic racism but with the the social media has further exacerbated difficult issues in this country I think that they just look at the stock is at an all-time high the only game in town they controlled between them and who will control advertising self now I just feel through this like a sail through I can't tell you how far through the first ever is it is I think an honourable person I think if you know you met him Murray he's a nice person he tries really are he certainly deplores a lot of things presence he said so it's the same impact as they never get they never get any liability for what they do we have to think hard about liability around finds around regulation and the trust and not someone of it all and I especially like the and that of course now that's where trouble for them I think it's really want to play regularly and lawyers get all that work all companies have to watch themselves I think that's the excuse that they have my ability to sense the more but that's no excuse everybody knows we have to have liability says the card companies we all felt as many cars and people get jobs that may be true that I kind of love seat belt and engines the job lot and things like that and so think liabilities hence the way and my eye However it gets there it is that is something that will actually have an impact Kara Swisher the New York Times Chris Fox one other thing to mention about the situation in the US that tech in the form of smartphones a social media played a big role but millions of us now have smart phones in our pockets we can take high quality video any moment and even Sharia widely on the internet I think that's added to the sense of urgency to what's going on because the justice system takes a long time a comparatively for it to do what it does and people are sharing these videos and saying we want action now now let's have a look at some of these other big tech stories with Chris Apple stores have been targeted in the unrest in the United States but it seems stolen iPhones will be much use the Apple has been actually disabling iPhones have been stolen from its stores and warning people that the phones are being tracked and reported to the authorities I think it does this anyway with the display models out in its shops but someone posted a picture went viral on social media of an iPhone said please return to Apple wall Street which is in Philadelphia this device had been disabled and is being tracked I think it's quite brazen to share that if indeed that person had stolen iPhone from Apple store of Apple has been close some of its stores temporarily during the protests It's Says it doesn't comment on security matters and instantly can enable a tool like this on every iPhone It's called find my it is pre-installed on every iPhone so if you want to set up and track your iPhone if stolen something you can do and this was supposed to be a big week for the games industry what happened we were surprised to see the big reveal of Sony's new PlayStation 5 games console and first title that was about to be released on that was supposed to be announced at an event on Thursday but Sony's postponed that event it said at the time we do not feel right now is a time for celebration and they wanted more important voices to be heard and some people say that's a bit cynical because perhaps only didn't want its launch event to be drowned out by all the news about the protests but either way it's likely the console will be on sale by the end of the year anyway so people still get games this year lots of gaming companies have rallied around this cause Xbox actually re-tweeted PlayStation saying we stand together electronic arts has donated million $ Interestingly Nintendo America posted a statement against inequality usually avoids any kind of controversy like this that is quite big from Nintendo the Pokemon company has donated 200000 $ to quality organizations Sega's making donations and Lego which also makes the game's raspberries or a toy company but they donated 4 million $ although they've corrected reports saying they were going to pull all the Lego police sets off the shelves they said that's not true still selling them they just ask their companies to stop advertising them right and in China a very true of e-sports has retired at the Grand old age Yeah this is China's most famous e-sports player scored jams how known online as boozy he retired at 23 due to ill health he's been a pro gamer since 2012's best known for playing

liberals have called for over the years you know treating is as as publishers rather than simple neutral platform we have seen governments around the world increasingly putting the pressure on social media sites to act in relation to a halt range of content and now the executive order from President Trump remakes that seemed like it might start happening of all of course that the wording of the executive order is very vague and it is kind of like going to be a long process lawyers will be scratching their heads over exactly what this will mean but definitely feels as if they now are responding not just tea calls for misinformation but also this whole area of politics and how closely involved the social media site should become in politics we see that Twitter and Facebook they have a very different approach approach Mark Zuckerberg has said that twitch that that Facebook should be \u00a3 of that political speech should be left alone now seeing Twitter taking the opposite approach in some ways Yeah not a united front from the social media companies that battle will rumble on and on Let's look at some other big tech stories with Jane another Titanic battle is one between the hallway and the United States it's another important step in a Canadian court and the court has ruled the that the case of senior while executive morning Wenger can go ahead and Mr. long is the chief financial officer of Weiwei is also the daughter of its founder she's been under house arrest in Vancouver now the US accuses Mr. amount of fraud she stand trial over allegedly violating us sanctions and what what the court has decided now is that the crime she was charged with in the US would also have been ones in Canada so that case is the Galahad and the battle between hallway and the United States goes ahead and is also rumblings around the world about her dealings with the Chinese company another Chinese company in the News this week and we learn something obvious there's money in tick-tock say tick-tock has become one of the huge hits of lockdown hasn't it and this has helped its owner by darts double its revenue from 7.4 billion $ in 2018 to 17 billion in 2019 and has private valuation of around 110 billion $ which would make it the most valuable startup in the world and tick tock has now been downloaded more than two billion times but not without controversy especially ironically around political content and how closely its sensor but it seems to be have become a huge huge hit in lockdown Yes it does indeed and why has boob been destroying bikes and scooters was that a it may seem counterintuitive when we've all been told during the pandemic we should get on our bikes rather the News public transport but moved east destroying thousands of them and electric scooters it sold its businesses and its rental business to to rival line and that meant it also acquired thousands of these bikes but this these all models but decided it was surplus to requirements and Uber said the best way to get rid of them was to responsibly recycle them that has left some charities scratching their heads and saying would it have been better today donate them to community groups Yeah we're gonna be cycling to work in the near future here in the UK said maybe we could have done with a few days Yeah listen to detect 10 on the BBC world service with Rory

President before Mr. Macri Katy Watson has our South America correspondent this though was all about the economy Mr. Macri came to power in 2015 promising economic miracles really talked about zero poverty and shaking up the economy which we're huge promises but 4 years later one in 3 Argentinians are in poverty inflation around 50% unemployment on the rise the country is in recession so people were fed up they blamed Mr. Macri for a lot of the economic problems what is Alberta for Abbas going to do that so different especially economically one person we need to talk about who's probably key to all this is Cristina Fernandez Kisner she was in power until 2015 for two terms and price that her late husband Nestor Kishna they are parents Christine it is a very controversial figure she is a populist she introduced a lot of welfare programmes that benefited Argentinians now the critics say it's that encouraged mismanagement of the economy there was a lot of spending it wasn't necessary but Nevertheless Newsbeat Argentinians on the streets as the had the time and time again I was there people felt at times much better under Cristina in fact when I said he will vote for a better though or Madison Macri a lot of people like voting for Christina such is her power if you like and influence that people wanted and that kind of generous spending leader back in fact she is now the vice president and a lot of people feel she'll have a lot of influence in the leadership of Alberto Fernandez you say influence who is actually going to be running the show is it him or will it be her well he is the President I think what's important is that depending on who you speak to obviously a lot of people who voted for him because of her he's a centre left politician who perhaps will be a bit more moderate and the Is who you voted for him feel he might be a good steady leader to get Argentina out of the economic crisis that it's currently in the fact is that Argentina is uneconomic Masson they may have promises they've talked about the end to austerity trying to stop the suffering of Argentinians is the words they used when they won the elections on Sunday but with fewer with what money given that Argentina is struggling the campaign itself past of passionately but peacefully is that stability likely to halt all very early on Alberto Fernandez said that he would talk to marry your Mac read to enable a steady hand over was pointed out to me that shows just how strong democracy it is in Argentina is very strong ideals at that's admirable given what's going on in the fact that they've gone from right-to-left certainly Argentina is split this seems to be a lot of respect for trying to make that transition is neat and peace as possible Katy Watson there's been a hidden threat every item we discussed this week the power of social media its influence is how we behave particularly at election time the big social media companies have come in for fierce criticism for her they have been used in elections this week Twitter announced that it would ban on political advertising Facebook famously is taking the opposite route Here's our media editor Amol Rajan the decision by Jack Dorsey co-founder and CEO of Twitter to ban political ad globally is more significant for its timing and the principal uphold the practical effect it will have a modern democracy political ads on Twitter I just a fraction in scale and impact of those on Facebook Mr. Dorsey new its chief financial officer has since confirmed that this decision will have little impact on the company's bottom line they therefore calculated that they could win a thumbs up from regulators and public opinion at little cost to the business at a time when social media companies are facing much greater scrutiny from lawmakers including a possible presidential run from the Democrat Elizabeth Warren who wants to break up big tech it is handy to demonstrate to the world of politics that you're thinking hard about your responsibilities and this week's move also presented Mr. Dorsey with an irresistible chance to provoke Facebook who live in a more difficult position on the subject it cannot be a coincidence that Mr. Dorsey's tweet was just a fortnight after Mark Zuckerberg speech at Georgetown University on the same subject a dividing line between the company's is useful for Twitter it puts the onus on Facebook to once again defend its stance and represents a minor escalation in the policy cold war but between the two tech giants but tactics aside what of the principal it clearly unsatisfactory have misinformation spreading around the web or two foreign or malign actors trying to play a role in elections where they have no right for role using social media to wield influence under the radar there is However a big gap between the clamour and something must be done sentiment understandably</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

which we live and but what does the corporation look like what are they doing with the Bluetooth standard in order space to share the love of it where but not the virus I split the two main things about this new Google app Paul initiative while is that there was a big problem with the Singapore Bluetooth module which is because Bluetooth is not good for privacy because it will basically Daesh out information about you to any other Bluetooth devices in the area Apple and newer Android devices don't allow it to keep running when you're not using it so if you want to use you have to have the app running hand the phone switched on and unlocked in Singapore there are complaints that if you run the app you have to leave your phone in your pocket unlocked you might pocket dial somebody don't pocket dial or somebody steals your phone they have instant access to life so Google and Apple said OK right we fix this will make it so that with your contact tracing app you can leave Bluetooth low energy running even with the phone locked or even when using the phone something else great so all people developing apps when brilliant will be a real help but then Google and Apple were in communication with all sorts of groups around the world who are developing their own ideas for apps and came across this project called DP 3T for decentralised privacy preserving proximity tracing for which uses Bluetooth but in a D centralised way to instead of Singapore where all the data could get uploaded to a central base matching happened there this is a model where it still uses Bluetooth text exchanges courage he changes the code more often so it's much harder to associate opinion the signal closure one phone but all the data stays on the phones and anytime it would leave the phones is if you do have the disease you upload the code you send out to a central database but with no other information about you and then the other apps running the other phones just checking with the database periodically to see if any of the code they received match any of those which now tagged there's this came from an infectious person's phone to see if they might come into contact but the central database doesn't know anything about them or who they are where they've been so that's why it's called privacy preserving because nobody has the whole picture nobody has access to all the data about everybody using it and Google and Apple have now built this thing in to how this will work on their phones they're good they got term an API which is the interface if somebody wants to build an app that will interface with Google or Apple operating system but cause lots of different countries are looking at lots of different models and centralised versus the centralised and so on and I wonder therefore how much for instance this plays out with data protection and the legislation around that varies greatly amongst different countries and indeed consonants for well Yes and Europe for example we have the GDPR with the General data protection regulation which governs personal data and there's not much more personal and way of was who are you near and what your disease statuses so there's been some concern me for example the the information Commissioner's office in the UK said that in order to comply with GDP are general good practice then government definitely should use a decent lie Sized model that Apple and Google have facilitated by another country is in France and Germany they are much more keen to have a centralised model because they want to be able to use the data for other purposes interesting Switzerland just announced that they are then completely embraced the decentralised privacy preserving model I didn't have this says something about Swiss assist French culture but they are developing an app which isn't completely conform to Google and Apple's model where as I think some other countries might say look this is a public health emergency need to be a bit flexible about things like GDPR which is legally allowed so it's quite an interesting power play I think between the big tech companies who are saying we want a platform that will work anywhere in the world so that everything will work are interchangeable basis and if you do move between countries then it's still a work in different jurisdictions but also I think they are slightly saying it is all very well for you nice Liberal democracy in Europe to have some to give up your data to the government and let the government know things like where you are and who you're with but there's lots of places in the world where chronic virus is also a problem but that he might not want to give up image dated to the central government because their history using is not so good so in a sense they have drawn a boundary around what they will facilitate which it does take away some control from national governments and often times we will say well Google and Apple you're not elected who are</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

what would the green party deal with the European Union look like will beckon 2016 I started investigating areas where I thought we might be able to improve things if we went ahead with Brexit in two areas clearly of farming policy and trade policy at the moment we have trade policy that is not particularly beneficial to the poorer countries of the world and also involves a lot of unnecessary trade so we would try and have a trade policy was much more about self-reliance and much less about global trade and swapping biscuits and swapping beef and unnecessary trade swaps waste energy and on the farming side I think we can really improve the way we use land for carbon capture strengthening biodiversity for improving water retention and so on but we wouldn't want to be negotiating Brexit what we think is if we have a strong bunch of of green MPs in Parliament we can stop Brexit Let's talk about the economy now one of your main economic policies in recent years has been advocating the introduction of a universal basic income why do you think people in Britain would benefit from that I say one of them is to remove this sense of insecurity that many people have if they can't find permanent employment or if they're in in insecure employment and also the stigmatisation of people on welfare benefits more widely what we're seeing is a major transformation of our Labour market and with the advent of robots and artificial intelligence many of the jobs we do now won't be necessary and that is why we see the Big tech giants actually coming through and saying universal basic income is a good idea what I want to see is a situation where the value that comes from that transformation of our economy doesn't accrue to some of these huge tech giants are making so much money at the moment so instead of the technological change making a small number of people rich it provides leisure further the vast majority of us and how do you fund that that the beginning a major way funding will be through introducing a carbon tax which is obviously also part of the pressure to encourage the transition away from fossil fuels we think that would be able to provide most of the funding but we're also an increasing corporation tax at the moment it is on 17% which is one of the lowest rates in many OECD countries we would increase to 24% which the OECD average and we think that would bring in additional money on corporation tax together with the four-day week that you would like to see introduced over time isn't there a danger that entrepreneurs investors see Britain as a place that is anti business what we see at the moment is an economy where small businesses are actually unable to compete because it's the corporate players who are dominating the market we want to make sure there's a level competitive playing field the thing that really makes it hard to do business if you're an entrepreneur is the fact that lets you set for a coffee shop in town but you know that the Starbucks next stories using all sorts of transfer pricing agreement to avoid paying tax well you have to pay tax we need to regulate the global economy properly so that small businesses in our communities have a chance to compete and be viable Let's turn to the environment you want to spend 100 billion \u00a3 over the next parliament that about 130 billion $ on various measures to try to see climate proof the United Kingdom what will that money be spent on there's so much we need to do to make sure that we are reducing our impact in terms of carbon emissions but also that we are resilient and ready for the climate change consequences that are coming our way already one thing is we need to electrify are hollow transport network we need to make sure we have either electric hydrogen buses in town and all our trains are electrified and we need to make sure that we encourage people to use public transport by making sure it's affordable and much more accessible and much more frequent than it is now and then in terms of homes we have some of the worst housing stock anywhere in Europe our homes leak energy said therefore expensive to heat but at the same time we're heating our homes through gas and obviously what we're talking about is a 10 year transition away from fossil fuels so we have to convert all homes in Britain so that they are heated by electricity and heat pumps rather than having always gas boilers that 90% of homes have Alanis will be expensive but it's something we need to invest in for future and at the same time I think we need to understand that this will create a lot of high-quality jobs as part of that you want Britain to be carbon neutral by the year 2030 effectively the UK would not be committing any carbon dioxide that is not offset by measures current law set a target date 2050 what might that mean say for a car car with day have to sell their car how would it work for the individual it is about a transition so it's not about having to change everything needed tomorrow but it is about making that transition as quickly as possible we like to see cars reduced in towns and eventually removed altogether following the model of cities like Amsterdam and Oslo instead Thames will be places where people can just stop and talk and have a sociable time they move</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

state owned banking sector the energy sector and even where it's not state-owned you have sort of politically connected people like the people who run big tech companies like Ali Baba are intense and so you know it works in a very different way in a place like China where you don't have elections you have one party that is in power but in a sense the party pervades all areas of life anyway so you know the sort of lobbying industry I think is no operator very differently it is not in the parallel as is very hard to make with what happens in America what does he has come back to America and eggs one by one of the things I think legally now all obvious Ashley registered them is that right of thrill of but they have to identify themselves as lovely as it and our campaign finance laws in the us are very very weak so you can go up to the line of actually being a lobbyist just not spend it is many hours while being edged you would have to to actually to clear areas of RBS so there are a lot of people who are working as a lobbyist in Washington who did not identify themselves as lobbyists so don't have to comply with campaign finance laws which then opens things up to corruption which is what we would mention just now because the potentially people could get under the wire as it were and I suppose use money I want to know if this does go on that but that could be a way forward as a means of persuasion absolutely and we have what we call on the US dark money which never has to be reported and I Kennedy aide or a political action committee can take these donations never have to say where they came from so we have incredible amount of money in our political system and was upheld a ruling in the Supreme court and several years ago and every year these dark money groups keep spending more and more money and campaigns and there were bankers in that room at that hearing and I know that they contributed to the the campaigns of the committee members and they are they are just even if they didn't tweet to say anything just silently there watching know anyone who's watched expose something like I am house of cards will know what seemed a lobbyist represented in that and the influence they do or don't have the but the point surely is also that in the end and it's the politicians the the elected politicians who make the decisions so they are held accountable whatever the system is for making those decisions absolutely any Yeah you made a good point earlier that the bankers had every right to be at that hearing the hearing I covered was about revising the Dodd Frank regulations the bar that was put in place after the financial crisis that did Breen in US banks the banks every every right to be at that hearing end to make their views known but at the same time they are making campaign contributions a lot of them are above board end and we got a lot a lot of these dark money groups are are also contributing so its its but does dark money groups are perfectly we got a I suppose Andrew the point is that the people put a lot of money into people can pay a lot of money to lobbyists and they would do it if they didn't think it was effective which is perhaps a row worrying element of absolutely I think the danger is if it becomes systemic right so you're absolutely right if if you think that some politicians have made some decisions and because they are beholden to a particular industry they've been paid to do that well you can vote them out of office in a couple of years time or 4 years time the problem then is if all that happens is that the party comes in also is beholden to those same lobbyists because because of the revolving Indoor because of the money involved then you know that the ordinary voter like you and me is powerless to stop this and that's that's the real danger that we need some checks and balances that checks things like you know if you've been a congressman for the cabinet officials may be you shouldn't be allowed to work for a lobbyist for a certain amount of years after you've been in office those kind of those kind of regulations could be brought in I mean you know we all know that the campaign finance situation America is kind of out of control anyway in some sort of regulation needs to be put on that limit limiting contributions to campaigns that's reform could could be enacted as well so I think you know that the system needs more checks and balances than just the ballot box every tool for 6 years what Renner's Nancy had you think Americans take the idea of restrictions on whether people are going to lobbying after they held office back and think</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

then plush a careful course tiptoeing around some of the fights at this patchy if not the best party in the world to be asked of all the time but as we watch the UK stumble into the Hall nothing to prevent is under way It's clear it's getting colder outside had a perfect example of why kill economics a mixture of comedy and economics works Let's see how many last we can get out of European competition policy now back to our panel the EU is regulating Pretty aggressively on behalf of the consumer Margarita this dire the competition Commission has taken up the cudgels again Tina do you see her continuing to pursue the big tech companies that's been the pattern over the last few years Europe versus the likes of FacebookGoogle and sell in short Yes for historical or any other reasons Europe is much more cognizant of the risks in particular relating to privacy there is also a sense that some of the big tech American firms have become too big to fail and so big and have such influence over our lives that they need to be reined back in I think Margaret Vestager is someone who has taken up this cause and clearly has been rewarded for what he's done so far which includes billions in fines against major American technology brands and others that she has been given the job again only bigger and in the words of one of the biggest competition lawyers in Europe whose name escapes me right now he told me listen I think it's true she is the single most powerful technology regulator in the world right now some people might say that this is just a case of sour grapes nice tech firms have got their America well let me break them up and let me make their existence in Europe harder when she like that day well maybe and then taken away from you I don't know if that's the case or not certainly there's a lot of talk of creating and supporting European Champions and the technology space that's seen as a zero-sum game we have to make the American Champions smaller so we get the European ones to be bigger but long story short I think the agenda of regulating technology and how it impacts people's lives and how it impacts people spending money and markets and behaviour is going to continue and Stefan will be starting in Brussels bill black what the American view on that is easy that Europe has shown the way forward with things like the GDPR data protection rules with this sort of that talk of you know maybe we will break up Facebook and so on and the USA's following behind or it is is there a general view that it is sour grapes for none of the above actually teach and I trust that the interesting thing I would say in the United States is that right is beginning to rethink these issues one of the big changes in every trust over the last 40 years is the right decided it shouldn't much exist and in particular should not exist and tech because networks are more valuable and inherently basically create a natural monopoly they are now starting to reconsider that because there's seen how much political power and personal power is seeded eventually something they care about a lot tends to get squashed in terms of Europe she is the toughest because elsewhere there has been an essential means no regulation I would know whenever key decision has been overturned by the court so even within the EU context she her power years less than many people I think and I would note that after most of these settlements in awards the stock price increases David Williams Ireland also the data protection commissioner who is effectively the data protection commissioner for all of Europe she's in charge of the likes of Facebook and and and some because they have the dog this particular round Yeah I must tell you worry about that were trying to pretend we don't but we do I think the interesting thing for stagger I was reading the profile of her she is the daughter of the Lutheran minister she is a very very moral view for she is doing about fairness about taxation and she seems to like many domestic politicians She was the leader of a small part in Denmark she then went to the European Commission she got to make a big personal statement for improved Commission and who knows what she might do which was back to Dumbarton was less interesting personal story here the other issue I think it is absolutely right about privacy and again I was really intrigued by by buying been in Germany last week very difficult</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

responsibility as consumers well there's a there's a problem in that internet providers basically say anybody who wants to list a third party vendor and I am resigned if you want a list should be complying with the laws and regulations if you persevere and the industry but as it turned out was Street Journal discovered all kinds of pressures being sold the am resigned or should I say it's kind of a flea market they discover situations people a dumpster diving selling on the web and things of this nature how Facebook to know if everybody who wants to sell the their platform is complying out when they find the problem and is on the same they take them down but they don't have the capacity to go and inspect these people it It's kind of a copout by government agencies say you are

were younger before there was an internet my wife and I would take the kids to the beach for summer vacations there are always vendors on the side of the road selling shellfish shelf Fisher's is tough stuff to keep sanitary the way you're supposed to we had a basic rule we just didn't buy anything that was caught from other than a store and I think people should follow everyone shopping on that and the net and mean they should basically by from established vendors regular restaurants and so forth there are plenty of them in lots of options to do that are buying from home kitchens with whom you're not familiar is a very dangerous gambit enough to do it within the wrong community L there's this summer was making food out of the house people they get a reputation people are getting sick it's OK thumb Yeah it's very blind Yeah Yeah you're right Peter I do come back to that buyer beware under as the internet develops as consumers I do think we also have a role to play in being careful

goods look after services how does a beauty as an economist what it is it in theory that all seems to work with but the problem is that which end up doing is disenfranchising specific groups of people so in the case of the UK It's gonna be the people who were picking fields low income earners I saw these industries within the United Kingdom are going to have to disappear because the idea that you're not gonna get strawberries on the shelf because of this is ludicrous is still its drivers on a shelf because will be grown elsewhere the just a cost more in Nats were really La removing the free market to move just increases the cost of low-cost items and and that's the real problem that's where UK economy will suffer Moss buttery interpreted interest in a row thanks very much indeed for that we will move onto some company news here because we have seen the biggest tech companies world report their earnings first up was Apple harvest of hours ago the last few hours we've had Tesla and Facebook also Microsoft and a talk about Microsoft a second but Tesla first hand record sales in 2019 record revenues on the other hand we had Facebook recorded its first annual fall in profits last 5 years reason increased cost of trying to put right always problems said privacy our reporter Zoe Thomas brought up speed and San Francisco even in general do you think this is really good News Facebook had strong results are still doing very well added users it need more money than it did in the last quarter and more than investors expected it to you but it growth is slowing and days because having to spend all these additional costs around privacy it need be raising concerns around the size of its advertising lawyer so on this is making investors are really worried about what's going to happen if Facebook the future and how it's going to be spending money on these fundamental problems as regards Facebook Alvear she just of things which might be sorted out next year or so said on a call with investors that Twenty20 is going to be a particularly intense year for Facebook's it does suggest that some of these are sort of short term and not problems with the business but it is going to have to make big changes people are concerned about privacy on Facebook they're concerned about the spread of false information and so to combat that is because to spend a lot of money to fix it could come up with new ways of dealing with how information is up there how much regulated with Anna Tims say and has to make decisions about who was going to advertise on the Facebook platform that's not just FacebookInstagram much that as well until all that is leading to these concerns about how much money they are going to have to spend in the short term and what that means for the long term because if these but has to make fundamental changes to its business this year in 20 and 21 2025 what is going to mean for a look at Facebook the shape of Facebook and Reddit users are they going to be using it differently are they still going to be coming to Facebook in the same way that investors are waiting Turks can feel EURO with Facebook the other big tech story is of course has which in some ways it's the opposite this is very much a new kid on the tech block as it were and it's releases turned a corner for the good Yeah and Tesla is having a very great day it released its earnings and they are doing better than expected and Starc went up it's actually had and media works stock grouse in the last 3 months it is now valued at over a billion dollars investors think it's on the right path as one of the key things for them that Tesla's production numbers are up it delivered more than 100000 vehicles in the quarter now that may not seem like so much when you compare turf for a word or two general Motors but that's the most vehicles Tesla has ever delivered in a single quarter and it shows that its production facilities are working smoothly It's Still got quite a lot of demand and because production is one of the things that Tesla said was its starting production of its moral why that's the sport utility vehicle it started that ahead of schedule and that's really expected to bring in a new sector buyer so that's very very positive news for it has famously just started of its new factory in China and if you think about it for hours to come back to that old story is not a good time to be doing that great tennis Canada in eye Kieswetter on the one hand it's a very strong story It's very good story there is demand for Tesla's in China and just open production facilities they are doing very very well doing better than expected but as you say on the other hand the chronic back as but that into question how is this going to be doing give in it when the Lunar new year ends and production is supposed to come back online what will that mean for test production going forward we don't know where we're expecting the company to make some comments about it but they may not know yet rider It's unclear how much this is going to affect back and Casella test I just bring you up-to-date with the latest figures we have from Microsoft they

company from like no access to finance to regulation but little challenges she is also interested in Lens and it's this big tech solutions like Bitcoin is the crypto-currency I know that the government of Ethiopia thinks that the technology centric economy could end up creating 3 million jobs is that's too optimistic how possible is that really for a country like Ethiopia where the for example mobile phone penetration still quite low internet connection is easy not Ohio on every Street corner or And in every home by any means yet it's absolutely challenging but I am looking at it from the opposite side so if he's the first us when I start to think that the issue was 0.4% of the population having the penetration was very long now we have around 12 to 15% of peak girls and and other output is a huge number of population to appear all 100 million create a huge amount of market opportunity and that was Merkel's Lemar chief executive of the tech business consultancy ice that this talking to Mike Johnson that the tech scene in Africa listening to the BBC world service the world's radio station It's a very good evening to a listers on satellite radio in the United States on Sirius XM Channel 1.0 and a special Hello Wallace's in KingstonJamaica I want a full . 3 now how much do you pay for a haircut a row erupted here in the UK ever claimed women are paying over the odds for the same style as men one woman told the BBC she was turned away by two Barber shops which are often cheaper than salons just because she was a woman and equality act of 20 temperature checks people from discrimination it means that when providing goods and services business must not discriminate against anyone on the grounds of gender so our barbershops breaking the law by refusing to cut women's pair I've got you in employment and equality lawyer Elizabeth McGlone a partner at Bindmans LLP saw the face of it this seems discriminatory but there are justifications for providing services to sink sexes you can justify discrimination on the grounds all its affected to provide a service to both sexes Alternatively you can objectively justified it as being appropriate but on the face of it if you go into a Barber's shop and ask for a short haircut number two short back and sides the bar should say that's fine not discriminate on grounds of sex if you go into a Barber's shop and sell on a full head of highlights made an offer that service slightly different argument so if you do feel as though you've been discriminated against what's the best course of action go through a call see you have aid discrimination claim in the County court rather than implement tribunal because this is the provision of services claim and it would be a section 29 and the equality act but Unfortunately the cost benefit of doing so is gonna be disproportionate the time it's gonna take you the cost the best way to out the issue is going to be social media badly beyond the on the salon /barbershop and tell your friends to boycott because they don't provide services to women that will be a lot more detrimental then a long-standing claim in the County court some hairdressing organisations say look these prices are justified because Women's haircuts often much more complicated but do you think that argument still stands particularly with the fact that my sons for example go in with all these strange requests for certain shapes be shaved into their hands I think that argument is less and less viable because I am more and more men go to barbers shops for an experience so a close shave hot towel shape and there are more and more bespoke Barber shops opening but also people want more for their money so I've example we spent 3 hours in a salon go in and come out and I don't want to be proved pipped prepped so I think actually nowadays there's more of a balancing act because people's desires changed into the less justification high-cost you have short hair heavy founder Barber will cut your I've never had a problem with a Barb not wanting to cut we have had bad cuts haircut had Shaun cuts from barbers by and never been turned away and do feel as though you're paying less as a result my average cost of a haircut is about 10 to 15 \u00a3 say Yes pair lot less and that was Elizabeth McGlynn their partner at Bindmans LLP said she'd seek out bargains paying 30 to 20 $ as opposed to around 4 45 to 50 $ which I would say the average price for cuts for women here now Liz square in Ankara Prime 7 News is listening into this list think you're being ripped off in the Salam absolutely play in 10 to 15 \u00a3 I weave Cyprus we pay about 250 $ every month that is coloured are ending</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

cash rich society I ask German France why the hell does this and they said because when used a credit card people know where you are the bases about privacy because back to come back to second world war was a German history they don't want anyone knowing anything more than the have to do is the place where Google Street view was mostly went out precisely so jihadis deep cultural differences in terms of privacy interest citizens versus the state in terms of oversight all that stuff there's also an interesting perspective from the Irish point of view because on the one hand there's support for what was a very very much want to do in terms of regulating on the other hand are you not read blockade I was gonna say I think I had to chase the islanders the country that was offered 13 billion quid certain facts Yeah right Remy remind people about that so this is it this is a tax that the European Commission slapped on Apple for tax avoidance not evasion and avoidance and most bizarrely decided we are not taxing we decide we are done with a new 13 billion $ to do a bit of a joke I think it be done we have a housing crisis we could build a break of state as of so we want to believe you can have a back its image are over the telly and over his alleged torture It's like a big role for but so does violence position Ireland is deeply complicit in what the multinationals do we are facilitating wholesale diversion of tax revenues the European Commission driven by European leaders the revenue side of your good simple hold on a second when I click on and Zong and I buy something I'm France the French authorities should be getting whatever their tax revenue it is going to want getting recycled appointed is because like two columns point of small countries and small countries have to use the tax system to steal a March on big countries that again small countries have always been dominated by the tune of geography the tune of size if we do not want to have the right stuff we have and the standard of living we have we dealt exclusively amongst yourselves and therefore how many people care we remain very poor country we have to actually trade if you know capital bases we hadn't by the late 80s through 20 min depends what I think we know a couple of base so we have to import Cup but how do you do that you gotta make cheap how do you tax at a different rate so we are in Ireland have a serious issue at stake with what the European Commission doing we also have the right to have a tax system that is discriminatory because that's part of the industry Arsenal but how do we reconcile of those the team whatever we think about this whole row about tax taxing these multinationals the big question is why is Europe not producing its own big tech giants to grow here and supply billiard tax at home what's the story here is America right to say we we built Facebook where your Facebook 41 Facebook page I don't come here I'm on Facebook I don't think the question here is there we have gone from defining technology as nuts and bolts innovation things that add affect humanity and its productivity and and live for a Grand scale Defining technology today and as any data collecting social network and I'm just not sure that is what technology and innovation are there are companies in Europe that are European technology Champions that makes stuff they go into other stuff that make it work you may not know what they're called but they exist but if you look at AI for example is a huge race going on in AI between United States and China and Europe is way behind isn't it well I think that that may be in part because are obviously social vested interest and social models that would be a bit sceptical about AI would were arrested but at the same time I would point out is that the real race there is with China Europe is definitely thinking about this some might argue that you know there is a lot of talent in Europe but that's really going to the US for work and and is not the sort of staying at home and innovating at home but I wouldn't write our European innovation quite yet we're moving towards a conclusion I want each of you to just addressed finally this question of whether the European project over the next 5 years is moving ahead of what could be stuck in stuck in neutral or even in in reverse and

place and looking back I think that was actually a mistake the attitude that was brought to the table by Microsoft we made more than their share of mistakes and I think it's an interesting story because we had to learn are what we had learned was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves but the way other people size we had to learn to connect with the world we needed to assume more responsibility we needed to compromise and accept regulation as it was imposed on us and here in that story I do think there are parallels for the tech sector is Hall today because it was tempting of course this was personified by bill gates more than anybody else tempting to see this sort of the key extraordinarily smart business leaders in a new enterprise tech oriented who really was we sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge but of course bill gates wasn't really like that at all just as Mark Zuckerberg more recently isn't really like that at all not just the EU but the key is a ruthless business man I do with that into worse statement that Bruyne whether I would suggest he is in the world of technology people start companies with a great idea and then moving very fast and I think one of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast one should never move faster than the speed of fire and they think if you look at the history of digital technology it has had a tenancy at times for companies to move fast the old slogan was move fast and break things I think the new just drove for a second that point you think Microsoft was guilty of that in its determination to absolutely dominate and ruled the operating system market for PCs I think that what we learned was that we need to think more broadly in the areas they sing Hill area of focus that you often find in a very successful tech companies Microsoft will be among them and then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact for sure having line others other people in your industry the world is a war is so much greater they have to step back and internalise that that's the key to accept more responsibility interesting so if that's the place that big Tech's that today do you understand the cause of the being made across the political spectrum in the United States right now for the break up of the biggest companies know if we will name them then they would be Amazon on app for alphabet of course have Google then be Microsoft and Facebook there are among will quote you Senator Elizabeth Warren who form presidential candidate of the Democratic party calling for the break up of those big companies because she says they fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy I do believe we need to say strengthen the Democratic side of the balance of power in democracy I don't believe that you need to break Kompany's up I don't even believe that the best or fastest path to restore the power that the governments especially the democratic governments are elected by the public should have we learned from Microsoft's own experience that while the government in our case 20 years ago actually pursue the break up of the company it could accomplish what it wanted and needed with out doing that and you can move a lot faster as a government to do it a different way so let's talk about the rule of regular Asian origin put it in the book used the word guard rails to ensure that the public is well served tell me what you think the guard rail should look like we don't have today I think wine should start by asking what problems we want to sign of in the Ukraine card real to solve the twine certainly will look around the world today there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved there are issues around privacy there are issues around cybersecurity there are issues around the use of artificial intelligence since saying something like facial recognition there are economic issues especially the impact technology is having on jobs in the future of the economy and in some places in the world there are some guard rails in place say in Europe but Brown something my privacy but almost everywhere you look I think we need additional guard rails we need to guard rails they will be essential for a decade had two Twenty20s and we need to start building Let's get specific go and let's start with privacy and data because goodness knows technology allows every single one of us now to use our smartphones and laptops and tablets to acquire used information and then bide also</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

a kind of code of conduct tell us more about that idea I was thinking about that the fact that at the moment right and wrong it isn't we need to find online so all the products that we are using and their services are defined by their business models as replaced outright say we've been thinking about what does it look like actually if everyone agrees there are things just don't happen if you turn off political advertising for its us and that is it is a standard everywhere if you agreed date if you're not sharing information between Sutton and bodies and that happens everywhere and that at the moment things are happening on the face of books instant are creating lots of their own rules they are creating their own rules about whether it is appropriate to show nipples or not they are creating their own rules about the kind of content that is appropriate and not really and drawing on the history of those things and for instance if you think about how I am in Meiji created Thursday cancel of industry people who choose there's a major and they choose belittles the pictures there are most representative imminent important for people and think actually doing is they are legislating on language and communication and there's actually nobody who is sitting back and saying these things all right away It's putting too much power moment into the hands of the private capital it cannot continue because any thing of nature that Rachel describing this kind of settlement rules for example to keep political advertising of the internet that would take a massive political will and that brings me back to where we started top of this half of the programme any when you said that users need to put some of this because the audience to this programme users said tell them what they should be doing in your view Jason I am slightly Jogee should resign as they die I get nervous when governments have too much control to last well Yes and one way we can sort of shape that is by choices too so that's where yet when you look to speak to the audience what should they be doing with their choices to move this in the right direction well there are all sorts of alternatives to the big tech firms the other at the moment I mean we have each of us collectively built all of them through the sharing of data and the use of their services there are smaller alternatives to each of them never quite as good there a little bit clunky the don't work quite as well a but never getting any better until more and more people start using them and so I think is quite important for all of us to to think consciously about what we are clicking on what services we are using a try maybe to spread your clicks around a little bit further so we can have a slightly more competitive market place and that will in the end depend on us we may have to trade some far off convenience in that regard you think carefully about the decisions you make when you click just like you do when you go shopping because it is just as important and Lewis attackers kind back to a point you made about the competition through the start-ups because I spoke to James just been describing is the nurturing the fragile young plants in the in the marketplace I suppose that's also speaks to you saying Yeah I mean I think that it's difficult though the user levels the kind of incentivised that because you have to really one of the things people are sad for start-ups and sign up for these smaller companies because they are genuinely useful or not because they have a good interest in mind they want to take the power away from GoogleFacebook and people using very easy in their work for them so what what in the marketplace what should happen in the marketplace right now to make this work in the best you can do Rate now is to a deal privacy settings and be careful about what kind of deal you share thinking now as you were saying do you realise that you're contributing to these companies every time you pull something every new shared deal with Emma share information you are helping and now we can use these platforms and maybe don't share as much I think that's a good thing for people to realise that you are contributing Lee Berger these platforms are really thinking about in that context understanding but also realising they're just still leading Facebook getting new services really privileged know there are a lot of parts of the world where for his book is essentially the internet should start-ups not be available to buy Yeah I think would be a good start early you're making sure that they're able to Syrian regulatory framework in which they can compete and feel like they can compete without it being a symbol of an acquisition has that can work I think it's hard to figure out exactly how it would work but I think they're making sure they have the right funding in a Howard these easy for organising think that especially other parts of the world we have a great venture capital structure here in the us that's really excited in</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
