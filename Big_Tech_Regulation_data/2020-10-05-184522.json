A genuinely powerful intellect, that's what. Enough to elicit a weekly instead of a walk. The most interesting thing I saw last week was A Tax to Fix Big Tech[1], an op-ed by economist Paul Romer[2] in The New York Times, proposing a progressive tax on corporate revenues from sales of search advertising. </p><p>'Putting a levy on targeted ad revenue would give Facebook and Google a real incentive to change their dangerous business models,' he wrote. About those dangerous business models, Romer had little to say except that It is the job of government to prevent a tragedy of the commons. That includes the commons of shared values and norms on which democracy depends. The dominant digital platform companies, including Facebook and Google, make their profits using business models that erode this commons. They have created a haven for dangerous misinformation and hate speech that has undermined trust in democratic institutions. And it is troubling when so much information is controlled by so few companies. What is the best way to protect and restore this public commons? Most of the proposals to change platform companies rely on either antitrust law or regulatory action. I propose a different solution. Instead of banning the current business model - in which platform companies harvest user information to sell targeted digital ads - new legislation could establish a tax that would encourage platform companies to shift toward a healthier, more traditional model. He relied for a foil on Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposals[3] to break up big tech companies, using antitrust statutes or regulation. He wrote, 'Existing antitrust law in the United States addresses mainly the harm from price gouging, not the other kinds of harm caused by these platforms, such as stifling innovation and undermining the institutions of democracy.' And regulators and judges can be captured by clever lawyers and patient corporate lobbyists. (Nothing here about the legislators who would enact and monitor the tax statutes and laws.) There are several advantages to using tax legislation as a strategy, according to Romer. The tax he had in mind could apply to revenue from sales of targeted digital ads, the core businesses of Facebook, Google and other firms that make money monitoring users' searches. 'At the federal level, Congress could add it as a surcharge to the corporate income tax. At the state level, a legislature could adopt it as a type of sales tax on the revenue a company collects for displaying ads to residents of the state.' Such a tax could be progressive, creating an impediment to growth through acquisition, and an incentive to periodic spin-offs, and thus greater competition. He added several FAQS[4] the next day on his website about various tax aspects. There was, alas, very little speculation about the new ad-free subscription models that might emerge as a means of avoiding taxes on targeted ad revenue, except to say that subscribers would be mindful of the privacy they obtained by avoiding the ever-more sophisticated surveillance of their habits by traditional search services, and subscription companies 'could succeed the old-fashioned way: by delivering a service that is worth more than it costs.' Along with countless others, I share Sen. Warren and Nobel-laureate Romer's sense that Facebook and Google and other big Internet firms have become highly undesirable corporate citizens in their current gigantic and highly profitable ad-supported form. Surely newspapers are among the 'institutions of democracy' that would be strengthened by some governmental reshaping of advertising markets. Those with long memories will recall that, as a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, Romer was the government's expert in the remedy phase of the Justice Department's successful (to that point) antitrust complaint against Microsoft Corp[5]. His recommendation was to break the company into two competing firms - one selling its Windows operating systems, the other marketing software applications (including its highly profitable Office suite). The remedy was headed for implementation, until an appellate court sent the case back to a different judge. The election of George W. Bush mooted the issue; the Justice Department withdrew its complaint: a salutary victory against big business slipped away. Romer had left research by then to start an online learning company. In 2007 he quit Stanford altogether to work as a policy entrepreneur - a natural enough path for the son of a former governor of Colorado[6] who had harbored national ambitions. Romer spent several years advocating for 'charter cities,' tax-favored enterprise zone in developing nations whose governance was to be somehow outsourced to independent authorities. Two attempts failed on the eve of what would have been their creation. In 2010, he joined New York University's Stern School of Business as a University Professor and for a time, Director of NYU's Marron Institute of Urban Management. In October 2016 he signed on as chief economist of the World Bank, with hopes of transforming its large and well-funded research department. Fifteen months later, he resign[7]ed, after a series of controversies with staff. By then he had come perilously close to gadfly status as a critic of macroeconomics[8]. He could speak so freely, he explained, 'because I am no longer an academic. I am a practitioner, by which I mean that I want to put useful knowledge to work. I care little about whether I ever publish again in leading economics journals or receive any professional honor because neither will be of much help to me in achieving my goals.' The Nobel award last year, jointly with William Nordhaus, 'for integrating technological innovations into long-run macroeconomic analysis,' rescued Romer from that limbo by certifying his stature. He married[9] the same day he received the prize. Since then, Romer has offered advice to incoming Word Bank President David Malpass, in an op-ed in the Financial Times(outsource the bank's research function and concentrate on infrastructure planning and financial diplomacy instead), and, last week, the op-ed in the Times Op-eds are only slightly better than TED talks[10]. But, as noted, really good ideas are rare. This one may be profound. It deserves plenty of further study. The post What Is So Rare[11] appeared first on Economic Principals[12].

But is Donald Trump's onslaught against Amazon chief Jeff Bezos really about the president's concern that the United States Postal Service (USPS) is getting a raw deal for delivering Amazon parcels?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Or is the source of his extreme irritation actually the Washington Post, the rejuvenated Bezos-owned title which has held the president and his administration to account under a portentous masthead line which reads \"Democracy dies in darkness\"?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For much of last week, Trump has been raging against his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">new favorite target</url>, Amazon - accusing the company of putting \"fully tax paying retailers\" out of business, and using the USPS as its \"Delivery Boy\" at the expense of American taxpayers.</p><p> I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">March 29, 2018</url></p><p>He has also chided \"The Fake News Washington Post\", Amazon's \"chief lobbyist\", railing against what he sees as its many \"phony headlines\" and bad reporting.</p><p>His Twitter rants continued in person as he addressed reporters on Air Force One, telling them: \"Amazon is just not on an even playing field. They have a tremendous lobbying effort, in addition to having the Washington Post ... What they have is a very uneven playing field.\"</p><p>Amazon stock has dropped from a $1,600 high on 12 March to $1,443 now. That is a $73bn drop in market capitalization over the past month. Based on estimates of Bezos's stock holdings, the Amazon founder may have lost $16bn from his personal fortune, the world's largest, over the same period.</p><p>For now, Bezos isn't reacting. \"I would not have bought the Washington Post if it had been a financially upside-down salty-snack-food company,\" he told <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">Fortune</url> magazine in 2016.</p><p>Trump says the title is \"used as a 'lobbyist' and should so REGISTER\". But the Washington Post has consistently rejected suggestions that Bezos has a hand in the paper's editorial decision making.</p><p>Publisher Frederick Ryan Jr said in a Post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">analysis</url> that its proprietor has \"never proposed a story\". </p><p>\"Jeff has never intervened in a story. He's never critiqued a story. He's not directed or proposed editorials or endorsements,\" Ryan said.</p><p>Last week, Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena estimated that for $250m the paper cost Bezos personally in 2013, the purchase could end up costing Amazon $75bn. But if Trump is hoping to pressure regulators to make a case against the company, it would ultimately fail. </p><p>\"We don't see how the current presidential rhetoric helps a US case against Amazon,\" Sena <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">wrote</url>. </p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">Trump's feud with Amazon is really about the Washington Post's success | Jill Abramson</url></p><p>The online retailer has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">reportedly</url> doubled its number of in-house lobbyists from 14 to 28 since Trump's election, more than double that of Facebook or Apple. While Google spends more on lobbying ($18m in 2017 to Amazon's $12m), Amazon's lobbyists span its sprawling interests: drones, autonomous vehicles and air cargo, cybersecurity, data privacy and intellectual property and cloud computing.</p><p>Big tech's Washington lobby presence parallels its growing vulnerability as, one by one, the tech giants are drawn into political disputes, with Facebook next in the spotlight: CEO Mark Zuckerberg is due to appear before Senate and House committees next week to answer questions on its failures to protect users' data.</p><p>Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, a global lobbying group for tech companies, said that big tech is preparing for battles ahead.</p><p>\"The question is no longer whether this is an intellectual exercise,\" he said. \"There is the Washington bubble/elite conversation about techlash, and there is real consumer concern around a host of issues, including how the tech sector uses and enables control over data.\"</p><p>How those two conversations now join together is dependent to some degree on the president and how his populist, anti-Amazon agenda plays with the political mainstream that is now looking at ways to limit the power of big tech companies.</p><p>Larry Kudlow, Trump's new economic adviser, appears to back the president's assault on Amazon. \"I just think he wants a level playing field with respect to taxing,\" Kudlow told Fox Business on Thursday. Kudlow's remark seemed to ignore Trump's own assertion during the presidential campaign that his own record of paying zero tax <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">\"makes me smart\"</url>.</p><p>Kudlow was referring to Amazon's tax advantages. Since its beginnings as an online bookseller in 1994, Amazon has taken an independent approach to taxes, collecting no state sales tax for many purchases until recently, and still does not pay local tax in some cases. </p><p>Moreover, Amazon is not always obligated to raise sales tax on sales through third party vendors, giving both vendors and Amazon advantages over brick-and-mortar retailers already suffering from changes in consumer habits. </p><p>Then there is the issue of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">post office</url>. According to Trump last Sunday: \"the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars.\" </p><p>He continued into the week. \"I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,\" Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">said</url> on Twitter. \"Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne [sic] by the American Taxpayer.\"</p><p>The reality is more complex. Over the past decade, the USPS has lost around $60bn despite a 60% increase in shipping and package revenue. Amazon's contract with USPS isn't public, but its use of the postal service to deliver packages for \"last mile\" delivery has helped the service make up for a steep drop in the volume of letter mail it delivers. In other words, the USPS needs more Amazons, not fewer.</p><p>According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">Vanity Fair</url>, Trump is discussing new ways to escalate his attacks. \"He's off the hook on this. It's war,\" one source told the magazine. \"He gets obsessed with something, and now he's obsessed with Bezos,\" said another.</p><p>But how far can he take the fight? Trump conjoined the Washington Post and Amazon into a single enemy with a tweet in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">December 2015</url>, immediately after the paper reported his campaign call for a ban of Muslim immigrants, and has continued the attacks on and off since. </p><p> After the Post published a story critical of the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, in July last year Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">claimed</url> the  Post was a lobbying arm for Amazon and that Amazon       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">costs</url> the postal service to deliver its packages. </p><p>Trump was apparently gleaning that information from a Wall Street Journal article published days earlier titled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">Why the Post Office Gives Amazon Special Delivery</url> that argued that Amazon was using its size to take advantage of the postal service. </p><p>According to Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">Public Citizen</url>, a consumer advocacy group, there's no question Trump attacks Amazon as a surrogate for Bezos and the Washington Post. </p><p>\"He's hoping Bezos will apply some pressure on the Washington Post to back down on its criticisms,\" said Holman. \"I seriously doubt that's going to happen. The Washington Post is a seriously independent newspaper, and Jeff Bezos is much wealthier as a result of Trump's tax cuts. This won't have much of an impact.\"</p><p>Last week, Business Insider published a study comparing Trump voters (63 million) with Amazon Prime members (in the region of 60 million, according to some <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">estimates</url> ). In a showdown that might threaten US consumers' access to free shipping, the outcome is a no-brainer. </p><p>\"If Trump were to take action that caused Amazon's shipping costs to go up, the relevant stakeholders - including nearly 100 million American customers - would be broadly united on Amazon's side of their business dispute with Trump,\" predicted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/trump-amazon-attack-stocks-tumble-presidents-twitter\">publication.</url></p><p>Still, says Holman, there is concern that Trump's continued attacks on Amazon and the Washington Post will feed into existing distrust of the media and, increasingly, of tech giants through which the news media is distributed and who are now gearing up for regulatory battles. </p><p>\"He's using every avenue he can think of to undermine the credibility of the independent press,\" Holman says. \"But I have the feeling Trump is out in the wilderness and he's not going to succeed in his efforts to undercut the Washington Post or the mainstream media.\" Americans, he says, \"have become for good reason much more skeptical of his intentions\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-42960759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S23-PB21-F021-64M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1454\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Coined by Tom Friedman in 2007, the term has reemerged courtesy of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the charismatic freshman congresswoman from the Bronx.<br/>The exact composition of the Green New Deal is a matter of debate, after early descriptions of it appeared to in\u00adclude calls for the eventual elimination of cows (a source of methane) and subsidies for those \"unwilling\" to work (why not). To judge from the congressional resolution introduced by Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward Markey (D., Mass.), the Green New Deal promulgated through official channels is hardly less ambitious. It would meet \"100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emissions energy sources\" and would upgrade \"all existing buildings\" with state-of-the-art energy-efficiency technology. All this \"should be accomplished through a 10-year national mobilization.\" That number is perhaps missing a zero.</p><p><br/>The energy industry already makes enormous investments just to keep the lights on and vehicles fueled. Pro\u00adducers, refiners, and marketers of oil and gas spent an estimated $184 billion in new capital investment just last year. Regu\u00adlated energy utilities spent $131 billion. These hundreds of billions of dollars are only the incremental capital spending for a single year, and they also do not include the costs of operating the system, such as labor. By comparison, the stimulus package that followed the 2008 recession included just under $50 billion for energy programs. (It was this tranche of spending that, infamously, granted $535 million to the failed solar venture Solyndra.) Any Green New Deal that attempts to reorder the state of American energy production and delivery must have a monumental scale.<br/>Thus does the Green New Deal include \"guaranteeing a job\" to \"all people of the United States.\" It calls for direct public funding and ownership of green projects through public banks. To this it adds assurances of \"economic security\" and \"high-quality health care.\" And a large helping of social justice: A Green New Deal must \"promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous communities, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities . . .\" - well, you get the idea. The body of the Green New Deal is direct government investment in renewables; its appendages are virtually all other progressive policies dreamt up over the past five decades.<br/>Or as the editors of the Brooklynite progressive magazine\u00a0n+1\u00a0put it, the first thing to do is \"Manhattan-Project the implementation of clean energy sources and immediately stop burning fossil fuels.\" Then, in the next sentence: \"We also need to ditch the patriarchal models of wealth and status reproduction that have been constitutive of nearly all expansionist, war-making, and resource-depleting societies of the past ten thousand years.\" Oh, is that all?<br/>This Green New Deal is outlandish, but it has a vocal cheer squad. About 600 environmental organizations, most of them local grassroots outfits, have signed on to this program, although hefty national players - the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Defense Fund - have sat it out while emitting blandishments about the passion of the youth. Activists working under the title \"Sunrise Movement\" have made sure that supporters are there to put House leadership and Democratic presidential aspirants on the spot.<br/>But of course pols are slippery. After Sunrise Movement crashed her announcement rally with a banner demanding her support for the Green New Deal, Kamala Harris the next week had a telling exchange in a CNN town hall. An Iowa voter asked, \"Will you fully endorse the Green New Deal tonight?\" The California senator replied, \"I support a Green New Deal\" - a careful use of the indefinite article. In recent weeks, a bevy of Democrats eyeing the 2020 primaries have fallen over one another either to mouth the words \"Green New Deal\" or to invent synonyms therefor. Kirsten Gillibrand said America needed a \"moonshot\" effort. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Juli\u00e1n Castro have all signed up. Bernie Sanders and Washington governor Jay Inslee have long treated climate change as among their foremost issues. None has pledged anything close to what the Green New Deal activist set are championing. But they will have to deliver something.<br/>We have seen this movie before, with the intra-Democratic health-care debate. Progressives championed the expansion of direct government funding on health care in the form of a single-payer system. The policy was moderated - or bastardized, call it what you like - to expand Medicaid and other government insurance programs and to ordain coverage mandates but otherwise to rely on big pharma and insurance firms to provide service, and obtain the rents, from the newly ordered health-care economy.<br/>More even than the health-care industry, the energy marketplace consists mostly of local monopolies and other very large companies. They await any policy proposal, not scared of the prospect of new programs and regulations so much as they are eager to co-opt them. Utilities in particular fit this mold. They have captive customers, so they have no great reason to worry about the price effect of government policies. Indeed, many of the most lucrative utilities have seen mini-Green New Deals emerge in states where they operate. The play is at this point quite common. A green coalition emerges demanding more clean energy and less coal- and natural-gas-fired electricity generation. Politicians endorse it. The bumper-sticker message - e.g., \"80 percent renewables by 2040\" - polls well enough that the utilities think it will pass. And then the utilities swing into action. They bargain with environmentalist groups to present a legislative package to retire fossil-fuel assets and embark on a renewables spending bonanza, usually financed by surcharges on customer bills. This core bargain then becomes a platform for all comers to insert their asks: labor unions, electric-vehicle advocates, technology-development firms looking for a carve-out, and local governments that want investments earmarked to them. The price tag grows, and all of the costs end up flowing through the rates that government regulators permit utilities to charge their customers.<br/>To give but one example of the phenomenon: Last year the Virginia assembly passed a law that included a carve-out for offshore wind development. The eventual no-bid project, to be owned by the monopoly Dominion Energy, clocked in at $300 million for twelve megawatts. An onshore project of the same size would cost one-quarter of that price or less. But when you multiply Dominion's shareholder investment by the standard 9.4 percent return that Virginia's regulators have authorized for it, you see that it pays to spend more on less efficient projects.<br/>If government commandeers the energy industry for a Green New Deal, that sector stands to profit enormously under a business model that rewards uneconomic investments. These state mini-Green New Deals are not so much a transition to least-cost sources of clean energy. They are vehicles to deliver favors with a green gloss. This type of bargain has passed legislatures or been approved at the ballot box in about a dozen states.<br/>If Republicans do not come up with a persuasive policy response to such dealmaking, it portends to be the eventual model for a federal Green New Deal - not the one progressives want but, as with health care, the one they'll have to live with after the sausage-making is done. Republicans have often supinely capitulated to state-level energy-policy logrolling because too many of them view the utility as a trustworthy example of private business rather than as an instrumentality for perverse incentives. The GOP includes a skeptical camp, too. But all too often it traffics in an explicitly anti-clean-energy message, raving about climate science, the shadow flicker of wind farms, and the electromagnetic field of smart meters. The atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases has not been higher since the dawn of human civilization than it is today. No debate about the niceties of climate science can eclipse this basic fact. It is prudent to encourage the development of power plants that emit no greenhouse gases, or less of them.<br/>Fortunately, there is a more persuasive and elegant response to the Green New Dealers than what many Republicans have been pitching. Democrats have said that consumers are demanding clean energy. They then have demanded massive government programs to invest in it - or to co-opt monopolies to do it for them. Why not instead, if consumers are demanding clean energy, adopt policies that would make it easier for them to get it through their own choices?<br/>What the United States needs is not a Green New Deal. It needs a Customer Empowerment Act. Only 13 states allow all customers a choice of electricity supplier. About a dozen more offer limited options, mostly for large customers, to exit a utility's supply monopoly. There is today no technical reason utilities should not simply act as poles-and-wires companies, their network a marketplace for power generators and retailers to sell to customers who are free to select the product that works best for them.<br/>A Customer Empowerment Act would include an option to select clean energy. Virtually every big tech company, and corporations such as Anheuser-Busch and even ExxonMobil, have directly contracted with renewable generators. But this bypass of the utility monopoly remains closed to smaller and midsized customers in most states.<br/>Progressives will complain that customers' own choices will not move the dial quickly enough on climate. Yet if all one may realistically expect from a Green New Deal is low-boil, inefficient rent-seeking, then customer choice is a better route even for those to whom decarbonization is paramount. This is because the cost of certain renewables is indeed falling. Lazard, the investment-analysis firm, publishes an annual \"Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis.\" In 2018, it finds, the unsubsidized cost of a\u00a0new\u00a0onshore wind farm ranges from $29 to $56 per megawatt-hour. This compares with a midpoint of $36 per megawatt-hour for operating fully depreciated,\u00a0existing\u00a0coal plants. Simply put, in certain places, renewables are least-cost - a stunning reversal from a decade ago, when those technologies were a boutique product. In such circumstances, government should get out of the way of consumers, not interject itself in the middle of things.1<br/>Of course, renewables do not have a low price in all locations, and a Green New Deal that focused on regional or racial equality would not provide an efficient allocation to the most affordable set of renewable resources. A marketplace would. Where renewables are a higher-cost alternative, consumers who are less price-sensitive could buy clean energy at a premium to earn some green cred. Unlike a utility-regulatory model, the marketplace would mean that those costs were borne by those customers and not by others. In any case, a marketplace where a sufficient number of customers want clean energy but also demand inexpensive prices will deliver an appropriate balance of both.<br/>New Deal interventions by government have a bad track record when it comes to energy. Germany has increased, not decreased, its carbon emissions as its government has mandated the purchase of high-cost renewables even while shutting down nuclear generation. China's command energy economy has inevitably been used to achieve economic, not climate, goals. And, finally, our country's own New Deal, version 1.0, offers a telling history: Its environmental component was intended to promote small-time farmers, especially in the American West, but it was quickly captured by special interests that to this day enjoy special privileges over the region's scarce water resources. The West is a drier, less ecologically diverse place because of it. Green is not a color that befits most New Deals, unless you're referring to their pecuniary aspect.<br/>Image from Shutterstock<br/>The post What Is the Green New Deal? appeared first on R Street.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-52894</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRM1-F03R-W3VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2046\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 R Street Institute, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>R Street Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000C9OD</classCode><className>SOLYNDRA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Not a full-fledged bill Seems to have been hastily assembled and is clearly a knee-jerk reaction to Libra. While we know that Libra is the intended target, as drafted, the bill is more far reaching and could have impact on blockchain adoption more generally Bill actually seeks to do more than keep big tech out of crypto - title suggests that intent is to keep big tech out of finance altogether. As drafted, would ban any tech company of a certain size from creating, operating or managing a 'digital asset'.Term 'digital asset' is undefined at the outset of bill\u2014 will rely on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to define - but then is defined as 'means an asset that is issued and transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, including, so-called ''virtual currencies'', ''coins'', and ''tokens[7]' Text of Big Tech Out Of Finance Act reveals a lack of appreciation/understanding of what a digital asset actually is. It can be argued that the USD is effectively a 'digital asset,' so 'digital assets' are neither new nor a threat to our monetary system.There is a big difference between 'cryptocurrency' and 'digital asset.'Cryptocurrencyis a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank[8].

In the morning, the president tweeted that he would reimpose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina immediately, and then later, the U.S. said it might put tariffs of up to 100% on French goods, including champagne, handbags and cheese. The U.S. says it's responding to a French tax on U.S. tech companies. The French trade minister this morning called the U.S. threat unacceptable and insisted that France is not changing that tax. And then here was President Trump this morning talking about this in London.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP:                 I don't want France taxing American companies. If they're going to be taxed, it's going to be - the United States will tax them.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Stephen Vaughn is former general counsel of the U.S. Trade Representative in the Trump administration, and we asked him in to talk about the administration's strategy. Mr. Vaughn, thanks for coming in.             </p><p>STEPHEN VAUGHN:                 Thanks for having me.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 OK, let's talk about the French tariffs since that's the most recent news. You know, the French government says big tech and data are not taxed fairly; that's what they're trying to do here. What would the impact be on U.S. companies, this tax?             </p><p>STEPHEN VAUGHN:                 Well, I think one of the things that the Americans are concerned about is that this is money that should probably be going to the United States or could be affecting the U.S. tax base. And it's been very clear that what France intends to do is to hit American companies. They say it's an across-the-board tax, but it's going to disproportionately affect U.S. companies, and that'll put U.S. companies at a disadvantage vis-a-vis, you know, other companies - and will be treating them unfairly. So that's what the Americans are concerned about. That's what the investigation is about. And they regard this as an unfair trading practice.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 OK, so President Trump is essentially saying, France has forced our hand with this tax; we don't really have any options. Do you think this will come into play as he sits down with France's President Emmanuel Macron today at the NATO summit in London?             </p><p>STEPHEN VAUGHN:                 Well, I certainly think it would be a wise idea for France to negotiate with the president on this issue. I mean, the president is very concerned about it. It is a major problem. We have had a tense history with European regulators and U.S. tech companies in recent years. And I think the U.S. government is increasingly concerned that our companies aren't being treated fairly.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 OK, the president also tweeted yesterday that he's restoring steel tariffs on Brazil and Argentina, which came as a surprise because those companies had worked out an exemption with the United States. What happened?             </p><p>STEPHEN VAUGHN:                 I think the president is concerned that - the purpose of the 232 steel tariffs is to make sure that we have a strong steel industry, we have a strong aluminum industry. The president regards those as a national security issue. So I think he's now concerned that certain actions that are taking place in Brazil and Argentina on the currency side, as he indicated, are going to lead to further imports of steel from Brazil and Argentina, which could put our own steel producers and aluminum producers at risk.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Although, he tweeted that he wanted to protect American farmers.             </p><p>STEPHEN VAUGHN:                 Now, I think that what he said was that Brazil and Argentina have a - have currency policies which are hurting our farmers, but it's also logical that those same policies could lead to increased imports of steel and aluminum from those countries as well. And I think that's what he's concerned about.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Tariffs obviously are a big tool for this administration. They are, as we also know, essentially a tax that are paid by U.S. consumers and businesses. We often on our programs talk to nervous farmers and nervous manufacturers. We know that manufacturing has contracted. Can the administration consider other options that don't have such a direct impact on Americans?             </p><p>STEPHEN VAUGHN:                 Well, first, let's put some statistics on this. U.S. exports are higher now than they were two or three years ago. U.S. imports are higher than they were two or three years ago. U.S. farm exports are about where they were last year. So up to this point, U.S. trade has continued very, very strongly.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Sure, but I do need to note that individual farmers, individual manufacturers tell us all the time this makes them very nervous; they are getting hit hard. I know we're talking about the difference between the macro picture and the micro picture and - but it seems worth noting that, right?             </p><p>STEPHEN VAUGHN:                 Well, I don't think anybody can come up with a trade policy that's going to make literally every single person - you know, affect every single person the same. There were a lot of workers who were hurt by the old trade policy when they saw jobs offshored and they saw manufacturing jobs shut down. So you have to - to me, you have to look at it from the macroeconomic picture - record-low unemployment, very - almost no inflation, strong markets and, generally, strong trade numbers. So I think the policies are working very well, and I think that's why the president is continuing to go down that path.             </p><p>                The issue of tariffs - I mean, the president wants to make deals. He made a deal with Japan. He made deal with Mexico. He made a deal with Canada. He made a deal with Korea. He's - he wants to talk to the U.K. He - he's in talks with China. He's in talks with India. He's happy to negotiate, and he wants to negotiate. Sometimes people don't want to come to the negotiating table, and then you have to figure out how you get more leverage.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Let me ask you a last question. More tariffs on Chinese goods go into effect on December 15 - things like smartphones and laptops, things that U.S. consumers love. As we said, consumers are already feeling the hurt. Do you think they should prepare for more?             </p><p>STEPHEN VAUGHN:                 I think it'll all depend on China and how they want to respond to the situation and the extent to which they're ready to sit down and work through some of these issues that the president's been talking about. He's been very clear - he wants a deal if the deal will be good for the United States. And he's made lots of deals with other trading partners. So that's what we're looking for, and I think it's really up to the other countries to decide how they want to work with us.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Stephen Vaughn is former general counsel of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

David Rockefellerthe grandson of the oil tycoon John D. Rockefellerwas a pioneer networker. According to a recent report, \"He recorded contact information along with every meeting he had with about 100,000 people world-wide on white 3-by-5-inch index cards. He amassed about 200,000 of the cards, which filled a custom-built Rolodex machine, a 5-foot high electronic device.\" Rockefeller's contacts ranged from <person><nameText>President John F. Kennedy </nameText></person>to the shah of Iran, Pope John Paul II and the astronaut Neil Armstrong. Henry Kissinger, a former secretary of state, garnered the most cards35, describing hundreds of encounters over sixty years. Close behind was Gianni Agnelli, the Italian industrialist who ran Fiat. In his memoirs, Rockefeller recalled how he had learned the importance of contacts while serving as an Army intelligence officer during World War II. \"My effectiveness depended on my ability to develop a network of people with reliable information,\" he wrote. It was an experience that he took home with him when he joined Chase Manhattan after the war.1</p><p>What was once the preserve of a tiny elite is now available to everybody with an Internet connection and a smartphone, tablet or laptop computer. Facebook was founded at Harvard in 2004, before David Rockefeller's 90th birthday, and rose rapidly to become the world's dominant social media platform. The company's foundational premise was and remains that \"Simply through sharing and connecting, the world gets smaller and better.\"2 Connecting people on Facebook, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>declared in 2015, was building a \"common global community\" with a \"shared understanding.\" A year later he summed up his utopian vision in a Facebook Live session (with Jerry Seinfeld):</p><p>We're at this next point in human civilization, where we have the next set of tools that we need, things like the internet, that can be this global communication infrastructure ... Just like we went from hunter-gatherers to villages and cities and then nations, I think we now need to come together as a global community. Because a lot of the problems that you're talking about, whether it's terrorism or the refugee crisis or climate change or global diseases spreading around the worldthese are not things that can be solved by any one city or one nation or one small group of people.</p><p>Humanity is certainly connected as never before. One in three people2.48 billionworldwide used a social network in 2017, according to eMarketer, nearly nine per cent more than the previous year, thanks to rapid expansion in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Three quarters of all users of the Internet on mobile phones used their devices to access social media. In the United States, an estimated 60 per cent of the population will use a social network at least once a month this year, up 2.6 per cent since 2017. The number of U.S. Facebook users is expected to reach 169.5 million in 2018, more than 60 per cent of all Internet users. Penetration is similarly high in the United Kingdom, where half the population is on Facebook.</p><p>How far the resulting network can be regarded as a problem-solving global community remains an open question, as we shall see. What is beyond doubt is that network platform companies are astonishingly profitable businessesnot least because users have handed them their personal data for nothing. As a commenter on the website MetaFilter memorably observed in 2010: \"If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold.\" In terms of its revenues, Facebook is primarily an advertising company, as is Google's parent company Alphabet. As a half-smirking Zuckerberg explained to Senator Orrin Hatch at a congressional hearing in 2018, \"We sell ads, Senator.\"</p><p>Eight of the world's most highly valued companies in 2017 were technology businesses, with a market capitalization equal to nearly a third of the market capitalization of the other 92 companies in the global top hundred. Of these eight companies, five (Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook) were American, two Chinese (Alibaba) and Tencent) and one South Korean (Samsung). It was not strictly speaking software that \"ate the world,\" in Marc Andreessen's famous phrase, because two of these companies sell hardware. It would be more accurate to say that network platforms ate the world, as the market dominance of all these companies arises from network effects and the operation of Zipf's Law (which can be summed up \"winner takes nearly all\").</p><p>Amazon ate bookselling. Jeff Bezos's company today sells 55 per cent of all the books sold in the United States, 82 per cent of all the e-books and 99 per cent of all the audiobooks. Nor is that all. Although its share of total U.S. retail remains small (4 per cent, or half of Walmart's share), the company's share of the global cloud business is 34 per cent, its share of U.S. online commerce is 44 per cent, and its share of the voice-activated device market is 71 per cent.3 Google ate search. It accounts for between 87 and 92 per cent of online searches worldwide, processing 63,000 queries a second. Apple ate music (along with Alphabet's YouTube and Spotify). YouTube ate television. Above all, Google and Facebook ate advertising. According to eMarketer, the two companies will capture a combined 56.8 per cent of U.S. digital ad spending in 2018, though Amazon and Snapchat have been increasing their shares. The revenues from this source seem certain to continue growing as a rising share of total advertising expenditure goes to the Internet.</p><p>\"For many years,\" according to a New Yorker profile, \"[<person><nameText>Mark] Zuckerberg </nameText></person>ended Facebook meetings with the half-joking exhortation 'Domination!'\" He stopped doing this because in European legal systems \"dominance\" is a term used to describe a business monopoly. However, he remains unabashed about Facebook's appetite for market share. \"There's a natural zero-sumness,\" he told an interviewer in September 2018. Revealingly, the figure he most admires in history is the Emperor Augustus:</p><p>You have all these good and bad and complex figures [in ancient Rome]. I think Augustus is one of the most fascinating. Basically, through a really harsh approach, he established two hundred years of world peace. What are the trade-offs in that? On the one hand, world peace is a long-term goal that people talk about today. Two hundred years feels unattainable. [But] that didn't come for free, and he had to do certain things.4</p><p>Facebook is indeed an empire, with as many users as Christianity has adherents, but a workforce of just 23,000. Nor does the new Caesar render up much to the old one: between 2007 and 2015, Facebook paid just 4 per cent of its profits in taxes. Amazon paid only 13 per cent, Google 16 per cent and Apple paid 17 per cent. (The average SandP 500 company paid 27 per cent.)</p><p>Market dominance is seldom without its political aspect. Prior to 2016, remarkably little attention was paid to the growing political power of the big technology companies. The posture they adopted might best be summed up as faux na\u00aff. \"Don't be evil\" was the motto adopted by Google in July 2001, after a brainstorming session between Eric Schmidt and early employees shortly before he took over as chief executive. As Schmidt recalled, referring to the company's decision to exit China rather than comply with Beijing's censorship requirements, \"We actually did an 'evil scale' and decided [that] not to serve at all was worse evil.\" By contrast, close involvement in the administration of Barack Obamaincluding energetic efforts to secure his reelection in 2012was deemed to lie at the other end of the evil scale. According to one estimate, there were 252 job moves between Google and the Obama administration from its inception to early 2016, and 427 meetings between White House staff and Google employees from 2009 to 2015. In 2012, Google was the nation's second-largest corporate spender on lobbying, behind General Electric. By 2017 Google was number one, spending $18 million.5 The closeness of the relationship between Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party was not unknown at the time, but it was remarkably uncontroversial. Little, if any, attention was paid to the political activities of the other big technology companies.</p><p>Donald Trump's victory in the November 2016 presidential election changed that, not just because the leaders of the big technology companies had confidently expected him to lose, but also because it was immediately apparent to them that their core products had either helped Trump win or failed to avert Clinton's defeat. The fact that Trump had dominated Clinton on both Facebook and Twitter throughout the campaign had been overlooked by most political pundits because his huge lead in follower numbers was at odds with all opinion polls. Likewise, experts ignored or discounted his even larger lead over her in terms of Google searches. Brad Parscale, Trump's digital media director, put it well: \"These social platforms are all invented by very liberal people on the west and east coasts. And we figure out how to use it to push conservative values. I don't think they thought that would ever happen.\" A video recording of a post-election internal meeting at Google confirms this. Senior executives lined up to express their dismay at Trump's victory and their allegiance to Clinton.6 As President Obama told David Letterman, his own successful use of social media in 2008 had left him and other Democrats with \"a pretty optimistic feeling about it. ... What we missed was the degree to which people who are in power [sic], special interests, foreign governments, etcetera, can in fact manipulate that and propagandize.\" Obama's analysis of what had gone wrong for his party and its presidential candidate in 2016 is worth quoting in full:</p><p>One of the biggest challenges we have to our democracy is the degree to which we don't share a common baseline of facts. ... What the Russians exploited but it was already here is we are operating in completely different information universes. If you watch Fox News, you are living on a different planet than you are if you listen to NPR. ... That's what's happening with these Facebook pages where more and more people are getting their news from. At a certain point you just live in a bubble. And that's part of why our politics is so polarized right now. I think it is a solvable problem but it's one we have to spend a lot of time thinking about.7</p><p>Speaking at MIT in February 2017, Obama suggested that \"the large platformsGoogle and Facebook being the most obvious, but Twitter and others as well that are part of that ecosystemhave to have a conversation about their business model that recognizes they are a public good as well as a commercial enterprise.\" It was, he said, \"very difficult to figure out how democracy works over the long term\" when \"essentially we now have entirely different realities that are being created, with not just different opinions but now different factsdifferent sources, different people who are considered authoritative.\"8</p><p>Obama was right. The status quo, in which a handful of giant corporations dominate the public sphere but tend not only to divide it but also to pollute it with a torrent of fake news* and extreme viewsat least some of it generated by this nation's foesis not defensible. Something needs to change. But what? What exactly does it imply to say that the network platforms are \"a public good as well as a commercial enterprise\"? In short, to quote Nikolai Chernyshevsky (from whom Lenin stole the famous title): \"What is to be done?\"</p><p>The Self-Non-Regulation of the Internet</p><p>The starting point for any serious analysis must be the business model of the network platforms. They are, in Tim Wu's phase, \"attention merchants,\" the heirs of the big twentieth-century media companies, such as Hearst, which used news and other mostly non-fictional content to attract readers' attention, selling space alongside articles and photographs to advertisers.9 They have a lot of attention to sellmore than any print publishing company in history. The average American spends 5.5 hours a day using digital media, more than television, radio and print put together.10 More than half that digital media time is spent on mobile devices. An average smartphone user clicks, taps and swipes 2,617 times per day. In April 2016, Facebook said it was capturing on average 50 minutes of every American's day, up from 40 minutes in July 2014, though usage may have declined slightly in 2017.11</p><p>Most of what is said online is inane. The ten most common words used in Facebook status updates are day, loud, word, ticket, nice, long, light, hangover, good and vote.12 A little of what is said is highly cerebral. Some is old-fashioned fiction: stories that do not purport to be true. But a significant proportion is \"news,\" i.e., content that purports to be true information about current affairs. In 2017, two thirds of American adults said they got news from social media sites. Around three quarters of Twitter users got news from the application, around two thirds of Facebook users, and around a third of YouTube users. In all, 45 per cent of American adults get news from Facebook, 18% of them from YouTube and 11 per cent from Twitter. A significant share of younger users also gets news from Instagram and Snapchat.13 It is a startling fact that Facebook and Google are now responsible for nearly 80 per cent of news publishers' referral traffic.</p><p>The network platforms have set out to act as aggregators of news for the simple reason that it engages users' attention. If extracts from the novels of Dickens or Pascale's Pensees had the same appeal, these too would feature in users' \"feeds\" or search results. The key point is that the network platforms customize the news that users see in order to maximize their engagement. When <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>talked in 2013 of making Facebook \"the best personalized newspaper in the world,\" this was what he meant. News Feed is a \"personalized collection of stories,\" and a user sees on average of 220 per day. Advertising and Pages, dedicated profiles for groups or causes, are sources of stories in News Feed. Anyone can buy ads to promote Pages, using an automated interface. Whenever one of Facebook's users opens the Facebook app, a personalization algorithm sorts through all the posts that a person could potentially see, serving up and sorting the fraction it thinks he or she would be most likely to share, comment on, or like. (Shares are worth more than comments, which are both worth more than likes.) Around two thousand pieces of user data (\"features\") are used by Facebook's machine-learning system to make those predictions. A somewhat similar process works when a user enters words in the Google search box. The user's individual search history, geographic location, and other demographic information affect the content and ranking of the results.</p><p>The problem is that the algorithms are not prioritizing truthfulness or accuracy but user engagement. For example, on October 1, 2017, Google directed users towards a false story alleging that the perpetrator of the Las Vegas massacre on that date was a member of the far-left group Antifa. A study by the Wall Street Journal and former YouTube engineer Guillaume Chaslot showed that a user searching for \"The Pope\" on YouTube was directed to videos with titles such as \"How Dangerous is the Pope?\", \"What if the Pope was assassinated?\" and \"BREAKING: They caught the Pope.\"14 As we shall see, these and other features of the network platforms had historic consequences in 2016 when they played a decisive role in the election of Donald Trump as the U.S. president.</p><p>How did we arrive at this state of affairswhen such important components of the public sphere could operate solely with regard to their own profitability as attention merchants? To answer this question, we must briefly review the history of Internet regulation. A decisive early decision was to define the Internet as a Title I information service, and therefore fundamentally different from the old telephone network, which was governed by Title II's intrusive monopoly utility regulations. (The Internet was briefly re-classified as a Title II service between 2015 and 2017, but no major regulatory change occurred in that period.) Another important decision was to give Internet companies very lenient treatment when they violated copyright. The Digital Millennium Act's notice-and-takedown provisions minimized the penalties to the network platforms of making the intellectual property of others available gratis to their users. A third vital decision was enshrined in Section 230 of Title V of the 1996 Telecommunications Act,15 which was enacted after a 1995 New York court held an online intermediary liable for a user's defamatory posts. Previously, managing content had triggered classification as a publisherand hence civil liabilitycreating a perverse incentive not to manage content at all. Thus, Section 230c, \"Protection for 'Good Samaritan' blocking and screening of offensive material,\" was written to encourage nascent firms to protect users and prevent illegal activity without incurring massive content management costs. It states:</p><p>1. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</p><p>2. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of:</p><p>A. any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene [etc.]; or</p><p>B. any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material in paragraph 1.</p><p>In essence, Section 230 gives websites immunity from liability for what their users post. The net result of this regulatory framework is that technology companies are neither communication utilities nor content publishers.</p><p>The argument for Section 230, as articulated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is as follows: \"Given the sheer size of user-generated websites ... it would be infeasible for online intermediaries to prevent objectionable content from cropping up on their site. Rather than face potential liability for their users' actions, most would likely not host any user content at all or would need to protect themselves by being actively engaged in censoring what we say, what we see, and what we do online.\" Senator Ron Wyden puts it even more strongly: \"If websites, ISPs, text message services, video game companies and any other type of platform were held liable for every word and deed they facilitated or somehow enabled, the entire system would shut down ... collaboration and communication on the internet would simply cease.\"16 In effect, it has been argued, Section 230 split the difference between liability, which would have meant restriction, or complete lack of curation, which would have led to a torrent of \"filth, racism, insults, and pornography.\" Thus, \"hobbling 230\" would \"stifle the competition that got us to today's rich internet in the first place.\"17 According to one recent and influential account:</p><p>Platforms moderate content because of a foundation in American free speech norms, corporate responsibility, and the economic necessity of creating an environment that reflects the expectations of their users. Thus, platforms are motivated to moderate by both of 230's purposes: fostering Good Samaritan platforms and promoting free speech. ... [They] should be thought of as operating as the New Governors of online speech. These New Governors are part of a new triadic model of speech that sits between the state and speakers-publishers. They are private, self-regulating entities that are economically and normatively motivated to reflect the democratic culture and free speech expectations of their users.18</p><p>Note that under the present dispensation, the network platforms have the power (not the obligation) to \"curate\" content that they host. They do so, it is argued, \"out of a sense of corporate social responsibility, but also, more importantly, because their economic viability depends on meeting users' speech and community norms.\" This curation began some time ago with the exclusion of content that no one would publicly condone. For years, the big technology companies have shared \"signatures\" of child pornography, so that once an illegal photo or a video is uploaded to one site, it is detected and taken down or excluded from all platforms. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft have a global working group that applies the same kind of technologies to terrorist content. In November 2017, for example, YouTube took down videos of Anwar al-Awlaki, the jihadist cleric killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011. Video fingerprinting technology has not removed al-Awlaki altogether from the platform, but it has substantially reduced the number of videos relating to him.</p><p>However, the process of removing or at least downgrading offensive content has not stopped with recognized advocates of pedophilia or jihad. In January 2018 YouTube removed from its Google Preferred platform the channels of Logan Paul, a YouTube star with almost 16 million subscribers, after he posted a video showing a suicide victim in Japan. \"Demonetizing\" YouTube videos, so that they are not promoted on the platform and their creators receive no share of any advertising revenue, is a powerful sanction short of outright prohibition. Twitter set out to be the \"free speech wing of the speech movement,\" but in 2015 added a new line to its Twitter Rules that barred \"promot[ing] violence against others ... on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, or disability.\" Any danger that the platforms might abuse their power has been airily dismissed with a promise that all problems can be addressed simply by making \"changes to the architecture and governance systems put in place by these platforms.\"19 Yet platforms' content moderation guidelines are not public, only their more nebulous \"community standards.\"</p><p>The network platforms have been left blissfully unmolested by the Federal Communications Commission, even as they have moved into direct competition with the television radio stations that it regulates and the telecommunications firms that provide most consumers with access to the Internet. The Federal Election Commission until recently considered digital platforms exempt from disclosure rules on political ads. In 2011 Facebook asked the FEC for an exemption to rules requiring the source of funding for political ads to be disclosed, arguing that the agency \"should not stand in the way of innovation.\"20 The only U.S. regulator that Silicon Valley has had to contend with is the Federal Trade Commission, which has powers to enforce consumer-protection laws. In 2011 the FTC cited Facebook for \"engaging in unfair and deceptive practices\" with regard to the privacy of user data. The company signed a consent decree pledging to establish a \"comprehensive privacy program\" and to evaluate it every other year for twenty yearsa commitment it seems to have honored mainly in the breach, as we shall see.</p><p>In short, to characterize the U.S. regulation of network platforms as laissez faire or \"light touch\" would be a considerable understatement. The current system is, in essence, one of self-regulationor, to be more precise, self-non-regulation.</p><p>The Political Consequences</p><p>The consequences have been profound. The first and best known has been to favor fake news. It has been claimed that social media mainly tend to amplify the content produced by traditional media.21 But that overlooks two things. First, if network platforms choose to promote a message of their ownfor example that users should consider organ donation for transplantsthe results are far more impressive than when newspapers or television channels make similar appeals.22 Second, social media also disseminate fake news, which traditional media tend not to do. Unfortunately, it appears that false information on Twitter is typically retweeted by many more people, and far more rapidly, than true information, especially when the topic is politics. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tracked 126,000 storiessome true, some falsetweeted by roughly three million people more than 4.5 million times from 2006 through 2017. They then used six different fact-checking sitesincluding Snopes, Politifact, and FactCheck.orgto rate the truthfulness of each story. It turned out that false claims were 70 per cent more likely than the truth to be shared on Twitter. True stories were rarely retweeted by more than a thousand people, but the top one per cent of false stories were routinely shared by between 1,000 and 100,000 people. And it took true stories about six times as long as false ones to reach 1,500 people. No accurate news item was able to chain together more than ten retweets, whereas fake news could put together a retweet chain 19 links longand do it ten times as fast as the accurate news item put together its ten retweets. This finding is especially startling, as Twitter users who share accurate information typically have more followers, and send more tweets, than fake-news sharers.23 An important role is evidently played in the dissemination of fake news by \"bots\"automated accounts purporting to be humanswho are believed to account for between 9 and 15 per cent of active Twitter accounts and as many as 60 million Facebook users.24 In the words of a recent large-scale study by the Knight Foundation, \"A supercluster of densely interlinked, heavily followed accounts plays a large role in the spread of fake news and disinformation on Twitter. Social bots likely make up the majority of the accounts in the supercluster, and accounts in the cluster participate in what appear to be coordinated campaigns to push fake news stories.\"25</p><p>A second consequence of leaving the network platforms to their own devices has been polarization. Homophilythe tendency of birds of a feather to flock togetherhas long been a recognized feature of social networks, even those of modest size. Giant online networks were therefore always likely to self-segregate into more or less homogeneous clusters. This was true of the \"blogosphere,\" for example, prior to the ascendancy of the network platforms.26 We are innately inclined to form into opposing sides over any bone of contention, as the case of \"The Dress\"a photograph of a dress taken in England at 3:30pm on a February afternoonillustrates. (For days the Internet was rent asunder: Was the dress black and blue or white and yellow?)27 Yet the network platforms do more than merely reveal our innate divisions. Because their algorithms are designed to maximize our engagement and, because confirmation bias is one of our many cognitive biases, they tend to accentuate it.</p><p>A good illustration of the point is the way that Twitter works. If the network of political retweets is graphed using a force-directed algorithm, two highly segregated communities of users are revealed: liberals and conservatives.28 A similar depiction of the retweet activity of messages containing moral and emotional language on a range of political topics (gun control, same-sex marriage, climate change) looks very similar. The presence in tweets of words that researchers classified as \"moral-emotional\" increased their diffusion by a factor of 20 per cent for each additional word. Moreover, \"moral contagion\" was bounded by group membership, in that \"moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them.\"29 Another paper, based on 3,938 Twitter users who together generated 4.8 million tweets in August 2016, suggested that it is politically extreme people who tweet about politics more than centrist users of Twitter.30 In Congress, more ideologically extreme lawmakers get more Facebook followers than centrists.31</p><p>This is not to say that people consciously choose to inhabit filter bubbles or echo chambers. A 2015 study found that \"most social media users [were] embedded in ideologically diverse networks, and that exposure to political diversity has a positive effect on political moderation.\" Nor is it to blame all polarization on social media. The division between liberals and conservatives has deep historical roots. Its reflection in the mediafrom newspapers to cable televisionis not new. And the increase in polarization in recent years seems to have been greatest amongst the elderly, the group least likely to use the internet and social media.32 Yet the network platforms are clearly making polarization worse because of the way they work. A good example is the way the YouTube suggestions algorithm works. In the words of former Google engineer Guillaume Chaslot, \"Videos about vegetarianism led to videos about veganism. Videos about jogging led to videos about running ultramarathons. Given its billion or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century. ... YouTube leads viewers down a rabbit hole of extremism, while Google racks up the ad sales.\"33 YouTube assists extremists in other ways, notably by placing advertisements for respectable corporations and other organizations on the websites of Nazis and so-called white nationalists. YouTube channels with over 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch-hours over a twelve-month period can apply to receive a portion of YouTube's revenue from the advertisements running on their videos. Until it was shut down, Brian Ruhe's Nazi channel featured adsand therefore earned moneyfrom Nissan, Disney, Mozilla and 20th Century Fox.34 There is also evidence from the 2015 protests against police violence in Baltimore that the degree and volume of moral rhetoric used on social media predicted the number of arrests during protests.35 The \"culture war\" in the United Statesover campus free speech, climate change, healthcare reform, racism, gender fluidity, and sexual harassmentwould no doubt be happening without social media. But the network platforms have surely intensified the conflict.</p><p>The elections of 2016 brought to light the full extent of the network platforms' role in the modern public sphere. Like the culture war, the elections would no doubt have been bitterly contested without social media. But the network platforms in 2016 did more than merely intensify the contests. They decisively influenced the results.</p><p>There is of course nothing new about a change in the structure of the public sphere having political consequences. Each new communications technologythe newspaper, the telegraph, the radio, the televisionhas had its effect on the political process. William Randolph Hearst was first a hero and then a pariah for his accumulation of mass-circulation newspapers and magazines, each of which toed his political line. Most recently, cable news stations such as CNN and Fox have had a measurable impact on American elections. According to one study, biased coverage by Fox News during the 2000 presidential election was enough to shift 10,757 votes in Florida, where George W. Bush's decisive margin of victory was just 537 votes.36 Social media played a modest role in the 2008 election because at that time Facebook and Twitter were still in their infancy, though there is no question that Barack Obama's use of them was far superior to John McCain's. But they were more important in the 2012 election. This shift had its roots in 2009, when Dan Wagner began work on a sophisticated model (known as the Survey Manager), which before long was accurately forecasting the \"shellacking\" inflicted on the Democrats by Tea Party Republicans in the 2010 midterms. At first, much of the data Wagner used were from surveys he and his team carried out. But by 2012 the Democratic National Committee had invested heavily in technology designed to integrate as much information as possible about individual voters. The Obama campaign spent twice as much on online advertisements as Mitt Romney's. Its approach to television advertising was based on far superior data on the viewing habits of potentially persuadable voters. The Romney campaign mostly out-sourced its data operation; in effect it relied on the technology and methods Obama had used in 2008.37 In 2012, by contrast, the Obama campaign was able to create a voter-outreach app that analyzed users' Facebook connections and encouraged users to reach out to potential Obama supporters among their Facebook friends. Google also made its data tools (Google Analytics) available to Obama's reelection campaign.</p><p>Google is first and foremost a search engine. So well established is the company's reputation for fast and efficient ranking of web pages that most users assume more or less uncritically that its search results are an objective measure of citation frequency, if not credibility. That is why nine out of ten clicks are on the first page of Google search results. In fact, the search engine can be manipulated and with significant effects. Three experiments relating to the 2010 Australian election found that the influence of a Google-like search engine on voter behavior was very great. After subjects were left to conduct their own search-based web research, seeing results that were biased by design, the likelihood of their voting for a particular candidate diverged from their initial preferences by between two and four percentage points. The authors term this differential \"voter manipulation power\" or VMP. Between three quarters and all of the subjects in these experiments showed no awareness of the manipulation. A similar experiment with U.S. voters had similar results. The VMP of voters in the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections in India was 9.4 per cent and as much as 73 per cent amongst unemployed males from Kerala. The authors of a pioneering paper on the \"search engine manipulation effect\" concluded in 2015 that \"If a search engine company optimized rankings continuously and sent customized rankings only to vulnerable undecided voters, there is no telling how high the VMP could be pushed. ... Search results favoring one candidate could easily shift the opinions and voting preferences of real voters in real elections by up to 80 percent in some demographic groups with virtually no one knowing they had been manipulated.\"38 The same author's estimated that \"Google's search enginewith or without any deliberate planning by Google employeeswas currently determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the world's national elections ... because Google's search engine lacks any kind of equal-time rule, so it virtually always favors one candidate over another.\"39 Comparably powerful is the \"Search Suggestion Effect,\" whereby Google search suggestions (\"autocomplete\" suggestions) have the power to shift opinions and voting preferences:</p><p>Negative (\"low valence\") search terms can attract 10-to-15 times as many clicks as neutral or positive terms can (an example of \"negativity bias\"), which means that a simple yet powerful way for a search engine company to manipulate elections is to suppress negative search suggestions for the candidate it supports, while allowing one or more negative search suggestions to appear for the opposing candidate (the \"differential suppression of negative search suggestions\") ... [T]he higher a suggestion appears in a list of search suggestions, the more impact it has on search, and overall, manipulating search suggestions can shift a 50/50 split among people who are undecided on an issue to a 90/10 split without people's awareness and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to follow.40</p><p>Nearly everything that happened in 2016 had a pre-history. Cambridge Analytica was established in June 2014 by Robert and Rebekah Mercer, who had previously invested in Alexander Nix's Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) Group. The new company was set up as a joint venture with SCL; its name was chosen by Stephen K. Bannon, executive chairman of the right-wing website Breitbart, who became a director. The company's voter database was purchased from the Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan, whose \"this is your digital life\" app represented itself as a research tool used by academic psychologists. Its online questionnaire was hosted by a company called Qualtrics. Respondents were asked to authorize access to their Facebook profiles and, when they did, Kogan's app harvested their data as well as the data of all their Facebook friendsnot only their names, birth dates and location data, but also lists of every Facebook page they had ever liked. The small print accompanying Kogan's questionnaire told users that their data could be used for commercial purposes, a violation of Facebook's rules at the time. In 2015, Facebook said that, having learned that Kogan had passed user data to Cambridge Analytica, it had excluded him from access to Facebook data and demanded assurances that the data had been deleted. But the company did not disclose to usersor anyone elsethat their data had been misused. Moreover, in November 2015, Facebook brought Kogan in as a consultant to explain the technique he had used.41 In March 2018, when Facebook was forced by news revelations to comment, the company insisted there had not been a data breach but merely \"a scamand a fraud.\" In all, some 270,000 people downloaded Kogan's app. That was enough to give him access to the data of 87 million Facebook users, 71 million of whom were Americans. Around 30 million profiles contained enough information, including places of residence, to enable Cambridge Analytica to build the psychographic profiles that were its main selling point.42 In 2014 the company did work for Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.43</p><p>To date, the most controversial aspect of social media's involvement in the 2016 U.S. election was the way Russian entities, principally the Internet Research Agency (IRA), disseminated inflammatory content through Twitter and Facebook. This, too, had a prelude. According to special counsel Robert Mueller's indictment of 25 Russian individuals (12 of them identified as Russian military intelligence agents), Moscow began building a U.S. influence operation in 2014. It had already experimented with \"information warfare\" in a number of countries, including Ukraine, which Russian forces invaded in 2014. During the UK referendum on membership of the European Union, at least 2,752 Twitter profiles appear to have been created and managed by the IRA. Russian content found itself into mainstream media on numerous occasions: 29 different Russian-run accounts were quoted across 73 different news stories. The Daily Telegraph embedded posts from Russian accounts such as @Ten_GOP and @Pamela_Moore13 15 times, for example. Another Russian account, @WarfareWW, accounted for four of the Daily Mail's seven citations. A recent NBER study estimates that automated tweets added 1.76 percentage point to the \"Leave\" share of the vote. There was a \"massive volume\" of tweets from Russian-language accounts in the few days before the referendum.44 When, in October 2018, Twitter released datasets of more than 10 million tweets and more than 2 million images and videos from 3,841 IRA-affiliated (plus 770 others suspected of being Iranian), the material dated back as far as 2009. 45</p><p>In short, there was ample reason to expect the network platforms to play both an important and a subversive role in the U.S. election of 2016. And yet almost no precautions appear to have been taken by either the authorities or the big technology companies themselves. On the contrary, Facebook executives continued to repeat the company's foundational mantra: \"Move fast and break things.\" On June 18, 2016, a day after the fatal shooting of a Chicago man was captured on Facebook Live, the company's vice president Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth, circulated an internal memorandum that epitomized a culture of indifference to negative externalities:</p><p>So we connect more people.</p><p>That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.</p><p>And still we connect people.</p><p>The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned.</p><p>That isn't something we are doing for ourselves. Or for our stock price (ha!). It is literally just what we do. We connect people. Period. ...</p><p>... I know a lot of people don't want to hear this. Most of us have the luxury of working in the warm glow of building products consumers love. But make no mistake, growth tactics are how we got here. ...</p><p>That's our imperative. Because that's what we do. We connect people.</p><p>What Exactly Happened in 2016?</p><p>Since the November 2016 election, Facebook has admitted that the Internet Research Agency used up to 470 false identities and spent $100,000 on more than 3,000 Facebook and Instagram ads to spread politically divisive posts to Americans before and after the vote. The ads promoted about 120 Facebook Pages set up by the IRA and related groups. These Pages posted 80,000 pieces of content between January 2015 and August 2017, reaching up to 126 million Americansa number only slightly smaller than the total number who voted. In all, an estimated 146-150 million users saw posts from accounts linked to the IRA, including around 16 million Instagram users. Jonathan Albright has suggested that posts on just six publicly known Russia-linked Pages were shared 340 million times. In addition, Russians with false identities used Facebook Events to promote political protests, including an August 27 anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rally in a rural Idaho town that was known to welcome refugees. The event was \"hosted\" by \"SecuredBorders,\" a phony anti-immigration group that was in fact a Russian front. (It had 133,000 followers when Facebook closed it down.) \"Heart of Texas,\" a Russian-controlled Facebook group that promoted Texas secession, announced a rally to \"Stop Islamification of Texas\" in front of the Islamic Da'wah Center of Houston on May 21, 2016. A separate Russian-sponsored group, \"United Muslims of America,\" advertised a \"Save Islamic Knowledge\" rally for exactly the same place and time. The Russians did not confine themselves to Facebook. Twitter has admitted that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election. So far, 2,700 Twitter accounts have been identified as IRA-run. Of these, 65notably @WarfareWW, @TEN_GOP and @Jenn_Abramsfeatured prominently in a large-scale study of the fake news phenomenon.46</p><p>How big an impact did this Russian effort have? Political scientist Kathleen Hall Jamieson goes so far as to argue that the election was in fact decided by Russian content aimed at discouraging potential Clinton voters from turning out, as this was the key variable that tipped Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin over to Trump.47 It is important, however, to recognize that the impact of Russian was not simply in one, pro-Trump direction. A study of retweet activity reveals, surprisingly, that liberals were more inclined to disseminate this content than conservatives.48 Another analysis of the Twitter network suggests that \"clusters of accounts affiliated with Russia serve a brokerage role, serving as a cultural and political bridge between liberal U.S. accounts and European far-right accounts.\" 49 Moreover, the Russians only accounted for a part of the fake news disseminated by foreign actors during the election. Buzzfeed traced a hundred pro-Trump sites to a small town in Macedonia. At least one of these was run by the Israeli private intelligence firm Psy-Group. The Iranians also appear to have abused Twitter.50</p><p>Yet the key point is that all this foreign-originated content was a drop in the ocean. Between March 23, 2015, and November 2016, an estimated 128 million people in America were responsible for nearly 10 billion Facebook posts, shares, likes, and comments about the election. Hindman and Barash identified 6.6 million tweets or retweets from 454,832 separate accounts that linked to at least one of more than 600 fake news or conspiracy websites during the month before the election. The tweets of Russian operatives and bots represented perhaps one per cent of all electionrelated tweets. The same goes for fake news from any source was only a fraction of total election-related content. True, according to one estimate, the average American encountered between one and three stories from known publishers of fake news during the month before the 2016 election.51 Another study of the browsing histories of 2,525 adult Americans during the run-up to the 2016 election suggested that one in four Americans saw at least one false story, with the most conservative 10 per cent of the sample accounting for two thirds of visits to fake news sites. Yet false stories were a very small proportion of the total news people consumed, accounting for just 1 per cent of the news intake of Clinton supporters and 6 per cent in the case of Trump supporters.52</p><p>It could be argued that even that small a proportion of fake newsforeign and home-grownmight have sufficed to decide a very tight election. Research on the impact of traditional television advertising between 2004 and 2012 concluded that partisan imbalances in advertising had significant effects. (Exposure to an additional ad by one party or the other shifted the partisan vote of approximately two people out of 10,000.)53 Moreover, false election stories tended to attract more attention than true ones. In August 2015, a rumor circulated on social media that Donald Trump had let a sick child use his plane to get urgent medical care. Snopes confirmed almost all of the story as true. However, only about 1,300 people shared or retweeted the story. In February 2016, by contrast, a rumor circulated that Trump's elderly cousin had recently died and that he had left a message publicly condemning his relative's presidential bid. Snopes rejected this story as false, but around 38,000 Twitter users shared it. Its retweet chain was three times longer than the one produced by the true sick child story. A false story alleging that the boxer Floyd Mayweather had worn a Muslim head scarf to a Trump rally also reached an audience more than ten times the size of the sick child story.</p><p>However, the Russians had real news, too, which they had obtained by means deemed legitimate by the mainstream media outlets that published it. Beginning in March 2016, Russian hackers Fancy Bear sought to phish their way into the Democratic party's emails, sending fake emails that seemed to come from Google and told recipients to change their passwords. Chairman John Podesta fell for the ruse on March 19, clicking on the fatal link and giving the Russians access to 50,000 emails. Former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos said that he was told on April 26 by an academic closely connected to the Kremlin that the Russian government had obtained compromising information about Clinton. \"They have dirt on her,\" Papadopoulos was told. \"They have thousands of emails.\" On June 12 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told a British TV show that emails related to Clinton were \"pending publication.\" On June 15 the supposedly Romanian (but in reality Russian) Guccifer 2.0 claimed to have hacked the DNC and began directing reporters to the newly launched DCLeaks site. WikiLeaks joined in on July 22. Guccifer 2.0, WikiLeaks and DCLeaks ultimately published more than 150,000 emails stolen from more than a dozen Democrats. Long-established newspapers did as much as network platforms to disseminate the leaked content. Hillary Clinton herself attaches more blame for her defeat to FBI James Comey's intervention on October 28when he told Congress that he was reopening an investigation into her private email serverthan to Russian disinformation.</p><p>Another point often overlooked is that not all online manipulation during the campaign was calculated to hurt Clinton. True, YouTube tilted its users towards Trump. Guillaume Chaslot discovered that, regardless of whether users started with a pro-Clinton or a pro-Trump video, they were many times more likely to have a pro-Trump video recommended by YouTube. Twitter also helped Trump as most Twitter bots (not only the Russian ones) favored him.54 However, there is striking evidence that the Search Engine Suggestion Effect was exploited by Google in Clinton's favor. Search suggestions on Google, Yahoo and Bing on August 3, 2018, differed strikingly. The user who consulted Yahoo was promoted to search for \"Hillary Clinton is a liar\" or \"Hillary Clinton is a criminal.\" On Bing the top two suggestions were \"Hillary Clinton is a filthy liar\" and \"Hillary Clinton is a murderess.\" But the user who typed \"Hillary Clinton is\" into Google's search box was prompted to search for \"Hillary Clinton is winning\" or \"Hillary Clinton is awesome.\" 55 Robert Epstein argues that Google search rankings favored Clinton over most of the six-month period that he and his research associates monitored. Between October 15 and Election Day, \"search rankings favored Mrs. Clinton in all 10 of the search positions on the first page of search results.\"56</p><p>Yet the truly decisive factor in the 2016 was probably none of the above. It was the different ways the Trump and Clinton campaigns themselves used the network platforms, particularly Facebook. According to the New Yorker, Facebook \"offered to 'embed' employees, for free, in presidential campaign offices to help them use the platform effectively. Clinton's campaign said no. Trump's said yes.\" Trump used Facebook to raise $280 million. More than a third of that moneyvastly more than the Russians spentwent to pay for targeted Facebook ads. These included a voter-suppression drive in the days before the election, targeting \"idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans.\" Theresa Hong, the Trump campaign's digital-content director, later told an interviewer, \"Without Facebook we wouldn't have won.\" 57 Her verdict has been echoed by Gary Coby, the director of advertising at the Republican National Committee and director of digital advertising and fundraising for Trump's campaign, and by Brad Parscale in an interview with Lesley Stahl for 60 Minutes and in a conversation with Michael Isikoff in Lisbon last November. Ali-Jae Henke, the head of elections at Google, explained how his company also provided help to both campaigns:</p><p>They say like \"look, we really want to get attention and we want to reach as many people as possible and these are kind of the areas politically where we might have challenges or the different types of voting blocs we need to reach\" ... and so then I am able to in that advisory capacity be like, \"well this is what moms look like online, this is how we find them ...\"</p><p>Parscale explained the role of Cambridge Analytica in this process:</p><p>[They] didn't play a role in crafting ads [but] helped with a research strategy to help us raise money. We needed to build an infrastructure. [Cambridge Analytica] provided staff, resources, because we had to grow a large organization, fast. They did a lot of polling, and they did a lot of building some directional arrows for us [regarding] where to place the money, being able to provide reporting back that says, \"Here are trends that are happening,\" so I could move the budget around in a way and I could make recommendations to [then candidate Trump] and to leadership, saying, \"Here's an opportunity. We should go into this part of Michigan. We should go into this part of Wisconsin.\" [Cambridge was] able to drive that kind of information ... and in a simple consumption model, daily.58</p><p>Also important was the way Facebook directed users to content on the Breitbart website, run since March 2012 by Steve Bannon. On August 17, 2016, Bannon was appointed chief executive of Trump's presidential campaign. \"I wouldn't have come aboard, even for Trump,\" he later said, \"if I hadn't known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine. Facebook is what propelled Breitbart to a massive audience. We know its power.\"</p><p>This was the crucial difference between 2012 and 2016. By the time of the later election, Facebook had acquired a database of American voters far superior to anything either party could possibly have built on its own. It had done so not only by persuading a majority of Americans to join Facebook, but also by (among other things) logging the phone call and messaging histories of Android smartphone users who installed Messenger or Facebook Lite and then synced their phone contacts with the app.59 Facebook had also paid third-party websites and apps to let it place cookies, invisible pixels, \"like\" and \"share\" buttons on them, thereby acquiring data on people who are not Facebook users.60 Facebook's approach to data-gathering was even more ruthless than Google's.61 Its attitude towards how that data got used by third parties was, at best, cavalier. And only one campaign made full use of Facebook's data. We may ask counterfactual questions to our heart's content about how the election would have turned out if the Russians had played no role. Yet the crucial point is that Russian meddling was a subplot in a much bigger crisis of the American political system produced by the unregulated and generally reckless operation of the network platforms. Without the Russians, Trump might not have won. It would still have been close. Without Facebook, he would have stood no chance.</p><p>The Backlash</p><p>That there would be a backlash against the network platforms after their role in the 2016 election was easily predictable.62 A few writerssuch as Jonathan Zittrain and Tim Wuhad been warning about their growing power for some time. Established content publishers such as Rupert Murdoch and Michael Bloomberg had obvious commercial reasons for going on the offensive. For Wu, Facebook was like a television network but with no \"sense of responsibility. No constraints. No regulation. No oversight. Nothing.\" Robert Thomson of News Corp talked about \"tech tapeworms in the intestines of the internet.\" Speaking at Davos in January 2017, George Soros warned of \"a web of totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined,\" and called on European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to be the \"nemesis\" of the network platforms.63</p><p>The most credible critics have been the insidersformer Facebook employees such as Antonio Garcia Martinez, author of Chaos Monkeys, or Sandy Parakilas, a former operations manager, who publicly criticized the company's handling of privacy issues in 2017, warning that \"The company won't protect us by itself, and nothing less than our democracy is at stake.\"64 Former vice president for user growth, Chamath Palihapitiya, told an audience at Stanford's Graduate School of Business: \"I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works. ... The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no co-operation: misinformation, mistrust.\" He felt \"tremendous guilt\" about his own part in this because, deep down, he and his former colleagues \"kind of knew something bad would happen.\" In a similar vein, Facebook's first president Sean Parker admitted that the platform was consciously designed to take advantage of \"a vulnerability in human psychology\" by delivering \"a little dopamine hit every once in a while.\" Parakilas joined forces with Dave Morin, Justin Rosenstein and Roger McNameeeall former Facebook employees or early investorsas well as Tristan Harris and Lynn Fox (both ex-Google) to establish the Center for Human Technology and launch a campaign with the title: \"The Truth about Tech.\"</p><p>Negative publicity in the wake of the election has led to a decline in public trust in Facebook and Twitter.65 Facebook also now lags quite far behind Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft in the Small Business Trust Index. A Gallup Knight survey published in January 2018 showed that 57 per cent of Americans regarded the way tech companies chose which stories to show to users as \"a major problem\" for democracy, while 73 per cent said the same about the spread of inaccurate information on the Internet.66 At that time only 49 per cent favored regulation of how websites provide news. By February 2018, however, the proportion \"concerned that government would do too little\" to address the problem had risen from 40 to 55 per cent.67 Young Americans in particular have lost trust in Facebook (though they trust it more than Washington and Wall Street).68 The Economist summed up the prevailing mood: the big tech companies were \"too big, anti-competitive, addictive and destructive to democracy\"BAADD. 69</p><p>At Facebook's second annual Social Good Forum in December 2017, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>described how his company uses artificial intelligence to identify users who might be contemplating self-harm or suicide. He did not discuss the possibility that Facebook might itself be driving people to self-harm or suicide. As Deborah M. Gordon has suggested, online social networks replicate on a vast scale many of the more insidious features of friendship circles amongst girls in a middle school.70 Using data from 5,208 adults over two years from a national longitudinal panel, Holly Shakya and Nicholas Christakis argue that \"the more you use Facebook, the worse you feel.\"71 They found that \"most measures of Facebook use in one year predicted a decrease in mental health in a later year ... [B]oth liking others' content and clicking links significantly predicted a subsequent reduction in self-reported physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction.\" The authors suggest that use of social media gives the impression of \"meaningful social interaction\" but is in fact no substitute for the real thing and therefore undermines wellbeing and health. Even Facebook's own research comes to similar conclusions about the effects of overuse of social media by students.72</p><p>Especially troubling is the effect of social media on children. As James Bridle has shown, Kid's YouTube seems designed to lure young users towards disturbing videos with titles like: \"Surprise Play Doh Eggs Peppa Pig Stamper Cars Pocoyo Minecraft Smurfs Kinder Play Doh Sparkle Brilho\" or \"BURIED ALIVE Outdoor Playground Finger Family Song Nursery Rhymes Animation Education Learning Video.\" A search for \"Peppa Pig dentist\" leads to a video on which Peppa Pig is \"tortured, before turning into a series of Iron Man robots and performing the Learn Colours dance.\" Others feature Peppa eating her father or drinking bleach.73 Facebook Messenger Kids, launched in 2017, seems calculated to introduce children under 13 to the app in order to get them hooked as early as possible. The analogies with cigarettes and corn syrup in the twentieth century and opioids in the twenty-first are not fanciful, as Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Aza Raskin of Mozilla and Firefox have acknowledged.74 There is some evidence that younger users of Facebook have been kicking the habit, but only in favor of Instagram (which Facebook owns) and Snapchat (which it would have liked to own).75</p><p>The revulsion against the power of the network platforms has not been confined to the United States. In Britain, Facebook has suffered a reputational hit, especially with older people. Although the evidence is less compelling that the company played a malign and decisive role in the Brexit referendum, journalists such as Carole Cadwalladr have done their utmost to make that case.76 There was controversy over the role of social media in the 2018 Irish referendum on abortion, too, as Facebook and Google restricted advertisements in moves widely interpreted to be helpful to the proponents of constitutional change. Did Facebook interfere in the 2017 election in Iceland by selectively displaying its \"I Voted\" button on some voters' pages but not others?77 In India, fake news stories on WhatsApp service have triggered riots, lynchings, and fatal beatings. In Sri Lanka, after a Buddhist mob attacked Muslims over a false rumor, a presidential adviser put it nicely: \"The germs are ours, but Facebook is the wind.\" In Myanmar, too, violence against the Rohingya minority has been fueled, in part, by disinformation and incendiary content systematically spread on Facebook by the military. The United Nations investigator in charge of examining the persecution of the Rohingya, told the New Yorker, \"I'm afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it was originally intended.\"78 A Burmese legislator called the company \"dangerous and harmful for our democratic transition.\"79 It would be easy to give other examples. In Egypt, the Arab Spring was supposed to be a democratic revolution propelled by social media. Eight years later, Wael Ghonima leading figure in the Tahrir Square protests of 2010is pessimistic. \"We wanted democracy,\" he has said, \"but got mobocracy.\" It seems unlikely that Kenyan democracy benefited from Cambridge Analytica's work for Uhuru Kenyatta in the 2013 and 2017 Kenyan elections. According to Freedom House, online manipulation and disinformation tactics played an important role in elections in 18 countries in 2016. In undemocratic regimes, too, the manipulation of social media is now standard practice, from China to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Yet the analogies offered by the critics of the network platforms are not consistent. As one journalist complained with respect to Facebook:</p><p>I've heard government metaphors (a state, the E.U., the Catholic Church, Star Trek's United Federation of Planets) and business ones (a railroad company, a mall); physical metaphors (a town square, an interstate highway, an electrical grid) and economic ones (a Special Economic Zone, Gosplan). For every direct comparison, there was an equally elaborate one: a faceless Elder God. A conquering alien fleet. ... Maybe Facebook is a church and Zuckerberg is offering his benedictions. Maybe Facebook is a state within a state and Zuckerberg is inspecting its boundaries. Maybe Facebook is an emerging political community and Zuckerberg is cultivating his constituents. Maybe Facebook is a surveillance state and Zuckerberg a dictator undertaking a propaganda tour. Maybe Facebook is a dual powera network overlaid across the United States, parallel to and in competition with the government to fulfill civic functionsand Zuckerberg is securing his command. Maybe Facebook is border control between the analog and the digital and Zuckerberg is inspecting one side for holes. Maybe Facebook is a fleet of alien spaceships that have colonized the globe and Zuckerberg is the viceroy trying to win over his new subjects.80</p><p>This kind of muddle helps explain the inconsistencies in the global debate on regulation.</p><p>The European Commission, as George Soros foresaw, has taken the lead in seeking to regulate the U.S.-based network platforms. In June 2017, the Commission's antitrust division fined Google $2.7 billion for \"anticompetitive practices\" related to Google Shopping, the company's product comparison tool (specifically, for favoring the company's own site over competitors). The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018, requires online services to make it easier for customers to transfer their information to other providers and even competitors, as well as strengthening people's control over their data. At the same time, the European authorities have also been active in regulating online \"hate speech.\" In May 2016, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube signed an agreement with the European Commission to \"prohibit the promotion of incitement to violence and hateful conduct\" by removing content inciting violence or hatred against protected groups within 24 hours of its being posted. On December 5, 2016, the companies announced plans for an industry database of \"hashes\"unique digital signaturesof all extremist material banned on their platforms. National governments have added to this pressure. In 2017 Germany passed a law threatening Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies with fines of $50 million if they failed to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refused to remove illegal content within 24 hours. After a series of terrorist attacks in London in 2017, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron threatened to impose steep fines on companies that failed to remove extremist propaganda from online platforms. Shortly thereafter, Google announced a four-part plan to address terrorist propaganda that included the increased use of technology to identify terrorist-related videos, the hiring of additional content moderators, the removal of advertising on objectionable videos, and the directing of potential terrorist recruits to counter-radicalization videos.81</p><p>These regulations are seen by some as a model for the United States. Another way of looking at them is as a halfway house between the American laissez faire regime and the Chinese system of much stricter state control. An important difference between Europe and China is that, unlike the Europeans, the Chinese have succeeded in building their own technology giants: the online retail site Alibaba, the search engine Baidu and the Internet conglomerate Tencent. That these companies are subordinate to the Chinese state is clear. They are obliged to share their data with central authorities such as the People's Bank of China (PBoC), which therefore has access to users' payment history, creditworthiness and contacts. This universal \"back door\" into the data represents the first step towards a comprehensive system of \"social credit.\"82 On June 1, 2017, a new cybersecurity law came into effect in China that requires technology companies to help the authorities remove content that \"endangers national security, national honor and interests.\" The Chinese police are rapidly expanding their network of surveillance cameras and facial-recognition technology. \"The political and legal system of the future is inseparable from the internet, inseparable from big data,\" Alibaba's Jack Ma told a Communist Party commission overseeing law enforcement in 2017. In future, he said, \"Bad guys won't even be able to walk into the square.\"83 In the context of a one-party state, the combination of ubiquitous smartphones, network platforms, big data and artificial intelligence makes possible a precision-targeted totalitarianism beyond the dystopian visions of Orwell and Huxley. At the same time, the immense attractiveness of the rapidly growing Chinese market to Western tech companies makes them susceptible to pressure from the Chinese government. For example, Twitter joined Facebook and YouTube in restricting social media accounts of popular dissident Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, in response to pressure from Beijing.</p><p>Regulation of the Internet is on the increase. Nearly half of the 65 countries assessed in Freedom on the Net 2017 experienced declines in online freedom last year, while just 13 made gains, most of them minor. Less than one quarter of users reside in countries where the internet is designated \"free.\" Not only China, but also Venezuela, the Philippines, and Turkey were among 30 countries where governments were found to employ armies of \"opinion shapers\" to spread government views.84 Yet it is not self-evidently obvious which is more dangerous: a regulated Internet, in which governments exercise at least some control over network platforms, or an unregulated one, in which private companies continue to gather and exploit the personal data of citizens for profit and without scruple.</p><p>Promises, Promises</p><p>Facebook's response to the criticism directed against it over the past two years has been unconvincing. \"Personally,\" declared Zuckerberg two days after the 2016 election, \"I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.\" His February 2017 manifesto, entitled \"Building Global Community,\" was long on aspirations, short on specifics. Four months later, Facebook unveiled a new mission statement to \"give people the power to build community, to bring the world closer together.\" The assertion that Facebook was engaged in community-building was disingenuous. The implication was that Facebook should not be held responsible, like a media company, for the content that appeared on its platform. \"Things happened on our platform that shouldn't have happened,\" Sheryl Sandberg conceded. But \"at our heart we're a tech company. We hire engineers. We don't hire reporters. No one is a journalist. We don't cover the news.\"85 A former senior employee explained:</p><p>The view at Facebook is that \"we show people what they want to see and we do that based on what they tell us they want to see, and we judge that with data like time on the platform, how they click on links, what they like.\" And they believe that to the extent that something flourishes or goes viral on Facebookit's not a reflection of the company's role, but a reflection of what people want. And that deeply rational engineer's view tends to absolve them of some of the responsibility, probably.86</p><p>This defense had lost credibility, however. The insistence that the content on Facebook was somehow not Facebook's problem effectively collapsed in the wake of the revelations about 2016.</p><p>In the course of 2017, a new strategy evolved, which might be characterized preemptive self-regulation. On September 21, Zuckerberg pledged to increase the resources of Facebook's security and election-integrity teams in order to work \"proactively to strengthen the democratic process.\" Facebook would henceforth require that all political ads disclose which Facebook page paid for them and ensure that every ad a given advertiser ran was accessible to anyone on the buyer's page. Facebook would double the number of employees and contractors working on user safety and security issues to 20,000 by the end of 2018. It would also build new artificial-intelligence systems to detect what Zuckerberg described as \"bad content and bad actors.\" This could mean a significant increase in operating costs. But Zuckerberg told investors: \"I am dead serious about this. I've directed our teams to invest so much in security on top of the other investments we're making that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward.\" These pledges amounted to an admission of responsibility for content.</p><p>Yet the practical consequences were confusing. In October 2017, Facebook introduced \"Explore Feed,\" which required media companies to pay for inclusion in the News Feed.87 Further changes were introduced in January 2018, when Zuckerberg announced that News Feed would prioritize \"meaningful interaction\" over \"passive consumption of low-quality content,\" demoting \"things like clickbait headlines and false news, even though people often click on those links at a high rate.\" He added: \"We want to make sure that our products are not just fun, but are good for people ... good for the world.\" At the same time, Facebook would start to boost certain publishers whose content was \"trustworthy, informative, and local,\" according to reader surveys. In the course of 2018, Zuckerberg made numerous such announcements:</p><p>In January Facebook hired Nathaniel Gleicher, the former director for cybersecurity policy on President Obama's National Security Council, to counter \"information operations.\"</p><p>In July, it removed thirty-two accounts running disinformation campaigns that were traced to Russia. A few weeks later, it removed more than six hundred and fifty accounts, groups, and pages with links to Russia or Iran.</p><p>In March, Zuckerberg pledged \"dramatically [to reduce] the amount of data that developers have access to, so that apps and developers can't do what Kogan did\" in providing data to Cambridge Analytica.88</p><p>That same month, he said that \"People should know who is buying the ads that they see on Facebook, and you should be able to go on any page and see all the ads that people are running to different audiences.\" He said that this would be in place by the November 2018 midterms.89</p><p>Also in March, Facebook announced that it would \"try to make privacy settings clearer by creating a central hub where users can examine the data they are sharing\" with third-party developers.\"90</p><p>In September he announced a \"three-year project\" to \"rebuild all of our content enforcement systems to proactively find harmful content rather than wait for people to flag issues.\" He added: \"It is our responsibility to amplify the good and mitigate the bad.\" 91</p><p>Similar measures of self-regulation have been announced by the other network platforms over the past eighteen months.</p><p>In April 2017, Google announced the release of \"Fact Check\": \"For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page.\" This was another sop to established publishers whose revenue Google and Facebook had been devouring.</p><p>In October 2017 Google ended its \"first click free\" policy, which required publishers to give away some stories in order to appear high in its search rankings. Google chief executive Pichai spoke of \"a flight to quality.\"92</p><p>In November 2017, Google announced the \"Trust Project,\" hosted by Santa Clara University and developed in conjunction with more than 75 news organizations worldwide. The goal of the project would be to introduce eight \"trust indicators,\" such as \"author expertise,\" \"citations and references,\" and \"diverse voices,\" into the search ranking algorithm.</p><p>In December 2017, Google announced its intention to increase to 10,000 the number of employees tasked with removing extremist content from YouTube.</p><p>In short, the network platforms' response to the crisis of 2016 has been a barrage of promises to regulate themselves. \"I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\" Zuckerberg said in a CNN interview in March. \"I actually think the question is more, what is the right regulation rather than 'Yes or no, should it be regulated?'\"93 He told Ezra Klein that he could imagine \"some sort of structure, almost like a Supreme Court, that is made up of independent folks who don't work for Facebook, who ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world.\"94 This was an unusual concession, as Zuckerberglike his Roman role model Augustusrarely offers to limit his own power. \"One of the things that I feel really lucky we have,\" he also told Klein, \"is this company structure where, at the end of the day, it's a controlled company. We are not at the whims of short-term shareholders. We can really design these products and decisions with what is going to be in the best interest of the community over time.\" This was an allusion to the preference shares that give Zuckerberg control over Facebook. Advertising might be Facebook's principal source of revenue, he conceded, but that was only so that his platform could be free to users. \"I think probably to the dissatisfaction of our sales team here, I make all of our decisions based on what's going to matter to our community and focus much less on the advertising side of the business.\"</p><p>In addition to numerous interviews, the leaders of the big technology companies have set out the case for self-regulation in a succession of hearings: on October 31-November 1, 2017, in April 2018when Zuckerberg himself testified before two congressional committeesand again in September 2018. \"Which are you?\" Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) asked Zuckerberg in April. \"Are you a tech company, or are you the world's largest publisher?\"</p><p>Zuckerberg: I view us as a tech company, because the primary thing that we do is build technology and products.</p><p>Sullivan: You said you were responsible for your content, which makes you kind of a publisher, right?</p><p>Zuckerberg: I agree that we are responsible for the content, but we don't produce the content. I think that when people ask us if we are a media company or a publisher, my understanding of what the heart of what they are really getting at, is \"Do we feel responsibility for the content on our platform?\" And the answer to that, I think, is clearly \"Yes.\"</p><p>This recognition of responsibility for content was an important moment in the April hearings. Also important, however, was Zuckerberg's assertion that Facebook is \"a system of different things: we compete with Twitter as a broadcast medium; we compete with Snapchat as a broadcast medium; we do messaging, and iMessage is default-installed on every iPhone.\" This was part of a wider argument he sought to make against any attempt to apply antitrust law to Facebook. \"I think that anything that we're doing to constrain [the big tech companies] will, first, have an impact on how successful we can be in other places,\" Zuckerberg also said. \"I wouldn't worry in the near term about Chinese companies or anyone else winning in the United States, for the most part. But there are all these places where there are day-to-day more competitive situationsin Southeast Asia, across Europe, Latin America, lots of different places.\"95 In other words, what is good for Facebook is good for America, and vice versaas General Motors CEO Charles Wilson famously said of GM in 1953. Regulate big tech at your peril, for you may unintentionally help the Chinese competition.</p><p>The scale of the self-defense effort by Silicon Valley since 2016 cannot be understate. Facebook has followed Google's lead by investing heavily in Washington lobbying, hiring Joel Kaplan, a former policy adviser to President George W. Bush, and Sandy Luff, a former aide to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, Facebook had contributed a total of $641,685 since 2014 to the members of Congress that Zuckerberg faced during his visit to Capitol Hill. The top recipients of that money included Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.</p><p>However, these efforts could not prevent a flurry of activity by legislators and regulators. In August 2017, an unusual bipartisan alliance of 27 Democratic and Republican senators introduced the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), despite opposition from the Internet Association and Google. It was passed, along with the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), in April 2018. In October Senators Amy Klobuchar, Mark Warner and John McCain introduced the Honest Ads Act (S. 1989), which would require the network platforms to reveal the buyers and content of all campaign-related ads as well as to maintain a public list of all political advertisers spending $500 or more. Other legislative initiatives of the past year include Keith Ellison's 21st Century Competition Commission Act, an antitrust bill; Senator Edward J. Markey's bill to commission research on the impact of technology on children's health, and California measure to prohibit the use of bots without identification (the so-called \"Blade Runner\" law SB-1001). Senator Amy Klobuchar has also proposed two bills to change the criteria for mergers. At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is conducting an \"open non-public investigation\" into whether or not Facebook violated the terms of the 2011 consent decree when users' personal data were made available to Kogan and Cambridge Analytica. In 2012 the FTC fined Google $22.5 million for violating the terms of another consent decree. It remains to be seen if Facebook will be penalized more or less harshly. Facebook is also under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Also investigating Facebook are the attorney generals of New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut.</p><p>Not to be outdone, the president himself has begun to use Twitter to attack the other big tech companies. \"Facebook was always anti-Trump,\" he tweeted in October 2017. \"The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes(apologized) and @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?\" (\"That's what running a platform for all ideas looks like,\" Zuckerberg responded in a Facebook post.) In 2018, Trump attacked Amazon for tax evasion and taking advantage of the U.S. Postal Service. On April 5, Trump told reporters that \"Amazon is just not on an even playing field. You know, they have a tremendous lobbying effort, in addition to having The Washington Post [which Jeff Bezos acquired in 2013], which is, as far as I'm concerned, another lobbyist.\" He was, he said, \"going to take a pretty serious look\" at Amazon because \"the playing field has to be leveled.\" According to an unnamed source who had spoken to Trump, the president had \"wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law.\"96 Even Trump's preferred platform, Twitter was not spared. On July 26, 2018, he accused Twitter of \"shadow banning\" Republicans and said he would look into what he called a \"discriminatory and illegal practice.\" The big tech companies \"better be careful because you can't do that to people,\" Trump said in August, following the expulsion from Facebook of far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. \"I think that Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful. It is not fair to large portions of the population.\" Google, too, came under attack. In August 28, 2018, Larry Kudlow, Trump's economic adviser, said that the administration was \"taking a look\" at whether or not Google and its search engine should be regulated by the government. Trump complained that \"Fake CNN\" was \"prominent\" in search results for him. \"They have it RIGGED, for me and others,\" he complained, \"so that almost all stories and news is BAD.\" Conservative media were being \"shut out.\" Was this \"illegal?\" he asked, accusing Google of \"controlling what we can and cannot see.\" In a tweet on August 18, Trump accused social media of \"totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices. ... They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT, while at the same time doing nothing to others.\"</p><p>The only surprising thing is that this kind of complaint was not made sooner. FEC disclosures from last year's presidential campaign showed that 95 per cent of tech employee donations went to Hillary Clinton, and only 4 per cent to Donald Trump. The liberal politics of Silicon Valley was regularly on display in 2017, beginning as early as January, when thousands of Google employees walked out of the office for a rally sanctioned by the companyand indeed addressed by chief executive Sundar Pichaito protest against Trump's executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Google's firing of James Damore, for writing an in-house essay that questioned the desirability of hiring and promoting more female engineers, seemed to furnish fresh evidence of a corporate culture skewed to the left. In March 2018 YouTube imposed \"strikes\" on the videos of some prominent far-right actors and conspiracy theorists, including Mike Cernovich, Infowars (Alex Jones), Atomwaffen and Sargon of Akkad (Carl Benjamin). The company maintained that its \"reviewers remove content according to our policies, not according to politics or ideology.\"97</p><p>In a similar way, employees at Facebook have been dismissed for apparently political reasons. Benjamin Fearnow was fired from Trending Topics for leaking Zuckerberg's condemnation of an \"All Lives Matter\" sign at Facebook. In the words of Brian Amerige, a senior Facebook engineer, and founder of \"FB'ers for Political Diversity,\" the company has \"a political monoculture that's intolerant of different views. We claim to welcome all perspectives, but are quick to attackoften in mobsanyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology.\" When Facebook imposed an outright ban on the anti-immigration, anti-Islam group \"Britain First,\" it was explained that the group had used language \"designed to stir up hatred against groups in our society.\" On July 27, after a direct appeal from the parents of a child killed at Sandy Hook, Facebook took down four Infowars videos and suspended Alex Jones for a month. On August 5 Apple stopped distributing five podcasts associated with Jones on the ground that they purveyed \"hate speech.\" Facebook also shut down four of Jones's pages for \"repeatedly\" violating rules against hate speech and online bullying. Zuckerberg's attempt to explain his reluctance to ban Jones backfired when he explained to Kara Swisher of Recode:</p><p>The principles that we have on what we remove from the service are: If it's going to result in real harm, real physical harm, or if you're attacking individuals, then that content shouldn't be on the platform. [But] ... The approach that we've taken to false news is not to say: You can't say something wrong on the internet. I think that that would be too extreme. Everyone gets things wrong, and if we were taking down people's accounts when they got a few things wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that. ... I'm Jewish, and there's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened. I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. 98</p><p>The resulting storm of criticism illustrated the shift in attitudes in Silicon Valley. The libertarian instincts of an earlier generation of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are being forced to yield to the more censorious attitudes of more recently hired employees who have been schooled in the modern campus culture of \"no platforming\" any ideas deemed to be \"unsafe.\"</p><p>For conservatives, as well as for right-wing populists, the alarm bells can no longer be ignored. Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, and film-makers Peter Schweizer and James O'Keefe are among those to add their voices to the growing chorus of complaint about Silicon Valley's bias. Of considerable importance is Prager University v. Google, a lawsuit filed by Dennis Prager that accuses YouTube of violating his first amendment rights by \"regulat[ing] and censor[ing] speech as if the laws governing free speech and commerce do not apply to it.\" Facebook was recently forced to apologize to Prager for removing videos with the titles \"Where Are the Moderate Muslims?\" and \"Make Men Masculine Again.\" At the time of writing, allegations of anti-conservative bias on network platforms are being made with increasing frequency. Renee DiResta's insists that the platforms \"need to be able to take down users and sites that fail the tests of authenticity, organic distribution and integrity reputation.\" But it seems inevitable that many of those who fall foul of \"viewpoint agnostic moderation\" will complain of politically-motivated censorship.99</p><p>So What Is to De Done?</p><p>American lawmakers must realize that the status quo is indefensible. The network platforms currently enjoy unprecedented power over the public sphere not only in the United States but around the world. Yet they have shown themselves to be very poor custodians of their users' personal data. They have shown themselves to be vulnerable to abuse by foreign and domestic actors. They can no longer plausibly claim not to be publishers or media companies, as they are increasingly under pressure to curate, sort and otherwise manage the content that they host, and to do so in ways that have significant political implications. Minor modifications of the law, such as SESTA, do not address the fundamental question of how to limit the power and capacity for harm of the big tech companies.</p><p>There are five options that seem worthy of consideration:</p><p>1. Scrap \"net neutrality\" in order to empower the Internet service providers (ISPs) relative to the network platforms;</p><p>2. Update antitrust doctrine and law so that the network platforms can be broken up;</p><p>3. Increase the regulation of the network platforms by either the FTC or the FCC, acknowledging that they are now public utilities;</p><p>4. Repeal Section 230 altogether, thereby making the network platforms legally liable for the content they host, and leave the rest to the courts; and</p><p>5. Impose First Amendment obligations on the network platforms, recognizing that they are too important a part of the public sphere to be able to regulate access to it on the basis of their own \"community standards.\"</p><p>The first of these options, the ending of so-called net neutrality, is the only one to date that has been acted upon. Unfortunately, it is also the least likely to be effective. FCC chairman Ajit Pai has repealed Obama-era rules that were intended to ensure equal access to the Internet by preventing ISPs from charging users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites. Under Pai's new regime, ISPs will be able to block access, slow down or speed up service. For ATandT, Comcast and Verizon this has obvious appeal; for the network platforms it is much less attractive. The two kinds of company have adopted predictably opposing stances. From the point of view of the citizen-consumer, however, the net benefits of nixing net neutrality are not obvious. The most likely outcome would seem to be that Internet users will end up either paying more for certain kinds of content and enduring slower speeds for other kinds content. That does not address any of the fundamental problems described above. It merely shifts power from the network platforms to the ISPs. There is no reason to believe they are superior actors from the point of view of the public interest in a functioning market for ideas.</p><p>Of considerably more importance is the revival of interest in antitrust as a tool. This began on the left, with the so-called \"antitrust hipsters\" around Barry Lynn of the Open Markets Institute, who was effectively ousted from the New America Foundation last year because of Silicon Valley donors' opposition to his work. In the past year, however, interest has grown in the idea that the big tech companies are simply too big, even amongst conservatives. The analogy with Standard Oil, which was broken up more than a century ago, is drawn with increasing frequency. In Washington, proponents of antitrust refer to Amazon, Facebook and Google as \"Standard Commerce, Standard Social and Standard Data.\" Tim Wu of Columbia Law School argues that Facebook should relinquish Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp; Google should give up YouTube and DoubleClick; Amazon should spin off Amazon Web Services. Scott Galloway takes a similar view and includes Apple on his list.100 Such arguments have ceased to be the preserve of progressives.101</p><p>Antitrust law was developed in the United States as a response to the rise of trusts and combinationsthat is, cross-ownership and management structures facilitating collusion. The focus of early antitrust law was (and in large part continues to be) enterprise size, market share, and strategic market positioning. At first, John D. Rockefeller was praised for bringing down the price of kerosene from 26 cents in 1870, when his market share was 4 per cent, to 7 cents in 1890, when his market share reached 90 per cent. Standard Oil was feted for bringing efficiency to the oil industry, which in turn fueled the development of steel, railroads, and the technological industries associated with them. However, in the early 1900s, journalists such as Ida Tarbell helped turn public opinion against Rockefeller (the \"King of Combinations\") and his allegedly anti-competitive tactics. Trusts became a political lightning rod. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis coined the phrase \"the curse of bigness,\" arguing that firms could be too big to treat employees on equal terms, to be efficient, and to treat rivals fairly. This laid the foundation for the 1911 landmark judgment in Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States, which broke Standard Oil up into 34 separate firms.</p><p>For half a century, Brandeis's approach was dominant in the courts. In 1956, the biggest platform of that era, ATandT, settled an antitrust case by signing a consent decree in which it made two important concessions: it agreed not to expand its business into new markets (such as computers) and it made all of its patents available to others at no charge. The consent decree did not break up ATandTthat did not happen until 1984but it was an essential first step, and one with great consequences as one of the many patents in ATandT's portfolio was the transistor. In 1968 the Department of Justice's merger guidelines were that any acquisition of a company with a market share of more than 3 per cent by one with a share higher than 15 per cent should be challenged. However, this view of antitrust law was challenged by Robert H. Bork and Ward S. Bowman in their seminal 1965 article \"The Crisis in Antitrust,\" which asserted that the intention of antitrust law was simply the protection of \"consumer welfare.\" Bork and Bowman argued that antitrust law could in fact harm consumer welfare by punishing aggressive pricing and preventing mergers that would reduce costs and therefore prices. \"Consumer welfare\" came to be equated with economic efficiency, notably in the Reagan administration's 1982 merger guidelines, which aimed to proscribe the \"ability of one or more firms profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels\"a radical departure from the previous 1968 guidelines, which had aimed \"to preserve and promote market structures conducive to competition.\" Another change was the narrowing of the definition of \"barriers to entry\" to exclude incumbent advantages from economies of scale and capital requirements. The argument was that all firms were subject to the threat of potential competition, so market power was always fleeting, and antitrust enforcement rarely needed.</p><p>This helps explain why neither IBM in the 1960s nor Microsoft in the 1990s was split up, despite their dominance of, respectively, computer hardware and software. The most that happened was that IBM had to open its platform to independent software developers and Microsoft was obliged to disclose details about the workings of its Windows operating system to rivals. The failure of the antitrust action against Microsoft looks, with hindsight, like a major turning point. Microsoft had sought to bundle its Windows operating system with its own web browser, Internet Explorer, to the disadvantage of its rival, Netscape. On April 3, 2000, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization, attempted monopolization and tying, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and on June 7, 2000, ordered a breakup of Microsoft. However, Jackson was removed from the case after he talked to reporters in an off-the-record discussion before his final decision. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals then overturned Jackson's rulings and in 2002 the company reached a settlement with the Department of Justice that left it intact. Microsoft survived, though it has been argued that the warning shot fired by Judge Jackson had a significant effect on the conduct of Bill Gates and his colleagues. Plans to program Internet Explorer so that it would redirect users away from Google to MSN Search, or simply warn them against Google, were quietly shelved.</p><p>The interpretation and enforcement of today's U.S. competition laws follow two main principles: the per se concept, whereby behaviors with no judicially redeeming characteristics are illegal per se, and the rule of reason, where the illegality of behaviors rests on their probable negative effect on market competition or in creating \"restraints of trade.\" Antitrust laws and market regulations are enforced in three ways: criminal and civil enforcement actions brought by the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, civil enforcement actions brought by the FTC, and lawsuits brought by private parties asserting damage claims. Yet in practice the law did almost nothing to stand in the way of the emergence of the network platforms. How could \"consumer welfare\" be harmed by \"free\" services such as Facebook. Where were barriers to entry to the Internet? The absence of good answers to such questions encouraged an increasingly overt defense of monopoly in Silicon Valley. During a 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee antitrust hearing, Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt observed: \"It's also possible to not use Google search.\" If competition was \"one click away,\" how was Google in breach of antitrust law? In his book Zero to One, Paypal founder and early Facebook investor Peter Thiel argued that competition was for losers, as it eroded profits; only companies with a shot at establishing a monopoly were worth investing in. At the start-up incubator Y-combinator, according to its president Sam Altman, \"We ... ask how the company will one day be a monopoly ... We're looking for businesses that get more powerful with scale and that are difficult to copy.\"</p><p>In reaction to such boasts, some attempt to revitalize antitrust law was highly likely. In \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" Lina M. Khan argues that the big tech companies have created conflicts of interest by using their dominant platforms to promote their own services against those of their competitors. This is in line with the reasoning advanced by the European Commission when it fined Google for giving more prominence to its own shopping services in search results. Khan has also revived the presumption of predation in cases of below-cost pricing, which others have argued creates pernicious long-term effects on productive investment, worker wages, product quality, and consumer choice.102 Roger McNamee, one of Facebook's earliest investors, has denounced \"the U.S. government's laissez-faire approach to regulation\" and called for (among other things) a ban on further acquisitions by the network platforms, an insistence on more equitable end-user license agreements with meaningful opt-out clauses, a return of data to the ownership of consumers, andlast but not leasta revival of \"the country's traditional approach to monopoly.\"103</p><p>There are two problems with the attempt to revive pre-Bork and Bowman antitrust, aside from the extreme difficulty of achieving a rapid paradigm shift in the minds of judges. First, the software industry is prone to natural monopoly or oligopoly. Software reduces friction along existing value chains, often reconfiguring industries into two-sided markets, with platforms intermediating between owners of assets or providers of services and consumers. As demonstrated by the work of Nobel laureate Jean Tirole, two-sided markets exhibit powerful network effects and therefore produce just a few dominant firms, an effect compounded by the aggressive use of patents in software markets and a deliberately engineered lack of inter-operability. Preferential attachment models, such as those developed by the physicist Albert-Laszl Barabasi, describe markets where strength begets strength. For example, in social media networks, the users with the most friends or followers are the most likely to get any additional nodes added to the network. This produces a power-law-like distribution that makes it all but impossible for latecomers to succeed. These insights from network science challenge the Chicago School's belief that high capital requirements or regulation are the most important barriers to market entry; network effects create a new kind of barrier. Breaking up network platforms would reduce these effects because the whole network is genuinely more valuable than the sum of its parts (Metcalfe's law).</p><p>In any case, the historian is bound to point out that even supposedly successful antitrust actions in reality achieved much less than was intended. The outcome of the breakup of Standard Oil was in fact to make Rockefeller richer. The 34 \"Baby Standards\" were worth a combined $600 million in 1911, swelling to $2.9 billion in value and paying out $920 million in dividends by 1921, making Rockefeller one of the richest men in history. The interoperability forced on Microsoft, which allowed rivals to make their products more compatible with Windows, only made Microsoft more central to the software ecosystem. After the original 2001 judgment ordering the breakup of Microsoft, many predicted the company's decline. But Microsoft retained more than 90 per cent of the operating system market until last year and Apple did not surpass it in market capitalization until 2010.</p><p>If breaking up big tech is either impossible or pointless, the obvious answer is to regulate the network platforms as utilities. There are ample precedents. In the 1876 case of Munn vs. Illinois, the Supreme Court upheld the power of the government to regulate private industries such as the railroads, though the railroads defied any attempts to regulate prices and the Munn decision was eventually reversed. The creation in 1886 of the Interstate Commerce Commission gave the government real power to intervene, but enforcement was left to the courts, which usually sided with the railroads. It was not until the twentieth century that the railroads came to be regulatedin other words, after the monopolized market had leveled off in innovation, growth and profitability. History shows that, in the United States, government intervention often serves to cement the dominance of large players for the foreseeable future, and that equity holders generally fare quite well. As Gabriel Kolko demonstrated in two seminal booksRailroads and Regulation and The Triumph of Conservatismlate nineteenth century regulation was often designed to stabilize profitability in oligopolistic industries that had reached maturity. This is a judgment supported by Carlotta Perez's more recent work on technological development, Carl H. Fulda's study of inland water-carriers, aircraft, and motor carriers, and conservative economist and jurist Richard A. Posner's work on natural monopoly regulation. It is therefore hard to summon up much enthusiasm for the prospect of a more assertive FTCor for that matter FCCworking in tandem with the biggest companies of Silicon Valley to create a regulatory framework very likely to entrench their market dominance.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner's October 2018 paper on \"Potential Policy Proposals\" illustrates what a more heavily regulated tech sector might have to contend with.104 Out of twenty proposals, two have already made it into law:</p><p>1. Duty to label bots (\"Blade Runner\" law).</p><p>2. Disclosure requirements for online political advertisements (Honest Ads Act).</p><p>Four of Warner's proposals envisage new legislation:</p><p>3. Comprehensive (GDPR-like) data protection legislation and establish an enforcement agency</p><p>4. Legislation banning so-called \"dark patterns\" such as Facebook nudges to induce users to upload their contacts.</p><p>5. A Data Transparency Bill that would \"require companies to more granularly (and continuously) alert consumers to the ways in which their data was being used, counterparties it was being used with, and ... what each user's data was worth to the platform.\"</p><p>6. A Data Portability Bill: \"predicated on a legal recognition that data supplied by ... users (or user activity) is the users'not the service provider's.\"</p><p>Only one Warner proposal envisages reducing the scope of legislation, namely removing Section 230 immunity for state-level \"dignitary torts\" such as defamation, false light, public disclosure of private facts.</p><p>Four other proposals would, implicitly or explicitly, increase the power of existing federal agencies or create a new agency:</p><p>7. Restore the FTC's rulemaking authority with respect to privacy.</p><p>8. Create an interagency task force for countering asymmetric threats to democratic institutions</p><p>9. Establish a public initiative for media literacy</p><p>10. Increase deterrence against foreign manipulation</p><p>A total of eight would impose new duties or responsibilities on network platforms, which presumably one or more of these regulatory agencies would enforce:</p><p>11. Duty to determine [the] origin of posts and / or accounts</p><p>12. Duty to identify inauthentic accounts</p><p>13. Information fiduciary duty, stipulating \"not only that providers had to zealously protect user data, but also [that they had to] pledge not to utilize or manipulate the data for the benefit of the platform or third parties.\"</p><p>14. Obligation to make anonymized activity data available to \"independent, public interest researchers\" (Public Interest Data Access Bill)</p><p>15. Requirement to get first-party consent for data collection</p><p>16. Requirement to provide consumers with the sources of data used to make algorithmic determinations or classifications.</p><p>17. Requirement for platforms to make their services interoperable with other platforms.</p><p>18. Obligation to make \"essential facilities\" (e.g., Google Maps) publicly available a \"fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory\" (FRAND) terms.</p><p>Only one (the requirement to open federal datasets to university researchers and qualified small businesses) asks anything from the government.</p><p>This is a list fraught with technical difficulties. For example, it is often impossible to origins of posts and accounts. Insisting on identification could have unintended consequences for users living in authoritarian states and even for the civil rights of those living in democracies. Is it entirely clear to whom data belongs, if it is data based on the platform's observation of user behavior? Would not increased portability of data go hand in hand with increased insecurity? But the biggest objection to Warner's approach is that, as in the past, increasing the powers of federal agencies would incentivize the already establish network platforms to collude with those agencies to raise entry-barriers. For example, data portability might entrench incumbents by obliging any new entrants to give them access to their data.</p><p>A fourth approach would be to go beyond Warner's more limited proposal on Section 230 and repeal it altogether, ending the exemption of network platforms from liability for the content they host. That exemption made sense when these companies were fledglings or did not yet exist. Today, it gives the biggest companies in the world both power and influence without responsibility or accountability. One appealing feature of getting rid of Section 230 is that it would be left to the courts to bring the network platforms to heel when plaintiffs could show that a harm had arisen from, say, a fake news story disseminated by Facebook's News Feed. Already the courts have established that the network platforms are not exempt from liability to warn and product liability, because they have a duty of care to warn users of potential dangers. Indeed, given social media's uniquely deep and wide knowledge of users' interactions and relationships, they have unprecedented abilities to foresee potential harms. In one important case, a model (\"Jane Doe\") had been lured by scammers on ModelMayhem, a social network for models and photographers, who then drugged and raped her, filming the incident for a pornographic video. Internet Brands, the owner of ModelMayhem, was aware of this rape ring, but did not warn any of its users. In Jane Doe No. 14 v. Internet Brands, Inc., the 9th circuit court ruled that \"Doe's negligent failure to warn claim did not seek to hold Internet Brands liable as the 'publisher or speaker of any information provided by another ...' and therefore the Communications Decency Act did not bar the claim.\" This case has established an important limit on Section 230 immunity, but it also exposes the anachronistic nature of Section 230 itself. If Internet Brands should have warned Jane Doe of the dangers of using ModelMayhem, why should not Facebook have warned all its users of the dangers of Russian-generated fake news targeted at them through the News Feed?105</p><p>There is, however, an important corollary. If we are to end the fiction that network platforms are not, in some respects, media companies or publishers, then we must at the same time end the equally dangerous fiction that they are not in many respects the modern public sphere. A first step has already been taken in this direction. In Packingham v. North Carolina</p><p>the Supreme Court last year overturned a state law that banned sex offenders from using social media. In the opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy likened internet platforms to \"the modern public square,\" arguing that it was therefore unconstitutional to prevent sex offenders from accessing, and expressing opinions, on social network platforms. In other words, despite being private companies, the big tech companies have, in some cases, a public function. \"While in the past there may have been difficulty in identifying the most important places (in a spatial sense) for the exchange of views,\" Justice Kennedy wrote, \"today the answer is clear. It is cyberspacethe vast democratic forums of the Internet in general, and social media in particular.\" In May this year the Southern District of New York gave a similar ruling in Knight First Amendment Institute v. Donald J. Trump, Hope Hicks, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Daniel Scavino:</p><p>We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump accountthe \"interactive space\" where Twitter users may directly engage with the content of the President's tweetsare properly analyzed under the \"public forum\" doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court, that such space is a designated public forum, and that the blocking of the plaintiffs based on their political speech constitutes viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment.106</p><p>As president, Donald Trump could not therefore block Twitter users from seeing his tweets.</p><p>If the network platforms are the new public sphere, then it cannot be their responsibility to remove \"hateful content,\" as 19 prominent civil right groups demanded of Facebook in October 2017, because hateful contentunless it explicitly instigates violence against a specific personis protected by the First Amendment. To be sure, Kate Klonick has argued that tech companies should not \"be held to a First Amendment standard,\" because that would mean \"porn stays up, spam stays up, everything stays up.\" But this is not convincing. It is better that porn and spam \"stay up\" than that our freedom of speech be circumscribed by the community standards of unaccountable private companies, run by men who imagine themselves to be emperors.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In a series of brilliant essays, the former Facebook engineer Sam Lessin has challenged much received wisdom about the Internet. As he puts it, the Internet \"increasingly represents a strange hybrid of the public and private spheres.\" The problem revealed in 2016, he argues, was not fake news or feed ranking but the fact that \"a public candidate can for the first time effectively talk to each individual voter privately in their own home and tell them exactly what they want to hear.\" Moreover, the disappearing message feature of Snapchat and Instagram makes tracking of all advertisements harder. \"Lots of data, and systems which can react properly to the interests, beliefs, and feelings of different people lead to a world where technology and brands tell us exactly what we want to hear in a way that can't be tracked or audited.\" Far from worrying about \"echo chambers,\" we need to worry about \"personal, private and disappearing messaging that can be powerful but can't be broadly traced or audited.\"107</p><p>For Lessin, the Internet is no more likely to produce two opposing ideological camps than it was to produce a global community. Polarization is just a phase on the way to a much more complete atomization as \"the pressure built into the internet's DNA, accelerated by things like artificial intelligence, ... threatens to undermine our ability to understand one another [and] see reality the same way.\" Lessin poses a series of difficult questions:</p><p>Is Anonymity a Feature to Be Protected, or a Bug to Be Quashed? (Looks like the latter.)</p><p>Should Anyone Be Able to Reach Everyone? (Not clear. Who gets through the email gateways?)</p><p>Is Money a Form of Speech? (If extreme views are stickier than moderate ones, they are cheaper to disseminate online.)</p><p>Who Decides What Algorithms and Human Policies Control Our View of Reality? (Answer: network platforms, i.e. private corporations in conjunction with ~200 governments. Means rising costs.)</p><p>Will We Tolerate Unregulated Escape Hatches for Free Speech? (Answer: if not, the global village blows up.)108</p><p>His worry is that the Internet is a kind of fission bomb. First it shrank the world into a global village; now it threatens to start \"a chain reaction that, just like a nuclear weapon, will cause the world to violently explode.\" The problem is that, with the consolidation of the public sphere in the network platforms and the rapid collapse of the private sphere, we are losing the ability to let off steam because nothing is any longer \"off the record.\"109</p><p>Nothing is off the record, but no record is wholly reliable. As technological advances make it easier to create believable fake photos, video and audio recording, we may soon find ourselves unmoored from the modes of rational verification we have evolved since the Scientific Revolution. The network platforms flourished in an anarchic Internet because they appeared to create trust. But our trust in them was misplaced, because their business models incentivized them to send us fake news from fake accounts if it was sufficiently engaging. Our biggest vulnerability turns out to be that while our appetite for entertainmentbranded as fictionis finite, our appetite for \"edutainment\"entertaining content branded as educational or informativeseems almost infinite. As a result, when we go online, we find ourselves a \"world where we are connected to less trustworthy people and organizations than we ever would have been in the physical world. The value of the human network has almost reversed itselffrom being an incredibly good way to 'clean' content and refine information to a system that packages together good and bad information and leaves the two indistinguishable.\"110 Worse, we are no longer able to distinguish when we are connected to another human being or to a bot or other device. Those who talk of the \"Internet of Things\" seem to believe we shall be able to tell the 8 billion people from the 30 billion \"things\" that will be connected to the Internet by 2020. That will be hard when many of the things will appear to be people.111</p><p>To some commentators, the future looks exceedingly bleak. The advance of artificial intelligence, they argue, dooms mankind to a new totalitarianism, rendering liberal democracy and free-market economics \"obsolete.\" According to Yuval Noah Harari, \"once we begin to count on AI to decide what to study, where to work, and whom to date or even marry, human life will cease to be a drama of decision making. ... We are now creating tame humans who produce enormous amounts of data and function as efficient chips in a huge data-processing mechanism.\" We shall soon be to data what cows are to milk.112 Lessin is only slightly more optimistic. He envisages two viable futures (and one untenable one that tries to lie between the two extremes). In his authoritarian future, national governments end up regulating all private and public speech, and the Internet effectively breaks up. In such a scenario, all countries end up going down the Chinese road. However, there is an alternative worldof \"technologically guaranteed free speech,\" based on blockchain technology. In this future, each person would have a public and private key-pair, as with today's cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. But this would be a blockchain-based system of communication and record-keeping:</p><p>Everyone could be identified by their public key. Anyone could write public or private \"claims\" about any other key (signing the information with their key and the keys of intended recipients). And, critically, all the \"speech\" shared over time could be stored in an append-only distributed database ... that would make it impossible for anyone to rewrite history or limit speech. ... anyone could say anything to anyone else. Anyone could remember anything they wanted. No one's identity could be blocked or eliminated. We would have true freedom of speech, memory and identity.</p><p>Yet this would be no libertarian paradise because \"people could have as many different identities as they want ... fraudulent identities spewing falsehood would abound. ... there would be a huge amount of junk, lies and attempted manipulation ... the most abhorrent speech [would be] unstoppable. Bullying would abound.\"113 Subversive interventions by foreign governments would presumably abound, too.</p><p>None of these futures is very appealing, but each becomes more plausible the longer we leave the Internet in its present state, with generally incompetent or repressive regulation by governments or bogus self-regulation by the network platforms. The events of 2016 should have made it clear that the status quo is indefensible. The network platforms are too powerful and too reckless, too addicted to making us addicted, to be left to regulate themselves. We do not wish to follow China down the road to the surveillance state. It is doubtful that we should passively follow Europe as it seeks, at one and the same time, to live off the network platforms, by taxing and fining them, and to delegate the power of public censorship to them. It would be far better if the United States, before succumbing to the terrors of science fictional futures, sought to learn from history.</p><p>The network platforms are new, but they have recognizable antecedents. They combine the pricing power of the big railroad companies with the monopolistic tendencies of Standard Oil; the political influence of William Randolph Hearst with the technological leadership of ATandT and IBM; the convenience of Microsoft with the addictiveness and harmfulness of cigarettes. That we should trust them not to \"be evil\" is out of the question. We should always have expected them both to move fast and to break things that we did not want to have broken. It will not be enough to tilt the balance of power a little in the favor of the ISPs. Antitrust alone is not likely to be a swift enough remedy, and it would be a chronic optimist who believed a federal government agency would solve all the problems described above. (The recent record of financial regulators offers almost no encouragement.) Far better, surely, to oblige the network platforms to deal directly with citizens and competitors through the lawcourts, by removing the privilege on which they have grown so fatthe exemption from liability for content, established by Section 230and at the same time to impose on them the obligation that is appropriate for entities that now so dominate the public sphere: the duty to uphold the First Amendment. This combination of remedies seems consonant with the traditions of American government. It recognizes the difficulty of reviving antitrust law in the age of network economics. It avoids the pitfall of entrusting too much power to bureaucrats. Yet by simultaneously increasing the network platforms' costs and reducing their power to distort the democratic process, the measures proposed here would, if implemented, stand a reasonable chance of reining in the new Rockefellersnot to mention the Caesarsof Silicon Valley.</p><p>Niall Ferguson is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and a senior fellow of the Center for European Studies at Harvard University, where he served for twelve years as the Laurence A.

One way to do this would be to make clear that the Section 230 safe harbor does not apply to the platform's contributory or vicarious liability for third-party content. Vicarious liability (which would arise when the platform has the right, duty, or ability to control conduct and benefits from the conduct) would be especially important for shaping the behavior of platforms that benefit from third-party content (by selling advertising tied to the content, for example). A phased-in duty to control would give big tech companies a very strong incentive to address tortious material on their platforms, much as YouTube was induced to deal with rampant copyright infringement on its platform by a long and expensive round of litigation.</p><p>106 U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, ruling in May 23, 2018.</p><p>107 Sam Lessin, Free Speech and Democracy in the Age of Micro-Targeting,\" The Information, December 5, 2016.</p><p>108 Sam Lessin, \"The Tower of Babel: Five Challenges of the Modern Internet,\" The Information, November 6, 2017.</p><p>109 Ibid.</p><p>110 Sam Lessin, \"How the Internet Broke and What to Do About It,\" The Information, September 4, 2018.</p><p>111 Philip Howard, Pax Technica How the Internet of Things May Set Us Free Or Lock Us Up (New Haven / London: Yale University Press, 2015).</p><p>112 Yuval Noah Harari, \"Why Technology Favors Tyranny,\" The Atlantic, October 2018.</p><p>113 Lessin, \"How the Internet Broke.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122524659</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRG-6N31-DYTH-G0HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"22517\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 13, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Firstly, because it uses something called a High-Definition (HD) Voice service, often calls made over Wi-Fi are clearer and easier to make out. However, this will depend on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-good-internet-speed?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">the speed of your internet connection</url>.</p><p>If you're in an area where cellular service is spotty, Wi-Fi calls can help keep you from dropping calls.</p><p>Additionally, on most major phone carriers, Wi-Fi calling services are free, as long as the calls are being made to U.S. numbers.</p><p>You have access to Wi-Fi calling as long as you have a compatible cell phone. Don't worry - that's all phones on the market today. So as long as you don't have a very old smartphone - as in, older than the iPhone 6 - you can use Wi-Fi calling.\u00a0</p><p>You should also note that to make Wi-Fi calls, you'll also have to provide your address. This is so emergency services can reach you if you call 911.</p><p>If you want to know how to turn that capability on, here's how.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How to enable Wi-Fi calling</emphasis></h><p>The exact way to turn on Wi-Fi calls on your phone will depend on what sort of phone you have.

You've probably heard a thing or two out there about Wi-Fi[3] calling. However, if you're not a big tech person, you may be a little confused as to what that is.It's actually very simple: Wi-Fi[4] calling is when you conduct a phone call over a Wi-Fi connection, rather than using your cell phone carrier's cellular network.Here's what you should know about Wi-Fi[5] calling, including how to set it up on your phone. Wi-Fi calling, explained As stated, a Wi-Fi call is a call that's placed using a Wi-Fi internet connection instead of a cell connection.There are several advantages to Wi-Fi calling over standard voice calling. Firstly, because it uses something called a High-Definition (HD) Voice service, often calls made over Wi-Fi are clearer and easier to make out. </p><p>However, this will depend on the speed of your internet connection[6].If you're in an area where cellular service is spotty, Wi-Fi calls can help keep you from dropping calls.Additionally, on most major phone carriers, Wi-Fi calling services are free, as long as the calls are being made to U.S. numbers.You have access to Wi-Fi calling as long as you have a compatible cell phone. Don't worry \u2014 that's all phones on the market today. So as long as you don't have a very old smartphone \u2014 as in, older than the iPhone 6 \u2014 you can use Wi-Fi calling.You should also note that to make Wi-Fi calls, you'll also have to provide your address. This is so emergency services can reach you if you call 911.If you want to know how to turn that capability on, here's how. How to enable Wi-Fi calling The exact way to turn on Wi-Fi calls on your phone will depend on what sort of phone you have. But in general: On an iPhone: 1. Open your phone's Settings app.2. Tap the \"Cellular\" option to open your cellular network menu. Select \"Cellular.\"  Melanie Weir/Business Insider 3. Find the Wi-Fi calling option and tap it. Open the \"Wi-Fi Calling\" menu.  Melanie Weir/Business Insider 4. Toggle the Wi-Fi calling switch to the left, so it turns green. Tap the switch so it toggles to the right.  Melanie Weir/Business Insider 5. A pop-up will appear, giving you more details about the sort of information that gets sent to your cell phone carrier when you enable Wi-Fi calling. Read to make sure you're okay with the terms, then tap \"Enable.\" Tap \"Enable\" in the pop-up menu.  Melanie Weir/Business Insider 6. Another pop-up will appear, asking you to confirm your address in order to comply with federal 911 regulations. The appearance of this pop-up may change slightly based on your cellular carrier. Confirm your address, then tap \"Next.\" Confirm your address using the form given.  Melanie Weir/Business Insider 7. Follow the on-screen instructions from your carrier to finish setting up Wi-Fi calling on your device. If you're using an Android phone: 1. Open your phone's dialer \u2014 the screen where you type in phone numbers \u2014 and tap the three dots in the top-right corner.2. Select \"Settings.\"3. In the menu that appears, tap \"Wi-Fi calling\" and then tap the switch next to it so it flips to the right.4. You'll be asked to confirm that you want to enable Wi-Fi calls, and then enter your address. Once you've done both, Wi-Fi calling will be enabled.

Wi-Fi calling is built into nearly all modern phones, and usually comes at no extra cost \u2014 all you need is an internet connection. Wi-Fi calls can be useful when you don't have a reliable cellular connection. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's Tech Reference library for more stories[1].You've probably heard a thing or two about Wi-Fi[2] calling. However, if you're not a big tech person, you may be a little confused as to what that is.It's actually very simple: Wi-Fi calling[3] is when you conduct a phone call over a Wi-Fi connection rather than through your phone carrier's cellular network.Here's what you should know about Wi-Fi calling, including how to set it up on your phone. Wi-Fi calling, explained As stated, a Wi-Fi call is a call that's placed using a Wi-Fi internet connection instead of a cell connection.There are several advantages to Wi-Fi calling over standard calling. Wi-Fi calls use something called a High-Definition (HD) Voice service, which typically makes the call quality clearer. However, this depends on the speed of your internet connection[4].If you're in an area where cellular service is spotty, Wi-Fi calls can sometimes keep calls from getting disconnected.Additionally, on most major phone carriers, Wi-Fi calling services are free, as long as the calls are being made to U.S. numbers.You have access to Wi-Fi calling as long as you have a compatible cell phone. Don't worry \u2014 that's nearly all phones on the market today. So as long as you don't have a very old smartphone \u2014 as in, older than the iPhone 6 \u2014 you can use Wi-Fi calling.You should also note that to make Wi-Fi calls, you'll have to provide your address. This is so emergency services can reach you if you call 911.If you want to know how to turn that capability on, here's how. How to enable Wi-Fi calling The exact way to turn on Wi-Fi calls on your phone will depend on what sort of phone you have. But in general, here's how. On an iPhone: 1. Open your phone's Settings app.2. Tap the \"Cellular\" option to open your cellular network menu.3. Find the Wi-Fi calling option and tap it.4. Toggle the Wi-Fi calling switch to the left, so it turns green.5. A pop-up will appear, giving you more details about the sort of information that gets sent to your cell phone carrier when you enable Wi-Fi calling. Read to make sure you're okay with the terms, then tap \"Enable.\"6. Another pop-up will appear, asking you to confirm your address in order to comply with federal 911 regulations. The appearance of this pop-up may change slightly based on your cellular carrier. Confirm your address, then tap \"Next.\"7. Follow the on-screen instructions from your carrier to finish setting up Wi-Fi calling on your device. On an Android: 1. Open your phone's dialer \u2014 the screen where you type in phone numbers \u2014 and tap the three dots in the top right corner.2. Select \"Settings.\"3. In the menu that appears, tap \"Wi-Fi calling\" and then tap the switch next to it so it flips to the right.4. You'll be asked to confirm that you want to enable Wi-Fi calls, and then enter your address. Once you've done both, Wi-Fi calling will be enabled. <url

Tell us in the form below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Ever since the summer of 2017, when Kevin Roose started writing The Shift, a column that delves into business, technology and culture, a torrent of big tech industry news has given him plenty of fodder, from privacy scandals to the rise of misinformation on social media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But sometimes Kevin turns the lens lightheartedly on himself, writing about his indoctrination into the Instant Pot cult and his conversion to e-scooter enthusiast.</p><p>  Here, he talks about the future of technology, the anxiety of publishing a huge story and his newest hobby (no screens involved).</p><p>  Your most popular column was about the lessons you learned from ditching your phone. In what other ways has your reporting influenced how you think about and use technology in your personal life?</p><p>  I've written a lot about the attention economy -- everything on the internet that is trying to grab our ears and eyeballs for profit, including the big social media platforms -- and it's made me really aware of where I put my own attention, and the ways I'm being manipulated in the background. I've gotten really protective of my attention, and I get self-conscious when I catch myself in a YouTube spiral, or find myself mindlessly swiping through Instagram stories.</p><p>  I've also become less of a gadget nerd than I once was. I used to buy all the newest phones and accessories, deck out my house in connected devices and try all the latest apps. But I've seen so many buggy launches that now I usually wait for version 2.0, and I've watched enough tech trends come and go that it's become hard to put too much faith in any one thing.</p><p>  What are you most excited for and worried about in the world of technology right now?</p><p>  On the positive side, I'm excited that technology is getting the attention it deserves, and that after years of operating with cheerful impunity, big tech companies are finally being scrutinized by regulators, the media and their own employees.</p><p>  But I'm also excited about a lot of smaller, less headline-grabbing developments. For the last two years, I've given out ''Good Tech Awards'' to tech projects that are actually making the world a better place -- the 2018 edition featured blood-delivering drones, decarceration start-ups, and researchers calling out racial and gender bias in artificial intelligence systems, among other things. It's one of my favorite pieces to write, and reminds me that lots of technologists are still out there doing good.</p><p>  On the worry side, it's a clich\u00e9, but I'm nervous about A.I. and automation. I'm not worried about the machines themselves -- at least not in the Terminator, killer-robot sense. I'm worried about the political and economic system into which we're deploying this new, world-changing technology, and whether it's too late to rejigger things so we don't end up with a truly dystopian outcome.</p><p>  What is the best news tip you've ever received?</p><p>  I'm not sure about ''best,'' but the most random tip I've ever gotten was probably the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack. It came to me as an unsolicited email from someone (whom we now know was likely a North Korean hacker) who called himself ''the boss of G.O.P.'' and included a link to a trove of documents. It looked like spam, but I opened it on a whim and was shocked to find 26 folders of internal Sony Pictures documents inside, including spreadsheets containing the salaries of all their executives.</p><p>  How does it feel after you publish a big story? What do you do?</p><p>  Hmm, let's see. After I publish a big story, I usually step out onto my terrace, draw a few deep, contented breaths, crack open a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Margaux and spend the rest of the day basking in the satisfaction of a job well done.</p><p>  I'm kidding. Obviously, I spend the hour after a story is published frantically refreshing Twitter, looking for affirmation from complete strangers and measuring my self-worth by their instantaneous judgments. I'm not a lunatic.</p><p>  Actually, it usually feels equal parts great and awful to publish a big story. Great because you're done, which is nice, but then you wait in agony as the world absorbs and digests what you've written and tells you that your entire thesis is wrong, or you've mixed up 4chan and 8chan, or you wrote that the concept of a ''non-playable character'' came from video games when it really originated in tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons. (I got dozens of emails about that one.) On the rare occasions when the reception to a piece is overwhelmingly positive, I allow myself to bask in it, although I sometimes suspect there's been some sort of glitch -- maybe the experts are all on vacation this week?</p><p>  I'm lucky to write for an intelligent and attentive audience, and I do get a lot of great and genuinely helpful feedback. I also write a lot about horrible parts of the internet, so once in a while my inbox and Twitter feed get flooded with trolls and bigots calling me a ''fake news moron from the New York Slimes'' (or worse). On those occasions, I try to take a few hours off from the internet and let the cycle run its course.</p><p>  How do you spend your time when you're off duty?</p><p>  My newest extracurricular is ceramics. Earlier this year, I started taking pottery classes, and it's been -- as Gwyneth Paltrow as this sounds -- totally healing and restorative. Making something with your hands is incredibly satisfying, and forcing yourself to get away from screens and learn a new skill is something I wish I'd done years ago.</p><p>  Other than pottery, I like cooking, music, walking my dog in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, doing the crossword puzzle and reading the New Yorkers that pile up on my kitchen table. I used to play a lot of video games, but I had to kick that habit -- it was turning my brain into pudding.</p><p>  ______</p><p>  Illustration by Rebecca Clarke</p><p>  A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.</p><p>  Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.</p><p>  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         </p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DRAWING (DRAWING BY REBECCA CLARKE)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-278645190430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0T-C8X1-DXY4-X2GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1086\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DF5V</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DL5G</classCode><className>HOBBIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE &amp; ETHNICITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DIEG</classCode><className>GENDER &amp; SEX DISCRIMINATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DO43</classCode><className>MOTORIZED SCOOTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Kamala Harris ascending to become former Vice President Joe Biden's running mate, Silicon Valley can breathe a little easier, at least for now. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For nearly four years, top Democrats and Republicans have attacked the tech industry with allegations of antitrust violations, political bias and criticisms of how large online platforms handled privacy and misinformation. Biden himself is among Big Tech's harshest critics --- needling Facebook over misinformation and political advertising, and calling for the repeal of a key legal shield for the industry. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But his selection of Harris for vice president is already giving some who operate in and around the tech industry cause for optimism. A California senator whose constituency includes Silicon Valley, Harris has experience working on technology issues. Her connections to technology execs include powerful donors such as Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. On Tuesday, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote that Harris's presumptive nomination \"is a huge moment for Black women and girls all over the world -- and for all of us.\"</p><p>\"She's a great pick for the tech industry,\" said Matt Tanielian, co-founder of Franklin Square Group, a Washington-based lobbying firm that represents Apple, Dropbox, eBay and others. \"Not because I think she's going to suddenly turn tech back into the darling it once was ... but she knows the issues really well. She's no pushover on any of the tough things.\"</p><p>On perhaps the most pressing issue for the tech industry, Harris also stands in stark contrast to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, her onetime rival in the Democratic presidential race and another name on Biden's list of VP candidates. While Warren advocated for the breakup of tech giants like Amazon and Google, prompting other presidential candidates to do the same, Harris never endorsed the idea.</p><p>\"I believe that the tech companies have got to be regulated in a way we can ensure, and the American consumer can be certain, that their privacy is not being compromised,\" Harris said when the New York Times directly asked if she thought Amazon, Facebook or Google should be broken up. </p><p>On this particular issue, at least, it may not matter who the VP pick is, given the number of ongoing tech antitrust probes. \"The regulatory exposure is already very far along\" for the biggest tech giants, said Jason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, a publishers' trade group that's been heavily critical of Google and Facebook. \"And I think regardless of who the vice presidential candidate is, it's going to move at a rapid pace.\"</p><p>Vice presidents may not always have the most direct impact on policies. And other candidates who were passed over, including Warren, could still have an impact if chosen for a cabinet role. Still, every VP pick sends a public message about how a potential administration might set priorities or approach certain issues. Here are some key areas in which tech experts say Harris could play a significant role. </p><p>Privacy and data protection</p><p>While Harris was not vocal on breaking up tech giants, she is widely regarded as an early leader on consumer privacy issues, several experts said. </p><p>Her experience on privacy matters reemerged during a tense exchange with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg when he testified before the Senate in 2018. Harris pushed Zuckerberg to say whether Facebook had deliberately decided not to tell users about the Cambridge Analytica data breach when the social media giant learned about it.</p><p>In 2012, as California's attorney general, Harris hammered out an agreement with Apple, Google, and other tech platforms requiring them to let consumers access the privacy policies of apps before they download them. Later that year, she sent letters to dozens of app developers warning that they were not in compliance with California's privacy regulations and that they faced fines of up to $2,500 per violation. </p><p>Since then, California has passed one of the toughest data privacy laws in the nation, but there's still no federal privacy standard. Given Harris's congressional experience, she may serve as a critical link between the White House and Congress on privacy, said Susan Hintze, a privacy lawyer and partner at Hintze Law.</p><p>\"Many folks don't realize she built her political career championing privacy issues against the backdrop of the tech world,\" Hintze said. \"I suspect as VP she may continue that fight, and we may see more privacy initiatives at the federal level.\" </p><p>Encryption and law enforcement</p><p>As a former attorney general and prosecutor, Harris is closely linked to law enforcement, and her record on policing has been deeply scrutinized during the Democratic primary. </p><p>For Silicon Valley, this aspect of Harris's record may represent the greatest source of uncertainty. As a senator, Harris supported a package of anti-sex trafficking bills known as SESTA/FOSTA, which many in the tech industry opposed because it watered down liability protections for online platforms. Biden has previously called for a complete repeal of those same protections, which were enshrined in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. It's an open question how a Vice President Harris might influence that agenda, given her previous vote.</p><p>Meanwhile, a top priority of the FBI and Justice Department has been accessing the encrypted communications of criminal suspects, an issue that's caused a rift between Washington and Silicon Valley; technologists argue giving police special access to read encrypted messages would weaken privacy and security for everyone. </p><p>Thus far, Harris has tried to walk a fine line on the matter. She avoided picking a side in the 2016 standoff between Apple and the FBI over unlocking the encrypted iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter. But as a potential decision-maker in a Biden administration, she may no longer have that luxury. </p><p>Harris may face similar quandaries over other technology issues related to policing. Facial recognition, artificial intelligence, drone surveillance --- all of these are likely to become major issues Harris may need to weigh in on during a Biden administration. </p><p>Remote work, immigration and good government</p><p>Some experts say Harris is unlikely to be mired so deeply in specific policy issues and instead may play a larger role on big-picture topics like immigration, intellectual property and broadband access, which are also important to the tech industry.</p><p>These types of issues hew more closely to the overall task facing a potential Biden administration, which will be to continue managing the economic fallout from the pandemic.</p><p>\"How do we create a vibrant economy, and how do we make social justice in a world of remote everything?\" said Blair Levin, a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission. \"That'll probably be a fundamental tech issue in the next administration.\" </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

With Sen. Kamala Harris ascending to become former Vice President Joe Biden's running mate, Silicon Valley can breathe a little easier, at least for now.  For nearly four years, top Democrats and Republicans have attacked the tech industry with allegations of antitrust violations, political bias and criticisms of how large online platforms handled privacy and misinformation. Biden himself is among Big Tech's harshest critics \u2014 needling Facebook over misinformation and political advertising, and calling for the repeal of a key legal shield for the industry.  But his selection of Harris for vice president is already giving some who operate in and around the tech industry cause for optimism. A California senator whose constituency includes Silicon Valley, Harris has experience working on technology issues. Her connections to technology execs include powerful donors such as Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. On Tuesday, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote that Harris's presumptive nomination \"is a huge moment for Black women and girls all over the world -- and for all of us.\"  \"She's a great pick for the tech industry,\" said Matt Tanielian, co-founder of Franklin Square Group, a Washington-based lobbying firm that represents Apple, Dropbox, eBay and others. \"Not because I think she's going to suddenly turn tech back into the darling it once was ... but she knows the issues really well. She's no pushover on any of the tough things.\"  On perhaps the most pressing issue for the tech industry, Harris also stands in stark contrast to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, her onetime rival in the Democratic presidential race and another name on Biden's list of VP candidates. While Warren advocated for the breakup of tech giants like Amazon and Google, prompting other presidential candidates to do the same, Harris never endorsed the idea.  \"I believe that the tech companies have got to be regulated in a way we can ensure, and the American consumer can be certain, that their privacy is not being compromised,\" Harris said when the New York Times directly asked if she thought Amazon, Facebook or Google should be broken up.  On this particular issue, at least, it may not matter who the VP pick is, given the number of ongoing tech antitrust probes. \"The regulatory exposure is already very far along\" for the biggest tech giants, said Jason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, a publishers' trade group that's been heavily critical of Google and Facebook. \"And I think regardless of who the vice presidential candidate is, it's going to move at a rapid pace.\"  Vice presidents may not always have the most direct impact on policies. And other candidates who were passed over, including Warren, could still have an impact if chosen for a cabinet role. Still, every VP pick sends a public message about how a potential administration might set priorities or approach certain issues. Here are some key areas in which tech experts say Harris could play a significant role.  While Harris was not vocal on breaking up tech giants, she is widely regarded as an early leader on consumer privacy issues, several experts said.  Her experience on privacy matters reemerged during a tense exchange with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg when he testified before the Senate in 2018. Harris pushed Zuckerberg to say whether Facebook had deliberately decided not to tell users about the Cambridge Analytica data breach when the social media giant learned about it.  In 2012, as California's attorney general, Harris hammered out an agreement with Apple, Google, and other tech platforms requiring them to let consumers access the privacy policies of apps before they download them. Later that year, she sent letters to dozens of app developers warning that they were not in compliance with California's privacy regulations and that they faced fines of up to $2,500 per violation.  Since then, California has passed one of the toughest data privacy laws in the nation, but there's still no federal privacy standard. Given Harris's congressional experience, she may serve as a critical link between the White House and Congress on privacy, said Susan Hintze, a privacy lawyer and partner at Hintze Law.  \"Many folks don't realize she built her political career championing privacy issues against the backdrop of the tech world,\" Hintze said. \"I suspect as VP she may continue that fight, and we may see more privacy initiatives at the federal level.\"  As a former attorney general and prosecutor, Harris is closely linked to law enforcement, and her record on policing has been deeply scrutinized during the Democratic primary.  For Silicon Valley, this aspect of Harris's record may represent the greatest source of uncertainty. As a senator, Harris supported a package of anti-sex trafficking bills known as SESTA/FOSTA, which many in the tech industry opposed because it watered down liability protections for online platforms. Biden has previously called for a complete repeal of those same protections, which were enshrined in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. It's an open question how a Vice President Harris might influence that agenda, given her previous vote.  Meanwhile, a top priority of the FBI and Justice Department has been accessing the encrypted communications of criminal suspects, an issue that's caused a rift between Washington and Silicon Valley; technologists argue giving police special access to read encrypted messages would weaken privacy and security for everyone.  Thus far, Harris has tried to walk a fine line on the matter. She avoided picking a side in the 2016 standoff between Apple and the FBI over unlocking the encrypted iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter. But as a potential decision-maker in a Biden administration, she may no longer have that luxury.  Harris may face similar quandaries over other technology issues related to policing. Facial recognition, artificial intelligence, drone surveillance \u2014 all of these are likely to become major issues Harris may need to weigh in on during a Biden administration.  Some experts say Harris is unlikely to be mired so deeply in specific policy issues and instead may play a larger role on big-picture topics like immigration, intellectual property and broadband access, which are also important to the tech industry.  These types of issues hew more closely to the overall task facing a potential Biden administration, which will be to continue managing the economic fallout from the pandemic.  \"How do we create a vibrant economy, and how do we make social justice in a world of remote everything?\" said Blair Levin, a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission. \"That'll probably be a fundamental tech issue in the next administration.\"  Get local news delivered to your inbox!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42829248684</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K9-2C31-JCSC-J545-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1214\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Pantagraph.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Kamala Harris ascending to become former Vice President Joe Biden's running mate, Silicon Valley can breathe a little easier, at least for now.   For nearly four years, top Democrats and Republicans have attacked the tech industry with allegations of antitrust violations, political bias and criticisms of how large online platforms handled privacy and misinformation. Biden himself is among Big Tech's harshest critics \u2014 needling Facebook over misinformation and political advertising, and calling for the repeal of a key legal shield for the industry. But his selection of Harris for vice president is already giving some who operate in and around the tech industry cause for optimism. A California senator whose constituency includes Silicon Valley, Harris has experience working on technology issues. Her connections to technology execs include powerful donors such as Amazon (AMZN) general counsel David Zapolsky and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. On Tuesday, Facebook (FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote that Harris's presumptive nomination \"is a huge moment for Black women and girls all over the world -- and for all of us.\" \"She's a great pick for the tech industry,\" said Matt Tanielian, co-founder of Franklin Square Group, a Washington-based lobbying firm that represents Apple (), Dropbox (DBX), eBay (EBAY) and others. \"Not because I think she's going to suddenly turn tech back into the darling it once was ... but she knows the issues really well. She's no pushover on any of the tough things.\" On perhaps the most pressing issue for the tech industry, Harris also stands in stark contrast to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, her onetime rival in the Democratic presidential race and another name on Biden's list of VP candidates. While Warren advocated for the breakup of tech giants like Amazon and Google (GOOGL), prompting other presidential candidates to do the same, Harris never endorsed the idea. \"I believe that the tech companies have got to be regulated in a way we can ensure, and the American consumer can be certain, that their privacy is not being compromised,\" Harris said when the New York Times directly asked if she thought Amazon, Facebook or Google should be broken up. On this particular issue, at least, it may not matter who the VP pick is, given the number of ongoing tech antitrust probes. \"The regulatory exposure is already very far along\" for the biggest tech giants, said Jason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, a publishers' trade group that's been heavily critical of Google and Facebook. \"And I think regardless of who the vice presidential candidate is, it's going to move at a rapid pace.\" Vice presidents may not always have the most direct impact on policies. And other candidates who were passed over, including Warren, could still have an impact if chosen for a cabinet role. Still, every VP pick sends a public message about how a potential administration might set priorities or approach certain issues. Here are some key areas in which tech experts say Harris could play a significant role. Privacy and data protection While Harris was not vocal on breaking up tech giants, she is widely regarded as an early leader on consumer privacy issues, several experts said. Her experience on privacy matters reemerged during a tense exchange with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg when he testified before the Senate in 2018. Harris pushed Zuckerberg to say whether Facebook had deliberately decided not to tell users about the Cambridge Analytica data breach when the social media giant learned about it. In 2012, as California's attorney general, Harris hammered out an agreement with Apple, Google, and other tech platforms requiring them to let consumers access the privacy policies of apps before they download them. Later that year, she sent letters to dozens of app developers warning that they were not in compliance with California's privacy regulations and that they faced fines of up to $2,500 per violation. Since then, California has passed one of the toughest data privacy laws in the nation, but there's still no federal privacy standard. Given Harris's congressional experience, she may serve as a critical link between the White House and Congress on privacy, said Susan Hintze, a privacy lawyer and partner at Hintze Law. \"Many folks don't realize she built her political career championing privacy issues against the backdrop of the tech world,\" Hintze said. \"I suspect as VP she may continue that fight, and we may see more privacy initiatives at the federal level.\" Encryption and law enforcement As a former attorney general and prosecutor, Harris is closely linked to law enforcement, and her record on policing has been deeply scrutinized during the Democratic primary. For Silicon Valley, this aspect of Harris's record may represent the greatest source of uncertainty. As a senator, Harris supported a package of anti-sex trafficking bills known as SESTA/FOSTA, which many in the tech industry opposed because it watered down liability protections for online platforms. Biden has previously called for a complete repeal of those same protections, which were enshrined in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. It's an open question how a Vice President Harris might influence that agenda, given her previous vote. Meanwhile, a top priority of the FBI and Justice Department has been accessing the encrypted communications of criminal suspects, an issue that's caused a rift between Washington and Silicon Valley; technologists argue giving police special access to read encrypted messages would weaken privacy and security for everyone. Thus far, Harris has tried to walk a fine line on the matter. She avoided picking a side in the 2016 standoff between Apple and the FBI over unlocking the encrypted iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter. But as a potential decision-maker in a Biden administration, she may no longer have that luxury. Harris may face similar quandaries over other technology issues related to policing. Facial recognition, artificial intelligence, drone surveillance \u2014 all of these are likely to become major issues Harris may need to weigh in on during a Biden administration. Remote work, immigration and good government Some experts say Harris is unlikely to be mired so deeply in specific policy issues and instead may play a larger role on big-picture topics like immigration, intellectual property and broadband access, which are also important to the tech industry. These types of issues hew more closely to the overall task facing a potential Biden administration, which will be to continue managing the economic fallout from the pandemic. \"How do we create a vibrant economy, and how do we make social justice in a world of remote everything?\" said Blair Levin, a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission. \"That'll probably be a fundamental tech issue in the next administration.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42822867920</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K6-K981-JCSC-J0R9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1197\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002E8X</classCode><className>EBAY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Kamala Harris has charted a meteoric rise within the Democratic Party as one of its most potent and effective messengers \u2013 even as she\u2019s struggled to refine her own positions on issues galvanizing the party\u2019s base.    The California senator joins Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign as a barrier-breaking running mate who has built a national following through her fierce interrogations of Trump administration officials and championing of racial justice. It\u2019s a resume that Harris\u2019 allies contend is tailor-made for the moment, as the 2020 race plays out against the backdrop of a widespread reckoning on race and a spiraling pandemic that\u2019s devastated communities of color.      But Harris\u2019 shifting positions on key policy matters undermined her short-lived run for the presidency. A former California attorney general and district attorney, Harris faced criticism over a prosecutorial record that doesn\u2019t always match with the progressive positions she espouses today. On health care, her waffling on \u201cMedicare for All\u201d during the presidential primary revealed a candidate torn between appealing to progressives demanding structural change and moderates favoring incrementalism \u2013 and satisfying none in the process.     \u201cIt took a little bit to get her footing,\u201d said Roger Salazar, a California Democratic strategist and former Clinton White House official, adding that the next few months will test how Harris learned from her stumbles on the campaign trail. \u201cGood leaders focus on the issues that are in front of them \u2026 and she\u2019s a quick study.\u201d    Here are major policy fights that have shaped Harris\u2019 political rise:   Racial and social justice   As both a former prosecutor and the lone Black woman in the Senate, Harris found herself at the center of a growing national debate over racial and social justice issues. Even as she has sought to cast herself as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor,\u201d her prosecutorial record has drawn scrutiny from progressives who derisively labeled her a \u201ccop\u201d during her presidential run.    That record included fighting to keep people in prison in certain cases where there was evidence of wrongful conviction and shying away from investigating police shootings. Though she\u2019s proclaimed herself a lifelong opponent of the death penalty, she earned the ire of many progressives when  as California\u2019s attorney general she appealed a judge\u2019s decision finding the death penalty unconstitutional .    Critics on the left said she didn\u2019t do enough to empty California\u2019s packed prisons, and they took issue with the way Harris touted her prosecution and conviction rates. Harris has argued she was successful in going after international gangs that trafficked in guns, drugs and humans \u2013 while promoting progressive policies like jobs and education programs for low-level offenders, rather than harsh prison sentences.    Harris in recent years cast herself as a chief proponent for overhauling a criminal justice system that has exacted a disproportionate toll on communities of color. During her presidential campaign, Harris pledged to eliminate private prisons and mandatory minimum sentences as part of a broad proposal to end mass incarceration, taking specific aim at policies that overwhelmingly target Black and brown Americans.    Harris recently has focused on addressing the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus and backed a new package of police reforms following the killing of George Floyd. She has supported a ban on evictions and foreclosures during the pandemic and proposed sending as much as $2,000 to people every month. She\u2019s also been among those urging the Trump administration provide more relief to minority groups disproportionately hurt by the virus.   Health care   Perhaps no issue was more damaging to Harris\u2019 presidential campaign than her fluctuating position on \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d As a Senate freshman and rising political star in 2017, she was among the first prominent Democrats to sign onto Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer bill, at the time calling it \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d    But during the Democratic primary, after initially doubling down on the idea of eliminating private insurance in favor of a government-run system, she quickly backtracked. Her poll numbers tumbled amid weeks of questions about her core beliefs on a topic that has singularly cleaved the party\u2019s liberal and moderate wings.    Harris ultimately pitched  her own solution that sought to split the difference: giving Americans the choice of enrolling in tightly regulated private health insurance plans or picking a public one. But the proposal only raised further misgivings about Harris\u2019 policy credentials and whether she had previously backed Medicare for All largely to score points with the Democratic base.    Since then, Harris has avoided weighing in on the coverage debate and has emphasized greater support for underserved communities amid a pandemic that she has warned has \u201cworsened longstanding disparities in our country.\u201d Harris is also among those calling for new investments to address the nation\u2019s maternal mortality crisis, which has left Black women three times as likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women.   Immigration   Even before her tough questioning of Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court nomination hearings, Harris already had built a reputation as a hard-nosed interrogator through her bouts with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration and homeland security officials.    Two years ago, she was a leading voice against the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating children at the border, joining protests at immigration shelters and advocating for expanded oversight of detention centers. She eventually become one of the highest-profile lawmakers to call for the resignation of then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen over family separations and detainment of pregnant immigrants.    As a presidential candidate, Harris  advocated for using executive powers to reinstate and expand the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and clarifying a path to citizenship for some Dreamers brought into the U.S. as children. It\u2019s an issue where she has often sought to distinguish herself even within the Democratic Party: Harris was one of just three Democrats to oppose a compromise that would have given the Trump administration billions of dollars for a border wall in exchange for a path to citizenship for Dreamers.   Big tech companies   More recently, Harris has been critical of Facebook and other social media companies' handling of political speech, hate speech and misinformation online. But like Biden, she's offered few proposals to address those issues. She\u2019s also taken a more moderate stance on antitrust concerns, stopping short of embracing Elizabeth Warren\u2019s call to break up tech giants \u2013 though she\u2019s advocated for closer scrutiny from regulators.    When she was attorney general of a tech-heavy state, Harris played a central role in the fight against online sex harassment, pressing tech companies to make their platforms safer and advocating for greater leeway to prosecute cybercrimes. That  effort culminated , most notably, in the arrest of the heads of Backpage.com over allegations that the classified ad website had knowingly become a hub for online prostitution. The case aided Harris\u2019 political rise in the months leading up to her election to the Senate in 2016, even as it ultimately faltered and was thrown out on its merits.    Once in the Senate, she played a far less visible role in controversial legislation aimed at cracking down on illegal sex trafficking online. She ultimately supported the bill, drawing sharp criticism from those who argued it would do little to protect sex workers while creating new avenues for censorship on the internet.   Consumer protection   As California attorney general, her role in  securing a $25-billion settlement for California homeowners from big mortgage firms cemented her stature as a fierce consumer advocate in the wake of the devastating 2008 foreclosure crisis. Harris\u2019 record as California\u2019s top law enforcement official included prosecution of predatory lenders, protections for those hammered by student debt, and taking a tough stance on online consumer privacy issues.   Other progressive issues   Harris has long enjoyed the support of the Democratic base\u2019s most activist women, labor and LGBTQ advocates for her stalwart backing of some signature issues. Those have included abortion rights, enforcement of California\u2019s landmark climate change initiatives, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and the protection of marriage equality and LGBTQ rights.

By ADAM CANCRYN and CARLA MARINUCCI    08/11/2020 04:53 PM EDT      Kamala Harris has charted a meteoric rise within the Democratic Party as one of its most potent and effective messengers \u2014 even as she\u2019s struggled to refine her own positions on issues galvanizing the party\u2019s base.    The California senator joins Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign as a barrier-breaking running mate who has built a national following through her fierce interrogations of Trump administration officials and championing of racial justice. It\u2019s a resume that Harris\u2019 allies contend is tailor-made for the moment, as the 2020 race plays out against the backdrop of a widespread reckoning on race and a spiraling pandemic that\u2019s devastated communities of color.    But Harris\u2019 shifting positions on key policy matters undermined her short-lived run for the presidency. A former California attorney general and district attorney, Harris faced criticism over a prosecutorial record that doesn\u2019t always match with the progressive positions she espouses today. On health care, her waffling on \u201cMedicare for All\u201d during the presidential primary revealed a candidate torn between appealing to progressives demanding structural change and moderates favoring incrementalism \u2014 and satisfying none in the process.    \u201cIt took a little bit to get her footing,\u201d said Roger Salazar, a California Democratic strategist and former Clinton White House official, adding that the next few months will test how Harris learned from her stumbles on the campaign trail. \u201cGood leaders focus on the issues that are in front of them \u2026 and she\u2019s a quick study.\u201d    Here are major policy fights that have shaped Harris\u2019 political rise:   Racial and social justice    As both a former prosecutor and the lone Black woman in the Senate, Harris found herself at the center of a growing national debate over racial and social justice issues. Even as she has sought to cast herself as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor,\u201d her prosecutorial record has drawn scrutiny from progressives who derisively labeled her a \u201ccop\u201d during her presidential run.    That record included fighting to keep people in prison in certain cases where there was evidence of wrongful conviction and shying away from investigating police shootings. Though she\u2019s proclaimed herself a lifelong opponent of the death penalty, she earned the ire of many progressives when as California\u2019s attorney general she appealed a judge\u2019s decision finding the death penalty unconstitutional .    Critics on the left said she didn\u2019t do enough to empty California\u2019s packed prisons, and they took issue with the way Harris touted her prosecution and conviction rates. Harris has argued she was successful in going after international gangs that trafficked in guns, drugs and humans \u2014 while promoting progressive policies like jobs and education programs for low-level offenders, rather than harsh prison sentences.    Harris in recent years cast herself as a chief proponent for overhauling a criminal justice system that has exacted a disproportionate toll on communities of color. During her presidential campaign, Harris pledged to eliminate private prisons and mandatory minimum sentences as part of a broad proposal to end mass incarceration, taking specific aim at policies that overwhelmingly target Black and brown Americans.    Harris recently has focused on addressing the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus and backed a new package of police reforms following the killing of George Floyd. She has supported a ban on evictions and foreclosures during the pandemic and proposed sending as much as $2,000 to people every month. She\u2019s also been among those urging the Trump administration provide more relief to minority groups disproportionately hurt by the virus.   Health care    Perhaps no issue was more damaging to Harris\u2019 presidential campaign than her fluctuating position on Medicare for All. As a Senate freshman and rising political star in 2017, she was among the first prominent Democrats to sign onto Bernie Sanders \u2019 single-payer bill, at the time calling it \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d    But during the Democratic primary, after initially doubling down on the idea of eliminating private insurance in favor of a government-run system, she quickly backtracked. Her poll numbers tumbled amid weeks of questions about her core beliefs on a topic that has singularly cleaved the party\u2019s liberal and moderate wings.    Harris ultimately pitched her own solution that sought to split the difference: giving Americans the choice of enrolling in tightly regulated private health insurance plans or picking a public one. But the proposal only raised further misgivings about Harris\u2019 policy credentials and whether she had previously backed Medicare for All largely to score points with the Democratic base.    Since then, Harris has avoided weighing in on the coverage debate and has emphasized greater support for underserved communities amid a pandemic that she has warned has \u201cworsened longstanding disparities in our country.\u201d Harris is also among those calling for new investments to address the nation\u2019s maternal mortality crisis, which has left Black women three times as likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women.   Immigration    Even before her tough questioning of Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court nomination hearings, Harris already had built a reputation as a hard-nosed interrogator through her bouts with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration and homeland security officials.    Two years ago, she was a leading voice against the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating children at the border, joining protests at immigration shelters and advocating for expanded oversight of detention centers. She eventually become one of the highest-profile lawmakers to call for the resignation of then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen over family separations and detainment of pregnant immigrants.    As a presidential candidate, Harris advocated for using executive powers to reinstate and expand the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and clarifying a path to citizenship for some Dreamers brought into the U.S. as children. It\u2019s an issue where she has often sought to distinguish herself even within the Democratic Party: Harris was one of just three Democrats to oppose a compromise that would have given the Trump administration billions of dollars for a border wall in exchange for a path to citizenship for Dreamers.   Big tech companies    More recently, Harris has been critical of Facebook and other social media companies' handling of political speech, hate speech and misinformation online. But like Biden, she's offered few proposals to address those issues. She\u2019s also taken a more moderate stance on antitrust concerns, stopping short of embracing Elizabeth Warren \u2019s call to break up tech giants \u2014 though she\u2019s advocated for closer scrutiny from regulators.    When she was attorney general of a tech-heavy state, Harris played a central role in the fight against online sex harassment, pressing tech companies to make their platforms safer and advocating for greater leeway to prosecute cybercrimes. That effort culminated , most notably, in the arrest of the heads of Backpage.com over allegations that the classified ad website had knowingly become a hub for online prostitution. The case aided Harris\u2019 political rise in the months leading up to her election to the Senate in 2016, even as it ultimately faltered and was thrown out on its merits.    Once in the Senate, she played a far less visible role in controversial legislation aimed at cracking down on illegal sex trafficking online. She ultimately supported the bill, drawing sharp criticism from those who argued it would do little to protect sex workers while creating new avenues for censorship on the internet.   Consumer protection    As California attorney general, her role in securing a $25-billion settlement for California homeowners from big mortgage firms cemented her stature as a fierce consumer advocate in the wake of the devastating 2008 foreclosure crisis. Harris\u2019 record as California\u2019s top law enforcement official included prosecution of predatory lenders, protections for those hammered by student debt, and taking a tough stance on online consumer privacy issues.   Other progressive issues    Harris has long enjoyed the support of the Democratic base\u2019s most activist women, labor and LGBTQ advocates for her stalwart backing of some signature issues. Those have included abortion rights, enforcement of California\u2019s landmark climate change initiatives, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and the protection of marriage equality and LGBTQ rights.

None would have even considered North America, and yet it is the United States that today produces the plurality of world GDP with less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. How did that happen? In the excellent new book \u201cCapitalism in America: A History\u201d Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge provide the answer. Adrian recently joined me on the show to discuss his book, American and world economic history more broadly, and the lessons voters and policymakers should draw today. </p><p>Adrian Wooldridge is the political editor and Bagehot columnist at The Economist and the author of \u201cMeasuring the Mind: Education and Psychology in England, 1860\u20131990.\u201d You can follow him on Twitter @adwooldridge. What follows is a lightly-edited transcript of our conversation. You can download the episode by clicking the link above, and don \u2019t forget to subscribe to my podcast on iTunes or Stitcher. Tell your friends, leave a review. Your book is fantastic. I liked it quite a bit and wrote a mini-review of it on the AEI website. It opens with an interesting thought experiment. Imagine if there was a Davos meeting back in 1620, and all the members made their case for which country or region would be the most influential and dominate the global economy over the coming centuries. Nobody would have pointed to America, which at that point was a bit of a wilderness, but obviously we\u2019ve done pretty well over the past four centuries. I always like to give alternate titles when we have authors on this podcast, and an alternate title to your book \u2014 not necessarily a better title \u2014 would have been \u201cWhat Made America Great.\u201d What did we do right in the United States that the rest of the world missed? \u201cWhat Made America Great: The Economics of American Greatness\u201d would have been a very, very good title. We chose \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d because we wanted to echo Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s great book \u201cDemocracy in America.\u201d And because we think if you\u2019re going to define the essence of American genius, democracy is one way to do it, but I think capitalism is the other way to do it. And indeed defining what made America great is really what this book is all about. We try and answer two questions. Why is America great? Why did America become the great power that nobody expected that it would be in 1620? And secondly, can it preserve its greatness? Can it preserve its economic preeminence? And we say that the driving force behind American greatness is that America has a greater toleration for creative destruction than any other power on Earth, than any other economy on Earth: that it\u2019s less worried about destruction, and that it\u2019s better at creation. And the combination of tolerance for destruction and genius for creation creates higher levels of productivity. So that\u2019s our description of what\u2019s going on. The question is why. Why does America have this tolerance for creative destruction? And we say it\u2019s partly because of the size of the country; that it\u2019s a huge canvas for people to work on. And whereas European countries tend to be very crowded and tend to have lots of people impinging upon each other, America for a lot of its history had a huge amount of open space. It\u2019s secondly about its timing. It was the first country to be born in the era of capitalism, in the era of business. It was basically created at the same time as Adam Smith wrote the greatest work of capitalist economics, \u201cThe Wealth of Nations.\u201d And it was a country that didn\u2019t have the sort of hangover of feudal traditions that France had, Britain had, or indeed Germany had. So it was born a business civilization in a business world. So those are our biggest reasons. The other reason, of course, is the Constitution \u2014 which of course has to do with when it was born \u2014 that America\u2019s Constitution put a limit on the power of government, ascribed certain rights and liberties to individuals which were inviolable, and even put right at the center the notion of property, and indeed intellectual property. And this Constitution provided defenses for business and individual entrepreneurs, restraints on the power of government, and I think has been one of America\u2019s most important weapons over the years against stagnation. So those are the preconditions. Then we go on to talk about the importance of America\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit: the way that America regards businessman as heroes. In Britain, people tend to defer to aristocrats; they tend to want to be aristocrats. They tend to want to live this Downton Abbey life. The French like the idea of intellectuals, of being Jean-Paul Sartre or some sort of philosopher sitting on the Left Bank and meditating on the meaning of life. The Germans revere scholars and the scholarly life. In America, the highest thing that you can be really is a great entrepreneur. And that spirit is one of the constants in American history; you can see it in the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s. You can also see it in Silicon Valley today. There\u2019s no country, I think, that has the same reverence for entrepreneurs. It\u2019s stunning how that attitude remains. I write quite a bit about why we don\u2019t see successful tech companies in Europe as we do in the United States. Although there are many reasons for that difference, in Europe they seem much more interested in regulating these companies than creating their own. The picture you just outlined there is one I\u2019m highly sympathetic to; I love hearing that we\u2019re a business-admiring civilization. It\u2019s a combination of our instincts and our attitude, our tolerance for dynamism and churn in the economy, and that explains why we went from hugging a sliver of the east coast to being this very successful, continent-spanning country. But what is the alternate theory? Because I think some people would say that you have given a very pleasing version that folks like myself like, but there\u2019s an alternate theory that could argue the US got great just because we had so many natural resources to begin with. We have these two oceans protecting us from war on either side of our country. We had slavery for many years. They would point to a lot of other reasons. How much merit is there in some of these counterarguments? The counterargument of having an abundance of natural resources is not a negligible counterargument. When we start this book, we note that Americans were under British rule, some of the richest people on Earth. They were taller on average than people back in England. They had forests. They had fish. They had game. They were surrounded by natural resources, and they had access to natural resources in a way that people didn\u2019t back in England, didn\u2019t back in Europe, because they were in a continent that was sparsely populated at the time. So there is some truth in that. Another rival theory, of course, is that the government played a vital role in creating American prosperity, and that it used a system of tariffs to protect America\u2019s infant industries from European competition. It\u2019s a very popular theory. I can tell you that whenever I approach this topic, if I\u2019m writing about it on social media, that is the number one response. I either get a response saying it was basically because of exploitation and slavery, but more popular than that is protectionism and tariffs really made America the world\u2019s leading economy by 1900. Let me tell you why it\u2019s wrong. It is a powerful theory, and you can ascribe the genius of Alexander Hamilton \u2014 you can say Hamilton was one of your supporters now, and he did, of course, talk about infant industries. Sure. The problem with the theory is first that the tariffs were a way of raising revenue. Indeed, for much of America\u2019s history, they were the only way of raising revenue. They were principally regarded as a revenue-raising device rather than a device for government policy. I don\u2019t think they were any coherent, well-thought-out government policy for protecting the steel industry or protecting the oil industry. There was an ad hoc policy of raising revenues because you didn\u2019t have any other access to revenues. And I think the most important thing about America was not that it erected tariffs to British steel or other British products. It was that it was the world\u2019s biggest coherent internal market. It is not a story of external barriers \u2014 An internal market without tariffs! Yeah, and then if you look at the steel industry, if you look at the rise of Carnegie and the US steel industry in the second half of the 19th century, I think it\u2019s very hard to argue that was because you had tariffs against British steel. It\u2019s because you had, partly, natural resources, of course, and you could bring those factors of production together very easily, in the form of coal, in the form of the iron ore. But it\u2019s also a matter of the organizational genius of Carnegie. Carnegie saw the importance of steel \u2014 how we could have a steel-based economy \u2014 and he saw the way that various innovations in the production of steel, like the Bessemer process, could be seized to improve productivity. And he also saw the way that scale would be vital, and he outmaneuvered and outcompeted the British steel industry by an incredible degree. I mean, that made the existence of tariffs irrelevant. He reduced the cost of steel production by about 90 percent between 1870 and 1900 and swamped the British steel industry. So I don\u2019t think tariffs explain it. I don\u2019t think they were part of a coherent industrial strategy, and I don\u2019t think they account for the sheer organizational dynamism and genius of America. And again with oil, I think that\u2019s the same thing. You just have in the United States \u2014 I was talking about the importance of entrepreneurial genius, but the other sort of genius is the corporate genius, the genius for creating corporations, which is not individualistic things. In corporations, the ways of bringing people together for a common activity, they\u2019re sort of communal, private-sector communal organizations. And America was the first country to free corporations from the dictates of the state. Early corporations, to get limited liability, you had to be willing to build a canal or do something very specific. America was the first country to free those corporations, and it was the first country to allow corporations to grow on a gigantic scale. So, I can see the appeal of the infant-industry arguments; I don\u2019t think it works. And again, I can see that \u2014 a lot of people also talk about the importance of government after the Second World War in keeping America going. And I think it was not irrelevant. But what strikes me as interesting is what government didn\u2019t do, rather than what it did do, after the Second World War. It didn\u2019t nationalize industries in the way that the British government and many other European governments do. It didn\u2019t try to control and plan higher education in the way that lots of other countries do, did at the time. It kept out of the way much more than European governments. It seems to me that people have a bout of economic nostalgia in this country and they look for other periods of prosperity as showing another way to run an economy. They point to the tariffs in the late 19th century to say tariffs were why America got rich, and then they\u2019ll also point to the immediate post-war decades as a sign that you can run a different kind of economy: You don\u2019t need to have this globalist economy, you can have an economy of strong unions, high taxes, and the economy did just find the 1950s and 1960s. So perhaps that should be the model for today. Sure, and it is quite interesting that the interventionist positions one associates with a lot of people on the left like Michael Lind have also been taken up by many people on the right with the rise of Trumpism. But again, if you look at many of the industries that were dominant in the post-war period, they become very decadent very quickly when they\u2019re divorced from global competition. And you can look at the car industry, and you can look at the steel industry; both those industries ceased to innovate, ceased to be very productive, and became very self-indulgent. That may have been quite good for a car worker, but it certainly wasn\u2019t very good for consumers. They actually start producing much better products after they\u2019re subjected to global competition. The American car industry, thanks to competition from Japan and Germany, is in a much better position than it was in the 1960s and 1970s. And remember, the left at that time was very critical of the car industry because it was an oligopoly and because a lot of the cars were unsafe. And people talk about stable manufacturing jobs now, but people at that point complained that manufacturing jobs were very tedious. The rise of Japanese production systems has done a lot to make manufacturing both more efficient and better for the work. Economic nostalgia manifests itself in a variety of ways, as you\u2019re aware. You wrote a book called \u201cCapitalism in America,\u201d and a lot of people think capitalism is broken in this country and also in other advanced economies. And some of them will make the argument that capitalism was broken before in the early 1900s with the rise of very big corporations, and now just as then we need to break up these large companies. They\u2019re too dominant. They\u2019re bad for growth. They have too much corporate power. They have to go. What do you make of that argument? One of the interesting things we note in this book is that the loss of faith in America is a repeated thing throughout American history. You saw it in the late 19th and early 20th century when people began to think that capitalism was crushing workers. You saw it in the 1930s when we had the Great Depression. You saw it in the 1970s when you had stagflation and, as I was saying earlier, when you had lots of big American industries just not competing very well with foreign industries. And after each of these cycles of disillusionment you\u2019ve seen very impressive resurgences in the United States. In the 1920s, productivity growth I think was probably at its highest point in American history, and you had a huge democratization of large numbers of innovations. You have the 1950s, the Golden Age of American growth. And you have the 1980s when America was regaining its dominance in the industries which are redefining the world, primarily computers and later the internet. So America has an extraordinary degree of genius for reinvention, thanks to creative destruction. I think it\u2019s willing to just seize on new opportunities, and there is no other country I can think of in the world that has been at the frontier of industrial development or economic development in the ways America has for the same length of time. America has basically been at the frontier since the 1860s in steel, in electricity, in oil, in consumer goods, and then in computers and electronics. But certainly there are many concerns that we\u2019re at the frontier, but we may not be at the frontier for much longer. China, with all of its people and money and ability to collect data, will surpass America\u2019s position at the technological frontier by the century\u2019s end. Do you agree with that? The first argument in this book is America has been the world\u2019s and is the world\u2019s preeminent economic power because of its willingness to embrace creative destruction. The second argument in this book is that America\u2019s willingness to embrace creative destruction is on the decline and that its position as the world\u2019s great innovator and great economic power is under threat more seriously than at any time probably in its history. If you look at various indices, you can see growing stagnation; fading dynamism is the phrase that we use. If you look at company creation, it is at a historical low. If you look at geographical mobility, it\u2019s low. If you look at the burden of regulations, it\u2019s unbelievably high. If you look at large swathes of industries, America\u2019s being surpassed by China. And if you look at workforce participation, you\u2019ve got a huge problem with men falling out of the workforce and becoming economically unproductive, as AEI has highlighted brilliantly. So indices that America used to dominate, like having the most graduates and by far the most educated population in the world, are beginning to fall down. So all sorts of indicators are flashing red. You\u2019re arguing we need to return to the American model: Don\u2019t regulate or tax away creative destruction and make sure we continue to be a global talent magnet. But the China argument is there is another model that works. Their model is not necessarily a creative destruction model. It\u2019s that government is smart enough to understand what the industries of the future broadly are, and they can just shove a lot of money at those industries and that\u2019ll work. Because inherent in these concerns about China is that, for the first time ever, this new model of state capitalism can at least rival America\u2019s if not surpass us. Absolutely. I mean that is the argument. But what we\u2019re trying to do in this book is expose the reasons why America became great in the first place and suggest that the way of remaining in the lead is to recover and return to those comparative advantages. The biggest threats to America\u2019s position come not from anything that\u2019s fundamentally wrong with business culture or fundamentally wrong with the economy; it comes from poor government policies having to do with entitlements, regulations, and poor financial sector management. We need to address those so this sort of unique genius of America for creative destruction can once more express itself. Now, I think China in particular, and state capitalism in particular, is the biggest single challenge that America has ever been faced with. Partly because state capitalism is quite clever. It\u2019s much cleverer than the pure socialism of SovietRussia because it tries to merge the best features of capitalism with the best features of statism in its mind. And partly because the Chinese economy simply is so big that we haven\u2019t seen anything on this scale before. State capitalism basically tries to use the genius of entrepreneurs and use the genius of companies in a way that is sort of guided by the state but isn\u2019t completely dominated by the state, and that is a very interesting model. It\u2019s a very exciting model in many ways, but it\u2019s so far not demonstrated an ability to innovate. It has demonstrated an ability to be a fast follower, and while it has demonstrated an ability to create some impressive companies, it hasn\u2019t yet demonstrated an ability to discipline those companies when they get too big and too dominant. They throw a lot of resources at that those leading companies, but they tend to reduce the efficiency of the use of those resources over time. I now have three big books of economic history on my bookshelf. I have \u201cCapitalism in America.\u201d I have the new Douglas Irwin book on trade, \u201cClashing over Commerce.\u201d And I have the Robert Gordon book, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of American Growth.\u201d Gordon reviewed your book in the Financial Times, and he was at least mildly critical, particularly about your focus on entitlements and how that\u2019s crowding out productive investments. Where do you and Robert Gordon differ? Well, first of all, let me say I think Robert Gordon\u2019s book on the rise and fall of American growth is an extremely impressive book. We used it a lot in our book; we were inspired and guided by it to some extent, and it\u2019s full of fantastic facts. Our problem with that book is that we weren\u2019t persuaded by his central thesis: that there is something about the modern high-tech, internet-based economy that means that growth is slower. And he thinks that the overall impact of the current wave of technological innovations is less than previous technological innovations; we\u2019re getting less of a boost from the average living standards of the workers. They affect a narrower range of activities, and they have less knock-on effects. I think that\u2019s wrong. I think that the knock-on effects of the internet revolution are going to get bigger and bigger and bigger as more and more things are attached to the internet, as we get intelligent houses and intelligent machines and intelligent infrastructure. As the world is increasingly linked to the internet, I think that the impact of the internet revolution is going to get bigger. I would liken what\u2019s happening now to what happened with electricity. Electricity was used to light houses in the 1890s and even before. So the great mystery was then, why isn\u2019t electricity improving productivity? Why wasn\u2019t it being harnessed by the manufacturing sector and by companies? It wasn\u2019t for a long time. But then in the 1920s it begins to have a big effect because people start redesigning factories and the production processes to take advantage of electricity. And it suddenly begins to have a big effect on productivity. And I think that we may see exactly the same thing with IT. Gordon\u2019s argument is that we can do a lot of right things policy-wise, but even if we do all the right things, the nature of technological advance and progress is that we won\u2019t get the same results as in the past because all the easy things have been done, like combustion engines and electrification. VR goggles just aren\u2019t going to have the same impact. I tend to agree with you that he\u2019s underestimating the potential big impact of general technologies like AI. I mean, he may be right, but I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. What we argue is that nothing about the nature of the current general purpose technology means it won\u2019t have the same impact as the last. What we have is problems with policy. And when you have problems with policy, that\u2019s a good thing and a bad thing. It\u2019s a good thing because you can get better policies, but it is a bad thing because the nature of American politics at the moment is that it is very hard for people to agree on policy changes. Another thing Gordon argues is that the growth that we do generate will be unequally shared, and therefore, even though we continue to generate growth, only a small sliver of the population will get it. And so another one of his criticisms is that you really did not get into the inequality argument, which some economists argue is the premier issue facing the economy. Even though we can generate growth, it won\u2019t be shared as equally as in the past, and that is a feature of the modern economy. It is sort of a new Gilded Age argument. I have two responses to that. One is to quote Schumpeter, who I like. He said famously that Elizabeth I had silk stockings, and the genius of capitalism is not to provide queens with millions and millions of silk stockings, but to make sure that something that was once reserved for queens can be purchased by shop girls. Capitalism makes basic products much, much, much cheaper. Things that were once luxuries become common goods. We are seeing that happen with smartphones now, which were once luxury goods, and now almost everybody has them. We can see this with access to libraries of information via the internet. Things that only the most privileged people on Earth could get access to now we have at our fingertips. So technology is reducing the costs of all sorts of things. Now where that hasn\u2019t happened is with college education and health care. The great riddle of why American wages have been stagnant has a lot to do with the fact that more and more of people\u2019s paychecks are being eaten up by rising costs of education and health care. The cost of buying a television or computer is going down vastly, but the cost of sending your children to a good university is going up. So it may be the case that we can apply the genius of capitalism to sophisticated service goods. I would also say that the fact that Bill Gates is very rich or Steve Jobs was very rich or Jeff Bezos is incredibly rich doesn\u2019t really worry me because those fortunes are in some sense signs that they\u2019re producing, as it were, the silk stockings for more and more and more people. What does worry me is the role of rent-seeking in the modern capitalist economy: the role of cronyism and the role of political connections and the way that big corporations preserve their positions by sticking it to the competition. Do you think the big tech companies qualify at this point? I think they\u2019re beginning to qualify. There was a cycle in the late 19th century, where the great companies produced by, let\u2019s say, Andrew Carnegie went from being incredibly innovative to being stable and cultivating political connections. If you look at the rise of US Steel after about 1903 it just stopped innovating to the same degree that Carnegie had been innovating. And I\u2019m worried that the tech companies have gone through that cycle faster, that they\u2019ve now become very defensive operations. If you look at the number of lawyers that they employ and PR people they employ versus the number of pure tech people they employ, that worries me. As we finish up, obviously I have to bring up the role of the Fed and monetary policy given that your co-author is Alan Greenspan. One of the policy solutions you suggest is making banks safer, making them hold bigger capital cushions. You are saying that if you like capitalism, it is really good to avoid these big financial crises that cause people to begin thinking capitalism doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019re just 10 years after the Great Recession and a great financial crisis. But yet you feel that the problem has not been fixed, and there is still a vulnerability in the US financial system that could lead to another financial crisis down the road. I think finance is sort of like creative destruction on steroids. It tends to speed up creation if you can allocate money very efficiently and ruthlessly; the financial system is ruthless. But also it tends to overshoot on the destructive side, and when you get things like the financial crisis in 2008, it\u2019s almost purely destructive. And what you have to do is have a system which doesn\u2019t hinder the creative side and the ability of financial companies to innovate and allocate money in intelligent and sometimes counterintuitive ways, but which also doesn\u2019t allow financial institutions to become almost voluntary. I mean, what happened with financial institutions is that they\u2019re playing with other people\u2019s money, and when that game goes wrong, then the state comes and bails them out and that\u2019s not anything that\u2019s desirable or healthy. And our way we try to deal with this is to say Dodd-Frank is much too prescriptive, much too big, and much too regulation-obsessed. There is a much simpler way of dealing with these problems, and that\u2019s to force banks to keep much bigger capital cushions than they do, and they\u2019ve been very resistant to that. The capital cushions are a bit bigger than they were just before the crisis, but they\u2019re not, in our view, anywhere big enough. So if they are going to play, they should be playing with their own money, not with yours and mine in a way that creates disillusionment with the whole system. Were you and Chairman Greenspan in complete agreement about the role of monetary policy over the past hundred years and the successes and failures of the Fed? It\u2019s his bag, not my bag. I defer to his judgment on all of those things. But I would say we were in agreement on those things. I think that our biggest disagreement probably came over the role of FDR because I think that FDR understood that combating recessions or depressions is about mood and politics. So I think I have a more sunny view of FDR than Chairman Greenspan probably. To wrap up, you are focused on financial stability and on fiscal solvency going forward. But is there any other area of recommendation that you give policymakers if you want to keep America as a high-growth, technological frontier kind of economy? Yeah, I\u2019m incredibly worried about the growth of crony capitalism and the intimate connections between big corporations and big government. And that\u2019s something that both parties are guilty of, and I think that the revolving door between the Democrats and the Obama administration and the big tech companies is just as worrying as the connections between the Republican Party and various Main Street companies. And protectionism makes that massively more likely. Although we\u2019ve argued in this book that America has a genius for business and that it likes corporations and entrepreneurs and gives them a lot of freedom is wonderful, what you have to understand in the end is what you really need is free, competitive markets. If businessmen become too powerful and too entrenched and too chummy with governments or political parties, that\u2019s a sign that dynamism is going to be threatened. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-RLPMN959945320181103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TMV-TND1-DXCW-D3TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4847\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 3, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RFI</classCode><className>AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC8733 NONCOMMERCIAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

None would have even considered North America, and yet it is the United States that today produces the plurality of world GDP with less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. How did that happen? In the excellent new book \u201cCapitalism in America: A History\u201d Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge provide the answer. Adrian recently joined me on the show to discuss his book, American and world economic history more broadly, and the lessons voters and policymakers should draw today. </p><p>Adrian Wooldridge is the political editor and Bagehot columnist at The Economist and the author of \u201cMeasuring the Mind: Education and Psychology in England, 1860\u20131990.\u201d You can follow him on Twitter @adwooldridge. What follows is a lightly-edited transcript of our conversation. You can download the episode by clicking the link above, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe to my podcast on iTunes or Stitcher. Tell your friends, leave a review. Your book is fantastic. I liked it quite a bit and wrote a mini-review of it on the AEI website. It opens with an interesting thought experiment. Imagine if there was a Davos meeting back in 1620, and all the members made their case for which country or region would be the most influential and dominate the global economy over the coming centuries. Nobody would have pointed to America, which at that point was a bit of a wilderness, but obviously we\u2019ve done pretty well over the past four centuries. I always like to give alternate titles when we have authors on this podcast, and an alternate title to your book \u2014 not necessarily a better title \u2014 would have been \u201cWhat Made America Great.\u201d What did we do right in the United States that the rest of the world missed? \u201cWhat Made America Great: The Economics of American Greatness\u201d would have been a very, very good title. We chose \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d because we wanted to echo Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s great book \u201cDemocracy in America.\u201d And because we think if you\u2019re going to define the essence of American genius, democracy is one way to do it, but I think capitalism is the other way to do it. And indeed defining what made America great is really what this book is all about. We try and answer two questions. Why is America great? Why did America become the great power that nobody expected that it would be in 1620? And secondly, can it preserve its greatness? Can it preserve its economic preeminence? And we say that the driving force behind American greatness is that America has a greater toleration for creative destruction than any other power on Earth, than any other economy on Earth: that it\u2019s less worried about destruction, and that it\u2019s better at creation. And the combination of tolerance for destruction and genius for creation creates higher levels of productivity. So that\u2019s our description of what\u2019s going on. The question is why. Why does America have this tolerance for creative destruction? And we say it\u2019s partly because of the size of the country; that it\u2019s a huge canvas for people to work on. And whereas European countries tend to be very crowded and tend to have lots of people impinging upon each other, America for a lot of its history had a huge amount of open space. It\u2019s secondly about its timing. It was the first country to be born in the era of capitalism, in the era of business. It was basically created at the same time as Adam Smith wrote the greatest work of capitalist economics, \u201cThe Wealth of Nations.\u201d And it was a country that didn\u2019t have the sort of hangover of feudal traditions that France had, Britain had, or indeed Germany had. So it was born a business civilization in a business world. So those are our biggest reasons. The other reason, of course, is the Constitution \u2014 which of course has to do with when it was born \u2014 that America\u2019s Constitution put a limit on the power of government, ascribed certain rights and liberties to individuals which were inviolable, and even put right at the center the notion of property, and indeed intellectual property. And this Constitution provided defenses for business and individual entrepreneurs, restraints on the power of government, and I think has been one of America\u2019s most important weapons over the years against stagnation. So those are the preconditions. Then we go on to talk about the importance of America\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit: the way that America regards businessman as heroes. In Britain, people tend to defer to aristocrats; they tend to want to be aristocrats. They tend to want to live this Downton Abbey life. The French like the idea of intellectuals, of being Jean-Paul Sartre or some sort of philosopher sitting on the Left Bank and meditating on the meaning of life. The Germans revere scholars and the scholarly life. In America, the highest thing that you can be really is a great entrepreneur. And that spirit is one of the constants in American history; you can see it in the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s. You can also see it in Silicon Valley today. There\u2019s no country, I think, that has the same reverence for entrepreneurs. It\u2019s stunning how that attitude remains. I write quite a bit about why we don\u2019t see successful tech companies in Europe as we do in the United States. Although there are many reasons for that difference, in Europe they seem much more interested in regulating these companies than creating their own. The picture you just outlined there is one I\u2019m highly sympathetic to; I love hearing that we\u2019re a business-admiring civilization. It\u2019s a combination of our instincts and our attitude, our tolerance for dynamism and churn in the economy, and that explains why we went from hugging a sliver of the east coast to being this very successful, continent-spanning country. But what is the alternate theory? Because I think some people would say that you have given a very pleasing version that folks like myself like, but there\u2019s an alternate theory that could argue the US got great just because we had so many natural resources to begin with. We have these two oceans protecting us from war on either side of our country. We had slavery for many years. They would point to a lot of other reasons. How much merit is there in some of these counterarguments? The counterargument of having an abundance of natural resources is not a negligible counterargument. When we start this book, we note that Americans were under British rule, some of the richest people on Earth. They were taller on average than people back in England. They had forests. They had fish. They had game. They were surrounded by natural resources, and they had access to natural resources in a way that people didn\u2019t back in England, didn\u2019t back in Europe, because they were in a continent that was sparsely populated at the time. So there is some truth in that. Another rival theory, of course, is that the government played a vital role in creating American prosperity, and that it used a system of tariffs to protect America\u2019s infant industries from European competition. It\u2019s a very popular theory. I can tell you that whenever I approach this topic, if I\u2019m writing about it on social media, that is the number one response. I either get a response saying it was basically because of exploitation and slavery, but more popular than that is protectionism and tariffs really made America the world\u2019s leading economy by 1900. Let me tell you why it\u2019s wrong. It is a powerful theory, and you can ascribe the genius of Alexander Hamilton \u2014 you can say Hamilton was one of your supporters now, and he did, of course, talk about infant industries. Sure. The problem with the theory is first that the tariffs were a way of raising revenue. Indeed, for much of America\u2019s history, they were the only way of raising revenue. They were principally regarded as a revenue-raising device rather than a device for government policy. I don\u2019t think they were any coherent, well-thought-out government policy for protecting the steel industry or protecting the oil industry. There was an ad hoc policy of raising revenues because you didn\u2019t have any other access to revenues. And I think the most important thing about America was not that it erected tariffs to British steel or other British products. It was that it was the world\u2019s biggest coherent internal market. It is not a story of external barriers \u2014 An internal market without tariffs! Yeah, and then if you look at the steel industry, if you look at the rise of Carnegie and the US steel industry in the second half of the 19th century, I think it\u2019s very hard to argue that was because you had tariffs against British steel. It\u2019s because you had, partly, natural resources, of course, and you could bring those factors of production together very easily, in the form of coal, in the form of the iron ore. But it\u2019s also a matter of the organizational genius of Carnegie. Carnegie saw the importance of steel \u2014 how we could have a steel-based economy \u2014 and he saw the way that various innovations in the production of steel, like the Bessemer process, could be seized to improve productivity. And he also saw the way that scale would be vital, and he outmaneuvered and outcompeted the British steel industry by an incredible degree. I mean, that made the existence of tariffs irrelevant. He reduced the cost of steel production by about 90 percent between 1870 and 1900 and swamped the British steel industry. So I don\u2019t think tariffs explain it. I don\u2019t think they were part of a coherent industrial strategy, and I don\u2019t think they account for the sheer organizational dynamism and genius of America. And again with oil, I think that\u2019s the same thing. You just have in the United States \u2014 I was talking about the importance of entrepreneurial genius, but the other sort of genius is the corporate genius, the genius for creating corporations, which is not individualistic things. In corporations, the ways of bringing people together for a common activity, they\u2019re sort of communal, private-sector communal organizations. And America was the first country to free corporations from the dictates of the state. Early corporations, to get limited liability, you had to be willing to build a canal or do something very specific. America was the first country to free those corporations, and it was the first country to allow corporations to grow on a gigantic scale. So, I can see the appeal of the infant-industry arguments; I don\u2019t think it works. And again, I can see that \u2014 a lot of people also talk about the importance of government after the Second World War in keeping America going. And I think it was not irrelevant. But what strikes me as interesting is what government didn\u2019t do, rather than what it did do, after the Second World War. It didn\u2019t nationalize industries in the way that the British government and many other European governments do. It didn\u2019t try to control and plan higher education in the way that lots of other countries do, did at the time. It kept out of the way much more than European governments. It seems to me that people have a bout of economic nostalgia in this country and they look for other periods of prosperity as showing another way to run an economy. They point to the tariffs in the late 19th century to say tariffs were why America got rich, and then they\u2019ll also point to the immediate post-war decades as a sign that you can run a different kind of economy: You don\u2019t need to have this globalist economy, you can have an economy of strong unions, high taxes, and the economy did just find the 1950s and 1960s. So perhaps that should be the model for today. Sure, and it is quite interesting that the interventionist positions one associates with a lot of people on the left like Michael Lind have also been taken up by many people on the right with the rise of Trumpism. But again, if you look at many of the industries that were dominant in the post-war period, they become very decadent very quickly when they\u2019re divorced from global competition. And you can look at the car industry, and you can look at the steel industry; both those industries ceased to innovate, ceased to be very productive, and became very self-indulgent. That may have been quite good for a car worker, but it certainly wasn\u2019t very good for consumers. They actually start producing much better products after they\u2019re subjected to global competition. The American car industry, thanks to competition from Japan and Germany, is in a much better position than it was in the 1960s and 1970s. And remember, the left at that time was very critical of the car industry because it was an oligopoly and because a lot of the cars were unsafe. And people talk about stable manufacturing jobs now, but people at that point complained that manufacturing jobs were very tedious. The rise of Japanese production systems has done a lot to make manufacturing both more efficient and better for the work. Economic nostalgia manifests itself in a variety of ways, as you\u2019re aware. You wrote a book called \u201cCapitalism in America,\u201d and a lot of people think capitalism is broken in this country and also in other advanced economies. And some of them will make the argument that capitalism was broken before in the early 1900s with the rise of very big corporations, and now just as then we need to break up these large companies. They\u2019re too dominant. They\u2019re bad for growth. They have too much corporate power. They have to go. What do you make of that argument? One of the interesting things we note in this book is that the loss of faith in America is a repeated thing throughout American history. You saw it in the late 19th and early 20th century when people began to think that capitalism was crushing workers. You saw it in the 1930s when we had the Great Depression. You saw it in the 1970s when you had stagflation and, as I was saying earlier, when you had lots of big American industries just not competing very well with foreign industries. And after each of these cycles of disillusionment you\u2019ve seen very impressive resurgences in the United States. In the 1920s, productivity growth I think was probably at its highest point in American history, and you had a huge democratization of large numbers of innovations. You have the 1950s, the Golden Age of American growth. And you have the 1980s when America was regaining its dominance in the industries which are redefining the world, primarily computers and later the internet. So America has an extraordinary degree of genius for reinvention, thanks to creative destruction. I think it\u2019s willing to just seize on new opportunities, and there is no other country I can think of in the world that has been at the frontier of industrial development or economic development in the ways America has for the same length of time. America has basically been at the frontier since the 1860s in steel, in electricity, in oil, in consumer goods, and then in computers and electronics. But certainly there are many concerns that we\u2019re at the frontier, but we may not be at the frontier for much longer. China, with all of its people and money and ability to collect data, will surpass America\u2019s position at the technological frontier by the century\u2019s end. Do you agree with that? The first argument in this book is America has been the world\u2019s and is the world\u2019s preeminent economic power because of its willingness to embrace creative destruction. The second argument in this book is that America\u2019s willingness to embrace creative destruction is on the decline and that its position as the world\u2019s great innovator and great economic power is under threat more seriously than at any time probably in its history. If you look at various indices, you can see growing stagnation; fading dynamism is the phrase that we use. If you look at company creation, it is at a historical low. If you look at geographical mobility, it\u2019s low. If you look at the burden of regulations, it\u2019s unbelievably high. If you look at large swathes of industries, America\u2019s being surpassed by China. And if you look at workforce participation, you\u2019ve got a huge problem with men falling out of the workforce and becoming economically unproductive, as AEI has highlighted brilliantly. So indices that America used to dominate, like having the most graduates and by far the most educated population in the world, are beginning to fall down. So all sorts of indicators are flashing red. You\u2019re arguing we need to return to the American model: Don\u2019t regulate or tax away creative destruction and make sure we continue to be a global talent magnet. But the China argument is there is another model that works. Their model is not necessarily a creative destruction model. It\u2019s that government is smart enough to understand what the industries of the future broadly are, and they can just shove a lot of money at those industries and that\u2019ll work. Because inherent in these concerns about China is that, for the first time ever, this new model of state capitalism can at least rival America\u2019s if not surpass us. Absolutely. I mean that is the argument. But what we\u2019re trying to do in this book is expose the reasons why America became great in the first place and suggest that the way of remaining in the lead is to recover and return to those comparative advantages. The biggest threats to America\u2019s position come not from anything that\u2019s fundamentally wrong with business culture or fundamentally wrong with the economy; it comes from poor government policies having to do with entitlements, regulations, and poor financial sector management. We need to address those so this sort of unique genius of America for creative destruction can once more express itself. Now, I think China in particular, and state capitalism in particular, is the biggest single challenge that America has ever been faced with. Partly because state capitalism is quite clever. It\u2019s much cleverer than the pure socialism of SovietRussia because it tries to merge the best features of capitalism with the best features of statism in its mind. And partly because the Chinese economy simply is so big that we haven\u2019t seen anything on this scale before. State capitalism basically tries to use the genius of entrepreneurs and use the genius of companies in a way that is sort of guided by the state but isn\u2019t completely dominated by the state, and that is a very interesting model. It\u2019s a very exciting model in many ways, but it\u2019s so far not demonstrated an ability to innovate. It has demonstrated an ability to be a fast follower, and while it has demonstrated an ability to create some impressive companies, it hasn\u2019t yet demonstrated an ability to discipline those companies when they get too big and too dominant. They throw a lot of resources at that those leading companies, but they tend to reduce the efficiency of the use of those resources over time. I now have three big books of economic history on my bookshelf. I have \u201cCapitalism in America.\u201d I have the new Douglas Irwin book on trade, \u201cClashing over Commerce.\u201d And I have the Robert Gordon book, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of American Growth.\u201d Gordon reviewed your book in the Financial Times, and he was at least mildly critical, particularly about your focus on entitlements and how that\u2019s crowding out productive investments. Where do you and Robert Gordon differ? Well, first of all, let me say I think Robert Gordon\u2019s book on the rise and fall of American growth is an extremely impressive book. We used it a lot in our book; we were inspired and guided by it to some extent, and it\u2019s full of fantastic facts. Our problem with that book is that we weren\u2019t persuaded by his central thesis: that there is something about the modern high-tech, internet-based economy that means that growth is slower. And he thinks that the overall impact of the current wave of technological innovations is less than previous technological innovations; we\u2019re getting less of a boost from the average living standards of the workers. They affect a narrower range of activities, and they have less knock-on effects. I think that\u2019s wrong. I think that the knock-on effects of the internet revolution are going to get bigger and bigger and bigger as more and more things are attached to the internet, as we get intelligent houses and intelligent machines and intelligent infrastructure. As the world is increasingly linked to the internet, I think that the impact of the internet revolution is going to get bigger. I would liken what\u2019s happening now to what happened with electricity. Electricity was used to light houses in the 1890s and even before. So the great mystery was then, why isn\u2019t electricity improving productivity? Why wasn\u2019t it being harnessed by the manufacturing sector and by companies? It wasn\u2019t for a long time. But then in the 1920s it begins to have a big effect because people start redesigning factories and the production processes to take advantage of electricity. And it suddenly begins to have a big effect on productivity. And I think that we may see exactly the same thing with IT. Gordon\u2019s argument is that we can do a lot of right things policy-wise, but even if we do all the right things, the nature of technological advance and progress is that we won\u2019t get the same results as in the past because all the easy things have been done, like combustion engines and electrification. VR goggles just aren\u2019t going to have the same impact. I tend to agree with you that he\u2019s underestimating the potential big impact of general technologies like AI. I mean, he may be right, but I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. What we argue is that nothing about the nature of the current general purpose technology means it won\u2019t have the same impact as the last. What we have is problems with policy. And when you have problems with policy, that\u2019s a good thing and a bad thing. It\u2019s a good thing because you can get better policies, but it is a bad thing because the nature of American politics at the moment is that it is very hard for people to agree on policy changes. Another thing Gordon argues is that the growth that we do generate will be unequally shared, and therefore, even though we continue to generate growth, only a small sliver of the population will get it. And so another one of his criticisms is that you really did not get into the inequality argument, which some economists argue is the premier issue facing the economy. Even though we can generate growth, it won\u2019t be shared as equally as in the past, and that is a feature of the modern economy. It is sort of a new Gilded Age argument. I have two responses to that. One is to quote Schumpeter, who I like. He said famously that Elizabeth I had silk stockings, and the genius of capitalism is not to provide queens with millions and millions of silk stockings, but to make sure that something that was once reserved for queens can be purchased by shop girls. Capitalism makes basic products much, much, much cheaper. Things that were once luxuries become common goods. We are seeing that happen with smartphones now, which were once luxury goods, and now almost everybody has them. We can see this with access to libraries of information via the internet. Things that only the most privileged people on Earth could get access to now we have at our fingertips. So technology is reducing the costs of all sorts of things. Now where that hasn\u2019t happened is with college education and health care. The great riddle of why American wages have been stagnant has a lot to do with the fact that more and more of people\u2019s paychecks are being eaten up by rising costs of education and health care. The cost of buying a television or computer is going down vastly, but the cost of sending your children to a good university is going up. So it may be the case that we can apply the genius of capitalism to sophisticated service goods. I would also say that the fact that Bill Gates is very rich or Steve Jobs was very rich or Jeff Bezos is incredibly rich doesn\u2019t really worry me because those fortunes are in some sense signs that they\u2019re producing, as it were, the silk stockings for more and more and more people. What does worry me is the role of rent-seeking in the modern capitalist economy: the role of cronyism and the role of political connections and the way that big corporations preserve their positions by sticking it to the competition. Do you think the big tech companies qualify at this point? I think they\u2019re beginning to qualify. There was a cycle in the late 19th century, where the great companies produced by, let\u2019s say, Andrew Carnegie went from being incredibly innovative to being stable and cultivating political connections. If you look at the rise of US Steel after about 1903 it just stopped innovating to the same degree that Carnegie had been innovating. And I\u2019m worried that the tech companies have gone through that cycle faster, that they\u2019ve now become very defensive operations. If you look at the number of lawyers that they employ and PR people they employ versus the number of pure tech people they employ, that worries me. As we finish up, obviously I have to bring up the role of the Fed and monetary policy given that your co-author is Alan Greenspan. One of the policy solutions you suggest is making banks safer, making them hold bigger capital cushions. You are saying that if you like capitalism, it is really good to avoid these big financial crises that cause people to begin thinking capitalism doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019re just 10 years after the Great Recession and a great financial crisis. But yet you feel that the problem has not been fixed, and there is still a vulnerability in the US financial system that could lead to another financial crisis down the road. I think finance is sort of like creative destruction on steroids. It tends to speed up creation if you can allocate money very efficiently and ruthlessly; the financial system is ruthless. But also it tends to overshoot on the destructive side, and when you get things like the financial crisis in 2008, it\u2019s almost purely destructive. And what you have to do is have a system which doesn\u2019t hinder the creative side and the ability of financial companies to innovate and allocate money in intelligent and sometimes counterintuitive ways, but which also doesn\u2019t allow financial institutions to become almost voluntary. I mean, what happened with financial institutions is that they\u2019re playing with other people\u2019s money, and when that game goes wrong, then the state comes and bails them out and that\u2019s not anything that\u2019s desirable or healthy. And our way we try to deal with this is to say Dodd-Frank is much too prescriptive, much too big, and much too regulation-obsessed. There is a much simpler way of dealing with these problems, and that\u2019s to force banks to keep much bigger capital cushions than they do, and they\u2019ve been very resistant to that. The capital cushions are a bit bigger than they were just before the crisis, but they\u2019re not, in our view, anywhere big enough. So if they are going to play, they should be playing with their own money, not with yours and mine in a way that creates disillusionment with the whole system. Were you and Chairman Greenspan in complete agreement about the role of monetary policy over the past hundred years and the successes and failures of the Fed? It\u2019s his bag, not my bag. I defer to his judgment on all of those things. But I would say we were in agreement on those things. I think that our biggest disagreement probably came over the role of FDR because I think that FDR understood that combating recessions or depressions is about mood and politics. So I think I have a more sunny view of FDR than Chairman Greenspan probably. To wrap up, you are focused on financial stability and on fiscal solvency going forward. But is there any other area of recommendation that you give policymakers if you want to keep America as a high-growth, technological frontier kind of economy? Yeah, I\u2019m incredibly worried about the growth of crony capitalism and the intimate connections between big corporations and big government. And that\u2019s something that both parties are guilty of, and I think that the revolving door between the Democrats and the Obama administration and the big tech companies is just as worrying as the connections between the Republican Party and various Main Street companies. And protectionism makes that massively more likely. Although we\u2019ve argued in this book that America has a genius for business and that it likes corporations and entrepreneurs and gives them a lot of freedom is wonderful, what you have to understand in the end is what you really need is free, competitive markets. If businessmen become too powerful and too entrenched and too chummy with governments or political parties, that\u2019s a sign that dynamism is going to be threatened.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1801002I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TN3-YSS1-F0YC-N2G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4847\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 3, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The goal: Figuring out whether regulators need to be tougher on companies that have staked out ever-larger chunks of the markets they serve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged in at least two ways,\" said FTC Chairman Joseph Simons in his introduction.</p><p>Challenge number one: An emerging body of research shows that many industries have become concentrated in the hands of a few very large companies. This comes at a time when antitrust enforcement has been getting less aggressive over the past several decades. (Think airlines, for example, where four companies now control 68% of the passenger miles flown in the United States.)</p><p>Another challenge: A progressive school of activists and scholars who say that antitrust policy shouldn't be concerned only with prices charged to consumers, but also with issues like labor standards, economic inequality and corporate influence on politics, where there's now more evidence that industry consolidation is having an impact.</p><p>The series of hearings is modeled on a similar exercise conducted in the 1990s, when the FTC took a broad look at how globalization and technology were impacting antitrust policy, in the midst of what was then the largest wave of mergers in United States history.</p><p>The FTC is now grappling with what to do about tech giants, like Facebook and Google, that have come to dominate advertising and internet search because of a mixture of technological superiority and \"network effects,\" through which services become more attractive the more users they have.</p><p>\"It's not competition in the market, it's competition for the market,\" said panelist Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale School of Management.</p><p>Amazon, in particular, has posed a puzzle for established antitrust doctrine. It has tended to lower prices for consumers, but it is also now by far the largest portal for online shopping, which gives it enormous power over the producers that sell on its platform.</p><p>Think tanks like the Open Markets Institute and the Roosevelt Institute have argued that the FTC, along with the antitrust division of the Justice Department and other law enforcement bodies, should prevent more mergers and potentially even break up companies that appear to be exercising too much market power.</p><p>\"Market concentration and market power lead to stagnant wages, fewer new businesses, and a weakened supply chain,\" write Adil Abdela and Marshall Steinbaum of the Roosevelt Institute. \"As a result, many participants in the economy feel their fate is out of their own hands... It's time for the agencies to stop ignoring the problem or going out of their way to deny it exists.\"</p><p>However, that point of view is far from generally accepted inside the Beltway.</p><p>President Donald Trump has lashed out at Amazon on Twitter and said on Fox News that it has a \"huge antitrust problem.\" But the Department of Justice's antitrust division has publicly defended its stance of sticking to the \"consumer welfare\" standard rather than implementing a more expansive one that might implicate the trillion-dollar company.</p><p/><p>The FTC's opening panel this week featured a handful of competition and consumer protection lawyers who leaned toward maintaining the status quo. Some argued that the new \"antitrust populists\" want to move back to the 1960s and '70s, when companies were prosecuted simply for being larger and more efficient than their competitors.</p><p>\"Nostalgia is misplaced,\" said Tim Muris, a former FTC chairman who is now a professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School. \"I have no desire to relive those years, and neither should you.\"</p><p>Businesses, consumers, and workers have a lot to gain or lose from any change in antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Some lobbying groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, have filed comments supporting the \"traditional\" antitrust standard. Others, such as the News Media Alliance representing newspapers and online publishers, argued that online platforms are threatening their viability by controlling advertising and the distribution of information.</p><p>When asked about the claim that they might be getting close to monopoly status, the big tech firms generally say they exist in a dynamic marketplace where they could be disrupted at any time by upstart competitors. If people don't like how Google uses their search data, the argument goes, they can switch to another search engine like DuckDuckGo, which says it protects users' privacy.</p><p>In its public comment, Amazon encouraged the FTC to consider that technology has now diffused into all sectors, and so it wouldn't make sense to treat tech platforms any differently than other types of businesses.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also weighed in on the matter at an event in Washington Thursday. He acknowledged that all large companies should expect to be scrutinized, but he also offered a defense.</p><p>\"It's really important that politicians and others understand the value that big companies bring, and not demonize or vilify business in general,\" Bezos said in remarks to the Washington Economic Club. \"Nobody in their garage is going to build an all carbon fiber fuel efficient Boeing 787.

But that's what's happening at the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Thursday, the federal watchdog tasked with protecting consumers from fraud and anti-competitive behavior kicked off a months-long series of hearings. The goal: Figuring out whether regulators need to be tougher on companies that have staked out ever-larger chunks of the markets they serve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged in at least two ways,\" said FTC Chairman Joseph Simons in his introduction. </p><p>Challenge number one: An emerging body of research shows that many industries have become concentrated in the hands of a few very large companies. This comes at a time when antitrust enforcement has been getting less aggressive over the past several decades. (Think airlines, for example, where four companies now control 68% of the passenger miles flown in the United States.) </p><p>Another challenge: A progressive school of activists and scholars who say that antitrust policy shouldn't be concerned only with prices charged to consumers, but also with issues like labor standards, economic inequality and corporate influence on politics, where there's now more evidence that industry consolidation is having an impact. </p><p>The series of hearings is modeled on a similar exercise conducted in the 1990s, when the FTC took a broad look at how globalization and technology were impacting antitrust policy, in the midst of what was then the largest wave of mergers in United States history. </p><p>The FTC is now grappling with what to do about tech giants, like Facebook and Google, that have come to dominate advertising and internet search because of a mixture of technological superiority and \"network effects,\" through which services become more attractive the more users they have. </p><p>\"It's not competition in the market, it's competition for the market,\" said panelist Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale School of Management.</p><p>Amazon, in particular, has posed a puzzle for established antitrust doctrine. It has tended to lower prices for consumers, but it is also now by far the largest portal for online shopping, which gives it enormous power over the producers that sell on its platform. </p><p>Think tanks like the Open Markets Institute and the Roosevelt Institute have argued that the FTC, along with the antitrust division of the Justice Department and other law enforcement bodies, should prevent more mergers and potentially even break up companies that appear to be exercising too much market power. </p><p>\"Market concentration and market power lead to stagnant wages, fewer new businesses, and a weakened supply chain,\" write Adil Abdela and Marshall Steinbaum of the Roosevelt Institute. \"As a result, many participants in the economy feel their fate is out of their own hands... It's time for the agencies to stop ignoring the problem or going out of their way to deny it exists.\"</p><p>However, that point of view is far from generally accepted inside the Beltway. </p><p>President Donald Trump has lashed out at Amazon on Twitter and said on Fox News that it has a \"huge antitrust problem.\" But the Department of Justice's antitrust division has publicly defended its stance of sticking to the \"consumer welfare\" standard rather than implementing a more expansive one that might implicate the trillion-dollar company. </p><p>The FTC's opening panel this week featured a handful of competition and consumer protection lawyers who leaned toward maintaining the status quo. Some argued that the new \"antitrust populists\" want to move back to the 1960s and '70s, when companies were prosecuted simply for being larger and more efficient than their competitors. </p><p>\"Nostalgia is misplaced,\" said Tim Muris, a former FTC chairman who is now a professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School. \"I have no desire to relive those years, and neither should you.\"</p><p>Businesses, consumers, and workers have a lot to gain or lose from any change in antitrust scrutiny. </p><p>Some lobbying groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, have filed comments supporting the \"traditional\" antitrust standard. Others, such as the News Media Alliance representing newspapers and online publishers, argued that online platforms are threatening their viability by controlling advertising and the distribution of information. </p><p>When asked about the claim that they might be getting close to monopoly status, the big tech firms generally say they exist in a dynamic marketplace where they could be disrupted at any time by upstart competitors. If people don't like how Google uses their search data, the argument goes, they can switch to another search engine like DuckDuckGo, which says it protects users' privacy. </p><p>In its public comment, Amazon encouraged the FTC to consider that technology has now diffused into all sectors, and so it wouldn't make sense to treat tech platforms any differently than other types of businesses. </p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also weighed in on the matter at an event in Washington Thursday. He acknowledged that all large companies should expect to be scrutinized, but he also offered a defense.</p><p>\"It's really important that politicians and others understand the value that big companies bring, and not demonize or vilify business in general,\" Bezos said in remarks to the Washington Economic Club. \"Nobody in their garage is going to build an all carbon fiber fuel efficient Boeing 787. It's not going to happen. You need Boeing to do that.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Continue reading What Mark Zuckerberg's big talk about free speech left out</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All week, we've been talking here about a central debate in our reckoning over big tech platforms and their power: what should stay up on the internet, and what should come down. The discussion has been fueled by two national conversations: one, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, about whether Facebook ought to exempt political ads from fact-checking. And the other, about how far the limits of free speech extend in a world where China is moving aggressively to restrict American companies from hosting speech supportive of democratic protesters in Hong Kong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg had his say. In a 45-minute speech at Georgetown University, Facebook's CEO made his case for internet services that promote the maximum amount of free speech. (Here's a transcript and a link to the video.)</p><p>The speech began with a major tactical and factual error, in which Zuckerberg attempted to awkwardly retcon the founding of Facebook into a story about giving students a voice during the Iraq war. ( I remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently. ) All previous reporting on the subject suggests that the truth was much, much hornier, and the fact that Zuckerberg's speech began so disingenuously caused lots of the folks I read to tune out the rest.</p><p>But I wanted to see how Zuckerberg would tackle the two big speech debates of the moment: lying in ads, and China.</p><p>On the former subject, Zuckerberg made his case for Facebook staying out of it:</p><p>We don't fact-check political ads. We don't do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying. And if content is newsworthy, we also won't take it down even if it would otherwise conflict with many of our standards.</p><p>I know many people disagree, but, in general, I don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we're not an outlier here. The other major internet platforms and the vast majority of media also run these same ads.</p><p>Zuckerberg also made his case for Facebook's pro-speech bias as a necessary counterweight to the advance of Chinese soft power around the world. He said:</p><p>China is building its own internet focused on very different values, and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries. Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There's no guarantee these values will win out. A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top ten are Chinese.</p><p>We're beginning to see this in social media. While our services, like WhatsApp, are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these protests are censored, even in the US.</p><p>Is that the internet we want?</p><p>On the whole, Zuckerberg tried to chart a middle course between his two loudest, angriest constituencies: the voices, mostly on the left, pushing for him to take down much more content than Facebook currently does; and the voices, mostly on the right, that complain Facebook is an engine for censorship that actively suppresses their views. It's a position that, I think, reflects Zuckerberg's actual beliefs   and it's also the only tenable position for someone who is trying to serve the largest number of customers, no matter their political views.</p><p>By that standard, I thought, the speech was fine. But in the view of Facebook it presented to the world, there were a few important things it left out.</p><p>One, Zuckerberg presents Facebook's platform as a neutral conduit for the dissemination of speech. But it's not. We know that historically it has tended to favor the angry and the outrageous over the level-headed and inspiring. We know that the distribution of various formats for speech, such as live video or links to third-party publishers, will rise and fall sharply   and with no warning   depending on Facebook's business needs. Zuckerberg's talk focuses exclusively on the right of speech, when the far more consequential question is the right of reach. What spreads, and by what means, and to what effect? These are all questions Facebook avoided today.</p><p>Two, Zuckerberg presents Facebook specifically and social media more generally as a leveling force in democracies.  People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world,  he said.  A Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society.  And that's true   social networks really did help to catalyze any number of vital social movements, including Black Lives Matter and #MeToo.</p><p>But as Jen Schradie wrote in this year's The Revolution That Wasn't, social networks have more reliably served to reinforce existing social hierarchies. Getting wide reach on platforms typically takes pre-existing celebrity, a coordinated campaign, or both. As Schradie told Vox.com:</p><p>The idea of neutrality seems more true of the internet because the costs of distributing information are dramatically lower than with something like television or radio or other communication tools.</p><p>However, to make full use of the internet, you still need substantial resources and time and motivation. The people who can afford to do this, who can fund the right digital strategy, create a major imbalance in their favor.</p><p>That's why it's somewhat disingenuous to paint Facebook in particular as a great equalizer in national politics. Especially when the company has chosen to accept paid political advertising   which naturally tends to benefit the wealthy and the status quo.</p><p>Finally, Zuckerberg presents Facebook as somewhat divorced from the real-world consequences of its speech decisions. He acknowledges that the company makes mistakes, but short of plugging its forthcoming independent oversight board, avoids discussion of what ought to happen when the company makes them. So much of the frustration with Facebook   over its size, its power, and its decisions on content moderation   stems from the fact that its decisions can have deadly consequences.</p><p>Think of the sectarian violence in Myanmar, or Sri Lanka, or India that has resulted from unfettered speech on the platform. Think of the new mothers who have joined anti-vaccination groups in the United States after Facebook's algorithm suggested they do so. Facebook has taken action to remedy these problems after the fact. But it was never held accountable for them. (If a single person lost their job over any of those calamities, it has never been made public.)</p><p>There is something untenable about a massive corporation / quasi-state that sets global speech policies but never has to answer for them, outside the odd Congressional hearing or public-relations crisis. It's easy to stand firmly on the side of free speech when the only negative consequence you suffer as a result is more speech.</p><p>What happens next? On one side, gradual improvements in detecting fake accounts, and incitements to violence. On another, outrageous lies in political ads going viral throughout the 2020 US presidential election campaign, creating increasing pressure for Facebook to changes its policies. A Zuckerberg interview on Fox News that fails to change anyone's mind on any subject. Regulation, maybe? Antitrust enforcement?</p><p>What stays up? What comes down? The debate is necessary, complicated, and far from over.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Elsewhere: Judd Legum and others call Facebook a tool of the right, to Facebook's utter delight; Zuckerberg rehearses his talking points in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal; it sure seemed liked only positive comments were popping up in the speech live stream; MLK's daughter tells Zuckerberg that disinformation kills. Also, ahead of the speech, I went on Today, Explained to talk about the controversy over political ads on Facebook.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The Ratio</p><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p>Trending up: Facebook is donating $25 million to build housing for teachers.</p><p>Trending down: Zuckerberg's awkward linking of company history to the Iraq war dominated early discussion of the speech.</p><p>Governing</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced a new data privacy bill that gives the Federal Trade Commission more power to fine tech companies that violate user privacy. It's called the Mind Your Own Business Act. Here's Makena Kelly at The Verge:</p><p>If approved, the bill would allow the FTC to establish minimum privacy and cybersecurity standards for tech platforms and give it the authority to issue fines of up to 4 percent of a company's annual revenue for first-time offenses, similar to provisions in the GDPR. The FTC has resolved a number of privacy investigations into companies like Facebook, YouTube, and Equifax over the past year, but officials have faced significant criticism for not taking stronger action.</p><p>The bill also includes strong restrictions on tracking and digital advertising:</p><p>Wyden's bill would institute a federal Do Not Track requirement, giving users the option to opt out of data tracking that's used to target ads. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter would also be required to offer  privacy-protecting  versions of their products for a fee. Interestingly, Wyden's measure would extend the Federal Communications Commission's Lifeline program for low-income people to use to obtain these privacy-focused versions of products so  privacy does not become a luxury good,  as his office put it.</p><p>Wyden told Vice the legislation is needed so Mark Zuckerberg starts taking privacy seriously:</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg won't take Americans' privacy seriously unless he feels personal consequences,  Wyden said.  A slap on the wrist from the FTC won't do the job, so under my bill he'd face jail time for lying to the government. </p><p>Facebook's plan to create an independent Oversight Board to police content is a really good idea, argues Kara Swisher. The board will act as the ultimate judge of what content stays up on the platform, and should be up and running in a year. Swisher says it deserves public support. (Kara Swisher / The New York Times)</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is meeting with lawmakers ahead of next Wednesday's Congressional hearing to discuss Libra. He's trying to answer their regulatory concerns and rally more support for Libra in the United States   which appears to be collapsing. (Christopher Stern and Ashley Gold / The Information)</p><p>Chris Hughes, the Facebook co-founder who has become a vocal antitrust activist, launched a $10 million  anti-monopoly' fund alongside George Soros and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Hughes has been calling for Facebook to be broken up for months. His new fund will support antitrust actions in a number of industries, not just tech. (Tony Romm / The Washington Post)</p><p>Amazon is making moves into the business of providing elections software. (Kevin McLaughlin / The Information)</p><p>Trump retains a significant advantage over Democratic presidential candidates: his well funded digital campaign. Under Brad Parscale, the president's re-election committee has devoted millions honing a sophisticated digital apparatus that can microtarget voters on Facebook and Google. (Thomas B. Edsall / The New York Times)</p><p>An investigation suggests that Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets general manager whose pro-Hong Kong tweet jeopardized NBA-China relations, was likely the subject of a coordinated harassment campaign from pro-China trolls. Half the accounts that replied to his tweet had fewer than 13 followers. (Ben Cohen, Georgia Wells and Tom McGinty / The Wall Street Journal)</p><p>Industry</p><p>More school districts are using facial recognition technology to prevent school shootings. But the software is also being used to enforce school rules and monitor students, according to Tom Simonite and Gregory Barber at Wired:</p><p>Jason Nance, a law professor at the University of Florida, says facial recognition is part of a trend of increasing surveillance and security in US schools, despite a lack of firm evidence that more technology makes kids safer. Nance's research has documented how high-profile school shootings drive intensifying surveillance, with the burden falling heaviest on students of color.</p><p>Companies selling facial recognition systems see schools as a growing market. Shootings like the murder of 14 students and three staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last year drive interest and sales. Max Constant, AnyVision's chief commercial officer, won't disclose how many US schools the company has worked with but says its work  typically centers around areas in which previous tragedies have occurred.  In a statement, AnyVision said its technology is installed at hundreds of sites worldwide.  Our technology never catalogs or retains records of individuals screened, and AnyVision remains committed to operating under the highest level of privacy and ethical standards,  the company said.</p><p>Twitch is becoming a go-to destination for people looking to watch Trump rallies and live-stream violence online. Some, like the German synagogue shooter, likely assume their videos will stay up longer on the newer platform. (Drew Harwell and Jay Greene / The Washington Post)</p><p>TikTok launched a series of educational videos in India in an attempt to expand its reach and appease local authorities who banned the app back in April. The videos range from explainers on science and math to tips on mental health awareness.

But as is typical of such hearings, an unabridged written testimony was submitted in advance so members of Congress and others could prepare their lines of questioning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As governments and central banks grapple with what it would mean to have a global currency backed by their own assets, in some ways Zuckerberg s comments were disappointingly predictable.\u00a0But as three new bills introduced to Congress in the days leading up to the testimony could spell doom for Facebook s plans, a closer analysis of Zuckerberg s comments shines a light on the social media giant s bigger strategy.</p><p>The submitted written testimony is broken down into five sections: introduction, a summary of the Libra Project, combating discrimination, a commitment to diversity, and a conclusion.</p><p>The introduction is interesting for three reasons. First, Zuckerberg plans to position Libra in the global context as a reaction to China s plans to release a similar cryptocurrency that will be spendable anywhere in the world and will be distributed via a consortium of state-owned companies. While Facebook has previously emphasized that the libra cryptocurrency would be backed by a basket of international currencies, perhaps giving a broader group of people a stake in the technology, today Zuckerberg will use the political undertones and his audience of U.S. elected officials to refocus the project on its American roots.</p><p> Libra will be backed mostly by dollars and I believe it will extend America s financial leadership,  Zuckerberg will say, according to the prepared notes.  As well as our democratic values and oversight around the world. If America doesn t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed. </p><p>The introduction is also notable in that it foreshadows a surprising amount of attention on questions of diversity and civil rights, topics he s previously addressed in front of Congress but that are only tangentially related to the cryptocurrency, which is being designed to serve with unbanked people typically consisting of underrepresented groups. Zuckerberg wraps up his address with what appears to be a hat-tip to the religious inclinations of some elected officials and U.S. voters.  I feel blessed to be in a position where we can make a difference in people s lives,  his prepared remarks say.</p><p>The second section of Zuckerberg s remarks to Congress largely rehash the already well-known definition of the Libra Association founded by Facebook, the libra cryptocurrency, and Facebook s Calibra wallet for storing the cryptocurrency, with one small change. Since Facebook s head of cryptocurrency, David Marcus, testified before Congress in July, four U.S. lawmakers have sent a letter to association members asking them not to participate in the group, which was followed by an exodus of every major financial player in the group, including PayPal, MasterCard and Visa. Not all elected officials responded so harshly, with U.S. senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota calling his colleagues   ominous tone   disappointing  and expressing support for the financial innovation.</p><p>This section concludes by distinguishing Facebook s cryptocurrency wallet, Calibra, from the libra cryptocurrency and clarifying Facebook s intention not to sell data about Calibra wallet users to third parties. The section also reiterates Facebook s desire to position libra as a U.S. tool for global financial competition.  If America doesn t lead on this, others will,  the submitted comments read.  Foreign companies or countries may act without the same regulatory oversight or commitment to transparency. </p><p>Sections three and four really address the same subject of combating discrimination. Reading between the lines however, the comments could serve two goals related to libra. First, they focus on some of the positive changes Facebook has made recently, including the establishment of a civil rights task force, which could leave a good taste in congress members mouths while so much negative news about Facebook fills the headlines. Second, the groups of people typically addressed in these civil rights campaigns, women and other<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>underrepresented </marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>groups, are among the same people Facebook has publicly identified as its target users for the cryptocurrency: the under-banked.</p><p>The conclusion is largely aimed at reiterating Facebook s previously stated intention of not launching without regulatory support, which in increasingly looking like a tough sell. As of early last week there were 21 bills relating to blockchain in various stages of passing through congressional review. But on Friday, October 19, three new bills were introduced aimed at undermining Facebook s efforts. An updated version of the  Keeping Big Tech Out of Finance Act,  appears to be largely aimed at keeping Facebook away from cryptocurrency, according to Jason Brett, CEO of the Value Technology advocacy group. The  Stablecoins are Securities  bill could have far-reaching implications to companies like Gemini, Circle and Coinbase, which have already created stablecoins similar to libra but backed by different assets. The  To Prohibit The Listing of Certain Securities,  appears to seek to prevent stablecoins like libra from entering the capital markets space, according to Brett.</p><p> As Congress attempts to reign in Libra from its perceived impact to the strength of the U.S. dollar, policymakers are creating broad measures that has an impact beyond Facebook,  says Brett.  If the three bills were actually passed, no Big Tech company could offer a cryptocurrency, all stablecoins will be treated as securities, and any company or its officers profiting from a stablecoin will face being delisted from a stock exchange. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-5db05aa3bb6a4c000683207a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBJ-PKY1-DXVP-518C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1001\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The Toronto-based company rolled out the live chat, which is available every day from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time, to its Canadian user base in December.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unlike whatFacebook announced on Tuesdaywith partners from various industries including Bank of America, TD's service is staffed by people, rather than supported by artificial intelligence \"bots.\" Nonetheless, the goal is the same - to be where the bank's customers are.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Given the vast popularity of Messenger, we believe this initiative will make contacting us for support even faster and easier - enabling us to deliver an unsurpassed customer experience,\" said Michael Rhodes, head of consumer banking at TD Bank.</p><p>More banks are likely to add the service, or at least they should consider it, observers say.</p><p>If successful, the partnerships could give banks another way to interact with their customers on one of the busiest platforms in the world. By pairing with one of the most downloaded apps, banks would likely gain prominence on their users' phones, which is becoming at least as important as being \"top of wallet.\" The AI component could eventually give banks a way to upgrade their mobile experience from one built on quick tasks - like paying a bill or checking the balance - to the kinds of advisory services they aim to provide in person.</p><p>In other words, this is a game changer. And down the line, it could lead to a more active role for tech giants like Facebook in the realm of financial services.</p><p>Immediate Opportunities</p><p>Using Facebook Messenger for communications is part of a broader push by banks to be more customer-oriented. That's the root of omnichannel banking - letting customers pick how they want to interact with the bank, rather than limiting their options.</p><p>With its 900 million users, Facebook is a natural avenue for such communication. If people are already there, why not use that platform?</p><p>Indeed, Bank of America cited the social network's omnipresence as part of its motivation in announcing that it would work with Messenger.</p><p>\"We want to serve clients wherever and whenever they choose, and Messenger is a perfect complement to our connected banking proposition through 2016 and beyond,\" said Michelle Moore, head of digital banking at B of A, in a press release Tuesday.</p><p>The company already allowed users to directly connect with a customer service representative by tapping a button on the mobile app. It also has a chat function on its website. B of A sees Messenger as a supplement to those services, not a replacement, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>Also, as people increasingly see Messenger as a valid method of communication, some banks will likely want to adopt it quickly to remain relevant, said Julie Conroy, a research director at Aite Group.</p><p>\"You don't want to be the bank that can't interact with millennials, for example, in the way that they want to,\" she said.</p><p>In the mobile phone realm, the ability to latch on to one of the most downloaded apps in the world is compelling.</p><p>\"Most phones are loaded with apps, but consumers only use four or five, Facebook usually being one of those,\" Conroy said. \"If this bot idea does take off, and it starts being used for business-to-consumer transactions, then your brand has to be capable of interacting on this platform.\"</p><p>In addition to connecting with customers on the channel, the partnerships with Facebook could help banks gain prominence in notifications on the home screen of a mobile phone, said Mark Schwanhausser,\u00a0director of omnichannel financial services at Javelin Strategy &amp; Research.</p><p>\"The value of the real estate in notifications is on par with finding an apartment in San Francisco,\" Schwanhausser said.</p><p>Down the Road</p><p>Most companies that will be using Facebook Messenger will rely on chat bots, essentially artificial intelligence software that can answer questions, on the platform.</p><p>Right now, such technology has mixed reviews. It can range from gimmicky (asking Siri on the iPhone if the character Jon Snow on \"Game of Thrones\" is dead) to disastrous (see Twitter's Tayfiasco) to marginally useful.</p><p>That will change, observers say.</p><p>\"Years from now, we will look back on 2016 and remember how clunky [automated services] were, but see them as a real part of our lives,\" Schwanhausser said. \"No one is backing off from trying to make this happen.\"</p><p>For now, companies will likely use the Messenger chat bots for simple tasks. Security concerns could keep things that way.</p><p>B of A, for instance, said its initial capabilities would likely center on important real-time alerts.</p><p>Conroy said banks that do use this platform will have to have the proper risk protocols in place. Since they are essentially trusting Messenger to authenticate the person the bank is interacting with, she said, banks will have to decide how services are delivered.</p><p>\"If someone just wants to do a balance check, you might trust Messenger to authenticate them; if they want to transfer money, a bank will likely take additional [security] steps on the back end,\" she said. \"One thing we are seeing is fraudsters are escalating attacks on the contact center. This is one very attractive attackvectorto do that.\"</p><p>But as artificial intelligence improves and institutions and users become more comfortable with the service, the bots could potentially handle more tasks and give banks the opportunity to provide advisory services digitally, observers say.</p><p>\"We could see it migrating toward more complex financial decisions. Imagine it going from understanding 'I'd like to save more' to 'Can you help me find ways to get closer to my savings goal?'\" said Bradley Leimer, head of fintech strategy for Santander U.S. Innovation.</p><p>Leimer declined to comment on Santander's plans with Facebook Messenger, but AI is clearly something the global bank is looking at. The bank announced late last month that it was rolling out voice technology to it U.K. customers, allowing them to ask the mobile app questions like \"Where did I spend the most money this month?\"</p><p>The Big Picture</p><p>If banks were already concerned about getting replaced or reduced to plumbing byFacebook or its tech giant brethren, Facebook's play with Messenger and businesses should only heighten those concerns.</p><p>\"Players like Google and Facebook are trying hard to engrain themselves into the center of your life through virtual assistance,\" Schwanhausser said.</p><p>So, should Facebook Messenger's play for business-to-consumer communication take off and people become comfortable discussing their finances via Facebook, could the banks be cut out of the equation? Maybe, observers say.</p><p>Of course, there is the issue of regulation - that's likely to keep some tech companies from going fully into the banking business, given their global business models.</p><p>Another factor in banks' favor is that people trust them, even though they see them as tech laggards, Schwanhausser said. Meanwhile, tech companies are increasingly gaining trust of consumers.</p><p>\"Big tech companies are moving up - they are gaining confidence from consumers,\" Schwanhausser said. \"Banks risk losing the game if they are not careful.\"</p><p>Fintech startups focused on messaging, not surprisingly, say that banks ought to see Facebook's move as underlining the importance of chat, but should be wary of a situation where they don't have control over the system.</p><p>\"It's clear from Facebook's announcement yesterday that messaging must be one of your top mobile features for consideration in 2016,\"\u00a0said Shannph Wong, vice president of engineering at Magnet Systems.\u00a0\"Define your messaging strategy now, or it will be defined for you.\"</p><p>But should Facebook see Messenger as a way into the banking industry, observers say there is still an opportunity for banks. In fact, it could be an extension of a hypothetical model in which banks increasingly look likeapp stores, holding customers' deposits but connecting with other players for virtually everything else via application program interfaces. (APIs work like Lego blocks, allowing software developers to easily bolt their apps onto existing services.)</p><p>Some banks are afraid of being relegated to \"dumb pipes\" in such a scenario, but Leimer said they shouldn't be so quick to dismiss that fate.</p><p>\"When you're the plumbing, the plumber still gets paid,\" Leimer said. \"The 'dumb pipes' fear factor is relevant, but there is still quite a lot of potentially good business in that.\"</p><p>Bryan Yurcan contributed to this article.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0001080435</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JHS-4P51-JCRW-5124-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1458\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 SourceMedia, Inc.

The expectation       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/19/technology/amazon-employee-salary/index.html\">in some quarters</url> was that Amazon might have had a higher pay number, in part because it is a fast-growing, cutting-edge company. But Amazon\u2019s revenue is dominated by its retail operations, a business that typically has lower wages.</p><p>What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more? This question may become more pressing if labor shortages start to force companies to up their pay to attract and retain employees.</p><p>Amazon does not disclose its total compensation expense, so it\u2019s not possible for outsiders to accurately compute what would happen to profits if it raised pay.</p><p>But the disclosure of median pay provides a little insight. Under S.E.C. rules, public companies must now disclose the median pay figure for all their employees. In annual filings, that number is then compared with the pay of the chief executive. In Amazon\u2019s case, the $1,681,840 that Jeff Bezos earned in 2017 was 59 times that of the median employee, a lower ratio than exists at other large public companies.</p><p>One way to get a rough proxy for a company\u2019s overall compensation expense is to multiply its median pay number by its total number of employees. For Amazon, that would produce a purely hypothetical compensation expense of $16.1 billion (566,000 employees times $28,466.)</p><p>Increasing Amazon\u2019s median pay number by 10 percent would bump the $28,466 up to $31,313, and the putative compensation expense would rise to $17.7 billion. Such an increase would have cut Amazon\u2019s $3.8 billion of pretax income in 2017 by 42 percent to $2.2 billion. A 20 percent raise would have slashed those earnings by 85 percent.</p><p>How does Amazon stack up against Walmart? The C.E.O. of Walmart, Doug McMillion, made $22.8 million in the company\u2019s latest fiscal year. That sum was 1,188 times as large as the median employee\u2019s pay of $19,177 (a number that excludes some foreign employees.)</p><p>At Walmart, increasing the hypothetical compensation expense would have less of an impact on earnings. A 10 percent increase would reduce Walmart\u2019s latest annual pretax profits by 28 percent, while a 20 percent pay increase would lower profits by 56 percent.</p><p>There are two ways to view such numbers. One is that retail is a cutthroat business and wages cannot rise by much if a company is going to be healthily profitable. The other is that large retailers have used their heft to lower as many of their costs as possible, including wages.</p><p>\u2014 Peter Eavis</p><p>Alphabet slips after earnings.</p><p>Strong advertising sales during the first quarter <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-results/google-parent-alphabet-profit-beats-street-on-strong-ad-sales-idUSKBN1HU2QE?il=0\">helped Google-parent Alphabet beat analysts expectations</url>.

The expectation in some quarters was that Amazon might have had a higher pay number, in part because it is a fast-growing, cutting-edge company. But Amazon's revenue is dominated by its retail operations, a business that typically has lower wages.</p><p>  What might happen to Amazon's bottom line if it paid its workers more? This question may become more pressing if labor shortages start to force companies to up their pay to attract and retain employees.</p><p>Amazon does not disclose its total compensation expense, so it's not possible for outsiders to accurately compute what would happen to profits if it raised pay.</p><p>  But the disclosure of median pay provides a little insight. Under S.E.C. rules, public companies must now disclose the median pay figure for all their employees. In annual filings, that number is then compared with the pay of the chief executive. In Amazon's case, the $1,681,840 that Jeff Bezos earned in 2017 was 59 times that of the median employee, a lower ratio than exists at other large public companies.</p><p>  One way to get a rough proxy for a company's overall compensation expense is to multiply its median pay number by its total number of employees. For Amazon, that would produce a purely hypothetical compensation expense of $16.1 billion (566,000 employees times $28,466.)</p><p>  Increasing Amazon's median pay number by 10 percent would bump the $28,466 up to $31,313, and the putative compensation expense would rise to $17.7 billion. Such an increase would have cut Amazon's $3.8 billion of pretax income in 2017 by 42 percent to $2.2 billion. A 20 percent raise would have slashed those earnings by 85 percent.</p><p>  How does Amazon stack up against Walmart? The C.E.O. of Walmart, Doug McMillion, made $22.8 million in the company's latest fiscal year. That sum was 1,188 times as large as the median employee's pay of $19,177 (a number that excludes some foreign employees.)</p><p>  At Walmart, increasing the hypothetical compensation expense would have less of an impact on earnings. A 10 percent increase would reduce Walmart's latest annual pretax profits by 28 percent, while a 20 percent pay increase would lower profits by 56 percent.</p><p>  There are two ways to view such numbers. One is that retail is a cutthroat business and wages cannot rise by much if a company is going to be healthily profitable. The other is that large retailers have used their heft to lower as many of their costs as possible, including wages.</p><p>  -- Peter Eavis</p><p>Alphabet slips after earnings.</p><p>  Strong advertising sales during the first quarter helped Google-parent Alphabet beat analysts expectations. The company's bottom line also received a lift from a change in accounting for its investments in startups.</p><p>   Net profit jumped 73% to $9.4 billion in the first quarter, up from $5.4 billion a year ago.</p><p>   Earnings per share came in at $13.33 per share, beating analyst estimates of $9.28 per share.</p><p>   The company reported a $3 billion, or about $3.40 a share, gain on equity securities in the first quarter.</p><p>   Sales rose to $31.1 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $30.3 billion.</p><p>   Traffic costs hit $6.3 billion, up 35% from a year earlier.</p><p>  Shares of Alphabet bounced around after hours. The stock rose as much as 2.2 percent but is now down slightly.</p><p>  Critics' corner</p><p>  Robert Cryan of Breakingviews writes:</p><p>  ''The tech group's $9.4 billion of earnings in the first quarter came with new noise after it adjusted the way it accounts for investments like ride-hailing app Uber, moved some smart-home appliances into Google and started stressing ''impressions'' over clicks. Investors wanting concrete measurements are getting squishy ones instead.''</p><p>  Edward Lampert offers to buy Kenmore</p><p>  Shares of Sears Holding are up about 4 percent in recent trading on Mr. Lampert's latest attempt to save the troubled retailer.</p><p>  In a letter to the Sears board, Mr. Lampert, whose ESL Investments hedge fund owns a controlling stake in the company, said ESL would also be willing to buy the retailer's home-services and its appliance-parts units.</p><p>  Mr. Lampert offered to pay Sears $500 million for the home-services and appliance-parts units, but did not mention a price for the Kenmore brand or the real estate. He noted that the company had been trying to sell the assets for nearly two years, but had failed to find other buyers.</p><p>  Mr. Lampert is Sears's chief executive. Any deal involving Sears and Mr. Lampert is complicated by his dual roles running both the retailer and the hedge fund, which is also a major Sears lender.</p><p>  Mr. Lampert said in his letter that he would recuse himself from any board discussions about his proposal. Any deal would need to be approved by a majority of Sears shareholders not affiliated with ESL, the letter said.</p><p>Sears has already sold some assets, closed hundreds of stores and laid off workers across the country as offset falling sales. The company sold its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black &amp; Decker for $775 million last year.</p><p>  -- Michael Corkery</p><p>  Not so fast on that Shazam deal</p><p>  The European Commission said Monday that it has opened an in-depth investigation into Apple's acquisition of Shazam, the maker of an app that identifies songs after listening to just a few seconds of them.</p><p>  Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition commissioner, said in a statement:</p><p>  ''The way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services. Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won't face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.''</p><p>  The European Commission is concerned that Shazam's strong position in music recognition would enable Apple to ''obtain access to commercially sensitive data about customers of its competitors.''</p><p>  ''Access to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors' customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage.''</p><p>  The European Commission has until Sept. 4 to finish its investigation.</p><p>Apple reached a deal to buy Shazam for roughly $400 million in December.</p><p>  Behind the bidding for India's e-commerce leader</p><p>  The U.S. retail giant is reportedly close to buying a majority stake in Flipkart, the top e-commerce company in India, at a $20 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg. Existing investors like Tiger Global Management and SoftBank have agreed to sell substantial portions of their shares, giving Walmart a stake of 60 percent to 80 percent.</p><p>  Why it's important: Both Walmart and Amazon have hungrily watched India, where the e-commerce market trails only the U.S. and China in terms of size but where foreign retailers have struggled. But don't expect Amazon, Flipkart's biggest rival, to give up.</p><p>  Move over, Spotify: Tencent Music reportedly plans to interview potential underwriters for a U.S. I.P.O., with a valuation exceeding $25 billion, according to WSJ. (It could also be the latest instance of a spinoff helping its Chinese parent's financial fortunes.)</p><p>  Elsewhere in deals: Elliott Management wants Hyundai to reorganize its divisions and pay out more dividends. HNA cut its stake in Deutsche Bank amid its downsizing. How China is buying into Europe. Deutsche Telekom plans to fight Vodafone's plan to buy Liberty Media's German and Eastern Europe cable division. The parent company of Poker Stars agreed to buy Sky Betting &amp; Gaming for $4.7 billion to get a foothold in Europe. Fresenius walked away from its $4.3 billion deal for Akorn, a maker of cancer drugs.</p><p>  Newell settles with Starboard</p><p>  Just over a month after cutting a deal with Carl Icahn (an agreement that Mr. Icahn's frenemy Bill Ackman said was ''a deal with the devil''), the consumer brands conglomerate has reached an accord with Starboard Value as well.</p><p>  What's in the peace agreement: Newell will name three new directors. Two -- Gerardo Lopez, the C.E.O. of Extended Stay America, and Robert Steele, a former senior executive at Procter &amp; Gamble -- are independent. The third, Bridget Ryan Berman, a former C.E.O. of `Armany and executive at Google and Victoria's Secret, was agreed upon by Starboard and Mr. Icahn.</p><p>  How it came together: In a joint news release, Mr. Icahn said that Newell asked him to parley with Starboard. Key to reaching a truce was Mr. Icahn giving up two seats that he had taken on Newell's board.</p><p>  What the parties said about the deal</p><p>   Michael Polk, Newell's C.E.O.: ''This agreement will enable the Company to now focus exclusively on the execution of our transformation plans and our efforts to strengthen our financial and operational performance.''</p><p>   Mr. Icahn: ''I am pleased that we were able to facilitate peace between the company and Starboard. Given that the company has so many more pressing priorities, this is clearly the best outcome for all shareholders.''</p><p>   Jeff Smith, Starboard's C.E.O.: ''We are confident this newly reconstituted board will bring a refreshed sense of urgency, oversight, and accountability to Newell.''</p><p>  The market reaction: Shares in Newell were up over 3 percent in premarket trading on Monday.</p><p>  -- Michael de la Merced</p><p>  Mike Bloomberg opens his wallet to fight climate change</p><p>  Even after the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris climate accord, Mr. Bloomberg insisted that the U.S. keep up its financial obligations to the U.N. body overseeing the pact -- using $4.5 million of his own money. ''I'm going to send them a check for the monies that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government,'' Mr. Bloomberg told CBS's ''Face the Nation.''</p><p>  The former N.Y.C. mayor has shown he has no problem speaking out on his personal causes, even if they're in opposition to President Trump's policies. And he's willing to put his own money to work as well.</p><p>  What Mr. Bloomberg isn't doing: Running for president -- at the moment. ''I think I can as a private citizen help in some of those things and that's what I want to do with my life,'' he said.</p><p>  Meet the trading practice that Trump hates</p><p>  ''If you talk China, I've watched where the reporters have been writing 2 percent of our steel comes from China. Well, that's not right,'' President Trump said last month, before criticizing transshipping. The practice, which disguises the origins of metals and other imports, is a reason behind the U.S.'s fight with China -- and  the E.U., South Korea and Canada have moved to crack down on illicit uses of the maneuver. (Certain instances can be legal.)</p><p>  Meanwhile, Steven Mnuchin is weighing a trip to Beijing, in the hopes that talks could avoid a full-blown trade war.</p><p>  Elsewhere in trade: The E.U. and Mexico forged their own pact on Saturday, sending a message to Washington. And a trade war  could hurt Google's Android.</p><p>  The political flyaround</p><p>   An NYT investigation into Scott Pruitt's career before the E.P.A. found close ties to lobbyists -- and an instance of a house purchase involving a lobbyist, a shell company and a questionable sale price. (NYT)</p><p>   Mike Pence's older brother, Greg, is running for Congress -- and his stewardship of a local gas station operator that went bankrupt is taking fire. (NYT)</p><p>   The Republican tax cuts sliced $18 billion off the book value of 100 big U.S. public companies -- but that math may change as a lower tax rate takes hold. (FT)</p><p>   Will Kellyanne Conway finally take a role in the White House communications department? (Axios)</p><p>   Has the office of the presidency become too big to manage? (The Atlantic)</p><p>Facebook's hot seat moves to Europe</p><p>  Mike Schroepfer, the company's chief technology officer, will appear on Thursday before the British government committee investigating fake news and social media following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (No Mark Zuckerberg this time.)</p><p>  Testifying tomorrow before that committee will be Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who passed user data to Cambridge Analytica. Mr. Kogan apologized for his role, but said he was considering suing Facebook for suggesting that he had acted unethically. (The star witness last week -- albeit in absentia -- was the man who set up Cambridge Analytica's parent company decades ago.)</p><p>  Elsewhere in Facebook: How the newsfeed played a central role in inciting violence in Sri Lanka. A deeper look at how much influence Campbell Brown, the former journalist who now leads news partnerships at the company, actually has.</p><p>Amazon critics are wary of their newest ally</p><p>  For years, the e-commerce giant has taken arrows from all corners, from labor unions to think tanks to competitors. Now President Trump has joined the fray, but not everyone is comfortable being on the same side.</p><p>  The issue: Mr. Trump's attacks appear rooted in personal animus, clouding what others feel are legitimate criticisms. Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute told the NYT, ''What he's doing is a threat to democracy, but so is Amazon.''</p><p>  Elsewhere in Amazon news: The average Amazon employee is in a warehouse, not a data lab, and earns a median annual salary of $28,446. Many Americans believe the e-commerce titan has the most positive social impact of any big tech company, according to a new survey. (Another survey found that more than half of Americans want more regulations of tech companies.)</p><p>  The problem with banks' answer to Venmo</p><p>  It's the same issue that dogged Craigslist, PayPal and Venmo early on: fraud. Now Zelle, a payment service used by the likes of Bank of America and Chase, is grappling with what some analysts told the NYT is an alarming series of incidents. ''I know of one bank that was experiencing a 90 percent fraud rate on Zelle transactions, which is insane,'' said Genevieve Gimbert, a partner in PwC's financial crimes unit.</p><p>  The problem: Customers often aren't notified when money is transferred; customers are subjected to phishing attacks that drain money from their accounts; buyers have no protections if sellers don't provide paid-for goods.</p><p>  Why it matters: Banks want their share of digital payments, and 18 so far have signed up with Zelle.</p><p>  Elsewhere in finance: UBS's strong first-quarter earnings were overshadowed by the bank's wealth-management unit missing estimates.</p><p>  The tech flyaround</p><p>   Gary Gensler has gone from Goldman Sachs trader to financial regulator under President Barack Obama to lecturer at M.I.T., where he plans to extol cryptocurrencies' virtues and warn of their regulatory problems. (NYT)</p><p>   Meet the kolion, a Russian cryptocurrency that is gaining favor in rural areas -- and being watched warily by Moscow. (WSJ)</p><p>   NewsGuard, a service that uses trained journalists to rate thousands of news and information sites, is starting a hotline for reporting fake news sites. (Axios)</p><p>   Major American consumer brands said that Alibaba retaliated when they refused exclusive partnerships with the company.

Government lawyers routinely blocked mergers merely on the grounds that the resulting company would be too big. The  companies' counterargument that being bigger would make them better was rarely entertained by the courts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the 1970s the \"Chicago school\" of antitrust law successfully harnessed economics to argue for a much more hospitable approach. Over the following decades America's regulators became so welcoming that critics painted them as doormats. In many industries the largest firms have consistently gained market share without any official concern; the most successful technology companies have grown into veritable titans. Many economists studying the subject now worry that a lack of competition is an economic drag, especially online. Some scholars go further, arguing that the Chicago school's sense of what is good for consumers is not serving their broader interests.  </p><p>The Chicago school, built on the work of Aaron Director, an economist from the mid-20th century, reached its zenith in the writing of the legal scholars Robert Bork and Richard Posner. Its proponents argued that many activities which were assumed to be anti-competitive were entirely reasonable strategies for improving corporate efficiency. They also claimed that in some cases even things which couldn't be justified that way could safely be left to the market to sort out without recourse to law. </p><p>Take \"predatory pricing\". Regulators thought that selling goods below cost so as to bankrupt competitors was malfeasance that had to be stopped. The Chicago school argued that it was a poor business strategy which would fail. Even if the predator crushed its competition, it would not remain a monopoly long enough to recoup its earlier losses. Instead, its high profits would attract new competitors. </p><p>Perhaps because, in the 1970s, American business had started to look more in need of help than hindrance, such arguments found favour with the American courts. And though the Chicago school's influence was more limited elsewhere, many jurisdictions, including the European Union, adopted one of Bork's central ideas: that the sole purpose of competition law should be to protect consumers. It is a view which forbids regulators from considerations of the broad public interest, limiting them to the busting of cartels and the prevention of mergers that create monopolies. Under this \"consumer-welfare standard\", competition cases turn on forensic analysis of \"upward pricing pressure\"\u2014ie, of the degree to which a merger or strategy will leave consumers out of pocket.</p><p>But has this approach led regulators to miss the wood for the trees? In 2016 The Economist pointed to America's high corporate profits and the rising market shares enjoyed by big firms as evidence that competition across the economy had waned. Later that year economists at the White House released a report making similar observations. A version of the trend can also be found in Europe. Research by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, finds that between 2000 and 2014 the share of sales accounted for by the top eight firms in a given industry rose by four percentage points in Europe and eight percentage points in North America (see chart on next page). </p><p> Many antitrust experts are unconcerned: industrial concentration, they argue, does not tell you how competitive the market for a particular good is. But some economists have blamed falling levels of competition for far-reaching economic ills, such as stagnant labour markets and growing inequality. In a paper published in 2019 the late Emmanuel Farhi of Harvard and Fran\u00e7ois Gourio of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago argued that the rising market power of big companies was linked to low interest rates and weak investment, factors shaping the whole economy.</p><p>As in the days of the Chicago school, other economists see these critiques as ignoring the role of efficiency. A recently published paper by David Autor and John Van Reenen of MIT, David Dorn of the University of Zurich, Lawrence Katz of Harvard and Christina Patterson of the University of Chicago argues that globalisation and technological advances have concentrated economic activity in a small number of \"superstar firms\". Because these firms are more productive, the industries which have seen the most of this concentration have also seen the fastest productivity growth.</p><p>It is when they are applied to technology giants that these arguments get most heated. In America the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, Congress and many states are investigating whether Amazon's dominant position in online shopping, Apple's immense profitability or the duopoly that Facebook and Google enjoy in online advertising can be seen as involving the abuse of the giants' market power. Google has been the subject of three separate competition investigations by the EU and fined ?8.2bn ($9.7bn). </p><p>Businesses built on \"platforms\", as Amazon, Facebook and Google are, raise particular issues when it comes to competition because they have two separate sets of customers. Amazon deals with both retailers and consumers, Facebook and Google with both users and advertisers. In the 2000s Jean Tirole and Jean-Charles Rochet, two French economists, laid out an economic framework for looking at such platform businesses which showed that their optimal strategy will often be to provide cheap access to one side of the platform and charge steeply on the other. Consumers enjoy free Google searching and Facebook socialising; advertisers pay through the nose to reach them as they do so.</p><p>Platforms existed before big technology firms: television, newspapers and credit cards are all platforms of sorts. But the internet has provided vast scale and reach. Adding users is cheap, and it is often the case that the more users a platform has the more attractive it becomes to those yet to sign up. A firm that attains critical mass becomes overwhelmingly dominant: winner takes all. </p><p>Does it matter if the winning platforms dominate the digital economy? In terms of consumer welfare it seems, on the face of it, a sweet deal: users get stuff which is of real value to them at a price\u2014zero\u2014to which no one can object. But on the other side of the platforms things look more worrying. A recent investigation by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority found that the cost of digital advertising for firms was worth \u00a3500 ($650) per household per year. Were the market less concentrated, those costs might fall\u2014and some of the savings would be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. </p><p>Another potential worry is that there are conflicts of interest in many big-tech business models, such as when Apple sells through its app-store software which competes with its own, or when Amazon collects data about the sales of third-party products with which it competes.</p><p>Perhaps concentration would be tolerable if the big firms lived in fear of usurpation by a hot new entrant. But startup platforms face growing barriers to entry. One is amassing the reams of data which enable firms to tailor their services to individual users. Another is that in the digital economy it is relatively easy for an incumbent to see what it is that users like about what a startup offers, provide something similar and push it out to millions (if not billions) of existing users. That reduces the incentive to innovate in the first place. A final worry is that wealthy incumbents can close off the possibility of competition by buying new entrants before they pose a real threat, as when Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. In the decade to 2019 the five largest technology firms made over 400 acquisitions with scant intervention by competition authorities. </p><p>There are, broadly speaking, two sets of ideas for reforming competition economics and antitrust enforcement in response to these worries. Adherents of the more radical call themselves \"neo-Brandeisians\" after Louis Brandeis, an early-20th-century American Supreme Court justice who thought the overarching purpose of government antitrust action should be to prevent any one firm from exerting too much power over the economy. Neo-Brandeisians such as Lina Khan of Columbia Law School and Matt Stoller of the American Economic Liberties Project, a think-tank, want to broaden the purpose of antitrust investigations beyond promoting consumer welfare. Governments, they argue, should not fear breaking up the tech giants; they should fear leaving them be. In this view the companies' size and power are a threat not just to consumers and workers but to democracy itself. </p><p>To its Chicago-school critics, Neo-Brandeisianism is \"hipster antitrust\", replacing a transparent and rigorous methodology with an ill-defined set of social goals. It might disempower technology firms, but it would empower regulators. If concentrations of market power should be viewed with suspicion, so should concentrations of regulatory power: they bring the risk of arbitrary and unaccountable decision-making. In America, its home territory, this debate is predictably partisan: neo-Brandeisians are listened to only by Democrats.</p><p>The second set of ideas for reform is more incremental. It seeks not to abolish the consumer-welfare standard but to reinterpret it. Carl Shapiro of the University of California, Berkeley, has suggested calling it the \"protecting competition standard\" to make clear that it takes into account all the harm that anti-competitive practices might do to consumer welfare, including that which is indirect or diffuse. </p><p>Applying this interpretation of the consumer-welfare standard to digital platforms means accepting that in some situations firms will naturally grow large, meaning that at any point in time there will be little \"competition in the market\". But there can still be \"competition for the market\" if a new, better product has a chance to disrupt the status quo. That might mean blocking more of the sort of early acquisitions which snuff out potential competitors, or reversing the burden of proof in such cases, so that the merging companies have to show that their plans will benefit consumers. It also might mean forcing incumbents to share some of their data, or at least making it easier for users to switch easily between platforms. </p><p>This agenda might not do much to satisfy neo-Brandeisian complaints about the political power of tech titans today. But it could succeed at making life at the top slightly more precarious. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-JF8N2BL</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HV-2MD1-DY2R-201R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

But last week that changed when the conservative, Australian-born media magnate and the left-wing US senator became unlikely allies in a quest to rein in America's tech giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Murdoch's Australian publishing house News Corp created global headlines when it provocatively called for search advertising giant Google to be broken up. The suggestion - in a submission to the Australian competition regulator's inquiry into digital platforms - surfaced days after Warren unveiled her plan to break up Google (and fellow internet giants Facebook and Amazon) at the South by Southwest conference in Texas.</p><p>News Corp is the owner of newspapers that compete with the publication you are reading now. And The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age have an advertising partnership with Google.</p><p>It is worth making one thing clear: the likelihood that Google (or any of its Big Tech peers) is actually forcibly broken apart in Australia probably falls somewhere between remote and nonexistent. For starters, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission doesn't have the power to force a Google break-up. Doing so would require new legislation. The appetite in Canberra to unilaterally split one of the world's biggest and most powerful tech companies, which is a prominent donor to both sides of politics, seems questionable. It would also invariably be challenged by Google in the courts.</p><p>Even in the unlikely event all of these hurdles were overcome, the break-up would only apply in Australia, where people tend to not enjoy being threatened with a different internet to the rest of the world. So, what are Murdoch and News Corp really up to then?</p><p>Playing hardball, as usual. The call to break up Google kept the pressure on the search giant, and made the ACCC's existing proposals to regulate it (and Facebook) seem tame by comparison. In December, the ACCC proposed a new body to scrutinise the opaque algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook's news feed, and their conduct in the ad market.</p><p>The tech giants and their supporters have dismissed the proposal as a weird, intrusive overreach. But now, all of a sudden, with the global media talking about a Google split, it seems relatively uncontroversial.</p><p>The call to break up Google consumed all of the oxygen last week, meaning another important and interesting suggestion made by News Corp passed by relatively unnoticed.</p><p>The company also proposed a system where Google (and presumably Facebook) could pay \"licence fees\" to publishers to compensate them for the benefit the derived from their content.</p><p>This appears to be a subtly different proposal to earlier calls from News Corp and Murdoch for digital platforms to pay publishers \"carriage fees\" - akin to the payments made by cable companies in the US to TV channel owners (such as Murdoch's Fox News).</p><p>The new proposal sounds more like the systems used around the world to decide royalties paid by streaming services and radio stations to songwriters and record labels. It would involve a new statutory framework, and independent economic analysis of the benefits of news to the platforms to help determine payments to publishers.</p><p>As for Warren, her motivation for taking on Big Tech is clear. The Massachusetts senator is campaigning to be the nominee for the Democratic Party at next year's presidential election, and clearly thinks there is mileage in this issue with voters. And so do key figures on the other side of the political spectrum including Republican senator Ted Cruz and even President Trump.</p><p>Whether the growing unease with the dominance of big tech companies in American politics translates into any concrete proposals to rein them in Washington is far from certain.</p><p>The US is also engaged in an unfolding, tech-driven cold war with China. Anything that weakens America's tech giants could give China the upper hand in the race to control emerging technologies that could be economically lucrative, and militarily critical.

But last week that changed when the conservative, Australian-born media magnate and the left-wing US senator became unlikely allies in a quest to rein in America's tech giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Murdoch's Australian publishing house News Corp created global headlines when it provocatively called for search advertising giant Google to be broken up. The suggestion - in a submission to the Australian competition regulator's inquiry into digital platforms - surfaced days after Warren unveiled her plan to break up Google (and fellow internet giants Facebook and Amazon) at the South by Southwest conference in Texas.</p><p>News Corp is the owner of newspapers that compete with the publication you are reading now. And The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age have an advertising partnership with Google.</p><p>It is worth making one thing clear: the likelihood that Google (or any of its Big Tech peers) is actually forcibly broken apart in Australia probably falls somewhere between remote and nonexistent. For starters, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission doesn't have the power to force a Google break-up. Doing so would require new legislation. The appetite in Canberra to unilaterally split one of the world's biggest and most powerful tech companies, which is a prominent donor to both sides of politics, seems questionable. It would also invariably be challenged by Google in the courts.</p><p>Even in the unlikely event all of these hurdles were overcome, the break-up would only apply in Australia, where people tend to not enjoy being threatened with a different internet to the rest of the world. So, what are Murdoch and News Corp really up to then?</p><p>Playing hardball, as usual. The call to break up Google kept the pressure on the search giant, and made the ACCC's existing proposals to regulate it (and Facebook) seem tame by comparison. In December, the ACCC proposed a new body to scrutinise the opaque algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook's news feed, and their conduct in the ad market.</p><p>The tech giants and their supporters have dismissed the proposal as a weird, intrusive overreach. But now, all of a sudden, with the global media talking about a Google split, it seems relatively uncontroversial.</p><p>The call to break up Google consumed all of the oxygen last week, meaning another important and interesting suggestion made by News Corp passed by relatively unnoticed.</p><p>The company also proposed a system where Google (and presumably Facebook) could pay \"licence fees\" to publishers to compensate them for the benefit the derived from their content.</p><p>This appears to be a subtly different proposal to earlier calls from News Corp and Murdoch for digital platforms to pay publishers \"carriage fees\" - akin to the payments made by cable companies in the US to TV channel owners (such as Murdoch's Fox News).</p><p>The new proposal sounds more like the systems used around the world to decide royalties paid by streaming services and radio stations to songwriters and record labels. It would involve a new statutory framework, and independent economic analysis of the benefits of news to the platforms to help determine payments to publishers.</p><p>As for Warren, her motivation for taking on Big Tech is clear. The Massachusetts senator is campaigning to be the nominee for the Democratic Party at next year's presidential election, and clearly thinks there is mileage in this issue with voters. And so do key figures on the other side of the political spectrum including Republican senator Ted Cruz and even President Trump.</p><p>Whether the growing unease with the dominance of big tech companies in American politics translates into any concrete proposals to rein them in Washington is far from certain.</p><p>The US is also engaged in an unfolding, tech-driven cold war with China. Anything that weakens America's tech giants could give China the upper hand in the race to control emerging technologies that could be economically lucrative, and militarily critical.

This news set off a seismic shift in how the public and congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle view Big Tech, opening up space for a necessary rethinking of its role in society and creating momentum for new efforts to protect consumer privacy and better regulate the major platforms.1</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unfortunately, the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook scandal also has renewed a very old and disabling fable embraced by many well-meaning people on the left, which is that Americans (and others overseas) keep voting for right-wing authoritarians because they are being manipulated by the media. I'm old enough to remember the 1980s, when progressives sought to explain Ronald Reagan's popularity by emphasizing the biases of mainstream media. Now, because many people are in awe of the magical powers of technology and lack basic literacy in how political persuasion works, a new fable is spreading-the notion of the \"Great Hack.\"2</p><p>That's the title of a new documentary about Cambridge Analytica released two weeks ago by Netflix. According to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Great Hack</emphasis>, by collecting thousands of data points on millions of individuals, and then building \"psychographic\" profiles linked to their personality traits, Cambridge Analytica was able to target voters with unprecedented precision. As Peter Bradshaw put it in an adoring <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/23/the-great-hack-review-cambridge-analytica-facebook-carole-cadwalladr-arron-banks\">review</url> of the movie for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis>, \"The data attackers could go all in, using their underhand knowledge to bombard these psycho-profiled targets, to push these persuadables' buttons and tip them over the edge with Facebook ads that popped up intimately on their smartphones, miraculously confirming their prejudices, playing on their insecurities, magnifying and warping their worries.\"3</p><p>The film gives an inordinate amount of attention to Brittany Kaiser, a Democrat who worked for CA's US branch as its business development director and then-after the revelations of the Facebook breach-apparently had an attack of conscience. According to her, until CA started working for Trump in June of 2016, his campaign had no data infrastructure or digital marketing apparatus, and no digital strategy. The inference, never blatantly stated but simply conveyed by all the tricks of modern documentary-making-striking digital graphics meant to illustrate how our data leaks into the hands of others, ominous music, and alluring close-ups of Kaiser as she watches the scandal unfold on television-is that Trump won because Cambridge Analytica gave him a secret edge.4</p><p>All of this is garbage. Kaiser first worked in politics as an intern on the 2008 Barack Obama campaign, helping its social media team-but <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Great Hack</emphasis> implies she ran Obama's whole Facebook operation. She is not the first person to pump a small role in that campaign into a career-making calling card; Cambridge Analytica is not the first political technology vendor to made big, unproven claims about its abilities. But we live in the age of silicon snake oil. There are millions to be made selling gullible investors and clients on mumbo-jumbo. Full disclosure: I got to see Kaiser pitch Cambridge Analytica's wares at close quarters, back in 2015 when the company was briefly a member of the civic tech center I help run in New York City, Civic Hall. I was not impressed.5</p><p>Evidently, neither was Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign, which paid CA millions during the Republican primaries. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Great Hack</emphasis> gives CA credit for Cruz's victory in the Iowa caucuses-and then makes no mention of what happened soon thereafter: The Cruz campaign stopped using its data. Chris Wilson, the campaign's director of research, analytics, and digital strategy, discovered that more than half the voters CA had identified as Cruz supporters in Oklahoma actually backed other candidates. Regarding the so-called merits of psychographic targeting, Wilson told me CA \"market[ed] their usage more aggressively than others and made unsubstantiated campaigns regarding its effectiveness.\" On Twitter, Wilson called Kaiser a fantasist back in 2016 for her claim that the Cruz campaign was planning to use \"psy-ops\" to manipulate delegates attending the GOP national convention.6</p><p>The closer one looks at Kaiser's claims, the more they dissolve into a young staffer believing the hype that her company's higher-ups asked her to sell. It's not for nothing that political scientist Dave Karpf, who has written two books on the use of data in modern campaigns, calls Cambridge Analytica \"the Theranos of political data.\" Eight different GOP political consultants told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ad Age</emphasis>'s Kate Kaye that the company was \"all hat and no cattle.\"7</p><p>Here's the bigger issue: When it comes to voters' decisions about their choice of candidate, most forms of paid political persuasion, including TV ads, online ads, mailers, phone calls, and door-knocking, have no discernible effect in terms of changing people's minds. That's the conclusion of a careful meta-review of 49 field experiments all looking at general election campaigns, published by political scientists Joshua Kalla and David Broockman in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">American Political Science Review</emphasis> in 2018. They write, \"The circumstances in which citizens' political choices appear manipulable appear to be exceedingly rare in the elections that matter most.\" Of course, all the people making money from selling the tools of political persuasion don't want anyone to know this. Why spoil a good racket?8</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Great Hack</emphasis> wants to make its viewers care about data rights and the dangers of modern misinformation campaigns, but unfortunately is itself a slick piece of misinformation that plays artfully on the prejudices and misunderstandings rife in its targeted audience. If the weaponization of misinformation was such a powerful tool for changing hearts and minds, why did the left win recent elections in Mexico and Istanbul? Why did Democrats retake the House in 2018? We aren't losing the war for the future because of some new media masterminds. If we're losing, it's because our message-and messengers-aren't connecting.9</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-320742</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-7YM1-DXR3-228J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1059\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>Aug 6, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

They say a complex set of laws that are designed to give users more control over their personal information will curb the power of Big Tech to track users across the web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But others warn that the rules, whose effects will extend far beyond the 28 EU member states, instead risk helping social-media giants Facebook and Googleconsolidate their digital power even further.</p><p>The GDPR makes it harder for companies to collect a broad array of personal data, from names and e-mail addresses, to browser cookies, IP addresses and location information. The rules also give Europeans the right to demand that firms delete their information. Companies must also notify authorities of a data breach within 72 hours.</p><p>The most important aspect for many privacy critics is the GDPR's requirement that companies get consent from users to harvest their data and explain in plain language what they plan to do with that information.</p><p>The new law comes with new powers for national regulators, who can fine companies up to 4 per cent of global revenues, or  20-million ($30-million), for the most serious privacy breaches.</p><p>\"There is no doubt for us that the GDPR is a game-changer, and that it will require companies to change their mindset and put the privacy of their users first,\" said David Martin Ruiz, senior legal officer for the European Consumer Organisation, an umbrella group of consumer watchdogs.</p><p>While the GDPR only applies in the 28 EU member states, the laws have implications for any company that collects data on European residents, even if they are headquartered abroad. Foreign companies that offer services or collect data on users in the EU who don't comply with the new laws could potentially face the same steep financial penalties as businesses based in Europe.</p><p>In the past month, Kirsten Thompson, a lawyer with McCarthy T\u00e9trault who specializes in data issues, has been inundated with calls from Canadians clients scrambling to understand what the rules mean for them.</p><p>Much of the public attention has focused on tech companies, but the law applies to a wide array of firms that operate in Europe. \"I have everything from regulated professional colleges, right through to construction companies,\" Ms. Thompson said. Some Canadian firms that assumed they were outside the reach of the European laws may be in for a surprise, she warned.</p><p>Although Canada's existing federal privacy laws are already in line with some aspects of the GDPR, the federal government may eventually have to look at overhauling its legislation or risk seeing Canadian firms blocked from accessing customers in Europe. \"One of the criticisms of GDPR is it imposes another state's laws outside its own borders,\" Ms. Thompson said. \"I expect there will be litigation around that.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, investors are closely watching what the rules will mean for digital advertising powerhouses Googleand Facebook. Both companies have unveiled changes aimed at complying with the new law and have promised to offer many of them, such as privacy features, to users outside of Europe as well.</p><p>Last month, Facebook chief financial officer Dave Wehner said he expected Facebook's European user base to flatline or even decline after the GDPR comes into effect. Financial analysts estimate both firms could risk losing billions in advertising income if enough users deny permission to access their data.</p><p>But the biggest risk may come from regulators and activists who are keen to make big tech companies a test case for the new rules. Googleand Facebook, which last year captured more than 80 per cent of the growth in digital advertising, \"are surely going to be on everyone's list,\" Mr. Martin said.</p><p>U.S. privacy activists are planning to work with their European counterparts to focus attention on U.S. companies operating across the EU, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a Washington-based non-profit.</p><p>Tech companies \"think they can get away with their business model without changing their practices,\" he said. \"This is going to be a serious war that will soon ensue.\"</p><p>Others worry that rather than cripple the power of Big Tech, GDPR will allow social-media giants to extend their dominance over the digital-advertising market by favouring its own data-gathering capabilities. \"Facebook has just become the biggest data broker in the history of humanity,\" John Battelle, a digital advertising executive and co-founder of Wired Magazine, wrote on his blog. \"It just doesn't want you to know that.\"</p><p>Googlerolled out new restrictions on the ability of advertisers to export some user data needed to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns across multiple platforms - while still allowing marketers to use that same data in Google's own in-house ad measurement tools.</p><p>Analysts with Credit Suisse predicted the new law would make advertisers \"more reliant on the larger internet services operators.\"</p><p>A separate battle is brewing between tech companies and media companies. Googletold publishers it was changing its policies around user consent for Google's advertising services.

This year's incoming class was 14 percent international. When this year's graduating class arrived on campus, that number sat at eight percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Living outside of their home countries, these students can face challenges as early as the application process itself that their American counterparts often never have to consider.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finances</p><p>According to sophomore Serena Chan, an international student from Hong Kong, most international students do not apply for financial aid. They fear that if they ask for financial aid, the school might reject them outright, she explained.</p><p>\"There's a perception that it's harder to get in as an international student because the application body is much bigger than it would be in just students from the U.S.,\" she said. \"[The process] was not need-blind, so it would encourage people to not apply for financial aid because that could possibly lower your chances of getting in.\"</p><p>The University states that its admissions policy for international students is need-aware, meaning that a student's financial circumstances are considered as part of their admissions process.</p><p>Junior Cindy Choi, who was born in South Korea before moving to Shanghai, agreed with Chan's characterization.</p><p>\"Applying for financial aid pretty much ensure[s] that you will not get in,\" she wrote in an email to The News-Letter.</p><p>The University also reports that only 10 percent of international students receive financial aid as compared to around 50 percent of the general student body.</p><p>This results in international students often paying more for college than American students, Chan said, edging out the less affluent applicants.</p><p>Junior Lily Daniels, an international student from Canada, wrote in an email to The News-Letter that when she arrived in Baltimore, she discovered that the Hopkins Federal Credit Union requires students to provide a Social Security number to open an account.</p><p>As a Canadian citizen, Daniels does not have a Social Security number.</p><p>\"I have struggled quite a bit in terms of trying to get an American bank account,\" she wrote.</p><p>In order to get a Social Security number, Daniels would have to visit the Baltimore Social Security office in Mt. Vernon. Because the office is only open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays and closed on the weekends, she would have to skip a day of classes to go.</p><p>As a result, Daniels has been forced to use prepaid debit cards as her main payment method for the past few years.</p><p>Visas and Work Permits</p><p>Last semester, junior Vinicius Lepca, an international student from Brazil, found his immigration status imperiled by a summer internship program he had joined.</p><p>The program had accepted Lepca without first placing him into an actual internship. This proved problematic when he went to fill out his paperwork, as he was required to demonstrate a link between his internship and his primary course of study for his work authorization. Lepca tried to connect the internship to his minor, but learned that minors were not sufficient.</p><p>In the end he got his work authorization. The process, however, had disappointed Lepca.</p><p>\"I feel like part of college is changing what you're interested in,\" Lepca said. \"I could see a situation where I get a good internship but then, 'Oh, you can't do it because it's not related to your major.'\"</p><p>For other students, simply getting into the country can sometimes prove challenging.</p><p>Although he has had no trouble renewing his visa since arriving at Hopkins, junior Junyao Li, an international student from China, has had such issues in the past.</p><p>During his senior year boarding at an American high school, Li was denied reentry into the United States from China.</p><p>\"I went back home for spring break, and then my visa expired, and I did not get it back until a month later,\" he said. \"I missed school for a couple of weeks.\"</p><p>Cultural Differences</p><p>While visa issues and missing documentation for banks are experiences which are mostly unique to international students, international students also struggle with homesickness and cultural adaptation to a heightened degree relative to their peers.</p><p>Dacia Gauer, the director for international students at the Office of International Services , explained in an email to The News-Letter that international students often report having issues adapting to American life.</p><p>\"Some of the common problems we hear about are adjusting to food options and the American diet, acclimating to the individualistic nature of the classroom environment that rewards personal achievement and missing family and friends from back home,\" she wrote.</p><p>International students often cope with these problems by getting involved in cultural, ethnic or religious groups to meet people from similar backgrounds.</p><p>Junior Faris Almaari, an international student from Saudi Arabia, transferred to Hopkins earlier this year. For him, being able to meet other Muslim students through the Muslim Student Association made his transition easier.</p><p>\"I remember I attended Friday (Juma'h) prayers during orientation week. It comforted me that I interacted with people who share a similar identity,\" he said. \"It helped me during my first weeks to meet other students outside the classroom.\"</p><p>In order to better respond to the needs of international students, the Office of Multicultural Affairs has recently appointed Emily Hickey to the new role of assistant director of diversity education and international student engagement.</p><p>The position was developed in order to demonstrate the University's commitment to the specific needs of international students.</p><p>In an email to The News-Letter, Hickey shared her hopes to use her new position to give international students a platform to share their experiences.</p><p>\"International students' stories being heard is a critical first step in successful support. International student stories will shape what the future of international student support looks like at Hopkins, not only for students gathering in community today but for years to come,\" she wrote. \"It is my hope to build a strong network of international student leaders.\"</p><p>This year also marked the first year that OMA was involved in orientation for international students, giving presentations, workshops and panels that covered cultural adjustment and immigration regulations.</p><p>OIS</p><p>The organization on campus that bears overall responsibility for supporting international students past all of these hurdles is OIS.</p><p>According to Gauer, OIS strives to help students navigate the often murky waters of living abroad.</p><p>\"It's quite common for immigration matters to involve a lot of gray areas where there isn't a simple answer. In those cases, we try to help the student understand all of the factors involved and how different options will impact them, and help them determine the best course of action for their situation,\" she wrote.</p><p>However, some international students complain that OIS does not do enough.</p><p>Junior Cindy Choi, a Chinese resident with South Korean citizenship, wrote in an email to The News-Letter that OIS has repeatedly let her down.</p><p>\"I live in China but am not a citizen, which means I have to go to Washington DC to get a Chinese visa every semester, and OIS does not offer any help with these kinds of services,\" she wrote. \"Figuring out a way to get my Social Security number after getting an on-campus TA job was also difficult and took way longer than it should have, particularly with the confusions regarding the inability to file for tax exemptions.\"</p><p>Likewise, Li says that OIS has not given him any help. He assumes this is because he went to high school in the U.S.</p><p>\"I have no interaction with that office at all. I think it's that they think I'm not international enough,\" he said.</p><p>He added, however, that he has figured things out well enough on his own and is fine without OIS's help.</p><p>Gauer stressed that OIS does its best to aid international students in whatever ways they can, but that the Office is always looking to improve based off of student feedback.</p><p>\"If they're unhappy with a particular service we offer, we want to hear about their experience,\" she wrote.</p><p>English as a Second Language</p><p>For many international students, English is a second or third language. Coming to an American university means taking classes entirely in English with English-speaking peers, a challenge that some international students initially have trouble with.</p><p>Li reported that when he first arrived in America for high school, learning English was one of the toughest hurdles.</p><p>\"Coming in I understood maybe 50 percent of the language, but it definitely got better, especially after a couple of months when you have to speak and everything is in English,\" he said.</p><p>But even for students more proficient in English, having conversations can be tricky.</p><p>Lepca said that when he first arrived at Hopkins from Brazil, he could not always communicate at the level he wanted.</p><p>\"The first month or so was a little awkward. I wanted to say something, like maybe crack a joke, but then I didn't have the right timing,\" he said. \"I would think about it, but then five seconds are gone, and then I'd miss it.\"</p><p>Why Hopkins?</p><p>Despite all the challenges they face, many international students say that it is definitely worth all the hassle.</p><p>According to Lepca, studying in the United States rather than in Brazil significantly broadens his professional horizons.</p><p>\"[There are] opportunities that I wouldn't get if I were back home, especially for my major. Computer science is starting to get a little bit bigger in Brazil, with startups and everything, but when you think of all the big tech companies, they have offices in Brazil, but they only do sales there. I would not get anywhere close to what I'm getting here,\" he said.</p><p>For other international students, universities in the U.S. offer areas of study which are unavailable back home.</p><p>Junior Faris Almaari explained how important this was to his decision to come to Hopkins.</p><p>\"One of the greatest opportunities I got here was learning Hebrew,\" Almaari said. \"I'm learning more about Jewish people, about Judaism, about Israel. That's part of why I came here.... I wouldn't find this opportunity anywhere, as far as I know, in the Gulf.\"</p><p>International students also seek out American universities for a sense of prestige and name-recognition.</p><p>Sophomore Serena Chan, an international student from Hong Kong, explained that by choosing Hopkins over equally competitive universities in Hong Kong, she was getting a more valuable degree.</p><p>\"These schools, whether it's in the UK or the U.S., have a global recognition. It allows you to basically be recognized all over the world if you have their diploma,\" she said.</p><p>Still, for others, like Choi, the problems facing international students at Hopkins cannot be overlooked.</p><p>\"The administration is genuinely disorganized and fails to effectively communicate with the students. A lot of the times, such disorganization causes frustrating complications for students, and it does feel like that the school simply neglects the specific problems of international students,\" she wrote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4321670</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFK-Y4Y1-DY7P-T0WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Johns Hopkins News-Letter: Johns Hopkins University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Baltimore</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MD</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Issuance of Visas</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mzg4RUQxNkU4QUZBNEJGNEE1NkFBMDk1QzEzMTE0QzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM5NTNBQjk2MUM3NDBCQ0E1NEU3MDI4QkY4NEVBNzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>ST0009JZ8</classCode><className>FOREIGN STUDENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009JY2</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

It did not go well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing, held by a House Judiciary Committee panel, featured almost five hours of sharp criticism by lawmakers of shockingly anti-competitive practices allegedly deployed by Amazon and three other dominant technology companies \u2014 Alphabet, Facebook and Apple. Although Republicans at the hearing seemed more concerned about instances of alleged bias against conservatives, members from both parties hammered Bezos and his counterparts for seeming to use their positions as gatekeepers of crucial platforms to advance their own interests, harm competitors and abuse the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The panel has been gathering information for more than a year about the companies' possible violations of U.S. antitrust law.

Amazon is responsible for about 40% of e-commerce in the United States and holds a similar lead in the market for hosting internet-based services. Alphabet's Google handles more then 90% of the world's internet searches, and its YouTube user-generated video platform is the most popular in the United States. Facebook is the world's largest social network and, along with Google, dominates online advertising. Apple doesn't corner the market on any products or services, but the only way to sell software and services to the roughly 1 billion iPhones and iPads in use worldwide is to pass through Apple's App Store.</p><p> The CEOs insisted that they face rigorous competition and are focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences for consumers. But lawmakers offered example after example of the companies appearing to use their market power to distort the competitive landscape, and the answers offered by the CEOs were singularly unsatisfying. Bezos, for instance, acknowledged that Amazon used data aggregated from other sellers on its platform to develop competing products. Alphabet's Sundar Pichai struggled to explain what his company's data policies were and whether it adjusted its search engine to favor its own products and harm competitors.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook sought to defend the company's practice of demanding 30% of the revenue app developers collect from their sales as an enormous discount from the software distribution costs of yore, as opposed to a toll that it forced developers to pay. And Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg had to admit that yes, his company has a history of buying up companies that it perceived as threats to its business.</p><p> One potential hurdle for Big Tech's critics is that U.S. antitrust law is uniquely focused on preventing harm to consumers, not to competitors. And because many of the products and services that Big Tech companies offer are free to use, it isn't automatically clear how consumers are harmed when the companies compete unfairly. That's an issue for Congress to explore.</p><p> In the meantime, though, the panel is assembling a powerful case for regulators to pursue. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have launched investigations into multiple Big Tech companies, as have many state attorneys general.

Alphabet\u2019s Sundar Pichai struggled to explain what his company\u2019s data policies were and whether it adjusted its search engine to favor its own products and harm competitors.  Apple\u2019s Tim Cook sought to defend the company\u2019s practice of demanding 30% of the revenue app developers collect from their sales as an enormous discount from the software distribution costs of yore, as opposed to a toll that it forced developers to pay. And Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg had to admit that yes, his company has a history of buying up companies that it perceived as threats to its business.  One potential hurdle for Big Tech\u2019s critics is that U.S. antitrust law is uniquely focused on preventing harm to consumers, not to competitors. And because many of the products and services that Big Tech companies offer are free to use, it isn\u2019t automatically clear how consumers are harmed when the companies compete unfairly. That\u2019s an issue for Congress to explore.  In the meantime, though, the panel is assembling a powerful case for regulators to pursue. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have launched investigations into multiple Big Tech companies, as have many state attorneys general. If Wednesday\u2019s hearing is any guide, the companies have much to answer for.

This could be a useful way to augment and support the role and efforts of public health contact tracers.</p><p>\"Contact tracers have very strict privacy rules, so we don't tell people, 'You were exposed to so-and-so.' We just say there has been a case and you have been exposed. It's once removed and people may not be very convinced by that,\" said Marcus Plescia, MD, MPH, the chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO).</p><p>\"It may be more compelling and people may be likely to take it more seriously if the person they know says, 'Hey, I've just been diagnosed with COVID, and you and I spent a lot of time together three days ago. You will probably be hearing from a health department contact-tracing staff, and you really should consider quarantining,'\" Dr. Plescia added.</p><p>Dr. Plescia recently spoke about why contact tracingone of the four signposts for safely reopening America that the AMA has laid out for proper reopeningis vital to slowing the coronavirus from spreading during a recent AMA COVID-19 daily video update.</p><p>You can stay up to speed on the fast-moving pandemic with the AMA's COVID-19 resource center, which offers a library of the most up-to-date resources from JAMA NetworkTM, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization.</p><p>Physicians can help slow spread</p><p>Dr. Plescia said physicians can help contact tracers and slow COVID-19's spread by stressing to patients diagnosed with the disease the importance that they stay home and limit contact with others in their household.</p><p>\"It's a really important message and physicians need to think about how to communicate that to their patients who test positive,\" he said. \"People listen to their physicians. They trust them.\"</p><p>Related Coverage</p><p>AMA to Congress: Antibody tests not the path back to \"normal life\"</p><p>Physicians can also help by being leaders in community settings, whether it is with local elected officials, an opinion piece in a local publication or in a faith community to which they belong.</p><p>\"I think we forget we have that very trusted, respected and earned status in society,\" he said. \"Use your authority and expertise to talk about how serious this is. Some people think this is nothing. We need people to say, 'This is not nothing. This is dangerous and we want people to be safe.\"</p><p>Technology's contact-tracing role</p><p>ASTHO and the Hopkins Center for Health Security issued a report in April, \"A National Plan to Enable Comprehensive COVID-19 Case Finding and Contact Tracing in the U.S.,\" that recommended ramping up contact tracers to 100,000. Now there are calls for 100,000 to 300,000 contact tracers.</p><p>A handful of states are where they need to be, but all states have started scaling up and bringing on more contact tracers, Dr. Plescia said in the daily video update.</p><p>\"If we can get to 100,000 by the summer, that'd be fantastic. We'd be just so much better positioned to take care of this epidemic,\" he said.</p><p>Dr. Plescia said he and his ASTHO colleagues are telling states to ramp up the workforce assuming that technology won't play a big role in helping in the trace contacting. While technology could extremely helpful and make the process more efficient, he said, it requires mapping and following people's movements.</p><p>Related Coverage</p><p>COVID-19 contact tracing, isolation are key: How to do them ethically</p><p>\"Some people aren't going to be comfortable with that,\" Dr. Plescia said. \"We've seen it be used very, very well in other societies, like some of the ones in Asia, but we need to tailor this to the United States. And I think we need to be cautious and get a better sense of how accepting people are of technology for this.\"</p><p>A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that a majority expressed doubts about whether big tech companies would protect the privacy of their health data.

Regardless of whether a startup or incumbent insurance firm uses technology-current or new technology--for strategic, tactical, or operational initiatives, the insurance firm remains an insurance firm and nothing more.</p><p>Might big tech take a bite out of the insurance industry? (Best's Review, May 2018) Possibly. That must be discussed by each major insurance line of business. But if any of the big tech firms want to enter the insurance marketplace, they must be licensed and regulated as insurance firms (intermediaries, (re)insurers) or partner with licensed and regulated insurance firms.</p><p>Incumbent insurance firms must realize, putting all the entrepreneurial enthusiasm aside and the level of investments in the startup insurance firms, that the startup insurance firms haven't reached into an alternative universe and extracted new technologies or new applications of technologies. I continue to recommend that incumbent insurance firms monitor what startup insurance firms are doing and copy the startup insurance firms only at the point where the incumbent insurance firm believes they can do so in a profitable manner--measured by insurance industry metrics for the insurance segment in question and never by technology firm/industry metrics. Moreover, when incumbent insurance firms decide to partner with startup insurance firms, the incumbents should never share their client list with the startup insurance firms.</p><p>I believe that the league tables--rankings by each major insurance segment--will remain the same for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Barry Rabkin</p><p>President and principal analyst, Market Insight Group Santa Fe, New Mexico</p><p>Reader responses may be edited for length and clarity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-545067090</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 545067090</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5STM-JTN1-DYTM-9225-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"313\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 A.M.

However, in many ways the shift retains the status quo. Page had already ceded significant responsibility to Pichai when Google restructured into Alphabet in 2015 and has stepped back<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>both publicly</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>and      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>within the company</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>in recent years. Pichai will now oversee Alphabet subsidiaries like self-driving car firm Waymo and health-tech company Calico, though all of its so-called  Other Bets  still account for      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>a tiny amount of the company s overall revenues and costs</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>and also still have their own individual CEOs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With Tuesday s announcement, both Page and Brin will remain on Alphabet s board and, most importantly, still retain the majority of the company s voting shares. Because of the company s dual-class stock structure, Page and Brin control 25.9% and 25.1% of Alphabet s total voting power, respectively, as of<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>its latest filing</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. The company told<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes</emphasis>that the company s voting structure is not changing with Tuesday s news.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>That means that while his official title may be gone, Page s role as a major corporate decision maker hardly changes. The founding duo will still be able to approve or veto any board-level decision. When Page didn t show up to the company s annual meeting in June,<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>one shareholder called his absence  disgraceful, </marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>due to his stake in the company. While the optics of Page skipping that event, or others like it, will not be as bad now that he isn t CEO, the crux of the shareholder s frustration remains.</p><p>Ultimately, a perception shift may end up being the most significant change to come from Tuesday s announcement.</p><p>As regulators in Washington and around the world increasingly scrutinize Big Tech, chief executives like Facebook s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter s Jack Dorsey, Apple s Tim Cook, and Amazon s Jeff Bezos have all appeared in D.C. So has Pichai. Page has not. Now that he s no longer an executive, he s no longer the one that lawmakers   including<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>angry Senators</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>  will call on.</p><p>Page and Brin are also stepping back at a time when<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>the super-rich are facing more criticism than ever</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. Both are billionaires many times over   with net-worths of nearly $60 billion by Forbes estimates   while Pichai is not. As Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both call for ways to limit personal wealth, Alphabet can better stay out of that political fray with Pichai leading the ship.\u00a0</p><p>Getting Page and Brin further out of the picture could also quell associations between Alphabet and their own personal ventures. For example, Larry Page is bankrolling a  flying car  company, Kitty Hawk, that is<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>facing a range of issues, including battery fires at its office</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. Meanwhile, Brin is      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>reportedly funding a giant blimp</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.\u00a0In the cofounders       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>announcement on Tuesday</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, they didn t drop any hints on what they d be doing with their newfound time other than to  remain actively involved as Board members, shareholders, and co-founders,  and  continue talking with Sundar regularly.  In that vein, both cofounders donate to philanthropic trusts through their family foundations, though neither have championed a cause, unlike Bezos, Zuckerberg, or Microsoft founder Bill Gates.</p><p>The announcement also comes as Google faces more internal strife than ever before, as employees clash with management on the company s business decisions and policies. When workers were protesting Google s plans to<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>launch a censored search engine in China</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>last year or the company s relationship with the      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>U.S. Customs and Border Protection</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, they raised Brin s background as an immigrant whose family fled a dictatorship as an argument against the company s actions. With Brin and Page stepping back, it appears that the perception that the cofounders would help guide that kind of philosophical decision-making is gone, too. (On the other side of the coin: Their departure may help repair the notion that Alphabet s attitude toward      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>sexual misconduct </marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>is skewed by its top executives  conduct, since Brin himself had      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>an extramarital affair with a Google employee.</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>)</p><p>While cutting off their management titles allows Brin and Page to remain further out of the spotlight than ever before, their real power is still tied to their majority voting shares.</p><p>After Alphabet announced the news on Tuesday, the company s after-hours stock reflected the concrete significance of their departures: It barely moved.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-5de719a0e84943000651a9ef</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XN9-NNY1-DXVP-531V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 4, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

This follows the broader GDPR regulations in Europe, as well as preemptive moves by companies such as Apple and Mozilla to restrict the power of internet cookies. Some within the advertising industry are even preparing for a so-called cookieless future.</p><p>What\u2019s often missing from the ongoing debate about such regulation and legislation is any consideration of how the internet pays for itself. As you read the news online or watch the latest binge-worthy series on your smart TV, you are likely paying for it by watching advertising. The more relevant that advertising is to you, the more valuable it is to the advertiser and publisher, and the more it can be used to fund great content.</p><p>For the select few, such as Netflix and The Wall Street Journal, a subscription-based business model works, for now. But in the great scheme of the internet, these subscription success stories are outliers and they will become increasingly rare. The latest research from Deloitte suggests that almost half of US consumers are already starting to experience subscription fatigue.Have you read?</p><p>The US want to regulate political advertising on social media 5 tips for online advertising</p><p>For all but the small minority of content providers who can currently sustain a subscription model, the internet is paid for with relevant advertising. This is no different from the way content has been monetized for decades. Whether it was soap companies marketing to 1950s housewives during hour-long daily television dramas or Pepsi sponsoring the Superbowl halftime show, almost all consumer content has had an advertising attachment.</p><p>While the balance between advertising and premium content has always been the value exchange of premium content, it is being tested in a more robust way on the internet, where data can be applied to make the relevance of advertising more precise. Indeed, it is estimated that the internet is funded by advertising to the tune of more than $35 per US consumer, per month.</p><p>But therein lies the emerging, thorny issue of consumer data control and privacy, now rumbling through the tech industry and consuming the time of regulators worldwide. When Facebook was marched to Capitol Hill to explain, in part, how data is used to understand consumer audiences in granular detail, politicians started to appreciate how digital marketing works and the wealth of consumer data that is being mined.</p><p>These are valid concerns: consumers should have comfort that their data is not being misused. Every time you search for something on the web, research or make a purchase online or express your views on social media, data about you is being gathered and stored. As more of that data is aggregated by a few companies, the argument goes, not only is your privacy compromised, but tech giants can use that data to exert growing control over the ad process, driving revenue to and from specific publishers.</p><p>That\u2019s scary, but advertisers come at this from a different perspective and it\u2019s important to consider how they approach funding great content while protecting the consumer. Many of the world\u2019s leading consumer packaged goods and automotive companies, for example, have a decades-long relationship with their most loyal consumers. They know that this loyalty can be destroyed in an instant if the consumer worries that their privacy has been compromised. At the same time, those consumers who understand their side of the value exchange are willing to engage in loyalty programmes, sharing information about themselves, in return for targeted value.</p><p>Advertisers understand this and have come to appreciate that privacy and relevance can co-exist in a digital world awash with data. That means using advances in technology to drive relevance and value in advertising without abusing consumer data. Some advertising pioneers are innovating with technology that will allow them to build anonymized patterns that represent their loyal customer base and understand where those patterns show up elsewhere in the market. In these emerging cases, relevance is all about anonymous patterns and associations rather than any specific form of identifiable personal information. These innovations have the potential to improve the consumer experience \u2013 perhaps we will finally get to a point where we don\u2019t all have to sit through hundreds of new car ads when only 5 million people in the US are actively looking for a new car at any given time. Perhaps we\u2019ll get to watch fewer, more relevant and more valuable ads.</p><p>This value exchange is not lost on big tech either: as Google implements changes to its Chrome browser to improve consumer privacy controls, it is doing so in a way that protects the ability to drive advertising relevance. Google understands the crucial role that advertising plays in funding the internet as we know it today and it won\u2019t do anything to destroy that value.</p><p>While new regulations can be helpful to consumers and businesses alike, we have to be careful about the consequences for the vast majority of digital content that is ad-funded. Without valuable ad dollars much of today\u2019s content, including great journalism, will not be sustainable. It is in the advertisers\u2019 interests to make their products as relevant to you as possible and to make your web experience as pleasant as possible. At the same time, they have a similar interest, and the technological ability, to ensure the responsible management of consumer data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2712060</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPT-0H51-F0YC-N55R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

So what is News Corp playing at?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Only a short time ago, if you had drawn a Venn diagram of Rupert Murdoch and Elizabeth Warren's policy interests and concerns, it would have looked something like two discrete circles with no overlap. But last week that changed when the conservative, Australian born media magnate and the left-wing US senator became unlikely allies in a quest to reign in America's tech giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Murdoch's Australian publishing house News Corp created global headlines <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/news-corp-calls-on-accc-to-break-up-google-20190312-p513iz.html\">when it provocatively called</url> for search advertising giant Google to be broken up. The suggestion - made in a submission to the Australian competition regulator's inquiry into digital platforms - surfaced just days after Warren unveiled her own plan to break up Google (and fellow internet giants Facebook and Amazon) at the high profile South by Southwest conference in Texas.</p><p>Disclosure: News Corp is the owner of newspapers that compete with the news publication you are reading right now. And The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age have an advertising partnership with Google.</p><p>Before going any further it is worth making one thing clear: the likelihood that Google (or any of its Big Tech peers) is actually forcibly broken apart in Australia probably falls somewhere between remote and nonexistent.</p><p>For starters, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission actually doesn't have the power to force a Google break-up. Doing so would require new legislation. The appetite in Canberra to unilaterally split one of the world's biggest and most powerful tech companies, which is also a prominent donor to both sides of politics, seems questionable. It would also invariably challenged by Google in the courts.</p><p>Even in the unlikely event all of these hurdles were overcome, the break-up would only apply in Australia, where people tend to not enjoy being threatened with a different internet to the rest of the world.</p><p>So, what are Murdoch and News Corp really up to then?</p><p>Playing hardball, as usual. The call to break up Google kept the pressure on the search giant, and made the ACCCs existing proposals to regulate it (and Facebook) seem tame by comparison.</p><p>Back in December, the ACCC proposed a new body to scrutinise the opaque algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook's news feed, and their conduct in the ad market.</p><p>The tech giants and their supporters have dismissed the proposal as a weird, intrusive overreach. But now, all of a sudden, with the global media talking about a Google split, it seems relatively uncontroversial.</p><p>The call to break-up Google consumed all of the oxygen last week, meaning another important and interesting suggestion made by News Corp passed by relatively unnoticed.</p><p>The company also proposed a system where Google (and presumably Facebook) could pay 'license fees' to publishers to compensate them for the benefit the derived from their content.</p><p>This appears to be a subtly different proposal to earlier calls from News Corp and Murdoch himself for digital platforms to pay publishers \"carriage fees\" - akin to the payments made by cable companies in the US to TV channel owners (such as Murdoch's Fox News).</p><p>The new proposal sounds more like the systems used around the world to decide royalties paid by streaming services and radio stations to songwriters and record labels. It would involve a new statutory framework, and independent economic analysis of the benefits of news to the platforms to help determine payments to publishers.</p><p>As for Warren, her motivation for taking on Big Tech is clear. The Massachusetts Senator is campaigning to be the nominee for the Democratic Party at next year's presidential election, and she clearly think's there is mileage in this issue with voters. And so do key figures on the other side of the political spectrum including Republican Senator Ted Cruz and even President Trump himself.</p><p>Whether the growing unease with the dominance of big tech companies in American politics translates into any concrete proposals to reign them in Washington is far from certain. It's been a long time since the bitterly divided US Congress produced any reforms of such a magnitude.</p><p>The US is also engaged in an unfolding, tech driven cold war with China. Anything that weakens America's tech giants could give China the upper hand in race to control a raft of emerging technologies that could be economically lucrative, and militarily critical, in the near future. As a result, expect to start hearing arguments that weakening 'Big Tech' could weaken the US geo-politically.</p><p>Then again, what's the use of geopolitical supremacy when your democracy and society is crumbling, in no small part due to the actions of a few giant companies?</p><p>The situation is fluid and unpredictable as underlined by the tragedy in Christchurch on Friday. Facebook's actions - or lack thereof - has attracted swift criticism at the highest levels.</p><p>With each such event, Facebook's position weakens and that of its media critics strengthens.</p><p>Reining in the tech giants is a deeply complex issue. Yet one thing about it is certain: with figures as diverse as Murdoch and Warren champing at the bit for action, it's not going to go away anytime soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520104577</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNF-RB51-DY19-C3HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Picking a fight with tech companies is not a smart move.</p><p>Critics have argued that the majority of powerful figures behind Google et al who champion consumer privacy are either diehard liberals or hail from countries where state surveillance is the norm (Google co-founder Sergey Brin, for instance, was born in Russia).</p><p>Yesterday's meeting is the latest in a long line of instances in which the Government has tried to make an example of such tech giants, from extremism to fake news.</p><p>MPs seem happy to try to blame big tech for facilitating conversations and hosting unsavoury content, but more reluctant to acknowledge their own failures in addressing the underlying social problems. The issue lies with the individuals spreading hate, rather than the means by which they spread it.</p><p>It's all very well to work yourselves up in a flap about the tech platforms not doing enough to combat hate, but it's not as if years of political misguidance have exactly helped.</p><p>Yes, Rudd wants to prevent terrorism, as do the vast majority of people in this world. Breaking encryption merely makes a tool for terrorists to exploit. The \"bad guys\" in this equation have far superior hacking power to our Government.</p><p>If you break encryption for the Government, you break it for everyone.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IINDUK-INMLMMGLSTRY000028398004-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IINDUK2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N6P-YR71-JCS0-D4SR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">379735</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"339\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Independent Print Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>i-Independent Print Ltd</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17013\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 31, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DAPY</classCode><className>CRYPTOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001710</classCode><className>TERRORISM</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4MDhDQ0I2QkY5NDU2Rjg1RDNEREFBODk1Nzg1QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY</classCode><className>Terrorism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

The agreement brings truce to an ongoing battle between WhatsApp[1], its owner Facebook and the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The social messaging startup which Facebook acquired[2] for $19 billion in 2014 has made it clear that it will share personal information of its users with Facebook until it can comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) drafted by the European Union. The GDPR is a wide-ranging protection framework that goes into effect in May and gives individuals more control over how their personal information is used by big tech companies across digital platforms. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bgr.in/news/sc-asks-whatsapp-facebook-to-not-share-user-data-with-third-parties/\">http://www.bgr.in/news/sc-asks-whatsapp-facebook-to-not-share-user-data-with-third-parties/</url> Also Read SC asks WhatsApp, Facebook to not share user data with third-parties[3] The commitment from WhatsApp to not share user information with Facebook[4] is outcome of an investigation conducted by UK's ICO in August 2016. The investigation began after WhatsApp updated its terms of service and privacy policy to notify users that the service would share user information with Facebook. The change in terms of service raised concerns globally with several analysts pointing out that Facebook will have access to data from the time WhatsApp began its service in 2009. 'People have a right to have their personal data kept safe, only used in ways that are properly explained to them, and for certain uses of their data, to which they expressly consent. This is a requirement of the Data Protection Act,' writes Commissioner Elizabeth Denham in her blog post. The investigation concludes that ICO would not be imposing a fine on Facebook since WhatsApp never intended to share information unlawfully. The announcement will serve as a big win for Facebook, which has been struggling with multiple issues at this moment. In particular, Denham notes that her investigation found several issues with the idea of sharing personal data[5] between WhatsApp and Facebook:1. WhatsApp has not identified a lawful basis of processing for any such sharing of personal data;2. WhatsApp has failed to provide adequate fair processing information to users in relation to any such sharing of personal data;3. In relation to existing users, such sharing would involve the processing of personal data for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose for which such data was obtained;4. I found that if they had shared the data, they would have been in contravention of the first and second data protection principles of the Data Protection Act.The undertaking signed by WhatsApp does not mean that data sharing is completely off the hook. After the GDPR comes into force in May, WhatsApp will continue[6] to share data with Facebook or any other Facebook company for technical support and security purpose.

India's data localisation regulations have caused a delay in the launch of WhatsApp's payments facility that the parent company Facebook is trying to abate. But despite the stalemate, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is optimistic about the expansion of the payment system on WhatsApp in more countries. WhatsApp Pay, as it is being called unofficially, will be rolled out in countries outside India in the next six months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm really excited about this, and I expect this to start rolling out in a number of countries and for us to make a lot of progress here in the next six months, Zuckerberg said at the company's earnings call on Thursday.  The response from one million users who participated in the pilot programme in India was the deciding factor for Facebook to introduce the WhatsApp Pay in other markets. Zuckerberg said that the momentum in the pilot programme, wherein so many of the people kept using it week after week, concreted the future of the service. He, however, did not say what markets will be picked for the rollout.</p><p>That said, the rollout in different markets will be full of teething troubles, as it is in India presently. Facebook has struggled to reach the middle ground with the government of India with respect to data localisation for the wider rollout of WhatsApp's UPI-based payments feature. </p><p>India's top bank, the Reserve Bank of India, told the Supreme Court back <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/whatsapp-pay-can-t-be-deployed-in-india-rbi-tells-supreme-court-1616974-2019-11-08\">in November last year</url> that Facebook's payments service is not compliant with the country's newly-framed data localisation norms. According to the rule, the foreign companies are mandated to store the data of their users on the servers installed within India. The data could belong to any feature or service, including the payments facility that requires user's details such as bank account.</p><p>WhatsApp Pay is based on the Unified Payments Interface, commonly known as UPI, which is managed by the National Payments Corporation of India. NPCI was ordered by the RBI to prohibit WhatsApp from rolling out the payments feature. The short-lived test programme is in abeyance until an approval is received.</p><p>The mandate to store user data locally, the big tech argues, will impact the smooth relay of information between different entities across the world. But despite that concern, companies such as Google, Amazon Web Services, Oracle, and Microsoft Azure have already set up their data centres within the country. Facebook, on the other hand, is yet to install servers in the country in order to begin with the process of storing data locally.</p><p>Facebook already offers payments service in its marquee app, Messenger, and Instagram in developed countries, including the US. The venture into e-commerce saw the launch of features such as Facebook Marketplace and Instagram Shopping. The company also launched its full-scale payment system called Facebook Pay for a seamless transaction between apps, besides the banks. Facebook also launched its cryptocurrency last year called Libra amid the controversy over privacy. </p><p>Coming to emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, and India, Facebook sees an opportunity to reach businesses in more than one way. Having small businesses succeed is not the only key to creating broad economic growth where everyone can support themselves, it's also important to maintaining healthy communities since small businesses are often where people come together, said Zuckerberg. The Facebook CEO said that WhatsApp's UPI-based payments facility will cover more than 400 million users, including the small and medium businesses in India.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202001/whatsapp_appstore_indiatoday-647x363.jpeg?LJu6SkuwT5P5Zx7gQpHIAqbSqBGyMXNX\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>WhatsApp payments to be launched in several countries in next 6 months: Mark Zuckerberg</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTOOL-1641943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTOOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4P-V1V1-JBF4-53W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470731</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><timeReceived>01:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 India Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>India Today Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11787\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0008UMH</classCode><className>RESERVE BANK OF INDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Since 2018, WhatsApp developers have been hard at work on the hotly anticipated WhatsApp Payments feature will let users transfer money across to friends, family members and small businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Related articles</p><p>As well as a nifty new addition to chat app users that should make splitting the bill at the end of a meal with friends much easier... the feature is also central to the way Facebook plans to monetise WhatsApp, given plans to put adverts in the chat app have reportedly been scaled down.</p><p>After undergoing testing during the past two years in India, the WhatsApp Payments feature began its long awaited rollout in Brazil in June. Brazil is WhatsApp's second largest worldwide market and seemed the perfect place for the Payments feature to dip its toe in the water before a wider rollout.</p><p>But not long after it was launched the WhatsApp Payments feature was suspended in Brazil by the country's central bank. At the time the Central Bank of Brazil the decision was made to \"preserve an adequate competitive environment, that ensures the functioning of a payment system that's interchangeable, fast, secure, transparent, open and cheap\".</p><p>READ MORE: TikTok and WhatsApp fans warned not to be fooled by fake messages</p><p> READ MORE</p><p>The news allegedly came as some surprise to WhatsApp with an insider claiming the two parties had been in regular contact in the run-up to the launch. While a WhatsApp spokesperson added: \"Our goal is to provide digital payments to all WhatsApp users in Brazil using an open model and we will continue to work with local partners and the Central Bank to make this possible. In addition, we support the Central Bank's PIX project on digital payments and together with our partners are committed to work with the Central Bank to integrate our systems when PIX becomes available.\"</p><p>But now, weeks after the WhatsApp Payments feature was suspended, it has overcome a major hurdle. In the past few days, Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello, director of Brazil's central bank, said WhatsApp will be allowed to relaunch Payments in the South American country.</p><p>According to Reuters, de Mello has confirmed the Central Bank of Brazil will authorise the launch of WhatsApp Payments as long as all the relevant rules are respected.</p><p>The BCB bigwig said: \"We view the entry of 'big tech' as a huge opportunity. Everyone can participate. We will allow it, no problem. People can take whatever path they want, whatever initiatives they want [ as long as rules and regulations are met].\"</p><p>Getting Payments off the ground and running in Brazil is the first piece of the puzzle as WhatsApp looks to bring the feature to users worldwide.</p><p>The chat app previously said they are looking forward to bringing the WhatsApp Payments feature \"to everyone\".</p><p>Outlining how the feature works in a blog post on its launch day, WhatsApp said: \"We have built payments with security in mind and a special six digit PIN or fingerprint will be required to prevent unauthorised transactions.</p><p>\"To start, we will support debit or credit cards from Banco do Brasil, Nubank, and Sicredi on the Visa and Mastercard networks -and we are working with Cielo, the leading payments processor in Brazil. We have built an open model to welcome more partners in the future. Sending money or making a purchase on WhatsApp is free for people. Businesses will pay a processing fee to receive customer payments, similar to what they may already pay when accepting a credit card transaction.</p><p>\"Payments on WhatsApp are beginning to roll out to people across Brazil beginning today and we look forward to bringing it to everyone as we go forward\".</p><p> Related articles WhatsApp users excited about playful new update will be disappointed All WhatsApp and Instagram fans need to know about crucial change WhatsApp announces five new features in iPhone and Android update</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXPONL-64617176</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXPONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DJ-4FT1-JCJY-G1R4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"660\"/><timeReceived>6:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Northern and Shell Media Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Express Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12327\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

No entanto, ele ressaltou que quando um grande ator entre no mercado, como \u00e9 o caso do WhatsApp, com 130 milh\u00f5es de usu\u00e1rios, \u00e9 preciso ter mais cuidado. Para operar como arranjo de pagamento, n\u00e3o era necess\u00e1rio autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o do BC. No entanto, no caso do WhatsApp o BC suspendeu e pediu para analisar a opera\u00e7\u00e3o.    \"Voc\u00ea pode come\u00e7ar a operar como arranjo de pagamento se voc\u00ea for pequeno para desonerar o pequeno, para ele n\u00e3o ficar como \u00f4nus de todo processo regulat\u00f3rio. Se voc\u00ea j\u00e1 embarca com potencial grande, o regulador tem que adaptar sua regula\u00e7\u00e3o para autorizar a priori isso, porque se voc\u00ea come\u00e7a muito grande, um segundo momento pode ser imposs\u00edvel de desfazer esse omelete, \u00e9 mais dif\u00edcil de corrigir\".    O diretor ressaltou que essa situa\u00e7\u00e3o vale para qualquer \"big tech\" e que o BC vai cumprir o mandato legal de garantir a competitividade e neutralidade do sistema. \"Sendo pr\u00f3-competitivo, os nossos regulados entrando com as regras e nos mostrando isso e, depois de checado com participantes do mercado que todo mundo pode competir, ser\u00e1 autorizado tranquilamente\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNPT-42589172311</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNWBR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BT-W891-F07F-82WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398829</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>O VALE</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Portuguese</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>13 Julho 2020 Segunda-feira</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>PORTUGUESE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>PORTUGU\u00caS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Brazil</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Issuance of Visas</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mzg4RUQxNkU4QUZBNEJGNEE1NkFBMDk1QzEzMTE0QzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM5NTNBQjk2MUM3NDBCQ0E1NEU3MDI4QkY4NEVBNzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC338</classCode><className>BRAZIL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GR122</classCode><className>SOUTH AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

No entanto, no caso do WhatsApp o BC suspendeu e pediu para analisar a opera\u00e7\u00e3o.   \u2014 Voc\u00ea pode come\u00e7ar a operar como arranjo de pagamento se voc\u00ea for pequeno para desonerar o pequeno, para ele n\u00e3o ficar como \u00f4nus de todo processo regulat\u00f3rio. Se voc\u00ea j\u00e1 embarca com potencial grande, o regulador tem que adaptar sua regula\u00e7\u00e3o para autorizar a priori isso, porque se voc\u00ea come\u00e7a muito grande, um segundo momento pode ser imposs\u00edvel de desfazer esse omelete, \u00e9 mais dif\u00edcil de corrigir.   O diretor ressaltou que essa situa\u00e7\u00e3o vale para qualquer \u201cbig tech\u201d e que o BC vai cumprir o mandato legal de garantir a competitividade e neutralidade do sistema.   \u2014 Sendo pr\u00f3-competitivo, os nossos regulados entrando com as regras e nos mostrando isso e, depois de checado com participantes do mercado que todo mundo pode competir, ser\u00e1 autorizado tranquilamente.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNPT-42588920522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNWBR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BT-W891-F07F-81KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398829</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>O Globo Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Portuguese</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>13 Julho 2020 Segunda-feira</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>PORTUGUESE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>PORTUGU\u00caS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Brazil</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>Issuance of Visas</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mzg4RUQxNkU4QUZBNEJGNEE1NkFBMDk1QzEzMTE0QzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM5NTNBQjk2MUM3NDBCQ0E1NEU3MDI4QkY4NEVBNzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GX036</classCode><className>BRASILIA, BRAZIL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC338</classCode><className>BRAZIL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GR122</classCode><className>SOUTH AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Pinho de Mello participou de uma transmiss\u00e3o ao vivo do jornal Valor Econ\u00f4mico.   \u2014 O Banco Central n\u00e3o proibiu nada. O Banco Central encara a entrada de agentes n\u00e3o banc\u00e1rios com muito mais uma oportunidade, mas a gente precisa garantir que seja uma oportunidade, n\u00e3o seja um problema.   O diretor relatou que o BC decidiu suspender a opera\u00e7\u00e3o porque n\u00e3o tinha as informa\u00e7\u00f5es necess\u00e1rias para garantir que a entrada do WhatsApp no mercado de pagamento n\u00e3o traria impactos negativos para a competitividade.   Na \u00e9poca do an\u00fancio, o WhatsApp informava que atuaria com as bandeiras Visa e Mastercard, os bancos Nubank, Sicredi e Banco do Brasil e a Cielo como intermediadora. J\u00e1 naquele momento, a empresa ressaltava que o modelo era aberto e estaria dispon\u00edvel para outros parceiros no futuro.   \u2014 O que o Banco Central tem que garantir? Foi ofertado para todas as maquininhas e s\u00f3 uma quis? \u00c9 fact\u00edvel e a todos est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel para participar desta solu\u00e7\u00e3o de pagamentos? Ou do modo como foi constru\u00eddo entre apenas tr\u00eas bancos, uma m\u00e1quina? A gente n\u00e3o sabe, por isso a decis\u00e3o de suspender.   Na semana passada, a Mastercard e a Visa, que s\u00e3o as entidades reguladas pelo Banco Central, entregaram a proposta de realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de pagamento pelo aplicativo. O documento cont\u00e9m as regras e as diretrizes de seguran\u00e7a que ser\u00e3o utilizados.   \u2014 Os entes regulados j\u00e1 vieram e colocaram o pedido de autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o que n\u00f3s vamos analisar, e garantidas essas condi\u00e7\u00f5es, que seja pr\u00f3-competitivo, para todo mundo, n\u00e3o ter\u00e1 nenhum problema em autorizar, mas n\u00f3s precisamos garantir e precisamos que as informa\u00e7\u00f5es cheguem de maneira formal com todas as informa\u00e7\u00f5es relevante.   Pinho de Mello relatou que a taxa de 3,99% que seria cobrada de empresas por transa\u00e7\u00e3o chamou a aten\u00e7\u00e3o do Banco Central. Atualmente, a taxa m\u00e9dia de transa\u00e7\u00f5es de d\u00e9bito \u00e9 de 0,9% e de cr\u00e9dito de 1,7%.   \u2014 Esse valor \u00e9 porque essa solu\u00e7\u00e3o tem v\u00e1rias caracter\u00edsticas que tornam o produto mais caro? Tem mais valor para os lojistas e ele \u00e9 mais caro? ou \u00e9 porque s\u00f3 poucos podem participar? Isso que n\u00f3s temos que nos assegurar. A entrada de um agente nao banc\u00e1rio \u00e9 bem vinda, traz oportunidades, mais competi\u00e7\u00e3o, mas temos que assegurar que trar\u00e1 mais competi\u00e7\u00e3o, essa \u00e9 a racionalidade por tr\u00e1s da competi\u00e7\u00e3o.   \u2018Big techs\u2019   De forma gen\u00e9rica, o diretor do Banco Central disse que a regula\u00e7\u00e3o tem que adaptar as mudan\u00e7as. Ele acredita que as \u2018big techs\u2019, com s\u00e3o chamadas as grandes empresas de tecnologia como Google, Apple e Facebook, ser\u00e3o um indutor de competi\u00e7\u00e3o para o mercado.   No entanto, ele ressaltou que quando um grande ator entre no mercado, como \u00e9 o caso do WhatsApp, com 130 milh\u00f5es de usu\u00e1rios, \u00e9 preciso ter mais cuidado. Para operar como arranjo de pagamento, n\u00e3o era necess\u00e1rio autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o do BC. No entanto, no caso do WhatsApp o BC suspendeu e pediu para analisar a opera\u00e7\u00e3o.   \u2014 Voc\u00ea pode come\u00e7ar a operar como arranjo de pagamento se voc\u00ea for pequeno para desonerar o pequeno, para ele n\u00e3o ficar como \u00f4nus de todo processo regulat\u00f3rio.
