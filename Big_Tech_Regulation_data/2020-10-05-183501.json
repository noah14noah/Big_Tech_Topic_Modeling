The companies have invoked this federal law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, in one court case after another to dismiss potentially costly lawsuits over messages, videos and other content created by users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now, big changes could be coming to Section 230 that might expose Facebook, YouTube and others to more lawsuits over hate speech and misinformation for the first time in their histories. If it happens, there could be sweeping repercussions for the internet platforms millions of people use every day. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As social media sites have become hotbeds of hateful, misleading and dangerous content, an increasingly vocal group of critics from government and civil society are pushing for changes to the law. Congress and the Justice Department are now studying the issue: Draft bills by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Josh Hawley promise to dramatically reshape Section 230, and the DOJ last week held a public workshop to debate the matter.</p><p>The push to rethink the law could become the latest flash point between Silicon Valley and the Trump administration. Together with state attorneys general, news publishers and online safety activists, Attorney General William Barr has elevated a campaign to weaken, if not repeal, the law, which dates back to 1996, years before companies like Facebook, Google and their peers were founded.</p><p>The proposals challenge the deeply held conviction in Silicon Valley that social media companies are just neutral platforms and conduits for information. And they could vastly expand the companies' legal exposure, not only to federal prosecution but potentially state and private lawsuits.</p><p>\"No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,\" Barr said at last week's Justice Department workshop. \"They have become titans of US industry. Given this change in the technology landscape, valid questions have been raised as to whether Section 230's broad immunity is still necessary, at least in its current form.\"</p><p>\"The 26 words that created the internet\"</p><p>The original intent behind Section 230 was to nurture startups and entrepreneurs. One of its key architects, Sen. Ron Wyden, said as recently as last year that without the law, \"all online media would face an onslaught of bad-faith lawsuits and pressure campaigns from the powerful.\" He's also said Section 230 encourages websites to remove objectionable content by creating a \"good Samaritan\" expectation: Under the law, tech companies can't be sued for trying to do the right thing, though the federal government can still sue platforms over criminal content.</p><p>The seemingly simple language of Section 230 belies the sweeping impact it's had on the tech industry. Under Section 230, \"interactive computer services\" are considered legally separate from the users who generate their content. They can't be said to publish or \"speak\" the words of their users. In practice, courts have repeatedly accepted Section 230 as a defense against claims of defamation, negligence and other allegations. In the past, it's protected AOL, Craigslist, Google and Yahoo, building up a body of law so broad and influential that Section 230 has come to be described as \"the 26 words that created the internet.\" </p><p>The Internet Association, a major trade group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google, has called Section 230 a \"fundamental pillar\" of the modern internet, saying it protects not just tech companies but all groups that offer a space for online communications, including schools, libraries, churches, or neighborhood organizations. </p><p>\"Section 230 enables services that allows internet users to post their own content and engage with the content of others, whether that's friends, family, co-workers, companies posting jobs, someone posting an apartment for rent, fellow gamers, or complete strangers from the other side of the globe with a shared experience or interest,\" the association wrote to Barr in a letter last week.</p><p>But the immense scrutiny facing Big Tech --- on everything from election security to privacy --- has created a ripe political environment for questioning Silicon Valley's most important legal shield. </p><p>Are tech companies doing enough?</p><p>At last weeks' workshop, experts clashed over how much legal responsibility tech companies should bear for hosting malicious content created by its users.</p><p>Social media companies say they're improving their ability to detect and take down content that violates their policies. \"Section 230 protects the good actors who are cutting off the bad actors,\" Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a trade group that represents many large tech companies, said at Wednesday's DOJ event. Without the law's good Samaritan protections, the industry argues, much of that good-faith moderation might end.</p><p>Weakening Section 230 could also force websites to vet every piece of content created by their users before it goes online, according to defenders of the law --- a task that only large and already powerful players like Facebook may be able to afford. Smaller, competing innovators that could break the grip of Google and Facebook might be snuffed out, said Patrick Carome, a lawyer who has represented tech companies in cases involving Section 230, at last week's event. </p><p>But critics accuse tech companies of abusing their legal immunity to turn a blind eye to some of the worst content on the internet. These critics allege that powerful online platforms allow harmful material to stay online because it drives engagement --- and profit.</p><p>\"Their financial incentives in content distribution may not always align with what is best for the user,\" Barr said at the event.</p><p>To help drive the message home, the Justice Department has turned to child abuse experts who say companies like Facebook must bear responsibility for the child pornography and sexual predators that lurk on its platform. </p><p>Facebook said it took action against more than 24 million pieces of child exploitative content last year. Most of it, the company has said, was caught automatically by Facebook's filters and that \"we remove much of this content before people see it.\"</p><p>Despite those successes, child sexual abuse content is still a widespread problem, said Yiota Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, at Wednesday's event. Last year, the non-profit group received about 17 million reports of online child exploitation, including over 15 million linked to Facebook, nearly half a million concerning Google and tens of thousands related to Microsoft, Imgur and Snapchat, among others. </p><p>One proposal backed by state attorneys general would amend Section 230 by giving them the power to sue platforms for hosting child abuse material, just like the federal government can. </p><p>\"We'll clean up your industry, instead of waiting for your industry to clean up itself,\" said Doug Peterson, Nebraska's attorney general, at the DOJ workshop.</p><p>A fierce debate heats up over the future of the internet</p><p>The Section 230 debate is tied to another politically charged tech issue: encryption, the technology that secures many everyday transactions ranging from iMessages to credit card swipes to sensitive business and government databases.</p><p>Souras said online child exploitation will only get worse if Facebook moves ahead with plans to encrypt all messages on its platforms, scrambling their contents so that not even the company knows what child abusers may be saying --- and to whom --- in private.</p><p>The thought of bad actors \"going dark\" has long been a fear of the FBI, which has asked companies like Apple for help decrypting the secure data of criminal suspects. But Apple and the tech industry have resisted. They've argued that giving the authorities a special way to tap into encrypted communications will encourage hackers and foreign adversaries to exploit the same tool. If that happens, it could ultimately weaken digital security for millions of Americans.</p><p>Some legal experts worry the Trump administration's push to impose new rules on tech companies could lead to broad expansions of government power. Those perceptions were reinforced earlier this month when Sen. Graham's draft bill on Section 230 began circulating around Washington. </p><p>The bill seeks to withhold Section 230's legal protections from tech companies unless they agree to implement \"best practices\" that would be designed by a commission and ultimately approved by the attorney general. </p><p>Technology and legal experts slammed the bill, saying it would give Barr a blank check to write his own regulations designed to weaken encryption, expand domestic surveillance, and force tech companies to undermine user security using the threat of lawsuits. </p><p>In other words, the deep, longstanding divide over encryption between tech and government may be driving some of the recent conversation around content policy.</p><p>\"Barr is cynically exploiting [child sexual abuse material] as a pretext for attacking the privacy of law-abiding Americans who would benefit from having secure communications tools,\" said Berin Szoka, president of the Washington-based think tank TechFreedom. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

View original post here[2]. Authored by Asher Schechter via ProMarket.org, The opening panel of theStigler Center's annual antitrust conference[3]discussed the source of digital platforms' power and what, if anything, can be done to address the numerous challenges their ability to shape opinions and outcomes present.  Play Video[4]Google CEO Sundar Pichai caused a worldwide sensation earlier this week when he unveiledDuplex[5], an AI-driven digital assistant able to mimic human speech patterns (complete with vocal tics) to such a convincing degree that it managed to have real conversations with ordinary people without them realizing they were actually talking to a robot. While Google presented Duplex as an exciting technological breakthrough,others[6]saw something else: a system able to deceive people into believing they were talking to a human being, anethical red flag[7](and a surefire way to get torobocall hell[8]). Following the backlash, Googleannounced[9]on Thursday that the new service will be designed 'with disclosure built-in.' Nevertheless, the episode created the impression that ethical concerns were an 'after-the-fact consideration[10]' for Google, despite the fierce public scrutiny it and other tech giants faced over the past two months. </p><p>'Silicon Valley is ethically lost, rudderless and has not learned a thing,' tweetedZeynep Tufekci[11], a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a prominent critic of tech firms. The controversial demonstration was not the only sign that the global outrage has yet to inspire the profound rethinking criticshoped[12]it would bring to Silicon Valley firms. InPichai'sspeech[13]at Google's annual I/O developer conference, the ethical concerns regarding the company's data mining, business model, and political influence werebriefly[14]addressed with a general, laconic statement: 'The path ahead needs to be navigated carefully and deliberately and we feel a deep sense of responsibility to get this right.' A joke regarding the flawed design of Google's beer and burger emojis received roughly the same amount of time. Google's fellowFAANG[15]s also seem eager to put the 'techlash' of the past two years behind them. Facebook, its shares nowfully recovered[16]from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, is already charging full-steam ahead into new areas likedating[17]andblockchain[18]. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/2018-05-12_13-06-26.jpg?itok=KsoEa8PE\">https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/2018-05-12_13-06-26.jpg?itok=KsoEa8PE</url> But the techlash likely isn't going away soon. The rise of digital platforms has had profound political, economic, and social effects, many of which are only now becoming apparent, and their sheer size and power makes itvirtually impossible[19]to exist on the Internet without using their services. AsStratechery[20]'s Ben Thompson noted in the opening panel of the Stigler Center's annual antitrust conference last month, Google and Facebook\u2014already dominating search and social media and enjoying a duopoly in digital advertising\u2014own many of the world's top mobile apps. Amazon hasmore than 100 million[21]Prime members, for whom it is usually the first and last stop for shopping online. Many of the mechanisms that allowed for this growth areopaque[22]and rooted inmanipulation[23]. What are those mechanisms, and how should policymakers and antitrust enforcers address them? These questions, and others, were the focus of the Stigler Center panel, which was moderated by theEconomist's New York bureau chief, Patrick Foulis.The Race to the Bottom of the Brainstem'The way to win in Silicon Valley now is by figuring out how to capture human attention. How do you manipulate people's deepest psychological instincts, so you can get them to come back?' said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who has since become one of Silicon Valley's most influential critics. Harris, who co-founded the Center for Humane Technology, an organization seeking to change the culture of the tech industry, described the tech industry as an 'arms race for basically who's good at getting attention and who's better in the race to the bottom of the brainstem to hijack the human animal.' The proliferation of AI, Harris said, creates an asymmetric relationship between platforms and users. 'When someone uses a screen, they don't really realize they're walking into an environment where there's 1,000 engineers on the other side of the screen who asymmetrically know way more about their mind [and] their psychology, have 10 years about what's ever gotten them to click, and use AI prediction engines to play chess against that person's mind. The reason you land on YouTube and wake up two hours later asking 'What the hell just happened?' is that Alphabet and Google are basically deploying the best supercomputers in the world\u2014not at climate change, not at solving cancer, but at basically hijacking human animals and getting them to stay on screens.' This 'fiduciary relationship,' in which one party is able to massively exploit the other, is best exemplified by Facebook, which is akin to a 'psychotherapist who knows every single detail in your life, including the details of your inner life, in the sense that it doesn't just know who you click on at two in the morning and what you post and your TINs and your photos and your family and who you talk to the most and who your friends are. It also intermediates every single one of your communications. It knows what colors your brain lights up to if I give you a red button or a green button or a yellow button. It knows which words activate your psychology. It knows an unprecedented amount of information about what will manipulate you. If there's ever been a precedent or a need for defining something as being an asymmetric or fiduciary relationship, it's this one.' Facebook's ad-based business model, Harris argued, is 'obviously misaligned' with its asymmetric power. 'Would you want to be paying that psychotherapist or would you want that psychotherapist to instantly take all that personal information about you, the most intimate details of your life, and then sell it to car salesmen?' 'The reason you land on YouTube and wake up two hours later [asking] 'What the hell just happened?' is that Alphabet and Google are basically deploying the best supercomputers in the world\u2014not at climate change, not at solving cancer, but at basically hijacking human animals and getting them to stay on screens.' It's not that Silicon Valley lacks in goodwill, he said. In 2013 Harris, then a product manager at Google, prepared apresentation[24]that argued that Google, while having the power to shape elections and societies, often exploits users' psychological vulnerabilities instead of acting with their best interest in mind. The presentation went viral and got Harris promoted to the role of 'design ethicist.' Ultimately, though, the company quickly reverted to business as usual. The problem, said Harris, was the incentive to maximize users' time and attention. 'If you're at YouTube, you're incentivized to getpeople to spend time on videos, even if those videos are conspiracy theories. The product manager\u201425 years old, going to stay at YouTube for two years, went to a good school\u2014their job is just to show on their resume that they made the engagement numbers on videos go up. Then you wake up two years later and YouTube has driven 15 billion views to Alex Jones' videos. That's not videos people sought out themselves. That's actually YouTube driving the recommendation.''The Search Engine Is the Most Powerful Source of Mind Control Ever Invented'Robert Epstein, a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology in California and the former editor ofPsychology Today, is one of only a few scholars who have conducted empirical studies on the ability of digital platforms to manipulate opinions and outcomes. In a2015 study[25], Epstein and Ronald E. Robertson reported the discovery of what they consider 'one of the largest behavioral effects ever identified': the search engine manipulation effect (SEME). Simply by placing search results in a particular order, they found, voters' preferences can shift dramatically, 'up to 80 percent in some demographic groups.' 'What I stumbled upon in 2012 or early 2013 quite by accident was a particular mechanism that shows how you can shift opinions and votes once you've got people hooked to the screen,' said Epstein. While much of the political and public scrutiny of digital platforms has been focused on the behavior of bad actors like Cambridge Analytica, Esptein called these scandals a distraction, saying, 'Don't worry about Cambridge Analytica. That's just a content provider.' Instead, he said, the power of digital platforms to manipulate users lies in the filtering and ordering of information: 'It's no longer the content that matters. It's just the filtering and ordering.' Those functions, he noted, are largely dominated by two companies: Google and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. SEME, said Epstein, is but one of five psychological effects of using search engines he and his colleagues are studying, all of which are completely invisible to users. 'These are some of the largest effects ever discovered in the behavioral sciences,' he claimed, 'but since they use ephemeral stimuli, they leave no trace. In other words, they leave no trace for authorities to track.' Another effect Epstein discussed is the search suggestion effect (SSE). Google, Epstein's most recent paper argues, has the power to manipulate opinions from the very first character that people type into the search bar. Google, he claimed, is also 'exercising that power.' 'We have determined, through our research, that the search suggestion effect can turn a 50/50 split among undecided [voters] into a 90/10 split just by manipulating search suggestions.' One simple way to do this, he said, is to suppress negative suggestions. In 2016, Epstein and his coauthors noticed a peculiar pattern when typing the words 'Hillary Clinton is' into Google, Yahoo, and Bing. In the latter, the autocomplete suggested searches like 'Hillary Clinton is evil,' 'Hillary Clinton is a liar,' and 'Hillary Clinton is dying of cancer.' Google, however, suggested far more flattering phrases, such 'Hillary Clinton is winning.' Google hasargued[26]that the differences can be explained by its policy of removing offensive and hateful suggestions, but Epstein argues that this is but one example of the massive opinion-shifting capabilities of digital platforms. Google, he argues, has likely been determining the outcomes of a quarter of the world's elections in recent years through these tools. 'The search engine is the most powerful source of mind control ever invented in the history of humanity,' he said. 'The fact that it's mainly controlled by one company in almost every country in the world, except Russia and China, just astonishes me.' Epstein declined to speculate whether these biases are the result of deliberate manipulation on the part of platform companies. 'They could just be from neglect,' he said. However, he noted, 'if you buy into this notion, which Google sells through its PR people, that a lot of these funny things that happen are organic, [that] it's all driven by users, that's complete and utter nonsense. I've been a programmer since I was 13 and I can tell you, you could build an algorithm that sends people to Alex Jones's videos or away from Alex Jones's videos. You can easily alter whatever your algorithm is doing to send people anywhere you want to send them. The bottom line is, there's nothing really organic. Google has complete control over what they put in front of people's eyes.' A 'Nielsen-type network' network of global monitoring, suggested Epstein, might provide a partial solution. Together with 'prominent business people and academics on three continents,' he said, he has been working on developing such a system that would track the 'ephemeral stimuli' used by digital platforms. By using such a system, he said, 'we will make these companies accountable to the public. We will be able to report irregularities to authorities, to law enforcement, to regulators, antitrust investigators, as these various manipulations are occurring. We think long-term that is the solution to the problems we're facing with these big tech companies.'Is Antitrust the Solution?In the past two years, a growingmovement[27]of scholars, policy wonks and politicians has argued that many of the challenges associated with digital platforms are related to market concentration and has favored increased antitrust enforcement, possibly evenbreaking platforms up[28], as a way to address their growing power. But is antitrust the best way to address things like addiction-enhancing business models? Kevin Murphy, a Chicago Booth economics professor, doesn't think so. 'First off, most of what we're talking about has nothing to do with concentration. These problems would exist absent concentration. Secondly, a focus on concentration as the bottom line of antitrust is misguided as well. The idea that we have some new world that doesn't look like things we've seen before, I don't know, I don't see it,' said Murphy. 'Would this be an easier problem to solve if we had 100 firms out there all trying to influence people using these same methods? It might be a much more difficult regulatory process in that world. It might be difficult to measure, difficult to regulate. It's not clear how this is related to the concentration issue per se,' he added. Similar arguments about the ability of technology to manipulate elections, Murphy opined, were also made in the early days of television, and concerns over market power were heard during the early days of the Internet. 'I remember the days where Yahoo was thought to have an insurmountable first-mover advantage in search, or [when] AOL had an insurmountable first-mover advantage in access to people's eyeballs, or [Windows] Media Player was going to dominate digital music. The idea that we're any good at predicting how these markets are going to move or any good at shaping how they're going to move seems to me to be odd. It also seems like a poor use of antitrust.' There is also the question of just what sort of impact digital platforms have on the economy as a whole. Contrary to their prominence in the political debate, noted Chad Syverson, also an economics professor at Chicago Booth, the rise of digital platforms coincided with a decade of historically low productivity growth. Tech firms often like to portray themselves as bucking this trend, but evidence of this has so far been slim. It is possible, said Syverson, 'the brain space dedicated to these companies, right now at least, exceeds the economic space that they fill up. The entire information sector, which is all of telecom, all of broadcasting, publishing, online and off, and some other sectors, that's less than five percent of GDP.' For years, tech execs have fended off possible antitrust actions by claiming that their dominance is not a competition issue, utilizing Alphabet CEO and Google co-founder Larry Page'sargument[29]that 'competition is only one click away.' The problem that faces antitrust enforcers, argued Thompson, is that it's 'kind of true.' 'You can go to Bing. You can go to DuckDuckGo, which doesn't track your information. You can go to other e-commerce sites. You can go to other social networks,' said Thompson. 'The issue is that customers don't want to. It's not that they can't. It's that no one wants to go anywhere else.' The services that platforms offer are vastly superior to what came before them, and network effects mean they can offer an overall better user experience than any fledgling competitor. According to Thompson, this is the paradox antitrust enforcers have to contend with: 'The bigger you are, the better you are, at least from a consumer perspective.'Concentration Really Does MatterResponding to Murphy, Yale University economics professor Fiona Scott Morton argued that while there have been similar concerns over technology's ability to influence and manipulate in the past, the difference is the precision with which digital platforms can target users at the individual level. Concentration, she said, is a relevant issue because of the massive influence currently held by a small number of actors. 'If there were 30 search engines and everybody was evenly distributed across those 30 search engines and each one had a bias, we would not think that anyone of them was perhaps tipping an election. That's the sense in which the concentration really does matter to the problems that we're talking about.' Responding to Syverson, Morton said that 'it is a little misleading' to say platforms are only a small part of GDP. The influence of their technologies on the rest of the economy, she noted, exceeds their actual share of GDP. While there are potential costs associated with regulating digital platforms, these are not necessarily larger than the benefits that would come from regulating them, Morton asserted. 'Of course, we're going to make a mistake, but we balance the mistakes of regulation. My photos aren't shared quite as well as they might have been. The search term doesn't come up quite as fast as it otherwise would because we've regulated the company away from innovating in that space. Then there's the cost of not regulating, which is our democracy doesn't work anymore, and we have to balance those two things. As a society, we're having a national conversation about how that latter thing is a lot bigger than we thought it was before.' Many of these challenges, Morton noted, are not strictly related to competition. When it comes to antitrust, she said, 'there's a little bit of a shortage of really tight theories of harm,' which is why, she said, antitrust cases against digital platforms have not moved forward. 'There's also a question of political will to bring those cases,' she acknowledged, but 'even with political will, you have to have a really good explanation of how competition is being harmed.' At the conclusion of the panel, Foulis asked the panelists whether platforms companies will be more or less powerful in 10 years. The panelists were divided. 'In 10 years, I think the surveillance business model will have been made illegal,' said Epstein, whereas Morton argued that platforms will ultimately become more powerful. 'I'm afraid that I believe that people with profit are really good at hanging onto their profit,' she said. Thompson also believes platforms will be more powerful. However, he said, 'I do think people like Tristan are the biggest threat to these companies. The reason is because their power accrues not from controlling railways or telephone wires. Their power accrues from people continually making affirmative choices to use their platforms. That's what gives them monopsony power, The way I think ultimately that power will be undone is through the political process.'

The senator, who has continually been forwarded as a potential threat to <person><nameText>Hilary Clinton's </nameText></person>seemingly preordained Democratic Party presidential nomination, took a tour of the manufacturing, prototyping, and shared office space, meeting and greeting some of the startups that call the facility home. While Warren has denied any intention of running in the 2016 Democratic primary, she has continued to gain media attention for her candid disdain toward\u00a0the meddling of Wall Street banks in Washington, D.C. Here is just one of many gems from a recent Bloomberg Business feature[1] on Warren: 'Today I am coming to the floor not to talk about Democrats or Republicans,' Warren began her speech, 'but to talk about a third group that also wields tremendous power in Washington\u2014Citigroup.' </p><p>With that, Warren turned Citi into exactly the kind of villain so many people suspect lurks in the backrooms of the Capitol. While the big banks' influence in politics seems to be the topic of discussion in media and beyond since the bailouts of 2008, few senators have been so brazen in pointing out the problems that come when big money combines with the big ambitions of politicians. So when I asked Senator Warren this morning, who had spoken at Re/code's Code Conference just a couple of days ago, whether or not she was concerned that some tech companies \u2014 that many may still view as startups \u2014 were gaining more influence due to their money and power, she did not hesitate in making her point. 'These are not startups, and that's the point,' Warren said. 'The question is, what happens when they become rich and powerful companies and what kind of policies do they follow, what do they ask for in Washington.' Referring to Greentown Labs, the senator said, 'For me, this is the best of what America has to offer: opportunity.\u00a0We make the investments in infrastructure, investments in research, and investments in education, and this is what it yields. It yields the people who are here in Greentown Labs, turning it into some extraordinary ideas, products, and changes for the future. That's a level playing field, and that's opportunity.' Warren went on: 'My concern always is when those who have money and power start to try to influence policies in Washington,' she said. 'Because the tilt then is not towards the creators, the innovators, towards the startups, but the tilt is towards those that are entrenched and who want to see laws and rules to make sure startups don't threaten them, who want to see laws and rules and make sure their profits grow at the expense of opportunity for others\u2026 That's the thrust of idea:\u00a0How are we going to get a level playing field, and how are we going to unleash the kind of creativity that our people are capable of?' I also asked Warren about comments she made at the Re/code event[2] about the growth of the on-demand workforce and their rights, especially for companies like Uber. At Code, Warren said, 'Our only chance for survival is to innovate our way out of this\u2026We're not going to stop tech so that lots of people will work. That's like saying, 'Let's get rid of heavy equipment and let people dig with a spoon.' That won't work.' When an audience member at the Code Conference asked her whether on-demand contractors should be classified as workers, the senator responded by saying that work is changing in America, but also that companies are using freelance contractors in ways that were not originally intended. 'I think it's a real problem,' Warren said. 'I think that [the] Department of Labor is looking into this, and I think they are right to do this.' Today, I asked Senator Warren if she stood by those opinions, and her points seemed to be more specific than the general statements she made at the Re/code event. 'Everyone should follow the same rules. The same rule on safety, the same rules on insurance, the same rules that make sure that both the public are protected and that workers have rights,' Warren said. 'We have to recognize that the workforce is changing. That the world is changing. That the old model that someone was gonna work for a corporation and be there their entire lives is shifting in America. And that means we need to make a lot of changes including changes in our laws and regulations\u2026 We can't stop change but we can channel it in directions that make things better for all of us.' Warren's comments hint that she is willing to draw a line in the sand between\u00a0tech companies that can benefit\u00a0all, and those only out to benefit their executives and VCs' personal wealth. As she was taking a picture with the staff of Greentown Labs before heading off to her next engagement, Warren turned to Emily Reichert, the incubator's executive director, and quietly said, 'What you guys are doing here will make a difference in the world.' She paused, gathered herself and the said in a louder tone to Reichert, 'A positive difference.'

Robert Reich, a former Secretary of Labor, has publicly agreed. </p><p>While it may be hard to see how Google and Facebook could be divided because each has one dominant business, a plan for how Amazon might be broken up is much easier to imagine. It already operates in three discrete enterprises that do not need to be together to prosper. Warren's argument against the three tech giants is that 'They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.' Her argument has precedent from over a century ago in the break-up of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust in 1911. It had a lock on the production, transportation and refining of oil in the United States. AT...which virtually controlled the American telecom market, was broken into pieces at the start of 1984. The government threatened to do the same with Microsoft. The two parties reached an agreement in 1994 that limited the way Microsoft operated some of its businesses. Amazon continues to be one of America's most admired companies[2]. Its customer service also ranks in the customer service hall of fame[3]. Amazon's original business was e-commerce. It dominates that industry in the United States and has contributed to the decline of the brick-and-mortar segment of retail. That, in turn, has triggered the loss of tens of thousands of American jobs. E-commerce continues to be its largest operation. Amazon posted total revenue of $233 billion in 2018[4]. Of this total, its North American e-commerce business contributed $141 billion. Its international business added $66 billion. A large portion of these domestic and international revenues are driven by Prime, a set of paid subscription services that have well over 100 million members worldwide. Among Prime's most significant benefits are a free streaming service, which is among America's most dominant, and a free shipping program. E-commerce is the first of the three parts that constitute the operation that makes up Amazon. Amazon is the world's leader in cloud computing, one of the fastest growing segments of the tech industry. It is the number one provider of these services by far. Its share of the public cloud business was recently put a 62%, followed by Microsoft at 20% and Google at 12%. The cloud division of Amazon is called AWS. It had revenue of almost $26 billion last year and made just more than $7 billion, for an impressive 27% operating profit margin. This is the second portion of Amazon that could be spun out into a separate company.The revenue for Amazon's third large and dominant business is rolled into its e-commerce operations, so financially, it is hard to identify. Amazon has a huge consumer electronics business that, among other things, dominates the artificial intelligence products market that consumers use in their homes. Amazon also sells computers, e-readers and streaming media hardware. Amazon's Alexa software can control home entertainment, communications, shopping and smart home services that include temperature control and bulbs and cameras that are voice activated. Estimates are that it has 75% of the global smart speaker markets. Amazon sells hardware run by Alexa. It is almost certain to move these products into the business sector. A review of these three parts of Amazon shows that they each hold a massive lead in their respective business. And each could operate independently from the other two. Reich argues that the three companies could be regulated. However, he further explains that 'A better alternative is to break them up. That way, information would be distributed through a large number of independent channels without a centralized platform giving all content apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach. And more startups could flourish.' While Google dominates the search industry and Facebook the social network segment, Amazon dominates three parts of the tech industry. That makes it the easiest of the three to dismantle.  24/7 Wall St. Top Stocks Have Dominated Since the Start of the Decade-Long BullMarket <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/investing/2019/03/08/top-stocks-have-dominated-since-the-start-of-the-decade-long-bull-market/\">https://247wallst.com/investing/2019/03/08/top-stocks-have-dominated-since-the-start-of-the-decade-long-bull-market/</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/disclaimer-and-terms-of-use\">https://247wallst.com/disclaimer-and-terms-of-use</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/investing/2019/03/07/small-grocery-chain-has-best-reputation-of-any-us-company-2/\">https://247wallst.com/investing/2019/03/07/small-grocery-chain-has-best-reputation-of-any-us-company-2/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2017/08/24/customer-service-hall-of-fame-5/\">https://247wallst.com/special-report/2017/08/24/customer-service-hall-of-fame-5/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-fourth-quarter-sales-20-724-billion\">https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-fourth-quarter-sales-20-724-billion</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TFS100006155230144432325176100207</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TFS-5001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM5-NBR1-F03R-N126-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><timeReceived>10:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>24/7 Wall St.</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That much is certain-as certain as the pension time bombs that plague state and local government and helped drive incumbent politicians to retirement.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;Mayor Rahm Emanuel decided not to seek a third term and Gov. Bruce Rauner, to much less surprise, lost his bid for a second. They will return to a private sector clouded by a slowing economy, stock market volatility and fears of further increases in interest rates.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;At least a dozen candidates are expected to make the mayoral ballot, a stark contrast to Chicago's long-held reputation for machine-made mayors. </p><p>If one candidate fails to capture 50 percent-plus of the vote, the top two vote-getters advance to an April 2 runoff. The municipal elections are expected to produce another shift: a City Council less beholden to whoever is mayor. Whether it includes its dean, 50-year incumbent and Finance Committee chairman Ed Burke, may depend on developments in a federal investigation of his office.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;In Springfield, House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton each will have veto-proof Democratic majorities to go along with a Democratic governor. Gov.-elect J.B. Pritzker, however, has tipped what may be the beginnings of a more-bipartisan approach by anointing a Republican state representative, David Harris of Arlington Heights, as director of the Illinois Department of Revenue.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;By year's end Illinoisans could be smoking marijuana legally.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;Here's what else to look for this year:lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; City officials will continue taking steps to designate tax-increment financing districts to help fund infrastructure improvements at two neighborhood-changing developments: Sterling Bay's Lincoln Yards site along the North Branch of the Chicago River and on Related Midwest's land along the South Branch between Roosevelt Road and Chinatown, where the developer has a proposed a 62-acre mixed-use campus called the 78. lt;/pgt;lt;pgt;#8226; Tech companies are hoping the IPO window remains open. Despite December'snbsp;slide in the markets, there are some very big names preparing to go public, including Slack, Pinterest, Lyft and Uber. Among the Chicago companies that might catch the IPO wave: Livongo and Sprout Social. SMS Assist also is likely to keep a close eye on the market. Chicago just finished one of its best years in recent memory for exits of venture-backed companies.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; The Chicago-area housing market, growing at a slower rate than most other major U.S. cities and punished by higher interest rates and property taxes, may slow further. For much of 2018, the extreme upper end of the market was in a more go-go mood than the housing market overall; a stock crash could change that. Will One Bennett Park in Streeterville, which will start delivering completed units in 2019, become the next \"it\" building where high net-worth individuals buy large numbers of condos, as they did with No. 9 Walton? lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; Post-Amazon, the city and state will be on the lookout for opportunities for Chicago to cash in on the move by the big tech companies to find new, more-affordable sources of talent and real estate outside the West Coast. Also expect the tech community to closely watch the mayor's race-and contribute. Despite the Amazon tax fiasco, Emanuel showed tech companies the love, and they got used to the attention.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; Downtown hoteliers, as well, are about to lose one of their biggest tourism cheerleaders in Emanuel. They had a banner 2018 thanks to another year of projected record tourism and a strong convention and trade show calendar. But things are going to be tougher in 2019. An off year for the biggest events at McCormick Place and a couple thousand more rooms slated to come online could water down room rates.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; Downtown office landlords enjoyed a surge in tenant demand in 2018, and they'll need it to continue. The redeveloped Old Main Post Office will add a couple million square feet of available space to the market, which will test the mettle of older buildings in the Loop that have been losing tenants to new and refurbished buildings. In the meantime, big new office buildings under construction will approach completion in the Fulton Market District in 2019.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; With the ordinances necessary to build the Obama Presidential Center in hand, look for a decision on litigation seeking to block it. Oral arguments are set for Feb. 14 in a federal lawsuit filed by the nonprofit Protect Our Parks, challenging the legality of the center's location on public park land in Jackson Park. Construction of thenbsp;$500 million project was supposed to begin this spring on the 19 acres it would lease for 99 years for $10. The feds also will be reviewing the plan, a necessary step before road reconfiguration set to start this year.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; Reverberations from the 2015 shooting of Laquan McDonald will continue. After Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder of the teenager in October, three other police officers await verdicts of attempting to cover up the incident.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; On the corporate front, McDonald's may face a shakeup in top U.S. leadership if the showdown between corporate and franchisees continues.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; Walgreens will continue to try to merge its bricks-and-mortar stores with online initiatives, ranging from partnerships with FedEx to a new digital platform that connects customers with telehealth providers. It may strike a wide-ranging deal with Humana to counter the CVS-Aetna merger of 2018. Still, the company is aiming to cut $1 billion a year in costs as it tries to fight ever-increasing reimbursement pressure and the specter of Amazon entering the pharmacy business.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; As the restaurant industry grapples with persistent worker shortages, packaged goods companies like Mondelez and Kraft Heinz are racing to offer innovation and healthier options while selling off old business lines that don't align with modern consumer tastes.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; And speaking of consumer tastes: With recreational adult-use marijuana expected to be approved this year, dispensaries and CBD-based items will continue to crop up with increasingly consumer-friendly, Starbucks-esque branding.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; In health care, the shift to out-patient services rolls on. Several Chicago area hospital systems are expected to open multi-specialty outpatient clinics and immediate care sites this year. The Rush system is debuting a $65 million outpatient center this week, and Northshore University HealthSystem is poised to spend up to $25 million on 20 new immediate care sites this year. Amita Health, Cook County Health and UChicago Medicine have each announced plans to consolidate existing physician practices into larger retail clinics that offer a range of primary and specialty care. Value-based payment models and rising health care costs have accelerated the demand for more affordable and accessible services. Hospital admissions and lengths of stay will further decline as advancements in technology continue to shift historically inpatient services to outpatient settings.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; Nonprofits and charitable foundations will be monitoring tax returns this year to see how much the higher income-tax deductibles effective in 2018-$12,000 for singles and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly-will affect financial support. The new deductibles have reduced incentives for some filers to itemize and thus make tax-deductible donations. Nationwide, annual giving could fall by as much as $20 billion, almost 5 percent of the $410 billion donated in 2017. lt;/pgt;lt;pgt;#8226; Several local venture funds are hoping to raise new funds this year, including Hyde Park Venture Partners, Math Venture Partners and OCA Ventures. Like everyone else, tech companies will be watching closely for signs of a slowdown in corporate spending, which fueled strong growth for many of Chicago's b-to-b tech companies last year. Watch for Grubhub's delivery partnership with Taco Bell and KFC to fully kick in, even as investors worry about what a newly public Uber and its Uber Eats subsidiary mean for the race to become king of ordering food by phone. Speaking of deals, don't be surprised to hear more chatter about Groupon, whose stock finished 2018 barely above $3 per share. Gogo, which also finished the year around $3 per share, likely will figure out in 2019 whether it's got much of a future as a stand-alone company.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; Meanwhile, the fate of Sears Holdings may finally be decided in a retailing industry due for more upheaval. On Jan. 4 company advisers are expected to evaluate bids for the venerable and vulnerable retailer that include a $4.4 billion offer from Chairman Edward Lampert's investment firm. Other bids are said to be from liquidation companies, which could mean that Sears goes from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 liquidation-and history.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; Another storied Chicago name-Tribune-also could disappear. Tribune Media, which owns WGN-TV/Channel 9 and other TV stations, has already agreed to a buyout from Nexstar. The long-awaited sale of Tribune Publishing, the other piece of the old Tribune Co. and publisher of the Chicago Tribune, could follow.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; A less-storied but still familiar name might fade, too: the Dan Ryan Expressway. Mayor Richard J. Daley named the South Side route after a now- (if not then-) obscure early supporter and Cook County board president, hardly the equal of the other expressway monikers Kennedy, Eisenhower and Stevenson. Now, nearly 60 years later, Daley's son William, seeking to reclaim his father's (and brother's) old job, has proposed changing the Dan Ryan to the Barack Obama. Expect a resolution this year, whether Daley wins or not. lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; Chicago just had one of its best years ever for new service at O'Hare and Midway, with 49 new routes added in 2018. O'Hare is benefiting from the continued expansions by United and American, the airport's two busiest carriers. The city likely will select and architect for its nearly $9 billion makeover of the terminals at O'Hare before Rahm Emanuel leaves office.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; In other transit news, the rebuild of the Jane Byrne interchange will grind on, and the $1.2 billion renovation of the CTA's Red and Purple lines will begin. It includes the building-displacing \"flyover\" at Belmont for the Brown Line.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; The Pritzker administration will have to grapple with what is likely to be an unwanted distraction, looming higher electric bills for consumers. The administrators of the multi-state power grid from Chicago to Washington, D.C., are pursuing policies as a sort of punishment for Springfield's previous major energy initiative to subsidize financially stressed nuclear power plants. Expect the state's large power player, Exelon, along with consumer advocates, to push for measures that could go so far as having the state take over from the feds the annual rate-setting auction that determines which power plants stay or close.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; And the Emanuel administration in its waning weeks will decide whether to proceed with a $10 billion refinancing of a piece of the city's enormous pension debt. lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; Further consolidation of Chicago's high-speed trading industry by mergers and/or shutdowns is a cinch, as is continued growth of the city's center-stage CME Group futures exchange with the absorption of London-based exchange NEX.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;#8226; A softening economy could make for leaner law firms. The Great Recession taught managing partners and committees to control labor costs by quietly trimming the ranks of lawyers. At the same time, Washington upheaval can mean more business for elite firms advising clients on tariff matters and changing federal regulations.lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;nbsp;lt;/pgt; lt;pgt;Crain's reporters Lisa Bertagnoli, Claire Bushey, Steve Daniels, Danny Ecker, Stephanie Goldberg, Greg Hinz, Lynne Marek, John Pletz, Dennis Rodkin and Brigid Sweeney contributed.lt;/pgt;

A group of major Chinese companies blacklisted by the US for building tech used to oppress and surveil Uighur Muslim people in China has been building out surveillance tech to track COVID-19.A new report by Top10VPN[2] outlines the questionable tech companies which have adapted to sell COVID-19 surveillance tech during the pandemic. On that list are a number of prominent Chinese companies that were placed on a US trade blacklist last year for building out surveillance networks in Xinjiang, a northwestern region in China where more than 1 million Uighur Muslims have been placed in detention centers[3].The five big tech companies blacklisted by the US in October 2019[4] are: Hikvision, Dahua, SenseTime, Megvii, and iFlytek, and are sometimes referred to as China's \"AI champions.\"Darren Byler, an anthropology researcher and expert on Uighur issues, told Business Insider these firms have been instrumental in building out the web of surveillance the Chinese state uses to monitor and demonize its Uighur population.\"Their surveillance tools and 'predictive policing' tools provided 'evidence' of what the state authorities have deemed Muslim 'extremism' \u2014 a condition that state authorities think of as a 'pre-terrorist' state,\" Byler said.Top10VPN's report suggests that not only are the firms flooding the market for COVID-19 surveillance tech, Western countries are snapping it up. </p><p>Thermal imaging and facial recognition Two of the main areas where these companies are pushing COVID-19 tracking tech are thermal screening and facial recognition technology.Top10VPN found evidence of thermal screening cameras from Hikvision being deployed in the UK and Australia.Facial recognition has been a key part of the companies' networks to surveil Uighur communities, and The Financial Times[5] reported in 2018 that Hikvision in particular had placed 1,000 facial recognition cameras around mosques in Xinjiang.Reuters reported[6] in April that Amazon had bought almost $10 million in thermal screening cameras from Dahua[7] to monitor the temperature of its warehouse employees. The blacklist the companies are on, called the Entity List, bans them from buying US-made parts but does not preclude them from selling to US companies.Thermal screening is not a surefire way of detecting people with coronavirus. The World Health Organization has warned[8] it is possible the tech will yield false positives. There are many reasons a person's temperature may be higher than usual, they might have just done exercise or be going through menopause. It is also ineffective for spotting asymptomatic coronavirus patients.The ACLU[9] also published a white paper in May warning that rushing to deploy patchy technology could infringe on civil liberties. \"Temperature screening should only be done if, where, and in ways that public health experts believe will actually meaningfully contribute to combatting the pandemic. Currently, experts say that there are sharp limits to its potential usefulness in detecting COVID-19,\" the ACLU wrote.Researcher Darren Byler said foreign governments buying this tech must recognize it's not only been funded by Uighur oppression but literally been built out from it.\"It is important that governments around the world understand that behind the COVID-19 surveillance tools that they buy from these companies are millions of Uighurs who provided the data on which aspects of these products were built.

For some companies, that means closing up shop.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The cost of complying with the new law has already forced an online game producer, a small social network and a mobile marketing firm to close key businesses or shut down entirely.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to any organization that holds or uses data on people inside the European Union, regardless of how big they are or where are they based. </p><p>Google, Facebook and other big tech companies will be affected by the changes, but experts say that smaller competitors are finding it much harder to comply. </p><p>Julie Bernard, chief marketing officer at Verve, said that the mobile marketer would shutter its operations in Europe because \"the regulatory environment is not favorable to our particular business model.\"</p><p>She said that while the new law would benefit consumers, it may also advantage large companies with the resources -- lawyers, data experts and programmers -- needed to make the transition.</p><p>\"The implications and ramifications of GDPR compliance will challenge numerous organizations ... with resources on scales smaller than, say -- and in particular -- Facebook and Google,\" said Bernard.</p><p>The new rules give Europeans more control over their personal data. </p><p>In many cases, companies need consent to process that information. They won't be allowed to store the data for longer than necessary, and they must respond to requests from customers who want their data deleted. Data breaches must be promptly reported.</p><p>Companies may also have to prove they are handling data correctly, meaning increased monitoring and documentation. Some may have to hire data protection officers.</p><p>Complying with the new regulations isn't cheap, and experts say the world's biggest companies are spending tens of millions of dollars to prepare. Smaller companies that do not have the same resources are struggling.</p><p>\"[They] don't have the apparatus and the team in place to actually really continuously support this kind of compliance,\" said Chris DeRamus, the chief technology officer at DivvyCloud. </p><p>Uber Entertainment, which makes online games, will shut down its Super Monday Night Combat game on May 23 because of GDPR.</p><p>The company said it would cost too much to rewrite the game, or migrate it onto a different platform. The current design, which was built in 2009, makes it difficult to delete data from user accounts.</p><p>\"We'll keep playable for as long as we are legally allowed to, but the day GDPR hits, we'll pull it down so as to be in compliance,\" said Jeremy Ables, CEO of Uber Entertainment.</p><p>Gravity Interactive, the maker of Ragnarok and Dragon Saga games, is taking a different approach: It will block Europeans from accessing its games.</p><p>Czech internet company Seznam.cz has said it will shutter its social network for classmates because of the regulation. It said the platform, which has 20,000 daily active users, would have to change completely in order to comply with the regulations.</p><p>European lawmakers have pushed back on suggestions that GDPR could give the biggest tech companies an advantage over smaller rivals.</p><p>Giovanni Buttarelli, the European Union's data protection supervisor, said that the biggest companies will also face the largest fines if they violate the rules. </p><p>The regulators can impose penalties on companies of up to (EURO)20 million ($25 million) or 4% of annual global sales, whichever is bigger.</p><p>\"Accountability and obligations in the GDPR are scalable, with data protection authorities empowered to enforce the law with rigor proportionate to the scale of the violation,\" Buttarelli said in a statement.</p><p>Experts say some smaller companies outside Europe might not yet realize that they have to comply with GDPR, because similar rules don't exist in their home market. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

For some companies, that means closing up shop.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The cost of complying with the new law has already forced an online game producer, a small social network and a mobile marketing firm to close key businesses or shut down entirely.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to any organization that holds or uses data on people inside the European Union, regardless of how big they are or where are they based.</p><p>Google, Facebook and other big tech companies will be affected by the changes, but experts say that smaller competitors are finding it much harder to comply.</p><p>Julie Bernard, chief marketing officer at Verve, said that the mobile marketer would shutter its operations in Europe because \"the regulatory environment is not favorable to our particular business model.\"</p><p>She said that while the new law would benefit consumers, it may also advantage large companies with the resources -- lawyers, data experts and programmers -- needed to make the transition.</p><p>\"The implications and ramifications of GDPR compliance will challenge numerous organizations ... with resources on scales smaller than, say -- and in particular -- Facebook and Google,\" said Bernard.</p><p>The new rules give Europeans more control over their personal data.</p><p>In many cases, companies need consent to process that information. They won't be allowed to store the data for longer than necessary, and they must respond to requests from customers who want their data deleted. Data breaches must be promptly reported.</p><p>Companies may also have to prove they are handling data correctly, meaning increased monitoring and documentation. Some may have to hire data protection officers.</p><p>Complying with the new regulations isn't cheap, and experts say the world's biggest companies are spending tens of millions of dollars to prepare. Smaller companies that do not have the same resources are struggling.</p><p>\"[They] don't have the apparatus and the team in place to actually really continuously support this kind of compliance,\" said Chris DeRamus, the chief technology officer at DivvyCloud.</p><p/><p>Uber Entertainment, which makes online games, will shut down its Super Monday Night Combat game on May 23 because of GDPR.</p><p>The company said it would cost too much to rewrite the game, or migrate it onto a different platform. The current design, which was built in 2009, makes it difficult to delete data from user accounts.</p><p>\"We'll keep playable for as long as we are legally allowed to, but the day GDPR hits, we'll pull it down so as to be in compliance,\" said Jeremy Ables, CEO of Uber Entertainment.</p><p>Gravity Interactive, the maker of Ragnarok and Dragon Saga games, is taking a different approach: It will block Europeans from accessing its games.</p><p>Czech internet company Seznam.cz has said it will shutter its social network for classmates because of the regulation. It said the platform, which has 20,000 daily active users, would have to change completely in order to comply with the regulations.</p><p/><p>European lawmakers have pushed back on suggestions that GDPR could give the biggest tech companies an advantage over smaller rivals.</p><p>Giovanni Buttarelli, the European Union's data protection supervisor, said that the biggest companies will also face the largest fines if they violate the rules.</p><p>The regulators can impose penalties on companies of up to ?20 million ($25 million) or 4% of annual global sales, whichever is bigger.</p><p>\"Accountability and obligations in the GDPR are scalable, with data protection authorities empowered to enforce the law with rigor proportionate to the scale of the violation,\" Buttarelli said in a statement.</p><p/><p>Experts say some smaller companies outside Europe might not yet realize that they have to comply with GDPR, because similar rules don't exist in their home market.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180501gdpr-tech-companies-losers1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S9H-5RM1-JBPX-W0B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><timeReceived>6:39 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 1, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And do we really want to give them the power to decide who and what is represented in this burgeoning global language?</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>BODY</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE CALIFORNIA SUN was shining brightly on the Kendall Jackson Wine Estate. Maggie Curry, the director of marketing for the biggest white wine producer in California, and a colleague were practicing their presentation in the boardroom close to the chateaux. Even though they'd been preparing for months, they were still a bit nervous; the big presentation, which they'd be giving on behalf white wine growers \u2014 and white wine lovers \u2014 was a mere week away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Imagine you're a woman texting a girlfriend to meet up at the pool, Curry told me. And imagine that your favorite varietal is chardonnay. If you text your friend the red wine emoji \"it's basically a lie,\" she reasoned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you use emojis \u2014 and if you do any electronic communication, chances are, you do \u2014 you may be aware that there is currently no white wine emoji; only red. For white wine lovers, this is a big deal.</p><p>It can cramp your style. And when you're left out of the conversation, it may even affect sales.</p><p>\"It's not just fun and games, emojis are serious,\" Curry says. \"They have the ability to have real global impact.\"</p><p>Used by 2.9 billion people across the globe, these little pictograms have the ability to communicate across countries, cultures, and languages. If you were to consider emoji a language, it would be by far the most popular in the world. Seven billion Facebook private messages a day are solely emoji. And 72 percent of people ages 18 to 25 say they find it easier to express their emotions with emojis than with words.</p><p>But the reason that Curry was practicing a presentation might surprise you: This emerging language used by so many is controlled by just a handful of people \u2014 the powerful and mysterious emoji committee.</p><p>The committee decides which emoji characters are added to almost every device and platform that we use around the world. That means that a handful of people select who and what is included \u2014 whether it's a skin color, a national flag, a woman wearing a hijab, or even a glass of white wine.</p><p>Who are the people behind this committee? How did they come to be the gatekeepers to the world's first genuinely universal language? What kind of emoji discussions are they having? And why do so few people know about this mysterious cabal?</p><p>THE EMOJI SUB Committee, as it's properly called, is part of the Unicode Consortium, the organization responsible for standardizing languages into codes useable for computers.</p><p>\"Unicode has sort of a reputation like a mysterious lord of the global keyboard in Silicon Valley,\" Curry says.</p><p>Besides being the high council in the emoji universe, the Unicode Consortium has the much larger task of translating all the world languages into codes that computers understand. Computers do not speak languages, they speak code. And in order for all computer systems to understand each other, you need someone to standardize these codes.</p><p>So who's in the Unicode Consortium? As you might suspect, it's corporate tech giants such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Huawei. Companies that normally are each others' biggest rivals are forced into one room to cooperate. Each tech giant sends one representative to sit at the table of this Supreme Court of our digital communication. They have to agree on standardization to keep miscommunication between the different carriers in check.</p><p>Think of it as solving the digital tower of Babel problem, says Lisa Moore, who has chaired the Unicode Technical Committee for the past 20 years.</p><p>\"So say you're texting your boyfriend and you want to say 'I love you' and you send him a heart, but what comes out on his phone is something completely different. You don't want that,\" Moore says. \"That's why all the main mobile carriers decided in the mid-2000's that it was urgent to start standardizing emoji. And that's where Unicode comes in.\"</p><p>This also explains is why there's one universal emoji keyboard. Different carriers might have their own emoji designers, but the meaning of the emoji is always the same.</p><p>\"Even though Unicode is the foundation of all text on modern mobile devices and computers \u2014 so all your Android phones, iPhones, Windows, everything \u2014 people still are not very much aware of it,\" says Moore. Think of Unicode like plumbing, she explains. \"You never talk about the pipes in your house unless something breaks.\"</p><p>THE MICROSOFT CAMPUS in Seattle doesn't look hip or vibrant like other, newer tech campuses. The tapestry lining the halls has a retro '90s pattern, and the computers would look old even at even a non-computer company. Here, behind closed doors, members of the emoji committee met in July. The committee meets four times a year and the different companies share hosting duties. This time it's Microsoft's turn.</p><p>At each meeting, the committee considers petitions from all over the world. (Proposals for new emoji can be made electronically.) The criteria for a new emoji appears inscrutable to some, but most proposals constitute several pages with data on the would-be emoji's importance, its potential to be widely used, and its distinctiveness. Then, after about four days of debate, decisions are made.</p><p>\"The simple answer to how you decide is: You get a diverse set of people discussing it,\" says Greg Welsch, a member of the Unicode board of directors. \"So the Emoji Sub Committee has linguists, designers, and software developers. Because you really need to look at this from all different vantage points.\"</p><p>But diversity is in the eye of the beholder. When I looked through the small window of the closed door at the Seattle meeting in July, I saw mostly white male engineers from California.</p><p>It is these men whom Curry hoped to convince about the importance of the white wine emoji. Which is why she waited in the Hyatt hotel next to the campus, with several cases of wine, ready to give away.</p><p>From the other side of the door, I could only guess at what the committee discussed. But it must have been wildly fascinating. Should the black cat have its own emoji, next to the white cat? And what to do with the request for a character with an afro? Is it an essential addition or the beginning of an endless stream of requests for specific hairstyles? And how about an emoji for the flag of Kurdistan \u2014 it does not now exist, but there's been a request for this flag emoji for years. Do the Kurds deserve to have their flag on the global keyboard with other nations?</p><p>\"Flags have been a challenge for us to figure out, because flags are so closely associated with self identity. It's explosive,\" Moore says. \"Sometimes it is politically very challenging, because do you want to pick sides? We would prefer not to.\"</p><p>After the nightclub shooting in Orlando in 2016, Unicode responded hastily to the request to add an emoji for the LGBTQ+ flag. It was the first non-geographical flag in the keyboard and in hindsight became a Trojan horse. The floodgate to representation through flag emojis was open. Because if the gay community is included in the emoji dictionary, why should other communities not be?</p><p>\"I can't understate how important that dictionary is .\u00a0.\u00a0. to have no way of saying 'this is me,' it is very frustrating,\" says Tea Uglow, who has been advocating for the inclusion of a transgender flag emoji for four years. Each time she has proposed it, it has been rejected. In July, she again proposed the blue/pink/white-striped flag. Uglow, a transgender woman, believes a transgender flag emoji it is an effective way to communicate to teenagers who are struggling with their gender identity.</p><p>\"I got annoyed that I have no way of signaling to a generation of kids .\u00a0.\u00a0. who might feel like they are on their own, that they are not on their own,\" Uglow says. \"They have family all around the world who will look out for them.\"</p><p>When Unicode added the lobster emoji in 2018, the trans community claimed it as their temporary emoji representation, because lobsters have both male and female reproductive organs. But the fact that Unicode responded to crustacean lovers \u2014 who, frustrated and confused by having only a choice between a crab or a shrimp lobbied for a lobster emoji \u2014 and not to Uglow's request for a transgender flag emoji hurt feelings in the trans community.</p><p>\"Rejecting the emoji is in a way saying that there are not enough of us to be represented. And if you don't even exist in a language, that is in fact a way to erase a minority from existence,\" Uglow says.</p><p>Uglow waited anxiously to hear whether her most recent proposal would be approved. If not this time, she'll try again, and again, for as many times it takes. \"It seems silly [to say] that some pixels would save lives, but to suicidal, depressed, trans kids, it makes an enormous difference,\" she said. \"It makes all the difference.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Curry and her colleague waited in the Hyatt hotel next to where the emoji vote was taking place. They received a text message that the white wine emoji might not make it to a vote this time \u2014 the emoji agenda was too full. Also the committee decided not to receive them for their presentation. But the women tried to remain\u00a0in good spirits and raised their glasses to a good outcome \u2014 glasses of chardonnay, of course.</p><p>About 60 new emojis are added each year. Because emojis are never removed, there are now 3,019 emojis in the Unicode Standard. The committee must weigh carefully which new proposals are the most important. Are there enough white wine lovers to justify an addition? And how to weigh the significance of the transgender flag emoji?</p><p>BUT THERE'S A larger question\u00a0that needs to be asked: Whether a small group of people, mainly white American men from the West Coast, should be the gatekeepers of this emerging universal digital language.</p><p>\"Imagine if you wanted to send somebody a letter and you had to pick a greeting card from the store but you couldn't add any other text to it. And imagine that the list of greeting cards is chosen by the very best plumbers of Cleveland, Ohio,\" says Keith Winstein, a professor of computer science at Stanford. \"That's kind of what we have with the Unicode Committee.\"</p><p>Winstein points out that a proposed menstruation emoji was rejected by the committee, while an emoji for mate tea made the cut. \"If you believe emoji is an emerging world language, it shouldn't be decided upon by a bunch of predominantly white, male, American text encoding engineers in California. That's just not a good way to run a language.\"</p><p>(While the original menstruation emoji was rejected, an emoji of a drop of blood was approved this summer.)</p><p>Unicode board member Welsch pushes back against the notion that the emoji library must be all-inclusive.</p><p>\"If you want a send a depiction of your family down to hair color, eye color, skin tone, in a text you can easily do it,\" he says, sounding annoyed. \"It's called a photograph.\"</p><p>Welsch also emphasizes that if it hadn't been for Unicode, emojis would have never taken off like they did. \"Emoji would not be as widely used if 50 percent of the time the recipient got an empty box,\" he says. \"Why it works is because of Unicode.\" Which is true, but doesn't override the concerns over those who believe that the emoji committee should be more transparent and that the approval process shouldn't be in the hands of so few.</p><p>So what if we don't want our universal pictorial dictionary in the hands of these white, male, American engineers? Then who do we give this power to? Should it be a libertarian system? Perhaps an informal commons? Should there be something like an emoji United Nations in which many people with different interests are represented?</p><p>EMOJIS HAVE THE ability to shift a conversation. When Apple released the gay couple emojis in 2012, it did not sit well with the Russian government. Since \"promotion\" of non-heterosexual relationships is prohibited in Russia, the government threatened to ban the emojis and the devices that supported them. That didn't happen; the emojis remain, and are in use in other countries not considered to be gay-friendly. And Unicode even just approved gender neutral couple emojis. An emoji UN would never have allowed this to happen.</p><p>But the tech companies don't always resist outside pressure. There is no Tibetan flag emoji and there are no signs of it being approved any time soon. The most probable reason is that the emoji would anger the Chinese government, which is not something that is in the interest of any of the big tech companies behind Unicode.</p><p>\"You have to remember that emoji, like many things on the Internet, is this new thing born out of nothing,\" Uglow said. \"I'm not sure if I'd want governments running this. I'm not sure whether I would want any particular one nationality running it. I certainly wouldn't want it to be a popular vote. Because honestly .\u00a0.\u00a0. The Internet can be a scary place and there should be some guardrails.\"</p><p>While the emoji committee and the resulting gridlock might be news to you, guardrailing and gatekeeping are already top of mind when we talk about the big tech companies. With the dangers of fake news on one hand, and the dangers of limiting freedom of speech on the other, it is a difficult discussion that doesn't seem to have an easy answer. Facebook recently declared it would not limit any political campaigning on its platform under the guise of freedom of speech, while Twitter just announced it will ban all political advertising, saying misleading messages can damage civic discourse.</p><p>\"I think we have to reckon with the fact that the libertarian idea of regulating the Internet that was the dream in the early '90's hasn't turned out so great, in all respects,\" Winstein says. The fact that anyone, including hostile foreign governments, can create content that looks like news, but is actually designed to create confusion and polarize communities, has indeed not turned out so great. So what to do?</p><p>\"The idea that there may need to be moderation or that someone has responsibility for this medium is definitely growing in cultural consciousness,\" Winstein says. \"Whether the people that control the medium should be the world's largest corporations? Probably not. But should it be the world's largest governments? That doesn't sound so great either.\"</p><p>Will any governments fall or rise because of emojis? Probably not. But looking deeper into the world of yellow smileys does give us another way of entering the important discussion about who and how we should regulate speech in the digital common.</p><p>Meanwhile, the transgender flag finally made it to the final list of proposals. Whether it will make the final cut for Unicode 14.0, we will have to wait and see. The white wine emoji was rejected. The committee told Curry that it thought approving a white wine emoji would open the floodgates for all different types of beverages. Curry was frustrated and disappointed, but assured me that in the end, she remains a glass half full kind of person.</p><p>Mea Dols de Jong is a documentary filmmaker based in Amsterdam and was a 2019 Nieman Fellow at Harvard.

I have a nephew whose band will play at Carnegie Hall soon. Carnegie Mellon University and dozens of other universities owe their lives to his generosity.</p><p>But extreme wealth can have a self-sustaining quality to it. It can keep growing, even when you're trying hard to give your wealth away. Carnegie's philanthropy began after he sold his company to become part of U.S. Steel for $480 million in 1901 dollars. He wound up giving away 10 times that much.</p><p>That's also the secret behind <person><nameText>Bill Gates</nameText></person>' return to the top of<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2014/03/03/inside-the-2014-forbes-billionaires-list-facts-and-figures/\">Forbes' billionaires list</url>.\u00a0</p><p>It's also the secret of <person><nameText>Warren Buffett's </nameText></person>continuing relevance.</p><p>Gates didn't hang around the office much in 2013. Instead he spent most of his time at his<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Gates Foundation</url>working to end dread diseases, aid developing countries and improve education -- to become a 21st century Carnegie.</p><p>Despite this, he managed to take back his title of world's richest person from Mexico's Carlos Slim. (Gates has $76 billion vs. Slim's $72 billion.) American media celebrated like we'd won something.</p><p>His was not a case of special genius, however. Gates mainly stayed invested in the stock of the company he co-founded in the 1970s, Microsoft . The shares rose over 35% during the year, from the mid-s$20 to the mid-s$30, and his fortune increased by $9 billion as a result.</p><p>This may be Gates' last appearance at the top of the charts, however. He's moving from the passive role of chairman to a more active role as adviser to incoming CEO <person><nameText>Satya Nadella. </nameText></person>Last year's gains may prove hard to sustain as the cloud grows, as Microsoft devices continue to struggle and as the PC market continues to shrink.</p><p>Buffett, meanwhile, clocked in at number four on the billionaire hit parade, with $58.2 billion.</p><p>Buffett hopes to give his fortune away through Gates' foundation, but that job gets harder as the hoard gets bigger. Imagine -- Gates now has to find a way to put over $130 billion to work for good causes. What 2013 shows is that job may actually grow.</p><p>Buffett's<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf\">annual letter</url>to Berkshire-Hathaway shareholders shows him taking a very conservative tack. His big investments are in insurance, regulated utilities, financial companies and manufacturing. He admits to not understanding technology and his one big tech investment, IBM , lost money.</p><p>That conservatism is also reflected in his advice. At 83, he still emphasizes long-term value, he still likes index funds and bonds over more active investments, he still invests mainly in America and he still doesn't like pundits, even though reporters insist on treating him like one.</p><p>During good years -- and 2013 was a very good year -- fortunes rise almost by themselves. It's important to realize when you're counting your own wins from last year that it takes no special genius to make money during a boom.</p><p>The real lesson Buffett wanted to emphasize this year was staying the course in a bust. He described in detail two real estate deals he made during the course of his long career. Both were distressed properties managed by government. Avoiding panic during a panic is the real key to getting wealthy, he wrote.</p><p>But the deeper lesson of both Gates and Buffett is this. Anyone can look smart when things are going well. When things are going well, wealth can grow faster than it can be given away.</p><p>Gates and Buffett have barely begun to give, and the result of that giving will transform the world of your grandchildren, as Carnegie's giving transformed the world for Buffett and Gates.</p><p>At the time of publication, the author held no positions in any of the stocks mentioned.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/danablankenhorn\">Follow @danablankenhorn</url>// &lt;![CDATA[!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)&lt;BRACKET&gt;0&lt;/BRACKET&gt;;if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");// ]]&gt;</p><p>This article represents the opinion of a contributor and not necessarily that of TheStreet or its editorial staff.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-12488347</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BNF-XFP1-JCMB-G0ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><timeReceived>11:19 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 TheStreet.com, Inc.

Here are some of their answers to the questions below.</p><p>EDITORIAL P38</p><p>Questions 1 What do you think is the secret of your success?</p><p>2 Who is your business inspiration and why?</p><p>3 What would you change to make Queensland a more attractive place for emerging businesses/young entrepreneurs?</p><p>Kate Williams, 36 NODO DONUTS FOUNDER 1. Two major factors would have to be the product and the people. I truly believe in our product and a lot of hard work went into the development before we were ready to launch. We have also been lucky to surround ourselves with equally passionate people who believe in our purpose and I think this reflects in everything we do.</p><p>2. I am really inspired by businesses who have stood the test of time and adapted to the market - businesses such as Boost Juice, Grill'd Burgers and Pana Chocolate. They all have extremely strong brands, have expanded successfully and have adapted their models along the way to meet their market needs.</p><p>3. Our experience has been nothing but positive. If I had to list three things, it would be more incentives for small businesses as seen offered to larger businesses, more recognition of the role and contribution that small business and entrepreneurs make to the economy and more marketing of Brisbane. A lot of people look to Melbourne and Sydney as more attractive markets due to their larger populations, but Brisbane has so many opportunities and so much to offer.</p><p>Ryan Stuart, 34 KAPICHE CO-FOUNDER 1. Starting a high growth tech start-up isn't easy. It won't make you rich overnight. It takes perseverance over many years and you need to be solving a real problem.</p><p>2. (American tech founder) Ryan Smith from Qualtrics battled away for several years and learnt everything the hard way. Eventually, after 17 years, he got his $US9 billion ($A13 billion) exit. That's what it takes.</p><p>3. Attract big tech companies to Brisbane to cultivate a thriving community of tech talent. Make it easier for start-ups to work with state government. Continue hosting large tech events to get Brisbane on the map.</p><p>Alexander Gransbury, 37 DREAMFARM FOUNDER 1. Perseverance. There's a famous quote from Thomas Edison that says: \"I may have found a thousand ways that didn't work, but I found one that did.\" That's what it's all about.</p><p>2. My grandfather had the world's most amazing workshop. He would say: \"Mate if we can dream it, we can make it or we can fix it.\" 3. I regularly see people with genuinely innovative ideas that just need help to get their products or services to market. A lot of creative minds and small businesses are simply not aware of the grants and support that is uniquely available to them in Queensland. We need to market these foundations for innovation and industry in Queensland as aggressively and skilfully as we do tourism if we want to see growth in these sectors.</p><p>Tommy Ericson, 38 AUS SHIPS DIRECTOR 1. We are honest, efficient and professional. We do what we said we would do, when we said we would do it. We push the boundaries, but we know our limits and our expertise. It sounds simple, but all too often businesses are guilty of taking on too much and not providing a quality outcome with any regularity.</p><p>2. I have always been motivated and inspired by those who push the boundaries to improve themselves and their respective industries - they calculate risks and take them. They don't always succeed, but they learn from them for next time.</p><p>3. Starting a business from the ground up is hard. Growing and maintaining it in a global market without a level playing field is even more challenging. Regulatory burden of compliance is stifling that. I believe there should be less of a focus on front-end grants and handouts, and more of a focus on back-end support. In lieu of giving grants, which is a lengthy, costly and uncertain process, why not push initiatives for concessions that can be realised when businesses satisfy a simple set of criteria.</p><p>Abbey Cameron, 32 NOURISH'D CO-FOUNDER 1. It's two-fold. For us, it's all about the customer and how we anticipate their needs. This means we might spend more on customer service and product than we do on TV ads, but that creates loyalty. The other half is having a co-founder (husband David Crompton) bring such different skills to the table in terms of risk management and operational processes.</p><p>2. It's probably the opposite for us - it's the things we saw in the industry such as poor customer service or lack of healthy options that have inspired us to do better.</p><p>3. I'd like to see the start-up space not be all about tech. There are only so many unicorns (tech start-ups that go on to be worth $1 billion), but there are basic human needs such as food and shelter where there is a huge opportunity for products to solve problems. Also accessibility of funding. When I started, I literally Googled how to find investors in Queensland - and what I discovered was that it is who you know and who they know.</p><p>James and Erica Bartle, both 38 OUTLAND DENIM FOUNDERS 1. Tenacity, timing and impact.</p><p>We exist to create opportunities for vulnerable people and our customers align with our reason why. We had launched only a few seasons in Canada and just signed with David Jones when Meghan Markle got off a plane in our jeans - this may also have had a large influence on our success so far.</p><p>Also our launch coincided with a growing interest in and movement toward sustainable and ethical fashion.</p><p>2. James: I have admiration for (American entrepreneur and philanthropist) Blake Mycoskie from Toms Shoes and the fact that his model had to evolve to have the desired impact, but he kept going.</p><p>Erica: (American publisher) Katharine Graham was an early influence of mine. I read her autobiography one summer during university. Here was a woman of privilege who had not had an easy ride, but toughed it out in the dog-eat-dog world of newspaper journalism, which had been a very sexist profession, to take charge of one of the most prominent news titles in the world known for its investigative journalism.</p><p>3. More education on the opportunities that exist around social enterprise, more mentoring in the space and support services that can help small business and entrepreneurs a have greater impact.</p><p>Leah Cameron, 36 MARRAWAH LAW FOUNDER 1. The boom in the indigenous-owned economy. From being almost non-existent a decade ago, the sector now contributes billions yearly. Old listening done new - you'd be surprised how many lawyers don't listen enough, particularly to their clients and especially in the indigenous space or with minority groups.</p><p>2. Other indigenous business owners are my inspiration day in and day out. 3. Access to finance by promoting the development of early-stage financing and support schemes, including incubators and accelerators, access to mentoring and coaching programs, and we need adequate support to hook into appropriate technology.</p><p>Frank Li, 33 RESTAURANT AND PROPERTY INVESTOR 1. Surround yourself with people in your life that can complement yourself in every way possible. Surround yourself with people who inspire, challenge and drive you to do better, to progress, to learn and to be positive.</p><p>2. My father. Being exposed to his business world at a young age has definitely contributed to me growing into who I am and what I want to achieve in my professional life.</p><p>3. This is a hard question. I love Queensland and I am a firm believer Brisbane has so much to offer to businesses as a major capital city in so many different ways. But if I have to criticise a few things, I'd like to see our public policy legislators adopt a more progressive and forward thinking policy platform. One example of this is our recent poorly executed change to the Liquor Act. This has had an enormous adverse impact on small businesses and, in return, we have not achieved the desired positive effects.</p><p>I'd love to see Queenslanders support local and small businesses more \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and more people accepting diversity in offerings that would make more entrepreneurs feel comfortable in creating their own businesses.</p><p>Dr Chris Jeffery, 33 MEDICAL ENTREPRENEUR 1. I am a strong believer that innovation occurs when people with problems meet those with the answers.</p><p>Due to my journey, background and skill combination - in medicine, business and engineering - I get to lead an amazing team who are the secret to my success.</p><p>2. My business inspiration is Elon Musk, as he showed me that when people believe in you, you can reinvent an industry.</p><p>3. Creating deeper opportunities for manufacturing here in Queensland. It is one thing to understand a problem and try to fix it, but to see the end solution through via manufacturing - especially of our types of products - would be ideal. Further integration of entrepreneur thinking for more risk-taking behaviour - for people to see they can be or create the solution to a problem they are facing, not just wait for others to develop it. Continued support from federal, state and local government and early access to investment and growth funding.</p><p>Chris Butters, 36 CBRE BRISBANE MANAGING DIRECTOR 1. Starting the day early, fostering strong relationships with my colleagues and clients, and treating everyone equally and with respect.</p><p>2. Guys I really looked up to when I began in commercial real estate were Sam Buchanan and Dan McVay (both ex-CBRE managing directors) because they both have had extremely successful careers and always had time for everyone they came into contact with.</p><p>3. I think they will definitely have to look at tax concessions from the government to entice groups to come from Sydney and Melbourne. I also think more needs to be done for housing affordability.Finally, we have to make sure that we are marketing our once-in-a-generation infrastructure boom to the younger demographic of Sydney and Melbourne. We have to emphasise how that will change Brisbane and, on top of that, drive home the social opportunities available - the way the city has grown and what it can provide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-6bd6d5c6c87c11e9ac61c25f11a80588a8faaba4c1d7bccb73086e5d97e15bc3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXN-RC71-F0JP-W2BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Australia)</publicationName><edition>CourierMail3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 30, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096KX</classCode><className>NEW BUSINESSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001462</classCode><className>REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000032</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX016</classCode><className>BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Welcome to the Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies.  And first I need to ask Sebastian if we have a quorum for the meeting.  Are we quorate?</p><p>GOMEZ:  We do Sarah.</p><p>HANKS:  OK, excellent.  I am Sarah Hanks and I am here without my coach Steve Graham this morning.  He is by the side of his wife Joanne, who is recovering successfully from a major surgery.  </p><p>Steve, if you're watching this, know that everybody in this room is thinking of you and sending thoughts and prayers for Joanne's continued recovery.  And we're looking forward to seeing you next time.</p><p>We have a wide-ranging agenda today.  We're starting this morning with a discussion on the limited liquidity and secondary markets for holders of shares of smaller companies.  We want to focus in particular on two types of companies; companies that are providing annual and semi-annual reports following a Regulation A Tier 2 offering, as well as SEC registered and reporting companies who are filing quarterly reports, but are not listed on any exchange.      When have asked two preeminent Blue Sky lawyers to present to the committee in order to help us navigate these issues because as you know, one of the big problems in this area is that there is no state pre-emption for resales of the securities.</p><p>Following that we are going to return to a topic of loan-held interest to many of us, the broker-dealer status of find us, that is, people who help small companies find sources of capital.  During our October meeting, we received an update on this topic from Stephen Luparello, the then director of the Division of Trading and Markets.</p><p>It was clear at that time that there was nothing in the immediate works, in terms of rulemaking or other division action to redefine the definition of broker-dealer.  So we're going to spend some time this morning discussing whether we'd like to reiterate, once again, a recommendation for action in this space.</p><p>After lunch we're going to take up a question that many have been asking which is, why more companies choosing to stay private?  Or to put it a different way, why aren't more companies choosing to do an IPO?  We're going to be joined by a lawyer, accountant and the venture capitalists who have lots of direct experience with companies making these decisions and it's going to tee up a very interesting discussion.</p><p>Finally, I'm hoping that we going to finalize our recommendation to the commission regarding divested yield and corporate boards and the ways that the SECs disclosure requirement in this area could be improved.  But before we move into the agenda for the day, we are pleased to have with us this morning for opening remarks, Acting Chairman Mike Piwowar and Commissioner Kara Stein.</p><p>Chairman Piwowar.</p><p>PIWOWAR:  Thank you, Sarah.  </p><p>Good morning everyone and Steve if you're listening as Sarah mentioned all of us are sending our best wishes your direction.</p><p>I've always enjoyed these Advisory Committee meetings and I am pleased to be here in my new role as Acting Chairman.  I'd like to extend a special welcome to our newest committee member Michele Schimpp, who's representing the Small Business Administration.  We very much appreciate having the SBA's insights and we look forward to working with Michele.  Welcome.</p><p>No matter where you are in the United States, small and emerging companies raise the tide for so many people to succeed.  The freedom to innovate and grow has always been fundamental to American success. And we as regulators must constantly assess how our work meets the needs of today's innovators.  That's why this committee is so valuable.</p><p>Committee recommendations put forward in early 2012 about lifting the ban on general solicitations, expanding Regulation A and raising that Section 12G registration thresholds helped lead to the enactment of the Jobs Act.  In 2015 the committee recommended that the commission modernize Rule 147 to help facilitate intra-state offerings and I am pleased the commission did just that.</p><p>As of last month, the related rule -- amended Rule 504 is now in effect and the new Rule 147 Cap A will go into effect in April, providing more options for companies looking to raise capital.  The committee also recommended raising the financial thresholds in the smaller reporting company definition to expand the number of smaller companies that qualify for scale disclosures.</p><p>In line with that recommendation, the commission proposed amendments to raise those thresholds last year.  The list of your valuable recommendations and discussion topics goes on and on.  And it seems Congress was so impressed with your efforts that in December it codified the committee into law.</p><p>The bipartisan Small Business Advocate Act of 2016 put into the Exchange Act two new provisions.  The first establishes the Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation headed by a new advocate for small business capital formation.</p><p>The second establishes a Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee.  These are parallel provisions to the Dodd-Frank Act that established the Office of Investor Advocate and the Investor Advisory Committee.  I'm proud to say that we are already taking steps, including working with our appropriations committees to stand up the new office.</p><p>I anticipate that we will begin the search for a new advocate for small business capital formation in the near future.  The law requires that the new advocate be someone who is not a current SEC employee. So I hope you all will encourage good candidates that you may know to apply.</p><p>In the meantime, we want you to continue down this exciting path. The charter of this Advisory Committee doesn't expire until September and I know that between now and then you will continue your efforts to bring forward ideas to facilitate capital formation for small and emerging companies.</p><p>Your agenda today, as Sarah mentioned, secondary market liquidity finders and why private companies are not going public reflect important topics facing small and emerging companies.  Secondary market liquidity for shares being held by investors in Reg A securities is becoming an increasingly important issue.</p><p>Between June 19, 2015, the day when amendments to Reg A took effect in January 31st of this year, there were 181 offerings filed using Regulation A; 103, which have been qualified by SEC staff for the issuer to begin making sales, 28 issuers have reported selling approximately $259 million in the aggregate.</p><p>I look forward to any recommendations on ways to remove frictions that may stand in the way of investors being able to readily exit their investment.  I'm also please that you are discussing why more companies are choosing not to go the route of an IPO.      While the menu of capital raising choices available today for small businesses presents more flexibility and more alternatives than ever before, there is always more we can do to provide robust public capital markets.  I look forward to your input on these and the other topics on your agenda today.</p><p>Thank you again for your service on this committee, and your continued commitment to facilitating capital raising by small businesses.</p><p>HANKS:  Thank you. </p><p>Commissioner Stein.</p><p>STEIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>I also want to extend my thoughts and good wishes to Steve and his wife, welcome Michelle.  Good morning to everyone else.  In this dynamic environment I think the ability to work on consensus topics is even more important.</p><p>This committee remains focused on fostering and supporting healthy marketplaces for fledgling smaller companies while protecting investors.  And this is a focus that we can all stand behind, and your commitment and work towards this goal as always is much appreciated.</p><p>Today's agenda re-examines topics that have been previously discussed, but we now have the added benefit of the inflow of initial information and data about how certain Jobs Act regulations are working in practice.  One aspect of your discussion concerns secondary market liquidity for smaller companies that are using the new Reg A plus rag.  And secondary market liquidity, I think from my perspective is a rather complicated topic.  For example, our Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee has also looked at this issue.</p><p>One of the things that's been most interesting to me is the availability of more data and current research that seems to be informing us on the role of information and transparency and the relationship to secondary market liquidity and firm value for OTC firms.</p><p>While your discussion today may be primarily focused n state securities laws and their impact on secondary market liquidity, I don't think it needs to end there.  Blue Sky requirements that apply to secondary sales of Reg A securities also are intended to provide a layer of protection for investors against fraudulent activities within each state in which the transactions occur.</p><p>I think from my perspective, state laws have often provided a protective guard rail in an attempt to balance efficient capital formation with robust investor protections.  That said, I mean I think it's fair to examine whether the current Blue Sky regime may negatively be affecting secondary market liquidity.</p><p>I am particularly interested in learning more about how compliance with state securities laws is working for Reg A non- exchange listed securities.  I look forward to the discussion of the pros and cons of Blue Sky laws and what if any improvements need to be made.</p><p>Finally, if there are inefficiencies with Blue Sky compliance regimes how can the current regime be adjusted?  For example, is there means by which NASA working with the states can improve the availability of manual exemptions across more states?</p><p>The other item on your agenda that I am sure will generate significant discussion and concerns the relative lack of IPOs as compared to prior periods.  What does the data reveal?  What are their current observations and explanations?  I can tell you again from my perspective, depending on what market participant you talk to, they are very different explanations.</p><p>One thing I'm interested in is has the Jobs Act provisions that change the registration thresholds or basically they have allowed for greater private capital raising contributed in any way to companies remaining private for a longer period of time I think that's another thing we should be thinking about as how different jobs at provisions interacted with one another.</p><p>I look forward to the discussion and I hope we'll delve into the very factors that are changing this whole ecosystem of our markets for capital formation including the effects of the economic environment and the regulatory structure.</p><p>Finally, you will also consider recommendations on broker dealer finders and board diversity.  I very much look forward to the discussion and these recommendations, and thank you again for your time and commitment to helping us think through these issues.</p><p>HANKS:  Thank you, Commissioner.  Now we're going to quickly turn to the SEC staff from the division of Corporation Finance.  We send our best wishes to Keith Higgins, who has moved on after more than three years since the divisions director.</p><p>I am reliably informed that he left just in time to enjoy staying up late on a school night to watch the New England Patriots win the Super Bowl, which I am equally reliably informed has something to do with American Football.  Who the hell knows.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The division is now in the capable, skilled and steady hands of Acting Director Shelley Parratt and we are very pleased to have her this morning.  Shelley?</p><p>PARRATT:  Thank you, Sarah, good morning.  </p><p>Good morning Acting Chairman Piwowar, Commissioner Stein and the committee members.  I am very happy to be here with you this morning.</p><p>This is my first time speaking at one of your Advisory Committee meetings and as part of the leadership of the division's disclosure review program I have always appreciated your thoughtful discussions and have carefully watched you develop recommendations.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to thank you in person for your time and for sharing your experience and insights with the staff, the commission, and the public.</p><p>Each and every staff member in the Division of Corporation Finance takes seriously the agencies charge of facilitating capital formation, while at the same time protecting investors.  We will be listening closely to your discussion this morning on ideas to improve secondary market liquidity for investors, which in turn, should help facilitate capital formation for issuers.  We also look forward to your afternoon discussion and welcome any ideas you may have that would promote further activity in the IPO market.</p><p>Before closing, I want to acknowledge the other members of the Corporation Finance staff at the table with me.  To my right, Betsy Murphy, a very important member of the Division Senior Leadership; next to Betsy is Sebastian Gomez, the chief of the Office of Small Business Policy; and to his right is Julie Davis, the senior special counsel in that office.</p><p>As you are all well aware, I need to give the standard disclaimer for any staff member speaking today which is that any remarks made by any of the SEC staff members reflect his or her own views and not necessarily those of the commission or any other member of the commission staff.</p><p>And with that I'd like to thank you for letting me join you this morning and I look forward to listening to your discussions.</p><p>HANKS:  Thank you, Shelley.  </p><p>So we're going to move on to the secondary market liquidity.  As you've known over the course of the last few years, in a variety of formal and informal ways, this committee has taken up issues surrounding the lack of sufficient liquidity in the securities of small companies.</p><p>Today we'd like to focus more narrowly on the topic of secondary liquidity in the context of issuers that is subject to ongoing reporting requirements and thus have updated information available in the marketplace.</p><p>In the case of a company that's done a Regulation A offering, they are obligated to file and (inaudible) annual and semi-annual ongoing reports and current reports.  Companies that have done a public offering, i.e.  Registered Public Offering; they are subject to the ongoing disclosure regime which includes quarterly reports.</p><p>The availability of these ongoing updates means there is available information to help establish pricing and its transparency in the secondary market.  Yet, as we have heard in our previous discussions, investors in Reg A securities are likely to have a difficult time when they're ready to resell their shares.</p><p>One key factor in this space is the friction that comes with having to find state exemptions for each trade since Blue Sky -- state Blue Sky laws do apply to secondary sales.  We have invited today two highly regarded attorneys who specialize in Blue Sky matters and can help educate us on the current legal framework.</p><p>First I'd like to introduce Richard Alvarez, principal of the Law Office of Richard Alvarez.  Richard currently serves as vice chair of the State Regulation Of Securities Committee of the ABA, American Bar Association.</p><p>And next to him is Martin Hewitt.  Martin is chair of the same State Regulation Securities Committee of the ABA.  Martin may look familiar to you because he often attends these meetings and the SEC staff think maybe he;s a member of the Advisory Committee fan club.</p><p>We're very happy to have both of you here to share your expertise and help us delve further into this very important topic.  And I think Richard you're going to first?</p><p>ALVAREZ:  Yes, I will.  Thank you, Sarah.  </p><p>HANKS:  Thank you.</p><p>ALVAREZ:  Thanks.  </p><p>Unfortunately, I didn't bring my own membership key for the Advisory Committee.  Martin decided not to share that with you.</p><p>HANKS:  We're designating you a member right now.</p><p>ALVAREZ:  Well, thank you Sarah, that's very gracious.  </p><p>Good morning everyone.  Thank you for inviting Martin and I to speak with you today on the topic of Blue Sky compliance that is applicable to Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings; and more broadly, to the securities of non-listed non-reporting publicly traded companies.</p><p>I'd like to particularly thank Acting Commissioner Piwowar and Commissioner Stein for their comments and certainly for their continued support in promoting the work done by this Advisory Committee.</p><p>Our presentation this morning will offer our views on the effects of state Blue Sky regulations on promoting or hindering secondary market liquidity for Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings and our discussion will hopefully be in the structure of a point, counterpoint presentation.  Not quite Kudlow and Cramer, for those of you who have long memories, but hopefully providing countervailing viewpoints.</p><p>Let me start basically at the end.  I believe that secondary market liquidity for Reg A plus offerings and for securities of non- listed non-reporting public companies will never be fully achieved unless state Blue Sky laws and regulations that are applicable to secondary market transactions in these securities are pre-empted by federal law, either through congressional action or through SEC rulemaking to revise and enhance existing provisions dealing with transactions and the securities in the secondary markets.      For the reasons I will explain in detail further on in our presentation, it is clear to me from the vantage point of over 30 years having dealt with Blue Sky -- state Blue Sky laws issues that while likely unpopular with many state regulators, the existing state regulatory framework that is applicable to secondary trading activities for certain types of securities and market participants has become overly burdensome.  Rooted in a view of a National Securities market that defers to larger, more mature companies at the expense of newer and untested companies.</p><p>This bias has the effect of stunting growth and innovation and is not in my view, responsive to both the rapid evolution of the markets resulting from technological innovation and to the shifting imperatives of Congress reflecting the desires of their constituents for greater opportunities for capital formation and investment opportunity.</p><p>This is not to say of course that these imperatives demand that investor protection, which is one of the principal mandates or state regulators should be diminished or eliminated.  However, to me it does mean that as security markets -- securities markets evolve and the objectives of the markets overall change by emphasizing the importance of capital formation and job creation through more robust marketing opportunities for issuers and investors alike, existing regulation should also evolve.  Often times evolution cannot be incremental, disruptive change is sometimes necessary.</p><p>At this point I'd like to sidebar for a moment to give a brief overview of the state-of-play regarding state regulatory secondary market trading exemptions.  As we all know, the securities of companies who are listed on a National Securities Exchange enjoy full pre-emption.  Certainly, the listing standards and the abundance of available real-time information for those companies offers the basis for reducing the amount of needed regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Pre-emption is also available for securities that are the subject of non-issuer secondary market transactional exemptions under section 481, that is for transactions by a person other than an issuer underwriter or dealer and for broker transactions executed in reliance on 4A3 or securities of companies who report under 13 and 15D of the Exchange Act.</p><p>We should note here that for securities that are sold in reliance on 4A3 while enjoying coverage security status there are a handful of states that obligate an issuer to file a notice to claim pre-emption if you will for securities to be eligible, to be traded in their state in reliance on that pre-emptive provision.</p><p>There is also federal pre-emption of state regulation enjoyed by transactions in securities made in reliance on Section 4A4 of the 33 Act which deals with unsolicited broker transactions.  It would seem obvious that exemption has some limitations, particularly in the context of a desire to create and develop a robust secondary market in outstanding securities.</p><p>Certainly, if a broker cannot solicit its customers it cannot create a market and certainly if a broker seeks to share its research for a particular company with its clients that will also defeat an assertion that the transaction, if it were initiated by the client would be wholly unsolicited, making that exemption unavailable.</p><p>There is also an institutional investor exemption which all of you are familiar with, again that focuses on the nature of the investor as opposed to the type of transaction.  Although transactions with institutional investors don't enjoy coverage security status, it is a universal exemption at the state level.</p><p>The trouble of course in mentioning that exemption in the context of Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings or for the securities of very small emerging growth companies is that category of investor is not normally found making investments for those insecurities of those issuers.</p><p>So I question whether in the discussion about developing a robust secondary liquid market for Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers and securities of non-reporting non-listed public companies, whether the institutional investor exemption has any real validity.</p><p>Last, but certainly not least, is the exemption that Sarah mentioned, the so-called manual exemption.  Most of you are familiar with the state exemption that is currently available and depending on who you speak to 39 or 44 states.  And there that simple statement demonstrates why this is such a problem area.  There is not even unanimity on which states actually offer an exemption that is usable for secondary market purposes.</p><p>What does the manual exemption provide?  It offers an exemption for secondary trades in by non-issuers through a licensed broker- dealer, provided that the issuing company has financial and other information published in a designated standard manual.</p><p>Up until the middle of last year the two main reporting manuals were emergency Standard &amp; Poor's.  Standard &amp; Poor's has given up the ghost and it is no longer involved in the space.  However, I do understand that the OTC market has been developing its own manual to replace -- I suppose to replace the Standard &amp; Poor's manual that is their best markets.</p><p>And as I understand it with Vermont Michael, his state leading the way, it is now an accepted manual in 19 jurisdictions.  I think that's right with two others on board to adopt the manual as part of its manual exemption.</p><p>The obvious problem for purposes of our discussion this morning with the manual exemption is the -- A, the lack of complete coverage in all 54 U.S. jurisdictions of that exemption.  And further the fact that even among the states that have adopted a manual exemption there are substantive differences in how those exemptions are applied, focused on the type of uniform Securities Act that the state follows.  </p><p>There are -- for those of you who do not know, two uniform acts that the states generally model their statutes after.  One is a 1956 Vintage Act that has been around for quite some time obviously, and the second is a more current updated version adopted in 2002, which about 20 states have adopted.</p><p>But again, the exemptions under both of those model acts differ, perhaps not substantially, but sufficiently that the lack of uniformity doesn't lend itself to promoting a national secondary trading exemption that is usable for companies that don't enjoy federal pre-emption.</p><p>A secondary market that must rely on these desperate exemptive provisions at the state level will of course be fragmented and far from the liquid secondary markets enjoyed by larger cap listed companies.  The question then is why our robust liquid secondary markets for smaller company is important, whether owning securities in large or small companies, investors generally don't want to hold their investments indefinitely.</p><p>A liquid secondary market allows investors to realize gains, minimize losses, generally make decisions to manage their portfolios and investments.  A liquid secondary market also helps issuers since even the prospect of a liquid secondary market makes it more likely that they will attract needed investment capital from potential investors who are short of an exit ramp for their investment, thus providing capital to foster job creation and entrepreneurial innovation.</p><p>Regulatory impediments to a robust secondary market frustrate those objectives.  This picture is not all wine and roses however, and unchecked market will undoubtedly offer opportunities for unscrupulous operators to gain the system to the financial disadvantage of the groups that would benefit from the most -- from a less rigid regulatory scheme; smaller companies and their investors.</p><p>So outer balance is equally important, but competing interests are robust and liquid secondary market is currently exists for exchange listed in SEC reporting company securities, must be based on real-time availability of information about a company.</p><p>The ability of an investor defined examine and rely on information that he or she deems critical to an investment decision, fosters investor confidence in the markets as much as the knowledge that regulators are standing by to protect their interests.</p><p>Certainly, though not ideal, the states manual exemption recognizes this fact since it relies on the availability of accurate, current information about an issuer as the basis for the availability of that exemption.</p><p>However, the lack of uniformity as I mentioned before, between and among the states in applying this exemption, coupled with the fact that more than a dozen states don't even recognize the exemption, frustrates investor efforts in many states to make investments based on what should be a coordinated, consistent regulatory environment.</p><p>Here then are my suggestions for addressing the lack of a meaningful secondary market liquidity for Reg A plus Tier 2 securities.  I'll address that first.      In my view federal pre-emption should be extended to include all secondary market trades insecurities for the securities of a Reg A plus Tier 2 issuer.  This can be done through SEC rulemaking by refining the definition of qualified purchaser under section 18 to include any person who, in a secondary market transaction buys or sells a security of a Tier 2 issuer that is current in its reporting obligations.</p><p>This would result in any such security being a coverage security under Section 18 of the 33 Act, thereby allowing a secondary market for such securities to develop without the regulatory burden of having to ensure compliance with state law requirements for secondary market traits.</p><p>The current definition of qualified purchaser which is any person to whom securities are offered or sold in a Tier 2 offering contains a limitation on the amount of Tier 2 securities and non-accredited investor can purchase in a Tier 2 offering.  It's my belief that QP definition should be revised to make clear that this limitation would not apply to investors purchasing Tier 2 securities in a bonafide secondary market transaction.</p><p>To continue to allow disparate state regulatory requirements to apply to secondary market transactions in what are at the initial offering covered securities, frustrates the objectives of promoting creation and growth of vibrant small emerging companies by continuing to impose restrictions on the secondary market for these securities.</p><p>While taking the step to grant full pre-emption of State Securities Law to all transactions or Tier 2 securities is significant, the impediments imposed by continued regulation of secondary market transactions in Tier 2 securities to the ultimate success of Reg A plus will, to a large extent, be tied to relieving the duplicative and non-uniform state regulatory structure that exists today with a more market and investor-friendly approach.</p><p>Each Tier 2 issuer has substantial initial disclosure and ongoing reporting requirements which should work to relieve concerns of inefficient -- insufficient information available in the market for these issuers which is vital to the success of a robust secondary market.</p><p>I also have a proposal that I would like to share with the committee for facilitating secondary market trading by non-reporting, non-listed publicly trading companies.  For these issuers, available information may not be as fulsome as the type of ongoing reporting required under Title 4, and certainly under the Exchange Act.  </p><p>State concerns over the type and quality of information for these companies argues for an increase in reporting that should be required of these non-Reg A Tier 2 non-reporting issuers.  The possible solution in my mind lies ironically, in the very regulatory structure that impedes the formation and maintenance of liquid secondary markets for these types of issuers.</p><p>A standard disclosure system comprised of a national standard securities manual model after the disclosures currently required to be included in the manuals that are accepted understate manual exemptions as the basis for supporting pre-emption of state law requirements over secondary market trading of securities of non-reporting, non-listed, non-rate Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers.</p><p>By requiring these issuers to include information that is consistent with what existing manuals currently require state concerns about a lack of current available information should be addressed, particularly if the states are partners in the development of such a national standard manual.  </p><p>An example of a model that may be useful here, which I had mentioned earlier, is the recent success enjoyed by the OTC best markets manual, though I am not endorsing this particular vendor.</p><p>My intention is to mention it as an example of a disclosure delivery system that offers a way for non-reporting companies to deliver the breadth and depth of information that will help investors while also demonstrating to the states that their concerns about disclosure as a basis for assuring that investors can make fully informed decisions about companies they seek to invest in are being met.</p><p>Rulemaking that requires non-reporting public companies to publish information as required under current standards and including securities of issuers that need these heightened disclosure and reporting requirements could be added as a category of covered security in connection solely with secondary market trading of those securities.</p><p>I certainly recognize that this proposal would increase the cost to small issuers.  Of course they would have to pay fees in order to have their information included in this new standard manual.  However, on balance, the cost would be significantly less than would be incurred if such an issuer were to become a reporting issuer.</p><p>Moreover, the pre-emption problem for the states is, in my view addressed by having the states participate in setting the standards for disclosure.  Since a majority of states already offer a manual exemption assuming the new national manual provides the same or greater information.  The regulatory concerns of most states should be satisfied.  </p><p>In closing I would, the advisory committee to recommend to the commission that each of these proposals be seriously considered as a means of starting or restarting the conversation around market liquidity for Tier 2 and non-reporting company issuers.  </p><p>HANKS:  Thank you.  </p><p>Martin?</p><p>HEWITT:  First of all I would like to thank Acting Chair Piwowar and Commissioner Stein and all of you for having us here today.  I want to take a different view of this, and step back from the \"P\" word, pre-emption, for just a moment.      The question that I think is really important is what are the concerns of regulators generally and specifically the states.  And what I believe the problem is at this point is a concern by the states and others that there is not sufficient information available to the small investor on the buy side and sell side, obviously they hopefully know, although that's questionable too and I'll bring that up in a moment -- that there is a sufficient information for somebody to make an educated investment decision.</p><p>And I believe as someone pointed out, I'm to hear this for all the meetings, a while back, I believe that the Acting Chair Piwowar are made an interesting observation.  I hope I have this right and you are talking about the fact that in some ways we are no longer looking at capital formation and investor protection, but protection from fraud and prohibition of investing.</p><p>And that is something that sort of got me thinking back then, I have been thinking of sense and to me the question could be further refined of not investor protection, as investors I do not believe have to be protected per se.  What they need is to be empowered and by that I mean have sufficient information to make intelligent investment decisions.</p><p>I think that there are concerns from the states that when you do not have sufficient information, there are certainly various things that can take place, and although not necessarily in the Reg A plus market, I think to a certain extent it could be in publicly traded non-listed REITs and BDC's.</p><p>What often happens in against a similar sort of lack of liquidity situation you end up with what's called a many tender where vultures of some sort -- I'm probably not picking the best word -- would make an offer to unsuspecting investors to sell their securities way below the value of whatever it is at that time, even if it is depressed from the actual purchase price.  </p><p>That is troubling on many levels because yes, there are disclosure requirements under Reg A plus, but are they as robust as they would be for listed company.  That is a question that I think has to be considered.  Also, to the extent that when you have a private offering, if somebody is interested in buying -- to get information from the company what you end up having is -- the bigger players have access to information that the small investor doesn't have.</p><p>So in fact, if we're concerned about is a level playing field and investor empowerment.  I think before we get to a discussion of pre- emption, we have the first think about what it is that is needed as a minimum for investors to be able to in fact make that intelligent decision.</p><p>And I think to a certain extent, 4A7 was a good indicator that which is -- Sarah knows that better than anyone -- that it had the backing of NASA because it had certain informational requirements, including knowledge of the you know, whose running the company, is it a going concern, up-to-date financials.      So my concern is more a shift away from how we normally look at the situation and trying to look at this in a slightly different way which is instead of concentrating on pre-emption, we should all be discussing together not separately, as in leave the states out of with pre-emption, what is it that we can all agree on it as information required add a minimum as I said to make a cogent investor decision.</p><p>At this point, there are plenty of times where in fact you have situations in which the investor has very little information, reports to be filed are one thing, but if they just have the most basic of information, is that really what they need to make the decision and I suspect it is not, at least not in all cases.  So one thing that we would have to...</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>HEWITT:  ... in fact it is not, at least not in all cases.</p><p>So one thing that we would have to consider is -- I know I am saying it a few times, but when -- another way looking at this is, what is it that all of us would like to see before making an investment decision and doesn't every investor have a right to have that which we all think we need to see personally sitting around the table.</p><p>And to the extent that we do, the question isn't necessarily pre- emption and I am not sure the states would even have a problem with pre-emption to the extent that their concerns about the information required is actually addressed now as Richard said, if you want to you, whether you have a more far-reaching manual exemption that is acceptable to all parties.</p><p>I don't think that is a bad place to start to think that in many ways it has worked except for there are a few holdouts states and for whatever reason.  But to the extent of there has to be pre-emption, I think it has to more not as in removing people from the table but making sure that everyone is able to see -- to say what -- they know that one of the states has one time said -- states has one time said to me that we want to facilitate investment not speculation.  With that information it can only be called speculation, and I think that really drives home the point.  </p><p>So I think that if there is any recommendation I have it isn't so much to worry about pre-emption per se, it's to worry about address the concerns of the states as to information that at a bare minimum, we should have all et cetera.  But how we get there is a matter of discussion.</p><p>I just think that if one rushes to quickly to the pre-emption, to go to pre-emption without considering several things, including what is it that the states are concerned about so I won't take up too much time because I know we both plowed through a lot of it already.  </p><p>HANKS:  Well, thank you both.  </p><p>If I could just sort of kick-off the questions here, so we are focusing on the information is available before we get to the \"P\" word, does anyone here have any experience in how different disclosure under Reg A ongoing reporting is to what's in a manual.  I've got to confess that it's been a long time since I looked in manuals.  Maybe I was a junior associate sometime back in the 80s when I last looked at these things.  </p><p>Seems to me, and I am hoping someone can challenge this, that when you look at the disclosure that's made under Regulation A and we have had now several companies go through a year's worth of disclosure, you have got ongoing reporting, you've got some annual reporting with audited financials, you got semi-annual with the unaudited financials, you've got one years -- you got a lot of companies filing 253 G2's supplement information to keep the information rolling.</p><p>How does those compare?  Is there anything in is there any way in which Reg A is not what you would want to see in manual because I remember those manuals, you just -- it was kind of unreadable.  Can we compare and contrast those two sources of information.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'm actually glad that you brought up the fact that they are unreadable.  That's the other problem is that whatever information is available has to be in plain language, which I know is always a goal.  But since the more that we try to make plain language the goal, the document becomes thicker and thicker which is great for killing trees, but that's about it.</p><p>The comparison between the two, I couldn't tell you to the nth (ph) degree, but I think we also have to look at is obviously Reg A plus these offerings are of companies with little or no history and of course if you just, if somebody is flipping out of that in six months to a year, where is that investor during the interim report supposed to get information, the purchaser.</p><p>And I think that's the concern that although there may be information out there, is it of sufficient detail and also of sufficient comprehensibility to be of any use to the investor.</p><p>HANKS:  But would that be any different under the manual requirements, I am totally not up-to-date with manual requirements.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Sarah I think that, it's fair to say that the reporting requirements that Tier 2 issuers are subject to while something less than 34 Act reporting, is something more than what is included in a manual.</p><p>The manual includes things like balance sheets, officers and directors, description of business, things that you would normally see that is a synopsis of a company and I think part of the thinking on the manual exemption is that that is certainly a starting point for an investor.</p><p>It is a collection of information that if an investor wants more information than they can go and find it either on Edger or wherever else.  But I think it's fair to say that Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers fall somewhere greater in their reporting responsibilities and of the information that they are required to report under Reg A plus, then they would need to under -- in a manual.</p><p>I would perhaps refer to Michael who may have more intimate experience with what his manual requires.</p><p>HANKS:  And well, we'll get to Michael and then to Emma.</p><p>EMMA:  Potentially in a unique situation, which is I actually got security qualified under the manual exception three years ago, I think that I am not mistaken, but they no longer publish information in a book.  What they do is they will only allow you to qualify for the manual exemption of this is S&amp;P, where they are still doing the business.  If the information was being disseminated by a regulator.</p><p>So the only entities who could qualify for manual exemption at all, were banks, thrives, entities that were required to publicly provide information to a regulator or companies that were qualified to train an OTC markets under the alternative reporting standards.</p><p>So you can't just qualify for the manual exemption you actually have to be regulated in order to qualify for manual exemptions.  So I think that's a really important point to understand, you can't just put out Reg A plus Tier 2 materials to the SEC and qualify for manual exemption unless the manual exemption has been amended to make that clear.  </p><p>Secondly, I think that -- and at least alternative reporting standards under OTC required more information than Reg A plus Tier 2, but that was to provide a trading market, it also has a $20,000 year cost, that some companies may not be able to bear with a manual exemption or S&amp;P.</p><p>I think the initial fee was maybe like 6000-5000 and so it was much less expensive to be qualified under (inaudible) than it is to do qualification under the alternative reporting centres, but you do get a trading market so I think it is really important to understand it's not just that you put some information in a book someplace that is no longer the case.</p><p>It is literally it has to go out through regulator and that is how they track that information is been updated and there is a cost associated with that.  </p><p>HANKS:  Michael?</p><p>PIWOWAR:  Thank you Sarah and good morning everybody.  </p><p>So, I think that question specifically about what the differences are, when you're talking about the reporting requirements in the manual.  I think probably the Reg A Tier 2 reporting the things I reported are pretty equal if not greater, as Richard had said you know, I think some of the other requirements getting beyond was in the manual as components of the manual exemption like the fact it goes through a broker-dealer and that would be a distinction difference.</p><p>And (inaudible) there is -- you know, there is sort of baseline in terms of what type of company can qualify for manual exemption and I believe I had to, you know, had to look back at our statute, but you know, there is a period of time in which it has to be operating in a period of there's an asset value which has to be on its balance sheet. </p><p>So there is a sort of minimum standard, but the not familiar with the requirement that has to wither bank calling company or insurance company, but...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It wasn't that I said that information had to be disseminated by own regulator, it could just be on the company's website that was very clear (inaudible) we had a public website, (inaudible) put the information on the website to qualify and they said, no, you have to be -- that information has to be disseminated through a regulated entity so it was OTC, it was the banking regulators and it was OTC markets with the only option that would satisfy that condition according to S&amp;P three years ago.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But we're talking about the access to the information under the manual exemption?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So, again this is three years ago, I don't believe S&amp;P is going this anymore, when S&amp;P said us your offering document, we will review that but you have to have a system for sending information on ongoing basis and it has to be through a regulator, it could not just be our website.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But the exemption, the manual exemption at the state level is predicated on an independent third-party publication containing information that is provided by the issuer, right?</p><p>The problem, of course, in the context of a discussion on a liquid trading market for these types of issuers is the fact that not all states cover the -- recognize a manual exemption, and even in those states that do recognize the manual, we have a variety of different requirements, whether it's a 90 day waiting period or restricting trading to securities by non-affiliates.</p><p>So having the manual, the existing state manual be the basis for creating a robust secondary liquid market in these kinds of securities.  I don't -- I am not confident is achievable, which is why I suggested that the \"P\" word -- or why the \"P\" word has again raised its ugly head.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  However I think one of the things we have to consider as we're talking about the manual exemption right now is which is all well and good and perhaps there is one that can be the gold standard.</p><p>But in the meantime, part of what happens -- part of what I think the states are concerned about, you know, obviously part of the thing of being empowered investors also having the ability to get guidance from an advisor of some sort -- emption and removal of the broker- dealer or advisor so that the of the day it is a one-on-one transaction and the question is, the person who's selling, there's no oversight there whatsoever.  </p><p>They are not, they are not representative of the company, they are not part of the issuer, they are selling and there's very little that, at this point, as far as I am concerned, that an unsuspecting and uneducated investor can rely upon in that situation, at least if there is a broker-dealer involved, you would hope that there is a minimal amount of guidance.</p><p>So I think that well, we're talking about the manual exemption, we have to also consider a slightly different point which is if it is on a one-to-one basis, how is that investor being protected by the seller?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Counter-point?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Go ahead.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  This is a Jane Curtin and (inaudible) sort of stuff going on and that's OK.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  The one to one transaction is already covered under 4A1 and we have federal pre-emption for those kinds of transactions. I mean the one to one transaction doesn't concern me and I don't think is impassioned doesn't concern me and I don't think is impacted by the problems that we have spoken about relating to Blue Sky law.</p><p>I think the challenge is trying to figure out how to fit the current federal state regulatory scheme to facilitate a liquid secondary market where people come and go into the market, whether through market participants or otherwise without any significant impediment which is what we see today.  </p><p>We see smaller companies struggling to convince their investors that they will have an exit strategy because there is no comprehensive uniform way for a company to tell a broker or to tell investors that their securities can be bought and sold in Iowa, as an example and I don't mean to pick on Iowa, if Iowa was listening.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Pick on Vermont instead.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Patrick, go ahead.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I can't remember Tier 2 requires to have a transfer agent?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes I think so.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But if you had a transfer agent, I mean you could condition execution of the transfer -- the transfer agent get some sort of proof or representation that there was an exemption so that is a thought that I have had and you see that under rule 144, the transfer agent will transfer the trade -- will register the trade unless there is an opinion or form used to be -- I am not sure what exactly they require now.</p><p>That seems to me something you should think about, but I want to add this general observation and then another observation.  First of all, the illiquidity creates a discount so you can't go and sell then the weigh of your company is less, and so we all need to keep that in mind.</p><p>And the second thing is my observation has been that when regulation steps up and says you cannot do something, something in business people wanted to do, you cannot do it or it is very difficult to do it.  That's when you get noncompliance.  That's when people start looking, sneaking off from what their lawyers or whoever their broker is and they go in and they go around the law and do the deal.</p><p>I have said this before, I think our policy, state and federal, is that we facilitate compliance.  We shouldn't make compliance so hard people opt to violate the law.  That's just because it's difficult to or impossible, some cases you are just saying impossible.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Because you have conflict of laws between states or states and federal.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean it's just got -- it needs to be something there.  The other thing is that I think, I don't mean to pick on you, but I think the Blue Sky people are, you know, we have two conflict of interest here, we have investor protection of capital formation.  I think when you go into any securities regulator SEC, federal, state securities law -- OK, how many people here have ever signed the front of a buisness check?  (inaudible) you're gonna get very few hands raised.</p><p>So you need to educate people, it's regulatory agencies, capital formation, as part of their goal to say no and protect in the investor is not -- and at the end of the day, if you do that, there's no business (inaudible) trade or treasury.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But here's the thing in respond to that.  First of all you said that they are conflicting and I don't necessarily agree with that statement because it is not sufficient and not investor protection is again I think it is investment empowerment.</p><p>If there is a sufficient empowerment, if there is all just emphasis on capital formation then there will be furious people out there.  They are there and then what happens is the integrity of market fails and people will not invest and there goes your capital formation.  The point being is it has a balancing act and it's a very delicate one at that.</p><p>But I don't think anyone saying that these people shouldn't be able to invest.  I do not think the states are saying that, I think what the issue is really one of information and education.  How you get there is what the discussion has to be about with all the regulators all the regulars in the room.</p><p>That's basically what I am saying but I don't think that you can say that those are conflicting at all because without one the other is going to fail either way.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Ultimately, you are right.      (UNKNOWN):  Thank you.</p><p>HANKS:  We'll get to Jonathon (ph).  I just wanted to respond on behalf of transfer agents who probably all turned white when you said that. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>We are looking at -- trying to make something less friction, we're trying to reduce friction and I think taking free trading securities and requiring the transfer agent to do something I think it's going to introduce our frictions.  I just wanted to make that point.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And is that a broker's job too?</p><p>HANKS:  To reduce friction or to increase the friction?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I mean to the point of asking...</p><p>HANKS:  Yes I think that if you are looking at that who in this transaction has a role in doing the agent's information, it's going to be broker as opposed to and they do have those requirements as opposed to imposing these numerals on them on transfer agents.  We'll go to Jonathan.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  One of my experiences in the heavily regulated industries in a past life when I was a nurse and I worked in five different states and every state had a specific licensure that you actually had to maintain as a nurse.</p><p>But the number of states had actually gotten together and they had said you know what, we are going to give each other reciprocity, where if you actually qualify in the states as a nurse, it's a regulative simple process to go through to get a license in another state.  There is also a series of states called compact states.  I think there's about 23 states where they said we will just honor everybody else's licenses.  </p><p>I think one of the interesting things about you know, about the SEC in government is you know, yes we regulate, but I also think that we have the ability to ask for to convene, do state securities regulators get together on a regular basis?  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Absolutely.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  OK.  I mean has there been discussion and -- I mean forgive my ignorance, is there discussion about can we create a program where there is reciprocity across these states?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  No, plain and simple.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  There is a -- and we're going to barge the words, I'm just (inaudible) this point.  There is a uniform process at least on the registration level with the states now when you go through Reg A plus Tier 2, so it's not like there is just a morass I think that the states are certainly working towards the goal of more uniformity and of course the punch line to the 56 Act and the 2002 Uniform Securities Act is nothing's uniform by the time the legislators get done with it. So, you know, that -- that's part of the problem.  </p><p>The one thing I just wanted to address very quickly though is when it came to the one-to-one transaction, I still think that there is potential there pre-emption or not for the small investor to be taken advantage of by somebody who just wants to dump their stock and I think is that is probably a concern of the states, although I can't speak for them.  But in terms of what you are saying, especially with the nurses license, it's actually in fact, now lawyers is a common BAR exam, my grand-son should have started for a couple on them.</p><p>So, there is more reciprocity in various areas within the states now, has it risen to the blue skylight area yet?  Not to that level, but that doesn't mean that -- that they are not working or trying to get the states together to make it more uniform or more user-friendly.</p><p>Because again I don't think the states are trying to prohibit capital formation.  I think as you said, sometimes -- or I think Patrick said, sometimes you can actually protect the investor ultimately, by just not letting him invest and therefore there will be no problem.</p><p>But that doesn't really solve the issue, which is why it is a true balancing act and again, although I keep on drumming this point, is that we have to make sure that those issues that those scenarios that have resulted in investors being defrauded are addressed.  I mean we can't do away with all fraud.  The key is to minimize as much as you can like a perfectionist isn't perfect, they just try damn hard not to make as many mistakes as everyone else.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But counterpoint.  In answer to your question, as the discussion about the standard manual illustrates that, exemption has been around from the beginning of time, OK?  It's an accepted exemption, but there are 54 different jurisdictions, each one of them has their own view about what that exemption means.</p><p>Yes, I get that investor protection is a significant interest that needs to be recognized, but I question whether this lack of uniformity as a basis for regulation, is protecting anyone.  I mean, certainly the states continue to retain their fraud authority and if there is a bad actor and an investor is harmed, they will complain to their state regulator and that regulator has the full breath of its of its securities law, arsenal to go after those fraudsters.</p><p>But different to, you know, your experience with nursing licenses.  The states jealously guard their own interests particularly by insisting that they alone understand the specific needs of investors and their particular jurisdiction, which I don't doubt, but -- and perhaps has validity in the context of primary offering review, I get that.  In the case of a secondary market transaction, particularly for companies where there will be information available.      For example, Reg A plus Tier 2 issuer which says, fulsome disclosures under the new law or non-reporting public companies that have information including in a national manual.</p><p>The particular needs of the state I think, need to take -- a backseat is the wrong word, but a backseat to the interests of developing a market, a liquid market in securities that benefits everyone, not just the people in Iowa and not just the people in Vermont.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I just -- every single lawyer that I have ever talked to about, if you are actually going to sell a security and going to the Blue Sky laws, they are just like too dumb.  But that is the third rail.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Give them my number.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But it's essentially -- I do not think that there is an efficient market at all because you just can't create it.  And I think ultimately, that ends up hurting the smaller, less wealthy states, and it essentially starts concentrating business in large wealthy cities because it tends to become who you know and it tends to be who you went to school with and if you went to a school with a bunch of wealthy people then you can essentially go and start a business and create security and end up selling it.</p><p>And if you are poor and you want to start a business, you really can't start a business unless you can completely bootstrapping without any capital.  I am just saying, it feels very, very, very broken to me and can we convene these state regulators and just say, dudes let's just sit in a room and let's just work it out.\"</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  You got to understand that first of all, NASA has several meetings throughout the year of the states, but again you put all of us in this room we have different ideas slightly or greatly. But I think one thing you have to understand -- I've been in securities industry now for 35 years which frightens me on many levels, but you know, there was a day when there was between the states and practitioners and issuers.</p><p>But overtime I have seen that shift dramatically and you know, one thing that that NASA is always trying to do and they do meet with several groups throughout the year and we are always trying to talk about quote, \"low hanging fruit\", what can we accomplish.  And this is one of those areas where I don't think anyone is saying that there shouldn't be more information or there should not be more easily understood information.  </p><p>I think it's a matter of having that discussion, but not everyone their own little corner, but you out in the open and having the robust discussion but I don't think the states are all sitting and going, wow, how can I make myself so different as to totally derail anyone trying to either sell a security or raise funds to build a business. I don't think that's the mentality.      (UNKNOWN):  But wasn't that discussion had -- during the lead up to the adoption of Title 4?  My recollection is that there was...</p><p>HANKS:  I just want to get to Laura (ph), she's been trying to get a word in.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I just want to take this back to I think something the committees talked about several times which is, what is the public policy benefit of requiring a Tier 2 reporting company to also qualify for manual exemption or to list under the attorney of reporting standards under OTC markets.</p><p>That prohibition means as Jonathon was saying, there is no opportunity for another market to develop, there's not an opportunity for another broker-dealer or ECN or any other parkit to try to create an efficient trading system for what are generally publicly offered and should be (inaudible) securities.</p><p>So I think we go back to the original conversation, I think back (inaudible) there was a real push to get pre-emption for Tier 2 securities where the information being made publicly available that end up coming off the table in the final vote, but we've had, you know, some time now to look at how the market is adjusting.  I've made the comments before at least one or two times that we did a real deep dive and look at Reg A plus after it got enacted and all of the banks that we spoke to for the most part so they would not be touching Reg A as an offering option for their client companies because their investors (inaudible) unless there was clear liquidity for securities, people are not going to invest in securities.</p><p>An idea that right now if you are investing in one of the 103 companies that have been qualified issue Reg A plus securities, there's no trading market for the securities, how's that beneficial to the people who are investing in that?</p><p>They're stuck in securities unless the company goes through a process and I -- you know, fully supported and respect OTC markets, they are providing a great option, they are the only option for trading the securities, and you have to go through a process, you have to pay, you know, not insubstantial annual fee.  And you have to find more disclosure than it is actually required in the offering, or in the ongoing voluntary reporting.  </p><p>It just doesn't seem it is (inaudible) policy or investor protection benefit that I see as being provided by that kind of activity and it's a detrement to Reg A plus and to the market developing and I tell people that's (inaudible) in dealing with insurers regulatory dates.</p><p>And just from a cost perspective, regulatory compliance because each of the states are different very much like we are talking about here only, they are low bit more advanced and they are complaints for all the things we are going to get together with, you know, work together and they come up with this common thing and they put it together and they put it on top of all their existing requirements.</p><p>So, it's fine that it created jobs, it's great, it's a cost that gets passed on to the consumer, cost of operating for the company so in the company that I worked at, I probably had about 15 percent dedicated only to state compliance reporting.</p><p>So, think about what that means, 15 percent of that body count that we had and if we are actually only making the 6 percent bottom line and some bad years because it's insurance.  But best maybe 20, that compliance component, even though it is not for the whole component, it was costing.  So therefore, what happens if you want a state -- company to do business in all 50 states, you got to be big.  </p><p>I worked with a big company and they said we just wanted to be able to say that we were listed in all 50 states and you know, it gave them additional market branding, et cetera.  Or you have small companies, insurance companies, and the only specialized in one, sounding familiar here, right?</p><p>And so therefore anybody in the middle, it's economically infeasible.  So (inaudible) I think it is great, but better people probably have tried before so unfortunately, as much as it pains me to say this federal is probably the only way to go at that point and time.  </p><p>However, the second point that I want to get to is, we are talking about increasing the availability of -- just increase in the market right so we don't worry about the institutional investors out there, they can take care of themselves.</p><p>We don't worry about the small people, you know, they're dealing all the small people, they are doing the one offs who actually know the business that they are investing in and again now we are talking about the mid, and the mid just disappears, right?</p><p>And so to add (inaudible) down into the details and whatever, if we have our goal to accelerate the investment at mid-level which means they're theoretically much more (inaudible) not investor, there's probably something in between regarding a regulatory perspective that we can take which I totally understand about working within the context we have because I don't think we are going to be able to check mid-level, which means there business people feel that it is a viable investment alternative.  </p><p>They will figure out a way to create that which will probably, it could be 90 percent of the time it really works, the 10 percent that fails but (inaudible) it will be enough to kill it.  Eventually, and then as an economy all we do is heard so that's a (inaudible).</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  If I could add to that, I think if you are looking for something to sell pre-emption I think pretty sure for states in fraud and (inaudible) fraud, in coordination with the SEC and the Justice Department, I don't know how you would do that.  I mean I think everybody agrees that there is finally a fraud out there to go and trace it.  </p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Are the Russians doing this?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Anyway, I think that's my only comment really, I don't have anything to add, but I think that does seem to me if we're bellybutton gazing and thinking deep thoughts that is one off thought put the states in fraud, if that matter regulating transactions.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Mr. Patrick, we'll get to Michael and then Jenny.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Thank you.  So I just want to address quickly (inaudible) a point that was made by Patrick and Jonathan, just to give some information in terms of what the states do and whatnot and the insurance regulator context, you know, I mean the state regulators are the only regulator of insurance market and states do coordinate quite efficiently on the insurance side.</p><p>My opinion of his accreditation for states they have to have certain requirements, or they are not part of the NAIC and similarly on the NASA side, you know, we have two annual meetings a year, we have a Board of Directors, we have a whole structure that works up issues through committees up to the board, you know, disseminated out to the membership and I encourage you to come to the NASA meeting you know, when you have an opportunity to and I'm sure we would appreciate inviting you.</p><p>But to again serve some veins to Patrick's point, I mean you know, the states have been very -- in my opinion they are very responsiveness in capital formation arena in the last few years, we take to heart this issue of the balance you know, the balance between investor protection capital formation because you know, on one hand, as you mentioned what happens if we focus too much in capital formation.</p><p>But if we focus too much on investor protection, the opportunities to invest, the opportunities to grow retirement, to create jobs that goes way too which is not good for the investors. That balance is very important.  </p><p>Martin alluded to the coordinator review that the states implemented in Tier 1 Reg A , this in our opinion, takes the burden off the individual issuer, puts it on the states to coordinate and get the specific comments out to the issuer's (inaudible) capital formation arena in the last few years.</p><p>We take to heart this issue of the balance you know, that the balance between investor protection capital formation because you know the one hand, as you mentioned, what happens if we focus too much on capital formation, but if we focus too much on investor protection you know the opportunities to invest, the opportunities to grow retirement to create jobs that goes way too which is not good for the investors.  </p><p>That balance is very important, Martin alluded to the coordinator review that the states implemented in Tier 1 Reg A , this in our opinion, takes the burden off the individual issuer, puts it on the states to coordinate and get the specific comments out to the issuers.</p><p>We have grade of capital formation amount of those discussions, we have worked more collaboratively with the SEC in recent years, rule 147 A and other initiatives and I hope we can continue to do that.  So states have been very proactive in this area and we have you know, vendor engagement, the OTC markets just to comment, OTC markets came to us in March or April of last year to Vermont and said you know, the S&amp;P manual is going away.  </p><p>There is only merchants now we look to that state regulators and said there should be more options we were concerned about that, we were the first movers they came to us in March we had a rule implemented in July of that same year, 19 states as Richard had said followed suit, three others have announced they are going to.  So the states do act and we do communicate regularly and you know, try to lead these initiatives on quite ongoing basis.  </p><p>Announced they are going to so the states do act and we do communicate regularly and you know, try to lead these initiatives on quite ongoing basis.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I have a question about state and regional secondary markets.  I know in the past we had a lot of more local exchanges -- state-level exchanges...</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  ... there is some benefit to being able to buy and sell securities in your own states.  I am just curious if that has been tried at all.  You know, what was the success of that, is that something we can consider reviving.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think the demise of the regional exchanges was clearly an economic issue.  I mean, you know, it costs a lot of money to do that stuff.  And while you know, there may be some theoretical benefit to reviving the concept of regional exchange while you know, there may be some theoretical benefit to reviving the concept of regional exchange, I mean Reg A plus Tier 2 is billed as a platform for national securities offerings.</p><p>So, at least in the context, and correct me if I am wrong, but at least in the context of Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings, regional exchanges I don't think would necessarily solve the problem.</p><p>And then I suppose the one way that you could implement that is to designate whatever regional exchanges are formed as national securities exchanges under section 18, but if I remember my section 18 provisions correctly, any national exchange has to meet the same standards or similar standards to the NYSE, NASDAQ.</p><p>So, you know, I wonder whether we could ever get back to what used to be the Midwest exchange, specific exchange in Cincinnati and like.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I would love to hear Michael's comments on that too and also whether this is been discussed at NASA and maybe it doesn't have to be an exchange, maybe it could be some kind of bulletin board or something like that.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I guess my initial reaction sort of piggyback on Richard's saying you know, economic component, not just running the exchange, but on the other side, I mean the supply, the demand, I mean the business element, I mean the illiquidity, lack of people wanting to buy the securities and I don't think -- I think that is probably the discussion that we should have in terms secondary trading now and its larger discussion as well because regardless of, you know, the regulations or whatever in place I mean it is actually demand.  </p><p>You know, people want to achieve liquidity and sell their investment, but if somebody willing to buy it and we are talking about, what we are talking about today we're talking about smaller companies, small investors, mom-and-pop investors that are doing initial buying and doing subsequent buying and selling so is not institutional investors, not largely sophisticated investors.</p><p>I think that's why the investor protection elements you know, are important to considerations.  So, you know, I think it's economic and, you know, and businessmen in terms of supply and the demand of the securities.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Just a couple of points.  One is and I think that Richard mentioned it when he was talking about the different exemptions and secondary trading at the state level.  There is a complete disconnect between the secondary trading exemption at the state level for broker-dealers and at the federal level, so the context of IPS for example, and I think (inaudible) original offerings.</p><p>A broker dealer who has an existing relationship and I think I have said to the committee before, a broker dealer has a pre-existing relationship with a client, has done suitability, understands their investment criteria, has confirmed the status in the investor.  </p><p>Can market any opportunity in a primary context to their clients as long as they believe that are suitable for them.  It is the exact opposite in the secondary context because of the state law, the sky requirements which are that a transactions for a broker dealer must be unsolicited.</p><p>That means that if I'm a broker-dealer, I can go out to every one of you if we have a relationship say would you like to buy Reg A plus primary offering, but I can't touch any of you to ask you if you want to buy the securities and secondary market, that doesn't make any sense.  </p><p>It has never made sense to me, these are clients of broker- dealers and again pre-emption solves that problem.  Pre-emption allows a broker dealer to go out and touch their existing clients, not in a personal way, but (inaudible) way and asked them are you interested in investing in these securities.</p><p>That is the only way we're going to develop a robust secondary market around these type of securities, brokers have to be able to do their job.  They have to be able to locate by said interest, they have to make sure that the investment suitable for their investors, that's how you get the investor protection.</p><p>You have the disclosure point already out there, then you have the broker-dealer protection and to Jenny's point, I don't think you're going to see NASA exchanges come back into the fray as a result of electronic trading -- I'm sorry regional exchanges because of electronic trading the cost structure is just not there I think to support regional exchanges, which is why most of them were acquired and as a matter of financial interest.</p><p>Yeah, but I think where you are seeing is and maybe an increased proliferation of platforms, web-based platforms that are in the primary space that could be in the secondary space for Reg A plus securities crowd funding portals that there are a multitude of players who are out there, who would be able to create a business model around this if it made economic sense if they had the pre-emption for secondary training.</p><p>HANKS:  I think where it was saying on that point time.  If you look at how many ATS there are at the moment I was just counting them from the other day from the most recent update.  I think this might 41 and some of those and some of those are clients are looking to be secondary markets for Reg A securities as well.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And they can't because the Blue Sky...</p><p>HANKS:  It is more difficult for them because that, yes.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  When I worked on getting the security approved first for Blue Sky manual purposes, it's a big deal that you cannot do it in all 50 states.  It should not underplay that, it's a big deal.  What if you are issuer in state that doesn't have a manual exemption, you can't actually -- why would anybody buy your securities if they know for sure, you can't ever get secondary liquidity, it is a big deal that it is not in every state.  It is a big deal, that is a patchwork of requirements that it takes significant expertise such as these gentlemen to hire a lawyer, to walk you through the requirements in every single state.</p><p>We did that when I was in second market, we did a big deep dive into the secondary market.  You guys have seen me, I have presented to NASA, it is a patchwork of unintelligible requirements that are driven by legislation securities commissioner interpretations.  That sort of thing it is not consistent across all 50 states.  So, again don't underplay the fact that OTC zoning approved in potentially 19 states, that's a big deal.  And that is a real fiction impediment to market being created around Reg A securities.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Michael?</p><p>PIWOWAR:  So I think there is -- I just want to address the one point the unsolicited broker.  I am not expert in this arena, but there certainly securities as you probably heard the phrase that are not bought but are sold, you know and I think that sort of the driving impetus behind the unsolicited portion of the broker dealer unsolicited exemption may not -- you know, on the OTC piece and I will just mention, you know, there's 19 states are within the last seven or eight months...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PIWOWAR:  Yes, but you know, the speed in which we have done it I think is pretty rapid, particularly when you look at some other historical context.  So you know, I think that's an element to take into place.  And then I think the other point is, don't want to lose -- I made this point already but I don't want us to lose this idea about the information requirements that these investors need to make an intelligible investment decision.</p><p>You look at the SEC Joshua White, I think it was an interesting report recently, study that looked at the OTC and I encourage everybody to read it but essentially look to the three tiers and as you move down in the tiers, the outcome for the investor and also liquidity decreases and I won't put an adjective there, I won't say rapidly decreased, but there's a -- there's a there is a correspondingly decrease in investor outcome when there's less information as a correspondent to decrease in liquidity when there's information.</p><p>So I think the requirements in the framework that we're talking about are not all just for investor protection.  I mean there are investor protection, but you know, there are also for the efficiency of the capital markets and ensuring there are sufficient information there for the flow of funds, flow of information, flow of securities.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So what you are saying is information drives the markets.</p><p>PIWOWAR:  That's what this report would suggest.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, exactly.  And that's why as I was saying earlier, it has to do with making sure that the investors in power to be able to make those decisions without that information they are not going to buy anything.</p><p>PIWOWAR:  And doesn't that argue for pre-empting the non-uniform current state regulatory scheme with a category of covered securities specific to Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers who are subject to fulsome information requirements.  </p><p>I mean, would you be satisfied as a regulator that the information that Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers are required to provide under statute sufficient for purposes of allowing a secondary market transaction in your state if they were -- let's assume that they were included in your manual, they would meet that requirement and you would be fine, right?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean speaking of solely Vermont regulator, you know, are manual exemption requirements are self-executing as I think they are everywhere so you know, what that means is for those in the committee is that they do not file a notice fine with us if they don't get our prior approval and they don't contact us, they look at the requirements, they meet them, they execute the transaction which, you know, provides efficiency on the transaction side.      So, you know, for Vermont, if those guardrails stayed in place, you know, whether it's in our stature or federal statute you know, the guardrails are in place, the investors are protected, the information is out there.  But you know, there is certain -- that's a Vermont standard and I can't say the same for even those in New England or those in another part of the country.</p><p>PIWOWAR:  But that's all more important fact that in coming up with whatever that federal \"X\" might be, it has to be in consultation with the states that there is a standard upon which the states can agree.  And then there is really no need at that point, you are satisfied with the information being provided and you take it from there, but I don't -- as you said this is self-explanatory, point one.</p><p>Point two is, I don't think the issue is pre-emption or not.  As I said earlier, I think it is making sure there is consistent information, if that takes the form of pre-emption, I would think as long as it is in consultation with NASA with the states and some they can get behind, well at least that's an easier road to take I think.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But the framework already exists.  The informational framework already exists at the state level in a majority of states. And the effort here would be to unify what is a fragmented regulatory scheme and if the only way to achieve that is through pre-emption, well you know, it's an unfortunate situation.  </p><p>I suppose if you are a state regulator, but the majority of state regulators currently offer exemptions for secondary market trades provided there is information available, 39, 44, whatever the number is so in order to get to that goal line of full compliance 54 jurisdictions so that you can then give the secondary markets for these kinds of issuers a fighting chance to survive.  Well, then perhaps pre-emption is the fix.</p><p>HANKS:  Can we say on the point of pre-emption and the secondary markets here because a point you made earlier Richard was, if we do pre-emption we should do pre-emption on the basis of the qualified purchases being just someone who buys and Reg A, period.  No restrictions on the investment levels as they are on primary market.  </p><p>This is a question for both of you, is the secondary market, why would you make that distinction?  Is there less pressure in the secondary trade and I don't think I am hearing that front from Martin. Or is that the information somehow more sufficient in a secondary trade than is primary trade?  Why make that distinction and how is the secondary trade different than the primary?</p><p>ALVAREZ:  Well, I think with the secondary trade at that point, you know, you're one generation sort of speaker removed from the issuer and from the IPO and the need for more robust disclosure, I think it's primal critical on the secondary trade, if I understand your question correctly.</p><p>HANKS:  So you would need more information...</p><p>ALVAREZ:  Not necessarily more, but equal too.  Because what happens is there is you know as -- once you've done with the IPO, the company, the issuer has the money now we are just talking about moving money between moving money and securities between investors and the question is, since you can't go -- the investor cannot go and call up the chief financial officer of the issuer, you do not kick the tires for speaking the same way for institutional investor might.  I think that what you are saying is you need sufficient information, what that is again is obviously up to discussion and disagreement.</p><p>But I think that's why it's important at the secondary level to make sure that what you may not have disclosure equal to that which is on a national exchange -- although that's to me the goal of standard and I understand there is a lot of expense involved with that and it could be prohibitive for it to produce information, there still has to be sufficient information, such that the investor is going in with his or her eyes wide open as to the risks and rewards.</p><p>HANKS:  And that is different than in the primary situation and try to (inaudible) on the one on one thing here that way you gone a buyer who is just going out there with and posted some securities and said -- sorry a seller who has posted securities, I am selling securities and then as a seller who comes along with and there is no broker involved so they are searching, \"oh this is an interesting company\", is there a different dynamic there in the secondary market than it would have been in the primary?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think it has to do with the relation...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Sorry what's that?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  If there prohibition secondary market right now, you know the issuer as an obligation, I think to make sure that it is unclear thing under Reg A who has the obligation to make sure that the cap's not exceeded, but how would you do that in the secondary sense.</p><p>HANKS:  It's self-certification anyway.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes OK.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But the question is whether or not, as you said there is a difference.  I know I would venture to say the primary distribution, the investor is relying on the issuer to provide the information that it needs to make that to make that investment, and in the secondary market, it's just you know, a normal contract.  </p><p>You know, you have a good to sell, and I can decide whether or not to buy it based on whatever information is out there.  The fact that I am or am not a qualified purchaser or a suitable purchaser should not matter because those funds are not going to the issuer, which is where suitability requirements are normally found.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  You think that makes a difference from the investor protection point of view and as that's actually a question from (inaudible).</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think at that point, there has to be some watchdog, some minimal amount of -- and I hate to use the words protection and empowerment of the investor so that they -- at that point they really just left their own resources so they can find the information great, if they can't that's too bad.  And to the extent that they decide to buy from this person, well why are they buying is it because they have done thorough research or is it just because it is a dartboard investment.</p><p>And for the small investor dartboard investment can be devastating to the retirement so my concern is that as you move further away from the issuer, the investor really is going out of haphazardly and not necessarily getting all the information that could be out there, whether it is accurate or not.  I mean to getting this from the seller at that point.  So, it's only so much diligence the a small investor can do for his or herself.  And I think that's a concern to me which is why a universal manual exemption which I don't think we disagree unnecessarily, is certainly stepping in the right direction.</p><p>Now whether or not that takes the form of pre-emption.  You know, that depends again as long as the if you can get the states on board, there some errors in which look -- even Bill Baydian, his testimony before Congress in May 1, 2014, clearly stated there sometimes there are some instances in which it is not every wrong that there is pre- emption.  It is not that it should never occur.  The thing is to make sure that what you are doing is well-thought-out and addresses the issues that the states if they were not pre-empted would address.</p><p>And I think that's one of the key considerations here is to figure out exactly where, how much information, what sort of information, how it is verified for the small investor.  The larger investor can get all the information he or she wants.  You know, that is that is not an issue.  The question is what is the small investor getting from whom and how can they rely on and that's that is my concern.  I suspect that might be the concern of states, but I'm not speaking on their behalf.</p><p>HANKS:  Is it Andrew or Laura?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I actually wanted to just bring out a comment, no matter what we do or we choose not to do I think we really need to understand what the implication is to the general economy and all states.  So, right now as how it's in my opinion, how it's laid out, it favors certain economic areas.  So even if we stay status quo, we don't do anything else, to Jonathan's point, frankly everybody here, the money's going to stay where the money knows, has the relationship in certain economic centers.  </p><p>And what we do is continue that process as we go along and then actually to the point, Michael I think you know, when you were talking you are asking Sarah about that secondary you know, what's the difference between the first and secondary?  And we are talking (inaudible) basically longer the company has been in business isn't that assigning in another self that this has a higher...      (UNKNOWN):  But the question is how are these companies necessarily in business when somebody flips out this...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  We don't ask these questions about listed companies.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Exactly, you don't do that.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It should be noticed that, noted that during 2008 during the crash, almost a third of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange went away.  So it's not that there is any guarantee there either and that's what is important for people to understand the small investor.  I mean all of us we get this, is that an investment is not a guaranteed rate of return and the problem is, a lot of investors think that they invest, they sit there in the money rolls in.  So, that is another different educational standpoint.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  The question to me occurs are we here and are we really just trying to protect a certain layer of investor or what about the balance on the other side to encourage business.  I will...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think it is balancing.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It is both, that's what I'm saying.  So I think that when we're talking about -- and I could be wrong, totally wrong.  I want to protect the investor to the extent that the investor should be protected.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I don't disagree with you.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And part of me says that you made the comment...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Is someone taking their whole investment portfolio, and they are buying stock in the secondary market without a bigger issue, right?  So really realistic where we're trying to target our efforts here is to that middle layer of investor's that has funds, OK? That is knowledgeable and can actually flow a lot of capital into that to grow companies.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But that's not probably company on the secondary market.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Just thought of an idea, so I just thought you know, we created a regime where there is this new type of platform under Title 3 of the Jobs Act.  What if there was a platform for secondary trading of Reg A securities that if things were traded on the -- you know, in the same way with the platform for Title 3, there is pre- emption, but the platforms have to meet certain requirements, they have to do certain kinds of investor education, could that be a potential solution?      (UNKNOWN):  Yes.  But on the crowd funding side, there were very, very discreet and particular requirements on who can operate a portal I mean that's you know, that's but -- and I think that that...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Not that hard to become a portal believe me.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But -- OK.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  You should see some of the portals out there, no offense.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I don't know, I guess I am biased, I view crowd funding a little differently than I view standard securities offerings.  And in the context of Reg A plus and Reg A plus Tier 2 specifically, as I commented earlier, I think the expectation is that this new regulatory scheme will promote a national type of a securities market and it should look more like what we are accustomed to seeing exchange listed, reporting company, securities rather than what is currently in place for crowdfunding which is at least for me as a Blue Sky lawyer a totally different end (ph).</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And I think crowdfunding for a lot of Blue Sky attorneys is -- yes, thank you.  It's a scary area because there is so much potential for chicanery there as opposed to Reg A plus.</p><p>But that doesn't mean that there are not issues to address there as well.  But I think the crowdfunding platform is not necessarily, although it's a good idea.  I don't know how it would actually work because again it is apples and oranges in terms of the caliber of what is being offered.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Right, I'm just making the analogy of a platform that has to be qualified by the SEC and in exchange for meeting a bunch of requirements.  There is pre-emption at the state level filings.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But Sarah mentioned there are a boatload of ATS out there that could serve as that platform.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  They went through already registered broker dealers.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Registered broker-dealers, right.  And then the question becomes if you're looking to use that as a vehicle to pre- empt state law under Section 18 there are particular criteria that have to be met for these ATS's and these exchanges to be able to have securities listed on them be deemed covered securities.</p><p>HANKS:  Do you have a question?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I also think a great way to lose a lot of money in a private market investment is to make like two investments or one.  And the proper way to do it is to actually build a portfolio of 20 to 25 companies so you have things like angel groups, and that sort of stuff that actively encourage a lot more of this type of investment.</p><p>And so I think that the current regulatory scheme not only does it not form a capital formation, but with the very, very, very low, almost non-existent volume of secondary transactions, investors are actually really hurt because they can't build portfolios.</p><p>And one of the frequent comments that I hear from angel investors who are actively building these portfolios is liquidity.  And so were essentially dependent on a very active merger and acquisition market which ends up consolidating companies which ends up decreasing the number of jobs because the merger and acquisition process is about consolidation, making large companies much more profitable.</p><p>And so the current way that we have is investors aren't making money, when they can make these sorts of investments they are at very high risk to actually lose the money, we're not having capital B-form for small businesses and we're having a lot of these really large massive corporations be formed and we're having less and less public companies.</p><p>And if -- the Angel Capital Association, how much money is actually invested in annual basis by angels to have that data?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Last year it was around $27 billion, right.  $27 billion.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And I think venture is about $50 billion a year, so that's about $75 billion.  But the lottery is a $65 billion a year business.  And I know that the lottery is targeting poor people and they are losing a ton of money at that.</p><p>I don't know, it feels like something is very broken and if we're expecting these small businesses to create these jobs, especially non- urban areas, I really think that something just got to change.  I would be interested like on the committee, you know, pre-emption versus not pre-emption.  I'm just interested in going around the table what do people think should be done.</p><p>HANKS:  That was going to be my next question because we've got like 10 minutes left and I'd like to see if we can make this into a recommendation.  Are we interested in giving a recommendation?  Bear in mind that the people that we give recommendations to here is the SEC, not to the States, alright.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Sarah, before the recommendation I just make one statement which is that -- I mentioned this in my earlier statements but the SEC and the states, that are really collaborative productive relationship I think for long time but -- well, go ahead Sebastian.</p><p>GOMEZ:  I second on that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I know and particularly as of late and we very much enjoy working Betsy and Sebastian and when Keith was here -- so when you're considering the recommendation I mean, you know, looking for ways for the states and the SEC to collaborate on this issue together I hope will be part of the consideration.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Sarah, if I just make one other editorial comment that -- recall that the original Regulation A died on the vine, principally because of concerns relating to burdensome state requirements.  No one used that form and it went away.  So you know, this latest iteration should be given a chance to grow.</p><p>And to Mike's point, I mean as I suggested in my comment about perhaps a solution being the establishment of the national manual, states certainly have a role to play in that.  They have -- they need to have a seat at the table because they are the policeman, those are the folks who are going to be enforcing the fraud actions when these investors lose their money.</p><p>And you know, if it involves a recommendation to pre-empt Tier 2 securities and secondary market transactions well the state should be involved in that discussion as well.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So we are in complete agreement now.</p><p>HANKS:  Duly noted regarding the State SEC dynamic that we want to encourage but can we just go around the table and hear what people have to say, especially people who you haven't heard much from this morning.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Sure.  I'm all for having a centralized information portal I guess, for lack of a better word that would allow the secondary transactions to happen.  I think definitely the states should be involved in that and what the standard is.</p><p>But there needs to be some sort of regulation on it and if we're taking the states out of that decision and then having them regulated. That's not a very good solution.  So I guess my answer is, yes, I'm all for having an essential information repository.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I don't think we'll get anywhere with that.  The state involvement, I think -- I do think like the apprehension from Reg A plus Tier 2 but I do think anything is going to have to have state involvement with it.</p><p>I'll commit from a small copy like that worrying about trying to raise money in different states, it is a big concern from our standpoint.  It's very, very difficult to have state to go through this.  But again, it's going to have to be a joint effort here.</p><p>HANKS:  Generally pre-emption, not pre-emption?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I don't know, I think there is room for a lot of creativity here.  I like the idea of some kind of a pilot program, maybe just within a single state.  I think Jonathan and I would volunteer to help out with that in our state, California.</p><p>And look at what would -- because California is a huge economy, if we limited secondary trading to just California we might learn a lot from that without having to do pre-emption and then maybe go from there.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Sarah, I am in favor of the pre-emption.  One of the things I think about -- again, coming from investor's point of view, is I look at the impact on the economy, what happens when we get a liquidity event and we put that money into play into other companies, other start-up companies or we put it into play buying a piece of real estate or we put it into play to buy other things and so that what you get is the multiplier effect on the economy.</p><p>And when you can't -- when you don't have liquidity, you impact the economy and we don't know what that impact is.  So let's see, I'd be very much in favor of something that's capitally efficient.  It's a balance that includes the states and it's another opportunity for us to have a very vibrant economy.  Thank you.</p><p>HANKS:  Jonathan?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think the best way to create a market is to make it as big as possible and have as many buyers at the table and as many sellers at the table as possible.  The last time I talked to someone about doing a California State exemption, the California state regulators said that they were ready to do dozens of these approvals every single year.</p><p>That just doesn't feel like a very large volume and it's not saying that -- it's not saying that they are not doing an amazing job and that is not a very hard job, and it's a thankless job because if there is fraud you get spanked and if there is capital formation, no one cares that you did your job.</p><p>But I think that these markets need to be as big as possible and they need to be as liquid as possible.  Otherwise the investors get spanked.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Michael, I don't know who first said it, genius is somebody who sees a trend coming and runs to embrace it.  I think this -- I mean we're dealing with ancient laws, 1933.  Even I weren't born right then.  So -- but they don't fit where we are right now, OK.</p><p>And it seems to me that there are two choices, either pre-emption which your group don't want and I understand or we got to have something that does work that involves states.  My approach would be that there are some period of time, two years strikes me as reasonable that NASA, your organization, gets together and comes up with something that's 50 states or 53 -- is that the number of agencies, 54, by answer, OK and you're willing to live with.</p><p>And then we all get hand-in-hand and go walking up to Congress and do whatever we can to make it happen, but I think if the organization don't do that pre-emption is coming and then you won't have any jurisdiction over it all.  I mean we have to have some sort liquidity for these investors.</p><p>And I hate fraud, I really do.  I mean I've thrown away many clients that were coming to me that they weren't going to do the right thing and I've said hit the bricks.  So I mean, believe it or not, I seem like a ruthless businessman but I am not, I'm on your side.</p><p>But that's what I see the trend is being and you obviously got to run and embrace it.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'm not quite as eloquent as Patrick.  But I think throughout the entire discussion now and being from Iowa or the typical flyover Midwest, I want to make sure that as we move forward the recommendation that we take into consideration that a lot of these regulations and items that we've been discussing maybe were based upon a reactionary or fear fraud and protecting.</p><p>So we need to make sure that is it protection or is it elimination?  So we need to make sure that as we take that next step that we are looking at everything; and so I don't mean to sound like on the fence over Switzerland or anything like that but I do have to agree with Catherine and am that would be where I stand.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think it's really important for the committee to remember that Reg A plus has three options, right.  You have Tier 1 where there is no information being disseminated after the offering takes place.  There is Tier 2 where there is no information voluntarily disseminated after the offering takes place.</p><p>In both of those situations I would love to see the states come up with some kind of common approach to information requirements that allows for secondary transactions to occur in all 50 states, a 100 percent.  With respect to Tier 2 voluntary reporting, going various point, the centralized information portal is EDGAR.</p><p>Those companies are filing public information with the Securities Exchange Commission as available on the SEC's website.  So that information is out there, as long as those companies are voluntarily reporting, I don't see how the states interest to acquire information dissemination through a manual is more efficient or effective than dissemination through the SEC's EDGAR Website with SEC oversight enforcement and everything else to create fraud prevention and an investor protection.</p><p>So my vote would be pre-emption for Tier 2 securities that are voluntarily reporting on an ongoing basis.  Once that volunteer reporting stops, then they fall on to the other buckets and they have to satisfy the state requirements but again.</p><p>I want to reiterate my point about the fact that broker-dealers cannot create secondary markets in these securities; and also that the manual exemption is not available in every jurisdiction.  So it could definitely be detrimental to capital information for small companies in states where they cannot actually legally provide secondary transactions, even under Tier 1 or Tier 2 non-reporting.</p><p>HANKS:  I just want to point out that with respect to the words voluntarily, I mean there is an obligation in most circumstances to keep going.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Actually it's -- there is -- as Sarah said, it is not just the first year, it is just -- it's an obligation in which there is an ability to suspend that report, obligation or terminate the report immigration just a specific categories.  But so I think when we say voluntarily I think it's in a different census voluntarily just because I want to -- the rules do require them to do it.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  That's what I meant, (inaudible) the company is dessemning information through the SEC, they should be in the pre- emption bucket.  I'm using the long-term (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Right.  I didn't want to let any of my clients get the wrong idea when I told them they have to do this.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Well, first stuff I want to say; I don't think we're going to do anything (inaudible) and I do appreciate that.  I have family members who work for the State so I think it's a very important function actually that occurs, but I think and we're stronger when we work together, right.</p><p>And I'm glad the SEC states have been working actually much better than the insurance.  So I mean that is very; so kudos and props.  But with all said and done, I think when I look at our perspective and what we need to do from an overall basis, unfortunately, because I don't take -- I hate to put down regulation on top of regulation.</p><p>The data (ph) market, that is controlled -- that protects the investors while encourages investment at that next level because that's a gap we're missing.  When we see -- you know, Jonathan gave a great example of how it's supposed to work and unfortunately I think we have a little bit of gap here because you use the capital both number of companies that are forming -- are down, the number of people that are growing our organizations, they are growing IPO is down.</p><p>The number of large entities actually is down through consolidation and the actual numbers look really good but it's not just a matter of dollars, right, sometimes it is a matter of large numbers.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Michael, I'm not going to ask you -- but is there anything that you and Michelle too would like to add before we move on?</p><p>PIWOWAR:  Well, I do want to thank Richard and Martin, they did a nice job presenting the points and counter points.  The only other their thing I wanted to mention which I didn't get to bring up was the relative newness of this general concept of allowing investors to invest smaller or what would previously be privately held, potentially private offerings or private companies.</p><p>And I think we see it on the primary market side and I assume it's the same thing on the secondary market side that from an investor demand perspective these exemptions are so new that investors saying, wait a minute, I didn't think I could invest in something like that or I've always been told this was the case or they do not know what a Reg A offering is or they don't know what a crowdfunding offering is.      So I think there is some element of investor education and further sort of maturity in these arenas that need to happen as well and in terms of secondary liquidity ever happening regardless of what the regulatory framework (inaudible) so I just want to put that out as an additional point.</p><p>HANKS:  (Inaudible).  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Thank you very much.  Really fascinating to walk into this and I think as part of an ongoing dialogue and trying to catch up on this, completely persuaded on the side that this would be filling an important gap area in our economy, we see that the area that where access to capital is most needed is in that area like $1 million and below EBITDA.</p><p>And so despite all of our efforts on SBA's side and to encourage investors to get more early-stage, more local we're still not meeting the markets.  So I think I'm very much persuaded by a uniform platform of information in order to try to put more vibrancy and predictability into this segment of the market.</p><p>In terms of pre-emption, I really would like to defer to all of you.  My gut instinct is that there's something very inefficient about all 54 units trying to get to this uniformity, but hesitant to move in the pre-emption direction prematurely.  Thank you.</p><p>HANKS:  So with that I think I'm going to put some thoughts together and we'll discuss this afternoon whether we move on with a recommendation on try and pull of these things together and see whether you agree with the way that I've summarized it.</p><p>We're going to move on to discussion of the broker dealer status of finders and so thank you to Richard and Martin.  I really appreciate it.</p><p>So moving on to the broker-dealer issue; we've talked many times about the finders issue, urging the commission to take steps to clarify the current ambiguity and broker-dealer regulation for people who act as intermediaries in private placements or find potential investors.</p><p>And one of the reasons we care so much about this is the fact that to the extent a small company uses someone to help find capital and that person should have been registered as a broker-dealer and wasn't then that deal is -- by its nature resendable (ph), which is a terrible source of uncertainty for small companies to have to live with.  But they do it and they do it all the time and we've talked about this just because they are so desperately in need of capital.</p><p>So the prior iteration of this committee made a recommendation to the commission along those lines, just before the committee was renewed in September 2015.  I think you've all got a copy of that on your -- at your desks.  Shout if you don't have it.</p><p>Some of us were members of during the development of that recommendation and others have joined since then.  I would also note that the American Bar Association task force on private placement brokers has existed for some like 17 years now.  It's also urged clarity in this area with some progress; the broker, the M&amp;A broker no action position, which was very much appreciated, but there is still areas of significant uncertainty.</p><p>Knowing the importance of this issue to so many of us, we wanted to do sort of bring him down to see whether we wanted to reissue this recommendation since we have a new chairman and senior leadership coming into the SEC, new Congress in session.</p><p>It seems that if we're not satisfied with the status quote and I think -- I hope I am not jumping the gun in saying that many of us are not satisfied that we want to make sure that this is not overlooked.</p><p>So with that, does anybody wants to reiterate some of that the points they've made and I don't know if we have our representatives from (inaudible); do you guys want to say anything?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It's Joanne (ph) from Division of Trading Markets.  I know Steve Looperelo (ph), our former director spoke to last fall and he just pointed out that we totally hear you but there is also two competing regulatory concerns; one is capital formation and the other is the protection of investors, particularly retail investors.</p><p>And so I think the one thing we would ask you as you go forward is to sort of address; if you could, the protections for the retail investors.  And with that I will here to answer your questions if we can.  Thank you.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'll be happy to speak.  Jenny, will you?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HANKS:  I think Jenny and then you.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I just had a quick question on the fourth point before the recommendation, it's say deal only with accredited investors but I don't think the recommendation actually says that.  So I personally would be very concerned about limiting this to people that deal only with accredited investors.  So I just wanted to see if we could get some clarity on that because it looks like it's in the preamble but not in the recommendation itself.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think the thinking those to the extent an exemption were to be developed then it would be appropriate to take the investor status into account but I'm interested to hear that.  And again, to answer Joanne's question, I mean to the extent we were to encourage a broker deal -- a limited broker-dealer exemption and it would not to have anything be dependent on the investor status as accredited or sophisticated; how would you protect the investor?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  This kind of goes back to our discussion about accredited and you know, whether the definition of accredited is actually protecting investors but I just think it's something we should think about.  I think limiting company -- you know, most of my clients -- I work with small businesses to raise money and most of my clients raise money from both accredited and unaccredited investors using usually under Rule 504 and state level exemptions.</p><p>And I think if this recommendation only applies to companies raising money from accredited investors, I think it really limits the applicability to companies that I want to talk to more than just accredited investors.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Commissioner Stein I want to direct this to you particularly because I think this is -- at the commission level where this belongs.  We had -- as far as I'm concerned a very unsatisfactory conversation, Mr. Luperela (ph), at our last meeting.</p><p>And as I told him, I think this is a worst case of bureaucratic waiting for (inaudible) I've ever seen.  They've been sitting on this for 16 years -- 16 or 17, I count 19, I don't know, but it's a long time.  And as obviously they are dissembling and wasting taxpayer time and I have no intention of ever moving on this that is the division of trading markets.  I don't know if that comes from the commissioner or not, but I do know this, that a tremendous amount of taxpayer time has been wasted on this.</p><p>If they could have just say we're never going to act on this and we're just playing -- stringing you along, it would have been very, very helpful and we could have done something else or going to licked our wounds and forgotten about the idea.</p><p>But instead we've had this constant teasing and even today we're hearing more from the division about what you want talk about, we understand your concerns -- I don't think they care about our concerns over there, frankly ma'am.  I think that you've got your own agenda and the public and the taxpayer be damned.</p><p>And I have no -- as far as my recommendation for the division, I don't know how to speak to the commissioners but to the division, I'm trying to figure a recommendations and that's not obscene.  I mean, I am -- I am so frustrated with this, I don't think anybody over there really cares or pretending to be listening; and I am convinced that if anything is going to be done on this, it will come from Capitol Hill.</p><p>HANKS:  Patrick if we could, I'm glad we skipped the bit about the obscene bid, so thank you for that.  But to addresses this, I mean I think there are some legitimate concerns when we see and we have raised this every time wet consent about the small companies who are absolutely desperate and there is this guy at the golf club who knows some folks and can introduce them.</p><p>Do you have an answer to that, though, what if the guy at the golf club is like -- well, I know some folks and they were part of my Elks club or whatever and I know they are pretty rich.  What about investor protection?  Are we saying that we don't need it there or is there an alternative way that we can loop into this recommendation?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  We've got the recommendations by the American Bar Association that promulgated 10 years -- roughly 10 years ago.  David Barton, over at Heritage Foundation recommendations.  I mean as far as I am concerned we don't need to tail that soil again, their recommendations and you can and get any number of -- I mean if you like for me to bring him to the next meeting?</p><p>HANKS:  I think we actually have someone.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I mean I don't see why we need to put the metal horsepower and to making recommendations that will be ignored once again.  And I just -- you know, maybe bang my head against the wall for 16 years; I've decided it's time to stop.</p><p>I mean I haven't been working on this for 16 years, but people have and I am not willing, frankly, to do anymore head banging.  I've given up, I'm completely dissatisfied that any regulatory action will ever be taken on this, 16 years is enough.</p><p>HANKS:  I will know that a couple of the members of the ABA taskforce have celebrated the 80th birthdays while they were waiting for...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I know two of those lovely ladies.</p><p>HANKS:  So nothing other than what's already in the record with respect to...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  What's already in the record; as I said to in that meeting; this topic has been studied as much as anything, but the Bible and the Torah, so it's time for action or just say we're not going to do anything.</p><p>HANKS:  And saying we're not going to do anything that I think part of the problem; one of the reasons that we do keep circling back to this is that there is a certain amount of uncertainty -- there is at least one no action letter out there and we know that no action letters only apply to the specific pop star that they apply to.</p><p>But to the extent there are still people out there relying on that and saying that statement is still out there that no action letter has not been withdrawn.  And there are people doing these deals and doing the golf club deals and one of the things that I have said is, we're at a point, it matters so much as what the answer is but just that there is an answer.</p><p>And then make a point that I've made before as well.  It's not fair on the guys who are playing by the rules.  That there are some -- and for my own industry, the online capital formation industry, there are electronic platforms who are not playing by the rules.</p><p>And then I've got clients saying well they get away with it and nobody is arrested.  And to the extent some -- and I was explaining, well, the SEC doesn't have handcuffs because they are a civil agency; they don't have the right to do that, but as long as they keep saying nobody's been arrested for doing that, you're going to have this dichotomy waived.</p><p>You've got the guys who are playing by the rules and paying for it, and the guys who are kind of getting away with it; everyone is saying there is nothing out there.  So certainty, even if it's bad certainty to certain extent is helpful, but that's just my own opinion.  I'd be interested to note who else in the room would like even bad certainly.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  A quick question and going back to the whole question of state dialogue; even if there was certainty at the federal level wouldn't we still have to deal with...</p><p>HANKS:  You're absolutely right.  I mean to the extent to go about to another discussion, to the extent there's no pre-emption and I don't see it.  I'm one of the things that we've seen again in the online communities; some people saying well those platforms have there no action letters, but we, state regulators, that's just their silly federal thing, we don't recognize it.</p><p>And as far in state acts; as far as we're concerned, there is still broker-dealers, so we do have uncertainty at the state level as well.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, that happened with the company called Profounder in California, I remember that.</p><p>HANKS:  It was California and not the Fed CTM.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Exactly.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  When I think about this, you know, how we're defining the difference is between someone who provides names versus someone who sells the transaction, right?  A broker dealer sells a transaction, a finder simply introduces.</p><p>HANKS:  It depends which side of the interpretation you fall on. I mean there are some folks would say anybody who brings together buyers and sellers of securities and takes money for doing that is going to be a broker-dealer.  Even if the compensation is not derived or calculated on the basis of the amount of security solved.</p><p>There are some people who say, so long as it is not a transaction-based compensation, then they say it's not a broker- dealer, but I don't think anyone has ever agreed that.  And so you get a wide range of interpretations at both federal and state level.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But how much is the issuer responsible for ensuring that the information is provided in that -- they're accredited; that kind of thing.  I mean that really comes on down the issue at that point; after that point, right?</p><p>HANKS:  The issue has got a whole bunch of things to worry about including if I raise money by using a non-registered broker-dealer who should have been registered, that transaction could be rescinded.  And so you've got a put hanging over your head forever.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  The visions position also is if a lawyer participates with a run registered broker, the lawyers violate the securities laws too.  So the fact is they are separating the business person from his or her lawyer.</p><p>HANKS:  Anyone in favor of more certainty even if it's wrong or -- because we keep making the recommendations -- and it would be nice if we could sort of move this ahead in some way?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'm struggling with this, not because I don't think we should move ahead with it.  I'm struggling because I think about the situations in which someone gets introduced or hears about the opportunity to invest in something and -- I mean it's going to happen and, you know, it's -- when I think about the private investor market; if there is a great deal of it, that is to say formalized, but there is still a lot of unformalized capital out there.</p><p>So I think we should put -- I think this puts some structure around that unformalized capital, that's why I like it.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  (inaudible)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It's really hard sitting next to Patrick sometimes. But...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I noticed it may be closer to the door.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But overall and I think it -- I feel like we have opened Pandora's Box and we have really animated debates regarding a lot of the issues that have come out and even when I am going back to the Midwest, and talking to people; it's like well you have to do this, this is what the rules are.</p><p>But we need to make sure that there is something -- that something moves forward, that we move the needle off zero.  We have to take action and it needs to be though collaborative, you can't have a mom versus dad.  Well, here is how I'm going to interpret this because this works better for us.  Here is how I'm going to interpret this.</p><p>And versus you know, what's the worst that could happen?  In only hurts if you get caught.  We need to make sure that you know, are we playing the protectionism in too far and making so much, but not being able to work together to achieve our goal.</p><p>And at the same time I think we've really shifted on what is our actual goal?  Is it fully a regulatory and here is what we want to do so that things fit into our funnel or we looking at what the markets are out there and what entrepreneurs and small businesses are actually defining as the new way of doing business and how they need to achieve that capital and get business done.</p><p>And I think that kind of lead us into our debate later this afternoon, but I want to see -- there needs to be a movement somewhere.</p><p>HANKS:  Which direction would you like the movement to be?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So that it works better for our companies.  And that would be my answer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HANKS:  I vote in favor of workability.  Ann Marie (ph), since you go to background in the broker industry?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I don't know that I'm qualified to comment on what team colleague said, but I'd probably agree with her.</p><p>HANKS:  And then it just -- one of the questions is whether we would -- whether and to what extent we wanted to reissue the comments that we made in September with respect to getting some -- get behind as reduced -- reducing ambiguity, but the question then is; in what direction does that -- does the reduction in ambiguity go?</p><p>One of the things that I've said is even having the wrong answer, at least it's an answer and it gives us some certainty.  What are your feelings on that?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Well, you know, we've talked that this as a committee.  Patrick is very passionate about the subject and...</p><p>HANKS:  He reiterated his passion.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I heard it.  It's very worthwhile listening to.  </p><p>I think the fact is that I was -- and that you were talking about Mr. Luprello (ph) as I left the room.  I was disappointed in his answer to the committee we're talking about that.  I think that we know that there is bad practices in the market, we know that there are people who don't understand the rules, we know there are platforms out there that are not registered and following the rules in a way that makes sense to me.</p><p>So I think I would definitely like to see the SEC take more specific action in the context of finders and platforms involved in primary and secondary transactions that may not be registered broker- dealers, you've got some no action letters out there from treating in markets to certain platforms that are helpful but potentially not being followed by the rest of the market.  So maybe more obvious disclosure efforts -- sorry, more obvious enforcement efforts to the extent -- you know, necessary no Patrick feels like there is not enough enforcement, obvious enforcement in this space.</p><p>I really do worry about companies hiring people to help them find capital and then not having that debt in a way that's consistent with the security's laws; that's not good for the investors and not the market.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I agree with you Sarah that having nothing sends the message that if you I have no enforcement to Patrick's perspective for looking the other way, it sends the message that it's really not an important regulation.  It's really not relevant.</p><p>So I am of the point that if we have something out there we probably should -- we can't selectively apply, right?  You can't selectively enforce because if you do that exists down a hole in another rabbit hole, so let's get off the bucket.      HANKS:  And any thoughts in what this initiative would look like and do we still -- do you still agree with the some of the things said out in the 2015 letter?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Well, personally no but I'm willing to say let's go, let's just -- let's do something.  I think we all don't agree with everything all the time and so it's just -- if -- I don't really understand why this is happening and -- so I just want to register out there, the fact that if we don't do something, that sends a message out there to people to take the risk.</p><p>And so therefore by again non-action, we're creating the environment, we're creating the environment.  And if we are OK with that, I know we're not happy with that, but if we are -- if we accept the consequences of non-action then we need to be prepared down the line (inaudible).</p><p>HANKS:  OK.  So if I were to -- it's kind of difficult to summarize because it's clear that not everybody agrees with the exact specifications in the 2015, but if we were to say that we would like greater certainty and that certainly could take a number of different shapes, including compliance and disclosure typing initiatives, answers to Q&amp;As.</p><p>I mean -- I think there -- not to put words into the mouth of the TNM guys,  but I think there has always been this some -- well, there is a slippery slope here and if we let this happen then what happens next?  But Q&amp;A type interpretations of who is a broker and who isn't might be tremendously helpful, even if it doesn't go as far as no action letter.</p><p>All right, that seems like a very innocent sort of thing to encourage and also to encourage that the staff also took to the states because one of the things that we are seeing -- we see this in the Reg A field.  We see for example, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Dakota have completely different interpretations of the dealer requirements. And so some kind of coordination at that level as well would be tremendously helpful.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It sounds like we're kind of talking about a speed limit issue aren't we.  Like what's the speed limit in your city or on a highway in New York City (ph)?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I have no idea.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Like 65?  Do they give you five miles an hour, do they give you 10 miles an hour or 15?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  My cousin's a state trooper, so I get a little bit...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think it's six because just for the margin of error.      (UNKNOWN):  And so -- you know, what is the actual rule in -- what is the actual speed limit and what actually gets enforced are sometimes diverse and sometimes -- I actually think you're getting your answer, Patrick.</p><p>I love you, but I think what I am hearing is that the SEC is saying, well, this is the speed limit, but we might give you five, we might give you 10 over, but at the same point in time don't be a jerk about it otherwise we might come down and pull you over and give you a ticket.</p><p>HANKS:  I'm not sure that we do have a speed limit even with the Anne-Marie rider.  And I think that's the problem.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And that and applying private litigation.</p><p>HANKS:  And I think that is a really good point, I mean in private litigation this is what's hanging over the heads of small companies is; you do a deal that was put together by the dude at the golf club who knows some guys.  And then it turns out that that was really bad investment.</p><p>And so what happens is a plaintiff's lawyer gets hold of it and goes OK, we are going to get your money back because that was a broker-dealer and he wasn't registered.  And that's what hangs over the heads of small companies all the time.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Sarah, I mean what I was looking at is the document that Greg sent -- e-mailed this evening.  I couldn't be here.</p><p>HANKS:  That's the ABA one?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So, it means what we are doing is we're classifying people to be intermediaries by making an introduction, and if they disclose or form -- or they're acting as an intermediary they are not selling and that the issuer says, you know, I understand this that this person is not selling and that these people that I am being introduced to are accredited investors.</p><p>I will not take anyone, but accredited investors.  What's the problem because they are not selling, they are acting as -- and if we define immediary (ph) and intermediary, if someone who does not sell, does not provide the PPM, does not provide -- you know, then that person all they are doing is an introduction.</p><p>HANKS:  All right, which is what we -- but we can't define the law and the guys who do interpret that the regulations are the guys we need the guidance from.  And that's one of the things that we were encouraging is this sort of limited purpose introductory.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I mean I -- that's what I'm thinking is, just what we've done here to me works fine because we're just -- we're just putting structure so let's define it.  Let's have a form.</p><p>HANKS:  And anybody against a rewrite of recommendation -- that be one of the courses that we would like to see from trading markets.      (UNKNOWN):  And to abstain from any further action from a regulatory standpoint on this.</p><p>HANKS:  Even if it's good action?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Sixteen years of good action.</p><p>HANKS:  Anyone else wanted to weigh in on the form that I captured?  That's the one that was circulated from (inaudible).  That would at least be something.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'd like to get the SEC's opinion on what that letter -- what they would do if a case came in front of them and somebody had the exemption letter that was referred to in the document?</p><p>HANKS:  I'm sorry, I'm not sure we've seen that, but I think that there is a vehicle for requesting no action or an exemptive order if you want some regulatory certainty, some clarity.  So there are established processes if this is something you'd like to pursue.</p><p>This is the -- I think it's from the ABA recommendations that you're looking at that.  But it's right at the moment.  So I mean I think the answer is, this is -- that's just a privately produced piece of paper and then if you took that to the SEC and said, if we did this, would it be OK?  Then I think the appropriate action would be to request no actual position.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HANKS:  Which I received on a case-by-case basis and only apply to the people they received to.  And we would like it to go a little further from that.  Anyone else on the brokers?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'm wondering what the reaction was when -- you know, to the recommendations that were made by the ABA.  What was the response?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think this is going back, but it contemplate a limit purpose registration scheme without the participation.  And the question is then, who monitors, who examines?  We, right now, are taking on all the investment advisory industry, so we're little short on resources.</p><p>So it's a question of you bringing folks in, we're putting additional regulatory burns on the SEC and we don't really have a lot of resources; you know, quite apart from the merits, you know, what you might think on particular point?  I think I was saying that Steve had told the folks from the ABA last summer.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Maybe again -- I'll analogize again to Title 3 of the Jobs Act; there is this new type of entity that is not a full broker- dealer, but it's regulated by FINRA.  You know, maybe that could be a solution that you know we have this limited type of registration, that's not a full broker-dealer, but it's a finder and it does become a member of FINRA, but with much more limited regulation.  I would support that.      HANKS:  A limited purpose broker-dealer and in fact...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Right, similar to that (inaudible) portals.</p><p>HANKS:  And you would of course need regulations to create that both with at the SEC and FINRA.  And also you would need -- I mean one of the things that we should point out -- some of those Title 3 crowdfunding platforms is; this one is bitten the dust for regulatory reasons already.  So there is a regulatory burden and keeping an eye on those folks.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, I'm not one to create more regulation, but I think that -- I agree with Jenny there.  I think that would be a good solution, but there is also the idea of -- when somebody doesn't do it; I mean are they being reserved, are there consequences for that. It sounds like there is quite a few transactions that are considered securities transactions that are not being monitored regulation as imposed on those.</p><p>HANKS:  Does anyone else have any other questions or comments on the (inaudible).  I just want to say thank you guys for coming by and I know this is the typical Washington poly (ph) game of lining people up and yelling at them.</p><p>And we want say thank you very much for coming back and hearing us and hopefully we don't take it personally but we do appreciate what you're doing.  But you hear us, I mean we want some certainty here.</p><p>Thank you everybody.  We are now going to adjourn until 1:45. And we will be talking then about why more companies are staying private.  Thank you.</p><p>(RECESS)</p><p>HANKS:  OK.  Thanks and welcome back everybody.  Sorry for the delay to those of you on the webinar, we had bit of a technical problem.  So we're now going to talk about why more companies are staying private or try and answer that question,</p><p>There was an interesting article in the January 6th Wall Street Journal focused on the lower number of U.S. IPOs over the last decade and calling the -- referring to a gusher of private capital.  We all know plenty of small companies that would love to benefit from this gusher of small capital and who are not seeing it probably but it's absolutely true that the decrease in the number of companies going public is no news to any of us.</p><p>The article talked about several possible theories as to why the private markets have proven more attractive in recent years, the companies that traditionally would have been candidates for an IPO.  I am pretty sure everybody here has got their own thoughts on the topic and we'll be discussing those.  But it's definitely a topic that we want to discuss in depth and further, and see what the trends are that are influencing companies decisions to stay private.</p><p>We're going to hear from three separate presenters, each of whom has extremely relevant experience in this area.  I don't know if this is the order you're going in, but it's order I've got.  So is James Hutchinson or Jamie, a partner in the private equity group of the law firm Goodwin Procter, as well as a member of Goodwin's technology and emerging companies FinTech and impact on responsible investing practice.</p><p>Jamie has extensive experience advising funds in the portfolio companies in a wide variety of transactions.  He has been a key contributor to his firm's online resources for start-ups, emerging companies and the entrepreneurial community.</p><p>Next we have Glen Giovannoni of the Global Life Sciences Leader at accounting from Ernst &amp; Young.  He has close to 30 years of experience with Ernst &amp; Young, at the majority serving clients in the biotech and medical device industries.  He has extensive experience -- sorry, he published a blog in response to the Wall Street Journal article I mentioned earlier which we will have.  So I look forward to hearing his thoughts on the topic.</p><p>And finally, we welcome Yanev Suissa, founder of SineWave Ventures.  Yaniv was formally with the large VC firm New Enterprise Associates, where he focused on early-stage investments in tech and energy companies.  He also helped form the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program, where he was engaged in the underwriting of billions of dollars of debt for estimates to companies within the energy technology industry.</p><p>And please take it from here.  Is it Jamie, you first or...</p><p>HUTCHINSON:  Glenn's got it.</p><p>HANKS:  Alright, Glenn, thank you.</p><p>GIOVANNONI:  Well, thank you and thanks to the entire committee for the invitation, it's great to here.  We're hopeful we can -- we catalyze some good discussion; we were talking earlier, I mean I'm sure there is a definitive answer on this, but we'll put forth some ideas.  And thank you for promoting the blog, that was a bit of a coincidence.</p><p>I read that same article heading out to the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference every year in San Francisco, kind of kicks off the year for life science companies; and sat there and said, really 30 percent your public companies; that can't be the case in biotech.  And I think what explore today is it, you know, biotech is obviously only one small part of the entire economy and it may be the exception that proves the rule for firm certain unique attributes of that of the particular sector.</p><p>And in fact, what I was pointing out the blog was that the number of publicly listed biotech companies is up 40 percent over the same period of time.  So the trend has actually reversed, but we'll explore it, the broader issues and answers if there is some relevance from biotech, I'll introduce that.</p><p>I thought what I do is -- start just with some bigger picture context setting and run through just a number of the data charge test hopefully help inform structure around it and then will dive into some of the real specific issues around this question of why are more staying staying private.  And we've had a chance to talk a little bit ahead of the session so little bit -- hopefully Jamie will be in everywhere so.  And of course please stop us any point, we don't need to make presentation -- we're have to entertain questions.  </p><p>So what's here and maybe a little hard to see the distance. There were a couple of academic studies that spurred some of this media coverage.  This particular one I think was actually quoted in a Bloomberg story about six months before the Wall Street Journal picked up the story there in early January.  And you know, coming on the fact that we've seen this significant decrease in the number of publicly traded companies and looking at why.</p><p>And (inaudible) so summarize some of the data from that study itself, just in 10 year blocks.  So their data when through 2012; so it's a little bit dated.  But you can kind of see some of the trend here of the rise in public companies up until 1995 and then a decrease.  </p><p>Since then and just pictorially, the green bars here are the number of IPOs.  The grey bars are the number of M&amp;A transactions where companies effectively delisted a transaction, and the red are our delisting's for a cause, right?  Which you see were pretty significant leading up to and late 90s leading up to the sort of the dotcom frenzy of quite a few IPOs.  And even in the decade after and they've diminished a bit; so we can argue whether it is positive or negative, but I think the number of companies going public today are less likely to be delisted.  There a little bit more substantial, they been private a little longer, they probably have a little more capital right.</p><p>So you know, I think it's person fair to say maybe they are more sustainable than say the average company that was listing in the late 90s.  The next slide is just to make the point; I've got a couple of slides on this, but quickly we want to look at this from the standpoint of -- is this is a U.S. phenomenon, a global phenomenon, you know what's happening here where we have a delisting -- or not delisting I'm sorry, but a decrease in the number listed companies.</p><p>This slide is not very interesting because the data didn't change very much, but basically what it says is 90 percent plus that 94 percent last year of IPOs happen on domestic exchanges, only six percent are cross-border.</p><p>And then if you say, well the U.S. have a particular problem, because certainly listings arts or going quite a rapid in many exchanges around the world.  Does U.S. have a problem or when companies choose to list cross-border, they come here is what the take away here is.  The yellow bar a number of foreign private issuers coming to the U.S. and you can see the other markets; how they compare.</p><p>So it suggests that we don't have some unique problem where our companies are finding their way to go public in other places and that sort of capped up on this slide which shows that in 2016 the only two U.S. companies chose to list exclusively overseas.  So they may have -- there may be other, there is quite a few others who probably want to do list but they are also listed, not a primary list here.</p><p>You know, a handful of year saw, there is another market for me. I'm not going to choose a here in the U.S.  So then more to what's going on with private companies.  This is data from venture source, and I'd direct you to the yellow line there and the grey line towards the bottom.  Those represent seed and first round; so by translation I guess company formations rate over the last many years.</p><p>And the numbers you can't read there on the right are you know running around last several years, 15 to 1,800 venture-backed companies created.  So that's sort that sort of the inflow of likely IPO candidates not exclusively but earnings go public because family owned businesses, non-venture backed companies can make the way to the public market but this is a pretty big indication of the funnel.  And we see since we kind of created after the dotcom frenzy back to the beginning of the 2000's, with a little hiccup there around the financial crisis.</p><p>There has been a relatively steady climb up, so it's not necessarily that the funnel is not there for companies that you know, would otherwise choose to seek an IPO.  The IPOs haven't increased at the same pace and that's a large part of the reason we're having this conversation, we'll get into the more larger -- some of the larger dynamics the way that is but you can see IPOs prior to 2000 were running at 400 or 500 a year.</p><p>Since the financial crisis you know we're in the 200 to 300 depending on -- I'm sorry, since the -- sort of dotcom highs and the recovery there in the 200 to 300 IPOs a year, last year was quite a bit lower than that.  And so there has been a different bar set relative to the number of IPOs.  And what we're experiencing is that companies are staying private longer.</p><p>Now the company that gets through is represented by these numbers and gets public, probably is a little bit more substantial in terms of it's time to grow as a private company, perhaps a little better financed and sent -- hence received fewer of the delisting's.  This is the same data, I won't go over that -- it excludes the foreign private issuers; this is just purely U.S.  company is going public on U.S. exchanges.</p><p>And then you know, the other -- the other way companies disappear is they get bought of course, and this data is from dialogic (ph) and its acquisitions of all private companies; venture backed, not venture backed by strategic investors, by PE or financial investors, it's kind of an all in numbers.</p><p>So it's maybe not right on point relative to the population of companies that may go public but it gives you an indication that we're in a robust M&amp;A environment, and have been for quite some time as the industries are consolidating and we see that at the top end with the Fortune 500 in terms of -- pardon me, the amount of revenue and assets, and the economy they control is also a trend of greater externalization for larger companies looking for innovation and be willing to buy it.</p><p>So there is an awful lot of deal activity that -- you know, these are companies that otherwise may have matriculated to the public market that better acquired while private.</p><p>Another cut of the data, much smaller numbers; these are the same dataset but deals over $100 million.  So this is the group of companies that might have been IPO-ready if you want to think about it that way relative to the market cap, you know, whether that's 100 or up to $300 million to $400 million takeout price.</p><p>So you know, if you're looking at a couple of hundred in a year on the IPO side, there is double that number of private companies that otherwise may have considered an IPO that are selling in M&amp;A transactions.</p><p>This is just for your information, the number of publicly traded companies that are coming out -- this isn't really germane to the private company story, this is existing public companies that are being acquired, and you can see that while it's pretty steady, it's actually quite a bit lower, more of that acquisition activity have been much earlier in the decade and even into the late 1990s.</p><p>So that kind of leads us to the question today of -- you know, why our company is staying more private and/or staying private longer? And not to be flipped but the kind of short answer we come up with this because they can and we'll talk about what's behind all of that but if you look on the left hand side, you know, why would I go public?</p><p>That list there is the common reasons, the companies would have pursued a public offering; number one, their business model really requires it.  Right, that they have a highly capital intensive business model, they need to access capital to grow their business and public markets, typically -- historically, have been provided a lower cost of capital, we can argue with if that's still the case with all the private money out there.</p><p>They need public currency to do acquisitions, they are looking for liquidity for their founders, for their investors.  Importantly, when we talk about tech and biotech companies for their employees; although Jamie also some stuff to say about that because he has part of creating alternatives for private companies in that respect.</p><p>And they just want brand identity, you know, that comes from being a public company.  I would say there is one here a particular that's more biotech focused; when we get over on the right side, you know many companies are staying private because there is this gusher of private capital to Sarah's comment from the article.</p><p>There is there is an unprecedented amount of private capital out there, it's not finding its way everywhere; the kinds of private capital that is going into some of the large technology companies in multi-billion dollar rounds -- if we go back to the biotech example for a minute, very few if any investors are going to write that kind of a check for a biotech company and wait five years and turnover a card and see if they got a drug or not, right.</p><p>It just doesn't fit -- the financing model doesn't fit the business model and that's one of the reasons we see biotech companies go public.  They not only need the capital, they need a wider shareholder base; right, that's sort of publicly traded stock provides them.</p><p>So on the why stay private?  You know the biggest issue is because they can, there is lots of capital out there, right, and if you can avail yourself to that capital and instead of a reasonable valuation it's not such a large haircut from one of public market might give you than you can still grow your business, your -- it's not as dilutive as it may have been at one point in time and certainly with -- you know, there is new pools of capital; the amount of capital, the pool is coming from and the evaluations; I think we've seen that to a large degree.</p><p>And then it sort of insulates you from what's the rest of the list there, right.  So obviously as a public company, a lot more infrastructure needed for disclosure and regulatory compliance, some perception of this was brought up in The Wall Street Journal Article about disclosure leading to loss of competitive advantage, especially for technology companies trying to build something new.</p><p>Just a general lack of operating flexibility or lower operating flexibility when you're public and you have investors that are much more focused on short-term quarterly profits, and your business model might be one off -- long-term growth and world domination in a particular category, right, that dichotomy.</p><p>And then a variety of other -- you know, just the risk of being a public company subject to activists and short-sellers and shareholder lawsuits and alike.  So, you know, we really have factors foreign against but the answer that we will set up here and I'll pass the baton here to Jamie is because they can live.</p><p>HUTCHINSON:  Again, switch some slides.  So again, I'm Jamie Hutchinson, I'm a partner in Goodwin's Private Equity and tech practice units.  We do a lot of work representing emerging stage companies and the folks that invest in them.</p><p>And we've actually kind of had a front row seat over the -- about the past decade to what we kind of call the large-cap growth equity. So a lot of the very big rounds into the high-profile tech companies, sort of the unicorn set, and a lot of those transactions come with some interesting dynamics including secondary pieces.</p><p>And so that the press has written a little bit about private IPOs which I think is not a good -- it's probably a misnomer but there are certainly a different type of transaction, much larger than had secondary liquidity and we've sort of had a front row seat to that. So I think we should be able to give some ideas of why this is happening.</p><p>So -- and certainly, during this presentation we're going to jump in and if anybody has questions and want to jump in and draw down on the stuff, you should do that, it can make it more interesting.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUTCHINSON:  Yes, I've noted.  I've seen that over the years Ann- Marie.  So here is the summary of some of the reasons; there is large amounts of private capital and it's really on a global level.  It's not just the U.S.  anymore.  Employees don't demand a company go public; there is -- there are alternatives to liquidity now that there weren't in the past.</p><p>Early investors don't need an IPO and maybe even want an IPO. The idea of a clean exit is something that can be particularly appealing to closed-end funds that have a lifespan.  Certain securities laws become more flexible, especially the 500 charter rule moving to 2,000 shareholders of record.</p><p>There is a new generation of entrepreneurs that have a different set of priorities and you know, this is perhaps the case now, maybe than in a different way historically, and we've had direct interaction with a lot of these folks and they think of the world differently, and maybe it's a millennial thing, but there -- you know, I think we're all seeing in the market, particularly the companies that are going public, there are focus -- the focus is on things like control, maybe then immediate sort of wealth creation, changing the world, winning the space, things like that.</p><p>There is negative -- this is negative press phenomena that can occur with public companies, and we'll drilldown onto that a little bit.  So cash as the new acquisition currency is shocking, but debts cheap and a lot of companies, both public and private are able to tap very deep pools of debt financing to do M&amp;A where in the past it might have been best done with a public company security.</p><p>M&amp;A equal's innovation, strategies are serial acquirers and they do that to continue to innovate.  And they are affected by, not only the cash they have on the balance sheet, but their ability to tap into cheap debt.  The high cost of being a public company or perhaps keeping folks from moving towards an IPO; and then there's sort of other set of pitfalls that we'll touch on.</p><p>So first the large amounts of private capital; so the capital is coming from different places, then maybe was historically the case. VC funds themselves, many have gotten bigger and their investment mandates have expanded where maybe in the 80s, 90s, even the early 2000's it was -- VCs were really doing early-stage start-up type investing; now their mandates are really across the spectrum from early-stage to late-stage.</p><p>The traditional private equity funds; buyout funds the (inaudible), the KKRs, they did not historically focus on minority deals; deals that they didn't have control and that has changed substantially.  Firms like Silver Lake investing in Zinga and Alibaba taking minority positions; TPG and these are all publicly available; TPG and Airbnb and Uber.  KKR just announced a growth equity funds.</p><p>So these are really traditional buyout shops that are moving into growth equity and have deep pools of capital, corporate venture capital, Google ventures, Dell ventures; they are out there and investing heavily and that's sort of a new and different source of capital over the past decade.</p><p>Hedged funds, so you know some people refer them as crossover funds, historically, hedge funds would invest in public securities. They were open-ended funds and they were structured in a way that having the liquidity of public securities kind of meshed with their structures, but that is no longer the case.  A lot of the big hedge funds, Tiger Global, for example, has been extraordinary successful and extraordinary active, investing all over the world into private companies.</p><p>The sovereign wealth funds; they have and over the past sort of five to ten years; well, historically they would invest as LP's in the big venture and private equity funds and they sort of have come around based on their expertise may be doing that to build their own infrastructure, they build their own investment teams and they are able to make direct investments.</p><p>GIC, Thomasic, the Saudi Fund that recently invested in Uber; the Abu Dhabi fund that's invested in Spotify (ph); you know, there is a long list of the sovereign wealth funds no longer being passive investors in private equity and venture but investing directly.  And they have very deep pools in their super-patient investors, so it's added things to the market.</p><p>Mutual fund complexes; so one of the things in the Wall Street Journal article that mentioned how the average investor doesn't sort of get access to these fast-growing sort of unicorn companies and you know, as I was reading that I was thinking well, that's actually not true.</p><p>I suspect a lot of people in this room have 401(k)s in mutual funds and through the public filings and a lot of -- you've seen it in the press, the big mutual fund complexes are one of the most active investors in private companies these days, and they too are very large pools of capital and they are very patient to different model.  They don't have an end to their fund life.</p><p>So that -- and we'll talk a bit more about that because that has been a really dramatic shift that sort of changed things, particularly with shareholder liquidity.  And then family offices; just like the sovereign wealth funds, they've build infrastructure to direct invest. Gates, that (inaudible) network, the founder of eBay, folks like that are now out there making direct investments.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Essentially we're going through is and might have been; I would also note that these are not all smart investors in the venture space and what I mean by that is not that they are not smart people but that these business models that they have historically been in are not the same business model as venture, right.</p><p>We are not typical finance; I do not do ratios on a daily basis, I do not write where building teams, building strategies, building technologies, innovating, often being a personal counsellor; or quite frankly, and a recruiter.  And you have all these guys moving in and I think they all have different motivations.</p><p>So for the big banks and funds and the more financial folks you have a phenomenon since the recession where people whether it's true or not, people believed that the public markets are not a place to make money or not place to make money safely, and you do have this phenomenon of it's hard to get in, so there must be something special about this that the small group of people of access to the set of special deals that you need to be in.</p><p>And there is a definite like you need to be in it mentality, right.  If you're not in Facebook, you're not a relevant investor in the technology space, regardless of whether you think Facebook is a good company or not, right.  And so similar for every other -- a lot of other big tech companies.</p><p>So that's where the banks come from; for the sovereign wealth funds we've seen a phenomenon where technology and innovation as you guys know has been promoted much more, more in the press as a way to -- and venture for that matter as a way to grow jobs right.</p><p>And learner skills had built businesses and build economies, and a lot of sovereign wealth funds are doing this not just to make money, but because they believe that having access to the understanding of these tech companies will then give them the ability to bring that technology to their country.</p><p>This is particularly relevant among the Middle East sovereign funds, where they say, we're going to invest in this because we want you to build an office here and train our people to do this.  So I think -- and then, and families are similar; there is also this phenomenon I don't want to pay managers fees, I just want to go at it directly because I think I am just as smart, right.</p><p>And so I am going to go out all these things that I really know nothing about it and keep going.  And I do think that that's a dangerous phenomenon, more generally, maybe not relevant to the going public point that were talking about today but you are seeing this change.  I think so all the really smart ones came in early, they realized -- because they are smart, that they didn't know what they were doing and they've pulled back significantly.</p><p>And then you have the second tier of just as smart, maybe not as smart people coming in and it will continue to kind of move that direction until people realize it really is a different game, and unless they are really focused on it and understand it, they are really just playing with fire.</p><p>So I think that's part of this dynamic.  It's not -- it's a reaction to hey, we as financial institutions are not making money right now and so we need to -- and everyone's asking us like why aren't you making money?  Why aren't you in this so we need to do something.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And to your point on sort of the -- not wanting to pay fees; we see these things that we call rifle-shot funds; so it's like a managed account almost where big investors will aggregate money; it might be led by a brand-name VC, but they will set up site, it looks just like a venture fund, feels like a venture fund, it's got a GP, it's got LPs, but invest in a single asset, a rifle-shot into one company.</p><p>Goldman kind of kicked that office in some respects when it did a big common round in Facebook and brought in a bunch of their investors in a special purpose vehicle.  So we're seeing that phenomenon too with some of this new money that doesn't want to pay fees but will -- once they co-invest alongside of some of the more traditional investors.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And in that case, once step is on the IPO?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, right.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Just one -- maybe a question or comment; (inaudible) was saying because I agree with -- you know, one thing to keep in mind is where do we think we are largely in this wave of private capital. So we're on the second wave and you know, many of these unicorns will make it no value to what but someone right and so where does not sort of app flow occur?</p><p>And if you go back to one-slide showed about venture-backed company formation.  There is a bolus of companies that are now three or four years into their venture stage development and so one of the dynamics on the pure IPO account could be -- A) that we see a little bit less of this gusher of private money and we've got a whole load of IPO ready companies.</p><p>So you these things ban, right -- they come, they have inflow with the couple availability.  And so can you guys talk, you guys keep on talking about discussion of private capital into small businesses or discussions of private capital in emerging businesses; what's the average check size attire global rights to a company?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I suspect it's not less than $100 million.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  What would be the small check-size that a mutual fund would write to a company?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, I suspect it's not less than $100 million, maybe $50 million.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I would just caution putting all those companies in the same bag and saying that all of this money just is going into -- the market is awash with capital because there is well over 100,000 small businesses in this country and you're talking about dozens if not hundreds of deals.</p><p>So the amount -- the check size in terms of gross stage private equity; so the check size is huge, the number of deal size is smaller. I mean we were just talking on the earlier session, you weren't here but you know, venture is about $50 billion a year right now; Angel is about $25 billion a year right now; and $75 billion a year right now; the lottery is a $65 billion a year business.</p><p>So I would -- I just I guess I take issue with that because I speak with thousands of entrepreneurs were capital start.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Well, can I make few quick comments to that.  So I will tell you -- there are VCs competing with certain one of these names, I'm not going to -- names that you would have no idea we're doing seed deals and that is, and when entrepreneur has to choose between a VC, who knows how to get there ownership and someone who doesn't because they are just taking dips on something, we're just spreading money or just trying to please investors who think they should be in the private markets, it's a different game, right.</p><p>And I will also say there are -- so I think a phenomenon that happened with the recession and they say I don't know which companies you know and this is going to sound horribly arrogant, but there are a lot of companies that shouldn't be companies out there.  Like -- so when the recession happened, you saw a huge surge in the word entrepreneurship, let alone people who wanted to be entrepreneurs because they got fired.</p><p>My friends got fired from their jobs in the law firms and the banks and the consulting firms and OK, great, we're young and risky and with all this stuff we'll start a company and it's exciting and it's cool and we'll do that.  And money is pouring into companies that wouldn't.</p><p>I think if you -- and this maybe comes from my background or where I invest from, but if you really look at -- if you had to go through and everyone has their own opinion; if you were to go to and say which one of these companies that are getting funding period actually should be; the answer is probably very high that they shouldn't be.  And so I do think there is that phenomenon going on as well.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  What would you decide a company that should get funding?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Well, so when you invest in a company, right, you're looking for a particular return...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  What would your return be?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think that phenomenon has been permitted (inaudible) and most VCs when they answer this question because they have to have an answer even if it's not true.  Too often say that we're almost guaranteed a 3X and yet have the potential for like 50X.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And so how many start-ups would you actually talk to before you actually come across one of those deals?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think most -- it depends on the firm and where you're looking but most the big VCs will probably look at at least 200 companies and maybe invest in one of those.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So it's 0.5 percent of the companies that you look like actually get funding that you think you have a reasonable chance of getting a 50X return on?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  OK.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So for every 200 companies?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  You know, it depends on the firm and where you're looking but most the big VCs will probably look at least 200 companies; and maybe invest in one of those.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So it's 0.5 percent of the companies that you look like actually get funding that you think you have a reasonable chance of getting a 50X return on.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So for every 200 companies -- for every 200 CEOs or entrepreneurs that out there that are actually interested in capitalizing the company, about 0.5 percent of them actually do.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Right.  But what I -- when I say the one out of the 200, I mean the 199 shouldn't have the capital or they should form a different form of capital.  So what I'm -- you know, I'm coming about this from venture money, there is other money out there that might be looking for different kind of motive but or return profile.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  May I shift gears here for a minute since you jumped in.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Not it's good, really good.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So will you think about the rate of innovation; when you look at the rate of innovation, you know, maybe even 10 or 20 year segments; you know how much of the capital that's pouring in is more a reflection of the opportunity because of the greater rate of innovation?  Is that something to considered or is now I'm off-base?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  More investable opportunities.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, because of the rate of innovation, it's not -- I keep thinking; I started my firm 15 years ago and I think about the companies we had to invest in, quality companies we had to invest in. And here in the United States but I'm seeing it all over the world now, it's very different.</p><p>I mean, I went to The Netherlands and I walked away looking at some companies I thought we're very enough great opportunities and (inaudible) is a good example of that too.  So it's not just -- some not talk about the rate of innovation and I've seen in the past 15 years there is much more robust than I think it was 15-20 years ago, other a dotcom.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, I absolutely agree with that.  And I think you just -- I know where -- we've kind of degenerate a little bit into like -- where is all the money coming from but I do think that's the reason that it is if we go back to the bigger topic, right, that there are more opportunities; I mean they are growing and they are out there but they are still not -- regardless of whether they are getting financing or not, they are still not turning to the public markets.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)      (UNKNOWN):  You know, different than MySpace where it's a lot of capital intensity, a lot of the innovative companies have a really asset light kind of model with (inaudible) you're in software you can avail yourself to cloud and computing power that's so cheap; your demand for capital as a small percentage of what it was 10-15 years ago.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And I think part of the focus on what we were talking about here as wire companies you know stay in private and so a lot of -- I think it's right, a lot of younger companies aren't getting the financing they might want or and the money is moving down, it's pouring into sort of the biggest one's and it's keeping those biggest ones, that otherwise would have gone public, private, longer.</p><p>And so that's kind of the -- at least the lends were looking at this but I take the point that you know, it's not being spread across equally.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, and that's what's allowing some of these most successful tech companies to push out an IPO where before these huge pulls of capital just weren't there and so you know, the Google's and Microsoft -- you know, I don't know, four/five years old and its market cap was $400 million to $500 million when it public where you know -- let's go to this slide, which is actually pretty interesting, it's a little hard to see but -- super hard to see but the...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  The blue is how long they are private -- the little orange dot is when they go public, and the black dot is when they hit 10 billion.  And what you're seeing is just looking at it.  It's -- they are hitting 10 billion before they are going public.</p><p>It goes from 1980 to 2015, yes, but it's interesting; so all those companies are up top were private for shorter period of time went public when they were smaller and they were -- they wrote the public markets up to a much bigger evaluation.</p><p>And so what we're seeing now is just the opposite; companies are staying private a lot longer, you're actually hitting these big valuations even before they go public and one of the -- I think one of the primary reasons that's happening is really the mutual fund investors; and they too have backed off recently but for a while that's how they made their money, they invested in our lives orange dot when they went public, they didn't used to invest in private companies same way, but they still got the same value creation because they were in at that inflection point.</p><p>And then the company went public and they got to rise that value now; they have to get in when it's private or they miss out.  And that's their whole business model, it's just sort of ride the growth. So we've seen what otherwise would have been an IPO in terms of the size of the round and in terms of the liquidity being offered to the employees happening when it's a private company driven by mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and the like.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And along with that point and maybe this ties to Jonathan and Catherine, they were mentioning earlier valuations because there is a lot of money for these companies were talking about, valuations get pushed up very high it before they should be, in almost every case before they should be.</p><p>And it's because there is competition and you can take money from whoever you want, there was one company that's like need to go public this year that in the past round said we are raising money in two days and you have no access to any information, period.  Put your money down, and they raise several hundreds of billions of dollars in two days.  So it is just the dynamic is happening.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean (inaudible) price in Twitter and $800 million round shortly before they went public, Fidelity and Facebook, Morgan Stanley funds and Air B&amp;B.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Uber...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, Uber.  I mean these are the types of company that's getting these big rounds and then what's happening with them and is sort of a secondary component which is kind of a traditional IPO thing, right?  You have selling shareholders, the employees are able then to exercise options and get liquidity and what we have seen in these adjacent snippets, you know, Yelp did a pretty small primary round and did a $100 million buyback from employees.</p><p>Ali Baba before it went public probably did the largest private tender offer that ever, and certainly they were aware of to you know, thousands of employees led by Silverlake and DST Global you know, were north of the billion dollars.  And Mark Zuckerberg in Facebook were really innovators in many respects because they were losing the talent work, they were 4-5 years old people, working for less than market rates in terms of salary, they saw their friends engineers at Google or Apple able after a couple years seem to exercise options and make money and Zuckerberg and that management teams said we got to fix this.  </p><p>We are not going to be able to track the best talent, how do we do it and so back in 2009 where everybody thought it was crazy, some investors put in a lot of money in a primary and a really high valuation and put in a lot of money in a private tender offer to the employee base that allowed for the exercise of options and for employees to get a little bit of liquidity, you know, a little bit, a million bucks, right?  Which is a lot of money to a 25-year-old engineer, but just a small fraction of what their value they had on paper.</p><p>And then we saw -- it went from the wild West of secondary trading that people kind of read about with Facebook employees selling shares to their dentist and things like that, not a lot of control to a very controlled private liquidity programs that were done purposefully and methodically to allow employees to get the type of liquidity they might either and early investors the type of liquidity they might have otherwise gotten in IPO.      So founder liquidities no longer a taboo, we are seeing it as early as series B rounds these days and new technologies outfits like NASDAQ private markets are able to allow these transactions to happen way that's you know, better, faster, cheaper, and said that they would become through routine, they are periodic private liquidity programs for these big tech unicorns and allow them to act like a public company in terms of giving their employees that equity incentive that actually can turn into money.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And I'll also say that applies to the investors too so with VCs, we now have other opportunities for getting out in the private markets at these high valuations and there are some of these companies where the early VCs already completely out right.  I mean people don't realize that but we were able to get out without it being a signalling mechanism which matters.</p><p>And because remember, even with these new big growth rounds, its they are not joining the board or advising the CEO, it still the early VCs who are doing that and so unless we feel the compulsion it's hard to have the entrepreneur feel the same compulsion.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So you know, at some point we are seeing early-stage VCs sell to the growth equity investors, sell to the mutual funds and sovereign wealth funds, where you know, 10-15 years ago it would have been really a bad signal for early-stage investor to get liquidity before the company was sold or went public.  Now, it's just sort of become a little more routine and there are pockets of capital that will -- the institutional investors will be able to get liquidity from one another.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Can I ask a question?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  1980, I worked on an initial public offering for contract drilling company in Houston.  I don't mind telling you the name, it was Drillers Inc.  and I know exactly what (inaudible) they were in.  I was a $20 million IPO and now let's work, I'll just calculated here roughly, $58 million would be the equivalent of going -- taking up and doing a IPO.</p><p>Now is that size IPO because frankly I don't think our charger here is for the company that does an IPO to billion-dollar valuation. We are much smaller than that, we are worried about the guy would do dry cleaners.  You know, is $58 million IPO just currently off the table, you would never do that now?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think my answer is it absolute wouldn't happen.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Would not happen?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Would not happen.  Because the market changed historically, they were investment banks that would do that sort of deal and then cover it, have coverage in the backside so that company would actually build and get market attention so they are like the (inaudible) of the world, they are gone.  Hambrecht &amp; Quist, they are gone...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Roberts and Stevens...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Roberts and Stevens they are gone, the four (inaudible) they called them and they were these sort of these super regional investment bank that would take a company like that.  And also companies like Microsoft, you know, which was kind of a smaller business public and that doesn't really exist anymore.  I don't know if you have seen...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Doesn't not going to happen.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So, they got buyed out around late 90s going into -- so JP Morgan buyed Hambrecht and Quist, they all got buyed...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  (Inaudible).</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And you try to get into this you know, innovative high-growth space but other things changed too so there is profitability, the whole analyst market banks and so that's why one of the reasons analyst coverage is hard to get and build your you know there is, we all know that -- I'm sure you all are aware there is a pilot going on around (inaudible) right so lower cap less liquid stock, it's harder for banks to make a trading profits so does that deal look as interesting anymore.  </p><p>Even if A&amp;Q still existed, that would be a problem with you that that deal probably is not as profitable anymore.  Even investment banking fees, there is good competition investment banking and the IPO is 7 percent fee but you see a lot of follow-on offerings that get squeezed down so you know, the 3 percent or 4 percent because enough competition.</p><p>Now that's really happening at the you know, one's everyone wanted to but generally that whole banking model is less profitable. So, that is a challenge and then you have investors who have a lot of capital to put to work and so it'd 25 or now 50 with inflation.</p><p>You know, and you are going to get 10 percent allocation of do you want to write a $5 million cheque, some may, but lot mutual funds like I need to put $40 million or $50 million to work at a time because of so much capital.  If I'm going to spent all that time to listen to the banker pitch, understand the company, get excited about it, I can't just put $4 million to $5 million to work, I got to put more to work.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It's an interesting problem and this goes to Jonathan's point you know, partially me coming from the tech world, I think of things and everything that is happening in my world in California right, but there are lots of companies growing in other parts of the country that a VC wouldn't step foot in and this money is not going to go to no matter how well they are doing, right?  And so and that that probably goes to your broader point.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I mean in, in California and I have a 55 company portfolio in an aggregate there was about $600 million, they have raised about $100 million but 40 percent of my portfolio have women founders and 4 percent of venture funded start-ups have women executives and half of my portfolio is Hispanic founders which is less than 0.1 which is less than 1 percent, 10 percent of my portfolio have black founders which is less than 1 percent and so and those percentages are probably 500 percent of the percent of the other VCs.</p><p>I mean I've worked for the White House on you know, on diversity sort of stuff and we just we have a blind selection process so we just remove people's names and pictures and that's where it stops.  And I speak Spanish and so that is part of this Spanish thing.  But I just -- it's hard for me, what I see is that there is a broad bottom.</p><p>You know, people get to accelerators, they might be able to get a $1 million to $2 million and there is this huge scrunch and then if I need $100 million cheque, that's actually a lot easier to come by.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  That's right.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And 7 to 10 million is tough money.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And you know, so which is why we are talking about secondary liquidity options, why that's an issue and which is what Catherine was talking about, angel investor fatigue because there is no liquidity for this investors and it just -- it feels broken for those small sub $100 million businesses.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think you are right Jonathan and I'm not worried about you guys, you are going to make out, you are going to make out how it makes out, don't worry and keep doing what you are and do it some more.  Unfortunately or fortunately, I think what we are here for is to figure out 99.99995 percent that don't fit into this model.</p><p>So I think your information actually is very interesting, it helps understand why that perception among you know, the pressures of capital and we saw it like where are those pressures other than what's there in the Silicon Valley.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Only got gushing in the valley.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Very narrow path right?  Within Monday's drive all those steps whatever so I think our challenge is to identify what you guys are doing really well, why you are doing it and how can actually we roll it out to where a greater portion, in fact greater numbers, may be not in dollars but greater numbers that people are going to participate in the core growing jobs, growing businesses, growing capital helped out.</p><p>Maybe not to the extent that your demographics work out but is there something that we can take, apply and learn.  This is just like going to the moon versus going to the grocery store, this does not apply at all.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think it's little off topic from this, but certainly when there is a tremendous matter competition for very few deals, venture capitalists at their heart, are you know, entrepreneurs and selves and very smart and they will seek opportunities that not everyone else is chasing, because it is too hard or too expensive.</p><p>So you know, Steve's case in revolution talking about looking into jurisdictions that aren't Silicon Valley and I think I just anecdotally we're seeing more of that, things like companies and in New Orleans, Louisiana that you know, have never done a deal there and all of a sudden the past couple of months we are starting to see things.</p><p>North Carolina has historically had a solid base and we're seeing more activity there.  So, I think because of this phenomena and it hyper competition for the best deals, you could see smart money, saying I don't want to overpay, there are smart people in other places in this country, let's go see if we can find unearth some of that. But maybe you might have a different perspective.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I agree with that and so our funds (inaudible) because I came from some of the bigger funds like NEA, we only invest with those funds actually for financing risk, which is at the heart of what a lot of you are talking about.  And I will say that the really top-tier funds are not, they'll pretend they are and the press will say that and they will deny it to the nth degree, but they are not doing a lot of deals right now at all.</p><p>That I know that because I am looking to invest to them, I invest a alongside to them, I monitor and I work with them as partners, and they are just not doing a lot of deals right now but we are more than happy to watch all the others bump up our existing deals, right.</p><p>So that is an important phenomenon and you see some firms who used to be investing all the time taking on different industries all of a sudden VCs like insurance.  Like no one ever paid attention to insurance before all of a sudden they like yes sure, that's right it changes and people will follow where the opportunities are.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Could I ask another question?  Julie or Sebastian in the lot of tasks last year, at the end of the year, creating (inaudible) for small business so it was a definition small business was $100 million assets, is that what it was?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So, I think you are referring to the fact that when the bill created the committee portion of the bill, this committee codified.  It uses the same definition that this committee has of looking for private and public companies up to $250 million.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  $250 million, I'm a lawyer, not good with numbers. Alright, I got a company, it's worth $250 million or it is going to be worth $250 million, but it's not, it was a bank industry.  It's not blood testing or anything, it's Silicon Valley, it may be smokestack industry, it may be in Texas.  It maybe conventional oil and gas.</p><p>We are not going to finance it, what's the answer there, putting aside all the all the glitz and glamour and stuff it's going public at $1 billion and it's producing two to three times return of money.</p><p>I mean just in Iowa or Texas or wherever are from, the flyover zone, we've got companies out there, they need money, they pull in people, they pay taxes, they make a decent profit.  Where do we go to get money from those companies?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So I think it's hard to finance them from an equity finance perspective.  I think that they will be able to tap into the debt markets but the reality is it is harder to finance it than it is to sell it.</p><p>There is a huge part of the private equity industry and the buyout side is focused on the middle-market and a $250 million company that's making money in a traditional industry, there will be a line 20 deep to buy the company by private equity sponsors.</p><p>But if you want to sell 10 percent of it and try to build it, it's a harder one because the buyout shops will take control all day long and they'll actually, you know it's almost universal in deals right now where the management team will probably be asked to \"rollover\" so sell 80 percent of the company or 75 percent of the company and keep a minority position from the original founder but it is hard for those sorts of traditional businesses to find equity financing, my opinion.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So this may be a little bit of a tangent, but I think all of this, including the bigger topic comes down to marketing and the reason -- I think the number one reason.  If you asked me why should a company go public, I don't think any of the ones we all just dismissed a lot of the ones as not being relevant anymore.</p><p>The only one that I still think resonates is the legitimacy point right be being able to be, I am a public company, I am real. Everything else can be done elsewhere.  But when that marketing thing turns against you right, like when companies go public and they are already criticized in the first quarter for thinking you know, for not producing, the number one thing when our companies go public is they are not profitable.  </p><p>And because they are throwing all their money into growth right that is what they are supposed to do, like we don't look for them to breakeven.  We look for them to grow and grow and grow and it ends up killing them right.</p><p>Like you have a model and I am not arguing about any particular company's value, but you have a model like Groupon who says that the way we do our business is different than the way you think about things.</p><p>So we are going to approach this a little bit differently right and that may be good or bad or legal or not legal about whatever the drama was, but that was a problem for them right and they pulled back. And that really hurt them right in a big way.  </p><p>Similarly with these companies right, the ones that you are talking about Patrick, it's a marketing thing right if I view you as this little company in the middle of why is so much in the Valley right?  It's in the valley and people think you need to come to the Valley because you need that stamp in order to attract capital and you need that step in order to attract talent and everybody thinks they need to go there in order to work at a great tech firm.      So everything starts to congeal in one place right and if you market and so people are really interested in growth and that's why venture is really hot, but I will tell you people are pulling back from that right now.  </p><p>People are interested in stable returns right now and so there is an opportunity in some of these other places where there are stable businesses in traditionally stable industries that have stable returns and give you an alternative to just give you an opportunity for -- a lot of them don't think there are alternatives and I don't know what that means but I do think it's about how you spin it, how you market it and how the people who need to hear that marketing hear it, right.</p><p>So how do you publicize that to the folks who are in Dallas or are in New Orleans like Jamie mentioned.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  OK.  Now, let's say I got this company that I have that I did public offering for in 1980 and let's use $60 million around number is.  This private company's got $60 million, write what you want it.  If I wanted to get it to be a $250 million company in its -- they don't have any molecular chemist working for them or anything like that.  It's something that is this one of those ugly businesses just much makes money, OK.</p><p>And so what I did finance it to get it to maybe it has potential, it has it core of a billion assets, I mean venture capital comes to mind, angels come to mind.  </p><p>I mean angels are local venture capital.  You know, we do have some financing sources and taxes.  Are those choices or industry partners I am assuming you can do joint ventures or something like that or (inaudible) buying they may do a JV or something like that. Are those the options that are available if we can do a public offering.</p><p>I'm just trying to figure out and I realize I am outside your fairway but little smaller but help me here understand what the financing options are from not in a whiz banks sizzling business, but is just one of those ugly...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And debt is not an option?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Well, you can only take debt so far and at some point someone's going whys up and say I'm not going to get my money back.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Well, it depends how much cash flows coming into our business.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Right, but suppose it's all going back in the growth and maybe if you are building smokestack there is collateral being created there that the banks gets excited about but we know bank and we have banks.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean I think the quickest way to 250 million and we see it all the time is through a cell control to a private equity fund and they invest in you, so you sell 60 to 75 percent of it to you know, middle-market buyout fund in Boston or Chicago and they will then invest into that company to do more acquisitions to consolidate smaller players and that's sort of the path of least resistance, but that the quid pro quo is the founder's give up control.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Right.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But you got some liquidity once and we have seen it work really well for founders and families to give up that control, turnover you know, that control to institutional investors, professional boards go out do a couple of acquisitions and the next thing you know you have increased the value to 250 million in that second bite of the apple for that rollover piece can be meaningful.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Right.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  That's the path of least resistance, but there are joint ventures and taking debt and trying to find a family office.  We have seen sort of real expansion of what we call fund-less sponsors, you know, individuals that are out of the big private equity shops, they don't have committed pools of capital but know how to do deals, they will find a company like that and say look, I will bring in you know, some private equity partners and help you build the business.</p><p>We are seeing a lot of transactions and those are particularly at $50 million T-shirt company in Atlanta, you know, or healthcare services company in Cleveland.  And those are the sort of things where you are seeing private middle-market, private equity really play a role.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'm sorry, I'll pass on my next question, I'll let Jonathon speak.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  If you guys were going to design a system, (inaudible) and we are going a design system for investors to be able to raise $10 million, $20 million, $50 million or for companies to be able to raise from, I don't know from $1 to $100 million and then achieve liquidity on the backend, what would that do or what would you tweak about the current system?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Depends who you are, right?  So as a VC, I have different incentives and an entrepreneur has different incentives, et cetera, right?  So, a big ends to my interests and talk as an entrepreneur right and so already see things developing of this nature right like kick starter is a very basic example of an alternative way to raise money that takes us out of the equation.  But sometimes I think it is a dumb choice to go and kick-start and sometimes it is a smart choice, right?</p><p>And similarly, Angel list is another great example of that.  You also have several of these kind of family office networks or middle tier institutional networks probably ones that are relevant to what Patrick's doing actually, creating these kind of, groups that deals can post on the platform when anyone sees it, people can comment and it kind of like an angels but for all stages of things including for funds, right.      And I do think that it's about the information right so it's about if entrepreneurs there is a lot of people looking at finances things and a lot of people looking for the money.  So it's about making the connection between the two right?</p><p>And so I do see the proliferation of platforms allowing that.  So the answer is, the more information the more you can connect the parties, the better.  For me the reason I say it's different for VCs because you know, the less options you have, the more you got to go with me, the better deals for me, right?  So that is, you know, (inaudible).</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So that's basically a more efficient markets?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  To a degree.  It's also why you see the development of -- so my firm is a good example of this, as is kind of a phenomenon that entries and Horowitz has said the VC world two, which is another value-added investor, right, which was kind of a fake term in a decade ago and is now a realtor.</p><p>If you have a choice, then the model needs to change right, we need to find other ways to help our companies and add value.  You can get in and so I think that is a similar element to it so the more information, the more opportunity, the more I have to do more which, by the ways in all the incentives of what you guys are trying to accomplish.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So I would like to switch back please to liquidity. So one of the things we have been discussing, we want to try to understand the impact on and the fact that investors invest and hold things longer therefore that you know, there is less money coming back into the market.</p><p>So I see that as -- OK so typically they would be out liquidity event the money, the profits would be ploughed right back into that into the economy and some new other new start-ups or maybe they took it and bought another house somewhere so again it's fuelling the economy.</p><p>So what we're trying to understand is, what can we do for or how can we understand this is in sublet, at some point in time, and I agree with you, you know, there is a lot of not smart money out there and at some point will they experience investor for take it and just get out of the market.  And things settle down a little bit and so we are trying to work through this.  Other piece we've talked about is I think there is -- and I'm anxious to hear from SEC how their tick pilot is going.  </p><p>So one time there was a lower tier public market and doesn't exist anymore in and does that seem like it is something that we should be exploring or considering so that again we can create this and I'm calling it velocity of money, but that's probably an incorrect term, that's a treasury term and I'm probably using it wrong.</p><p>So what are your thoughts about you know, liquidity, how that impacts IRR, how it impacts the -- the flow of money into the economy long-term.  Even though, there's like -- to me I look at it and say supply demand and supply is pretty big right now and so that's impacting what we are seeing, supply so what are your thoughts on liquidity options.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'll just say one thing and then these guys chime in because I think they know more about it.  I don't think there is a lack of liquidity at all.  I just think it's in different places than you think it is so and that's kind the point of the conversation right.  There's other ways to get out, there's other ways to move money, there's other ways to exit at all different stages and that is actually why less companies are going public in my opinion because it is not the only option for liquidity.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  There is more liquidity now than ever.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes I agree.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And things like 487, to make it a little clearer that yes, there is a way to do it but you know, in 2000 and before the 2007, you know, you would really never see founders and employees getting liquidity until the venture investors got liquidity and now we see.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes like in the series B round is sort of the first place we see it which is pretty early.  You know companies still have a long way to go but we're seeing you founders and some early employees be able to get liquidity and then seeing programmatic frequent you know, what's a quarter or twice a year type of liquidity for the larger private companies that didn't exist.</p><p>Things, technologies that allow that to occur, easier -- sort of all contributing to this additional liquidity that we have now.  And these people are buying houses and I think the real estate prices in the Silicon Valley reflect liquidity.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It is not without conflict either, right?  People are concerned about it still because you know, it misalign incentives ,right?  So you know, the part of the reason it is happening is because of the talent crunch.  People need to be able to keep their talent, but then it's also when you are giving talent the way out of being locked into the incentive structure, it creates response.  So people are still trying to figure it out.  I don't think any of the companies that figured it out.  You know, to a T.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I was going to say would you say also on life science biotech's I mean, my sense of what they are doing with their capital is really has to be in clinical development, I mean clinical trials so I mean we are totally -- so that would be different.  Would you agree?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes and they still adopt much more of a traditional model of you know, may not be found in three years and I feel maybe five or eight depending on where the market is, but they don't really have a choice because you know, at this point of you have to get your employees liquidity, you only have to get them there because there is massive source of private capital that can keep you private and you get to keep control and there is a benefit, right.</p><p>If that didn't exist, you wouldn't do an IPO.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  That's a good point.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It's only capital, right?  All of this phenomena are about the larger market forces at work.  To the extent that many of those do not apply in biotech, we see more of a traditional model and so we don't see founders getting out until after the lockups on IPO but it's just the way tech was 15 years ago, it really hasn't changed.</p><p>I do think just to the -- you brought up the tick size pilot, that is interesting to watch and we'll see what the results are that as well as whether that will create float for some of the smaller cap stocks and keep banks and analysts in the games so you might have a different calculus in going public.  It's not going to change the calculus of how it got private capital, I don't need to go public.</p><p>But you know, if your company is otherwise is or that market dries up, I still don't think it is going to overcome, anything like this can overcome the fact that a lot of public investors you may want to put big chunks of capital to work and Scott have enough flow to make that work for them, right.  That's just for a lot of capital, the pools that is invested from that's a phenomenon that can be difficult to overcome but you know, this can be helpful.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Can I raise a question that's going to tie into something that we are told about this morning which was liquidity in the Regulation A space.  When you talk about some companies as early as Series B rounds, what size of company we are talking about because I have the feeling that the companies we are talking about this morning are very much smaller than the guys who are now going and getting liquidity as early as Series B.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So maybe you know, $12 million to $15 million pre- money value, maybe up to $20 million and they are raising you know, through $5 million to $10 million.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Is that for Series B?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, on the small side.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Oh OK.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Very small.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And that's like what the A is now because the valuations have gone up typical series.  I mean, traditionally a series B company was a company you know, had us maybe 5 million in revenue, 5 to 10 in revenue kind of thing like early revenue around the like, you know, 30s, 40s, 50s and valuation your 10 X would be high right of that revenue multiple.      Now like a typical soup you know, A can get that high you know more like the 20s, 30s, but there -- things have just been pushed up but traditionally Jamie is correct that's the right side.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Fenwick does a really nice study every quarter and showings sort of where the value from a B is I was actually just looking at bears and so I think things it that definitely it's creeping higher for every round.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And size wise too this used to be like $15 million in infusion and now they can be up to like 40 million -- 50 million.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I know biotech but everything that really has changed is I can't remember the last time I helped an entrepreneur with the business plan and pitched into a VC.  VCs create their own companies, they know where the sciences is, they go find the management team, they license and it's really much of a build your own so that I look at 200 deals like the way it is intact where you can start something with low capital, you are going to need a lot of capital to begin with.</p><p>And in the 90s when it was Hambrecht &amp; Quist, I did a lot of IPOs were the funds raised to 20 million, 25 million, I can remember 15 million, we won't even really look serious about getting involved with accompanies who is A if they haven't (inaudible) raised 20 -- 25 because it's a couple years of burn.</p><p>You know, if they only raised 5, it's like by the time we get involved in, they may not be here right?  So that the scale is completely different but it has also come from the fact that investors have learned saying it's too risky, the way to go to the entrepreneur, so to speak.  </p><p>They wanted -- they are already walking the holes and the labs to figure out who the potential entrepreneurs and recruiting them out. So it's a very different dynamic.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Can you talk a little bit more about what it was like when you have a smaller investment banks raising smaller rounds for more companies, like what were their economics like if-</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  They were doing 7 percent on the IPO same they were probably making a little while and I am not a banking expert, they were probably making a little more on the trades after and at least in life sciences a lot in tech, you would count on two or three pretty fast follow on to that same 70 percent so you could see a you know, even though it's a small dollar, maybe it was 15 or secondary as 25 and then you did a 30 down the road.</p><p>You know, that's not a bad income stream right for smaller bank and you got some trading out of them.  It was decent enough to hook up out of pretty good multiples of time that tech was taking off.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  This might be a switch a little bit but I have been thinking about Jonathan what you were saying about your firm and the numbers and how it had -- and also the question how do we fix some of these things.  A mentor of mine, Steve Coltie writes a lot on entrepreneurship, has this whole list of things that are required for successful entrepreneurship ecosystem and one of the ones I was remember is celebrating the wins and I think that's key, right.</p><p>So when you go invest in the middle of the country, it happened with New York like so when New York became a big venture ecosystem people threw tons of money and then tons of money and they all stopped because everyone was like where are the IPOs, where are the exits?</p><p>It's like a nice idea for few years and all will jump on the bandwagon because by nature human beings are lemmings, including investors.  And what they all would do it is they'll go after it but until you see the wins, no one's going to do it and when you do see the wins if no one knows about it, that might be good for you as an investor because you're dibs on those great opportunities, but it doesn't encourage more money to come in.</p><p>So there is something about you know, identifying the wins or identifying the success stories and being able to make them more clear so in your business with the different minorities and women and gender, in running things, you know, show the wins we have that NEA with care.com when Sheila took her company public so the more you give them, the more you publicize the more people see that it actually works and you know affects the bottom line, the more they are interested.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  We've only got a few minutes left, I just wanted make sure is there anything from the panellists that you think we missed any insightful slides, I'm pleased that the conversation is going exactly the way that we needed to go but are we missing anything from your point of view.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):I think maybe just you know, one of the points about why companies aren't going public is there is a lot of M&amp;A still and you are seeing in the big strategies and could you see more of it the repatriation of cash in the new administration is allowed in a tax efficient way.</p><p>It can underestimate the effect that that has on a lot of companies just to get big enough and then Google or oral courses go comes in and makes a compelling offer and they sell before they would even get the chance to go public.</p><p>And just recently we are seeing you know, these dual track where a company will file to go public and right before they go, big strategic will snap them up, Cisco did that with that dynamics, Stone Canyon did it with Mouser and those are just in the past couple months so I think that is it.</p><p>We touched on it, but that's important issue why companies just staying private, longer or just not going not even ever getting the chance to go public because there are deep pools of capital.  The big strategic have a lot of equity cash, debt is cheap and they are able to pay your top dollar take these companies is out of play.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And you are showing the big guys tech but this is happening in other sectors.  The banking and insurance they are monitoring the FinTech start-ups.  We have started to keep a database of 5000 FinTech companies because the banks want to know where they are so we buy them, are they innovators, are they competition, who's going to need a lunch kind of thing.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It's happening in consumer products.  So a lot of companies who have set up their own internal innovation, arms realizes that it's hard to create an innovative culture yourself, and so there are much more looking externally saying to a partner they'll do a buy it in and you know, it's not always tech, but it also got a tech feel to it, but the acquirers not always a tech company.  So there is many I would put in the cereal, acquirer category.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And it is not even a public company, maybe we are starting to see the tip of the iceberg as Uber and DD and.  Air BNB, for example, recently announced acquisitions have been able to borrow a bunch of money, could we see that sort of strategic expand outside of the large public companies, did that sort of M&amp;A.  Go ahead Jamie.</p><p>HUTCHINSON:  And I think the last issue, it's still expensive to be public and to Jonathan's point may be around why we are not seeing some of these smaller public companies is you know, the compliance makes it expensive.  It is real money, it's millions of dollars to go public and its millions of dollars to stay public.  It has to sort of be economically make economic sense to do that and make that investment.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  That's probably biggest one we didn't touch on.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I had a subjective one that I think is worth mentioning.  So, the mentality aspect of things is really important so entrepreneurs as Jamie mentioned this early you know, they believe in their company, they want their word, they are long-term, they do not care about this stuff and they do not want to hear you telling them that they are not you know, that their passion is not real or not working because you don't understand it right and so I think that's what kinds of pulls them away, but the VCs are really important too.</p><p>So VCs when they invest in something or they have a bad experience, they wear their scars forever.  They just don't forget, it's amazing.  We'll have meetings like what you remember 15 years ago when we did this thing is like there were no phones, like Apple didn't exist or whatever, right.</p><p>So and they don't forget and when they do take the lead back in which they ultimately do often, if they get hurt again, it almost kills the opportunity set and I would say VCs have been significantly I would say they feel scars whether they admit it or not from the most recent IPOs or the past IPOs.  Some recent examples we have already gave examples of and all of them have had it with some things because we are all in different deals, but all and a lot of the same deals too.</p><p>This year is a very crucial year because there are a lot of tech companies going public this year or that are expected to and the good news for the bigger point is there does get a point in which we say this is ridiculous, you need to go public like there is a point at which everyone is like this just needs to happen.  I do not have any insider knowledge, but I would bet Uber's feeling that, I would bet Air BNB is real feeling that right?</p><p>So there are these -- there is a point at which it has to happen, but if it doesn't go well, it will especially given all the new opportunities and options and alternative routes, it will kill it.  So fingers crossed and if there is a way to mediate that that be a great thing.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Thank you.  Are any follow-up questions, wind up questions?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Just my personal stuff is on my sleeve of course, but I am actively taught looking at taking companies like doing a reggae offering and then seeing if the compliance is actually about the same as taking company in public under London AIM exchange.</p><p>For them $5 million a year going 30 percent year-over-year is actually a nice IPO or even looking at the Australian stock exchange and you know, being public but actively traded on a foreign exchange.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think just one thing some of the things that you guys have touched on, there was a market for small IPOs that does not exist anymore.  These companies do not belong in the public markets at you know, even like (inaudible) billion dollar market capital, companies they struggle.</p><p>You are not going to get research written about your company, are not going have a bank getting you to your next deal.  The cost of being public it says 2.5 out there, I have talked about being the General Counsel public company Brian has as well.  </p><p>There is a real cost so it's great to say we want companies to go public and we do.  There are definitely wonderful reasons and (inaudible) probably the public, but until we sorted out some the things like (inaudible) decimalization, that does provide more spread for research and others sort of things that came with you know, penny increment trading before that change.</p><p>There are enough market forces right now that I think our goal should also be -- we talked about earlier days try to find a way to help create off public exchange liquidity for these companies that are very successful.  </p><p>They are just not you know, tech unicorns so I think that has to continue to be part of what we focus on because those companies are private, they are getting funding, they can get that whenever they are not, the ones we are seeing in the news but they probably also shouldn't be in a highly liquid public market listing.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Anybody else.  Oh, thank you very much indeed.  That was really useful.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Thanks for having us.      (UNKNOWN):  Jamie can we have the slides sent around?  OK guys, we are going to move on to the final piece of today's program which is (inaudible) diversity.  We have now had a couple of discussions on the recommendations.  I spent a good time of, a good portion of our time on October 5th as well as they a conference call on December 7th.</p><p>As you recall currently regulation SK in item 407C2, little Roman at six, request company to disclose in the proxy statements whether a nominating committee considers diversity in identifying nominees for the company's Board of Directors.  The rule also requires that if the company has a policy with respect to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, how that policy is implemented and how its effectiveness is assessed.</p><p>As we have discussed the disclosure requirement is soft, diversity is not defined, which means a regulation hasn't been as helpful in generating useful information as it could be.  Based on our prior discussions we come up with a draft recommendation, you should all have both.</p><p>I have received soft and now you got hardcopies all of the recommendation and so I think you have also seen that they are suggestions that Greg Yardley sent around to make changes to that wording and the changes that Greg had suggested where to change the recommendation.  </p><p>The recommendation is at the bottom of the page and his, now I have lost his statement.  He says instead of saying \"while generally the definition of diversity should be up to each issuer, issuer should include disclosure regarding race, gender and ethnicity of each member/nominee and self-identified by the individual,\" that's in our current draft.</p><p>The alternative language being suggested is, \"while generally the definition of diversity should be up to each issuer, issuer should include disclosure whether race, gender and ethnicity of each member/nominee and self-identified by the individual are considered.\"</p><p>Anybody got any opinions as to -- so looking at the sentence that begins \"while generally\" and it would the alternative that Greg is suggesting is \"while generally the definition of diversity should be up to each issuer, issuer should include disclosure whether race, gender and ethnicity of each member/nominee as self-identified by the individual are considered\" is slightly different term spin on the -</p><p>The race, gender and ethnicity of each member would be still self-identified.  That is still included.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  He just changed the word regarding to whether.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I will consider it.  Yes.  It's did you think about that.  Did you consider it?  I mean that's a big change between the date the two.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  From my standpoint it strikes me as less useful information.  The answer is yes/no and it doesn't give you granularity on gender, racial, ethnic to the representation which is really what the value add of this kind of reporting could be.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  The original is more what have you got on your board and then that the new one was did you think about who you have got on your board.  And apologies to Greg if he is listening, I'm totally misphrasing that.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes but we discussed that...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  We have these words as well...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I know, I know.  And we went back -- OK so we discussed it and my preference was for the details.  I like the original language that we have.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Any opposing.  All right so I think the sense of the panel is that so we would leave the language as it is currently drafted and what about the last sentence.  Greg is asking this is the sentence, \"while disclosures should be the default issuer should have the option to opt out\", do we keep that sentence?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  The way I am reading is that we're saying if you don't want to answer, you don't have to.  If you leave it, if you put it in or leave it out they are going to be obligated to answer.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I am not sure if you they are going be obligated.  I suppose you would, yes.  I think you are right.  If you want to disclose...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And to Michelle's point, if we think the information is relevant, then because my opinion is the people who do not want to answer are going to be the ones who downright so why do we want to put compliance in for people who-</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Any objections to that and so what the proposal is right now is that we keep the language as disclosed as said out in this draft.  We need to vote on that?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I thought we were saying that we wanted to remove the last sentence.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Well, the suggestion was to remove it, but I think...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I thought Laura was agreeing with that and I think I do too.  </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  You agree to remove it?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Sorry, the way I read it -- OK, let me go back again, is if we leave it in, they can opt out of it.  So do we want them to be able to opt out or not report.  And if the answer is yes, then we leave it in.  If we really want this information...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  You want to force the information?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  If you want to force the information, I would remove the sentence.      (UNKNOWN):  It's not quite relevant here, but on a program at SBA that we run where we have an opt out portion, we're finding that a lot of women owned businesses opt out because they do not want to be -- they public feel like they will be disadvantaged by being identified.</p><p>So there can be -- maybe opt out, can be used in ways that one doesn't intend and if the information useful eliminating the opt out, I would indoors eliminating it.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Lisa?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  We had a lot of discussion surrounding that and I am more in favor of leaving it there, and that's why we put the language in for the default to be to answer and put this out there because the other argument as well is, was giving everyone the opportunity to self-identify which gave us more flexibility there.</p><p>And the default being this and then the opt out is a decision on the backend.  So my preference is to leave it in as it is.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Any other thoughts?  I mean it does provide the option for them to define diversity however they want, so that kind of allows them flexibility there if they really don't want to talk about ethnicity, gender and race.  So I think I feel comfortable taking it out.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think if we look back at the fifth sentence, the role failed to generate the information that's useful.  We leave that sentence in it.  I think the same result -- we're going to get the same result as we're currently getting.  So I would agree that we should take that sentence out.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  OK.  Can we have a proposal to take this language and take the last sentence out?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  OK.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And the second.  All in favour?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Aye.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I don't want to force a premature vote.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I would like it to be kept in.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And Catherine?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'm sorry, I'm not sure because I'm trying to think through the implications of leaving it in or taking it out based on the wording that already exists there.  So maybe our attorney can help us.  I mean...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  The first part, does it require SUS to describe?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Catherine, I mean -- I don't know what the right solution is, I try to refer to you all, and I've talked enough on other things.  But I mean it's a sticky wicket, however, you do it.  I mean it's -- I mean I think just go with your gut because it is -- I mean I think, the only think or thought I had was is our system or the SEC system is not mine is one of disclosure.</p><p>I don't think we mandate unless there is a special statutory admonition about the diversity and disclosure of it, is there -- I mean, we're not mandating you to have a board that's diverse; we're just saying you disclose it and so -- I mean I think that seems to me to be within the powers of the SEC to say you need to disclose that and so -- then it becomes a matter of policy, and what we all think is in the best interests.</p><p>Corporate America knows that diversity is a hot button, and rightly so I think some people would say and I agree with that to an extent; Jonathan and I talked about it at the last meeting that -- there is any number of use in this and I'm trying to be sensitive and not step on any toes.  So I think it don't matter, at the end of the day the commission is going to give it a lot more thought and they will come to probably a more considered decision than I am capable of doing.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  This is of course only a recommendation, that is not the actual wording of whatever we think the commission showed up. Would it change anybody's mind if the final sentence said something along the lines of while disclosures should be the default; issuer should have the option to opt out if they explain why.  Make any difference?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, I'll just live it on.  Then you get into what is an adequate explanation.  I mean I keep -- I mean this is such, I have -- this young lawyer, you heard me mention the young lawyer whose -- who went to Washington and I've known since he was a freshman at college.</p><p>Well, I talked to him recently and he said well, and that was about this very issue and I said Chad, you know, I mean -- and we were talking about and I think I mentioned on one of the calls that I knew a woman who was European ancestry but she had grown up in Zimbabwe and moved to Fort Worth and I meet her and she said well, I'm African- American.  She used to color her eye (ph).</p><p>And -- I mean this whole thing is rather imprecise and my friend Chad whose parents are -- his father is African-American, his mother is white, he says I check both boxes.  So there is no precision here. And I mean, you just -- you do the best you can and we go from there, we have same situation with our former President, who was -- his father was not African-American, he was African; his mother was white, he self identifies as African-American.  I mean it's too complicated for me.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So we'll leave the box checking for the people who write the rules.  Lucy?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, what is their overall intent with the disclosure?  Is it data that we're going to utilize?  Is it data for decision-making?  What did we determine from that originally?      (UNKNOWN):  It's for potential investors.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, I mean I think the summary of the discussions in the two previous discussions -- I like after considering that -- I mean those I think are our objectives and the aim at which the recommendation looks to underscore.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And I will support whichever way we go but since there is full self-disclosure and we're not going through in redefining each of the categories; you know, the data could be skewed either way, that's why I was more in favor of the act outside of it because you are going to do other due diligence; you are going to do other items that are to be important as well.</p><p>This is really, really important; I am just worried that we won't have as consistent as data as what we think we would have.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I don't think you're always going to get a lot of data from this, not that you can put into chance, I think.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And I think that's the case.  I think that we're always going to have my own children right, think I want which box should I check in?  Frankly, I hope we get to the point where you know the box is always checked up the bottom or whatever it is.</p><p>But for today and for now, we've had multiple discussions about this and I think we've all identified and come to the conclusion statistically from studies etcetera that -- that it is a business benefit to include diversity.</p><p>And which is why maybe investors would like to know that in the -- regards to disclosure the Patrick speaking about this is just another piece of information to disclose.  It isn't going to perfect, no, absolutely not, but it's going to give an essence of perhaps a picture once they -- once people do all their other due diligence and so it gives them a first place to start; and this is the case may be depending where they're at.</p><p>So that's why we really think it's important that we instead of letting people, organizations, whatever maintain the status quo because that's what we're talking about that we take out that option.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I think it's also really useful for fund managers and wealth advisors who are investing in public equities because their clients are asking for -- you know, I want to invest in companies that have diverse boards, I want invest in companies that have women in leadership, for example.</p><p>So I just can't imagine any downside; I mean if the company really doesn't want to talk about race and gender, they can say we have people from the following 10 states or we have people from the following three age groups.  You know, it's totally up to them to define diversity.  I just don't see any problem with it.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Alright.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Also you can take it out.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  OK.  So before we get to that bit, does anyone have any objections to any of the rest of the language?  Are we are OK?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  So I have the same concern that I had when we discussed this last time which is it says, provide information regarding each member nominee self-identified by the individual but what happens if an individual chooses not to be -- chooses not to self-identify, right.</p><p>So I don't love the idea of opt out if we're going to think this important I think we should make it important, opt out against the opt out and nobody will understand why some companies have it and some companies don't have it but I do think we need to have some mechanism for companies to acknowledge that some other members were not willing to self-identify, otherwise you will have 10 board members with information on five and no information on the other five because those people choose not to self-identify but it's going to raise an SEC comment I would think.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Presumably, the rule when written would say, in the event the individual declines to provide that information, put NA in the box.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  OK, that's just my concern.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And I'm just going to punt that and say, I'll bet that you guys at the SEC who are good at writing these rules, we'll manage to work that one out.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  NA.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  NA, Box 1, Box 2, NA.  All good alternatives. Alright, so can we move to the -- the proposal is the language as drafted without the last sentence.  So can we -- again, you repropose? OK, and then all in favour.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Aye.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Anyone against?  We're good, we have language, thank you.  Just keep it on.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I gave out a comparison.  We don't need to talk about, if you have any comments or you -- maybe not helpful after the discussion today but anybody wants to assume any comments to it, it's just something I did in dealing with business people and I found that tabular presentation side-by-side are useful and help people grasp the issues.</p><p>So I did that just because I felt like it helped me just drafting it, it helped me crystallize some of the thoughts but anyway, you will all see the typo in the first page and I will correct that.  But Julie, if you're interested in posting it on the website, I will get you the digital flap.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And thanks for doing that, it's useful resource. Before we completely wind up, I will work with the staff to put together the recommendations from the discussions this morning. Interestingly, I thought the overall viewers, I would have -- if I had to predict anything, I would have said, no pre-empt everything but there is a much more subtle and reasoned newest opinion that wants to take the states thoughts into account in both of the proposals that we discussed and we will be reflecting that and we'll be getting drafts out on those.</p><p>So thank you very much for those discussions.  And just one thing before we leave; any thoughts on what goes on to the agenda for next time.  I know Catherine had.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'm very curious, I know I brought this up last time too but whenever the tick pilot is completed, I really would like to see that data and hear the remarks from the SEC on that.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I would love to hear him aggregate data statistics on fraud, just because if we're protecting -- trying to protect unaccredited investors it would actually be helpful to say, OK, these are the instances when they -- when things have gone south.</p><p>I would also love to talk about getting data on how much capital small businesses think that they need.  And what are ways that we could actually suggest to get that data because all of our opinions are anecdotal.  I don't think we actually have any hard date on the subtle; if it's possible.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  And to that point, elaborating your point Jonathan; I thought it was really interesting because clearly we have different communities, right.  Here the gushers and the gusher and that's great. Would that like to have a better sense of -- you now, is it 90 percent and how many billion is that for 200 companies versus the companies I think Patrick you're talking about the ones that I see that are -- that de-capitalization above leverage, OK, but below IPO or access to that type of capital.</p><p>So if there is any data out there, I don't -- you know, what is that -- what does it look like?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, and -- you know, there are so many companies that completely count themselves out of even thinking about being able to raise capital and because it's so complicated they hear about these laws and they hear, oh I can only talk to wealthy people and I don't know any wealthy people, so even if we were to get data on how many companies are trying to raise capital unsuccessfully that would leave out a huge number that just don't even think that it's possible for them.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  If we could just get the tip of the iceberg; but I don't know how -- I know that's really hard.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Not sure where we would look for that iceberg.  Any thoughts on where the iceberg might be?  Gratefully received.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  QuickBooks.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Interesting.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Also keep in mind that in some exemptions you can't use general solicitation to the extent that you have company self- identifying themselves as publicly looking to raise capital, query whether that puts them already in the category of an exemption that would need to permit general solicitations.</p><p>So I think part of the challenge is; how do you get data on the aggregate without actually going to the particulars of a specific company such that particular company doesn't have to publicly indicate to the world that they are looking for capital?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  That would be kind of ironic.  Hey companies, who would like to self-identify as violating Section 5?  We maybe shouldn't do that then.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  But I also think there is a census, there is a census committee -- they do it like an annual census of businesses; and this is where they get the jobs numbers from and this is where they get that sort of stuff.  If we could in that census, while the census actually going on getting that data to say hey zero to 10; you know, how much would you like to have more money to grow your business or something along those lines.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I do know there are surveys that are out there because I filled them out.  But and I don't think we're going to get a precision and data; it's not like we're going to get a census or whatever but just something to -- so that when -- you know, people like Jonathan and Patrick, when they're throwing out numbers; there is something -- you know, and I don't have to sink a billion, right.</p><p>We have more precision in the amount of numbers because, again, intuitively through anecdotal qualitative experience, and the people in my world.  They feel -- they fall into more of the industries, the number of businesses that Patrick is.  So if we can just get a -- or spoke if we just get kind of a data field that it would be really great to put something in the ground, continuing quest.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  We have (inaudible) capital market survey, we find it useful for at least the lower and middle market comparisons.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  That would be good if we can get.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  All right, anything else, am I missing anything before we wind up.  All right, thank you very much.  Thank you everybody in the Internet land.  Thanks.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-1872273923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS4-XGG1-JBHT-D0VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"38788\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 Roll Call, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 20, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0003FJ1</classCode><className>GOODWIN PROCTER LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0003BNV</classCode><className>ERNST &amp;

Welcome to the Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies.  And first I need to ask Sebastian if we have a quorum for the meeting.  Are we quorate?</p><p>      GOMEZ:  We do Sarah.</p><p>      HANKS:  OK, excellent.  I am Sarah Hanks and I am here without my coach Steve Graham this morning.  He is by the side of his wife Joanne, who is recovering successfully from a major surgery.  </p><p>      Steve, if you're watching this, know that everybody in this room is thinking of you and sending thoughts and prayers for Joanne's continued recovery.  And we're looking forward to seeing you next time.</p><p>      We have a wide-ranging agenda today.  We're starting this morning with a discussion on the limited liquidity and secondary markets for holders of shares of smaller companies.  We want to focus in particular on two types of companies; companies that are providing annual and semi-annual reports following a Regulation A Tier 2 offering, as well as SEC registered and reporting companies who are filing quarterly reports, but are not listed on any exchange.      When have asked two preeminent Blue Sky lawyers to present to the committee in order to help us navigate these issues because as you know, one of the big problems in this area is that there is no state pre-emption for resales of the securities.</p><p>      Following that we are going to return to a topic of loan-held interest to many of us, the broker-dealer status of find us, that is, people who help small companies find sources of capital.  During our October meeting, we received an update on this topic from Stephen Luparello, the then director of the Division of Trading and Markets.</p><p>      It was clear at that time that there was nothing in the immediate works, in terms of rulemaking or other division action to redefine the definition of broker-dealer.  So we're going to spend some time this morning discussing whether we'd like to reiterate, once again, a recommendation for action in this space.</p><p>      After lunch we're going to take up a question that many have been asking which is, why more companies choosing to stay private?  Or to put it a different way, why aren't more companies choosing to do an IPO?  We're going to be joined by a lawyer, accountant and the venture capitalists who have lots of direct experience with companies making these decisions and it's going to tee up a very interesting discussion.</p><p>      Finally, I'm hoping that we going to finalize our recommendation to the commission regarding divested yield and corporate boards and the ways that the SECs disclosure requirement in this area could be improved.  But before we move into the agenda for the day, we are pleased to have with us this morning for opening remarks, Acting Chairman Mike Piwowar and Commissioner Kara Stein.</p><p>      Chairman Piwowar.</p><p>      PIWOWAR:  Thank you, Sarah.  </p><p>      Good morning everyone and Steve if you're listening as Sarah mentioned all of us are sending our best wishes your direction.</p><p>      I've always enjoyed these Advisory Committee meetings and I am pleased to be here in my new role as Acting Chairman.  I'd like to extend a special welcome to our newest committee member Michele Schimpp, who's representing the Small Business Administration.  We very much appreciate having the SBA's insights and we look forward to working with Michele.  Welcome.</p><p>      No matter where you are in the United States, small and emerging companies raise the tide for so many people to succeed.  The freedom to innovate and grow has always been fundamental to American success. And we as regulators must constantly assess how our work meets the needs of today's innovators.  That's why this committee is so valuable.</p><p>      Committee recommendations put forward in early 2012 about lifting the ban on general solicitations, expanding Regulation A and raising that Section 12G registration thresholds helped lead to the enactment of the Jobs Act.  In 2015 the committee recommended that the commission modernize Rule 147 to help facilitate intra-state offerings and I am pleased the commission did just that.</p><p>      As of last month, the related rule -- amended Rule 504 is now in effect and the new Rule 147 Cap A will go into effect in April, providing more options for companies looking to raise capital.  The committee also recommended raising the financial thresholds in the smaller reporting company definition to expand the number of smaller companies that qualify for scale disclosures.</p><p>      In line with that recommendation, the commission proposed amendments to raise those thresholds last year.  The list of your valuable recommendations and discussion topics goes on and on.  And it seems Congress was so impressed with your efforts that in December it codified the committee into law.</p><p>      The bipartisan Small Business Advocate Act of 2016 put into the Exchange Act two new provisions.  The first establishes the Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation headed by a new advocate for small business capital formation.</p><p>      The second establishes a Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee.  These are parallel provisions to the Dodd-Frank Act that established the Office of Investor Advocate and the Investor Advisory Committee.  I'm proud to say that we are already taking steps, including working with our appropriations committees to stand up the new office.</p><p>      I anticipate that we will begin the search for a new advocate for small business capital formation in the near future.  The law requires that the new advocate be someone who is not a current SEC employee. So I hope you all will encourage good candidates that you may know to apply.</p><p>      In the meantime, we want you to continue down this exciting path. The charter of this Advisory Committee doesn't expire until September and I know that between now and then you will continue your efforts to bring forward ideas to facilitate capital formation for small and emerging companies.</p><p>      Your agenda today, as Sarah mentioned, secondary market liquidity finders and why private companies are not going public reflect important topics facing small and emerging companies.  Secondary market liquidity for shares being held by investors in Reg A securities is becoming an increasingly important issue.</p><p>      Between June 19, 2015, the day when amendments to Reg A took effect in January 31st of this year, there were 181 offerings filed using Regulation A; 103, which have been qualified by SEC staff for the issuer to begin making sales, 28 issuers have reported selling approximately $259 million in the aggregate.</p><p>      I look forward to any recommendations on ways to remove frictions that may stand in the way of investors being able to readily exit their investment.  I'm also please that you are discussing why more companies are choosing not to go the route of an IPO.      While the menu of capital raising choices available today for small businesses presents more flexibility and more alternatives than ever before, there is always more we can do to provide robust public capital markets.  I look forward to your input on these and the other topics on your agenda today.</p><p>      Thank you again for your service on this committee, and your continued commitment to facilitating capital raising by small businesses.</p><p>      HANKS:  Thank you. </p><p>      Commissioner Stein.</p><p>      STEIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>      I also want to extend my thoughts and good wishes to Steve and his wife, welcome Michelle.  Good morning to everyone else.  In this dynamic environment I think the ability to work on consensus topics is even more important.</p><p>      This committee remains focused on fostering and supporting healthy marketplaces for fledgling smaller companies while protecting investors.  And this is a focus that we can all stand behind, and your commitment and work towards this goal as always is much appreciated.</p><p>      Today's agenda re-examines topics that have been previously discussed, but we now have the added benefit of the inflow of initial information and data about how certain Jobs Act regulations are working in practice.  One aspect of your discussion concerns secondary market liquidity for smaller companies that are using the new Reg A plus rag.  And secondary market liquidity, I think from my perspective is a rather complicated topic.  For example, our Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee has also looked at this issue.</p><p>      One of the things that's been most interesting to me is the availability of more data and current research that seems to be informing us on the role of information and transparency and the relationship to secondary market liquidity and firm value for OTC firms.</p><p>      While your discussion today may be primarily focused n state securities laws and their impact on secondary market liquidity, I don't think it needs to end there.  Blue Sky requirements that apply to secondary sales of Reg A securities also are intended to provide a layer of protection for investors against fraudulent activities within each state in which the transactions occur.</p><p>      I think from my perspective, state laws have often provided a protective guard rail in an attempt to balance efficient capital formation with robust investor protections.  That said, I mean I think it's fair to examine whether the current Blue Sky regime may negatively be affecting secondary market liquidity.</p><p>      I am particularly interested in learning more about how compliance with state securities laws is working for Reg A non- exchange listed securities.  I look forward to the discussion of the pros and cons of Blue Sky laws and what if any improvements need to be made.</p><p>      Finally, if there are inefficiencies with Blue Sky compliance regimes how can the current regime be adjusted?  For example, is there means by which NASA working with the states can improve the availability of manual exemptions across more states?</p><p>      The other item on your agenda that I am sure will generate significant discussion and concerns the relative lack of IPOs as compared to prior periods.  What does the data reveal?  What are their current observations and explanations?  I can tell you again from my perspective, depending on what market participant you talk to, they are very different explanations.</p><p>      One thing I'm interested in is has the Jobs Act provisions that change the registration thresholds or basically they have allowed for greater private capital raising contributed in any way to companies remaining private for a longer period of time I think that's another thing we should be thinking about as how different jobs at provisions interacted with one another.</p><p>      I look forward to the discussion and I hope we'll delve into the very factors that are changing this whole ecosystem of our markets for capital formation including the effects of the economic environment and the regulatory structure.</p><p>      Finally, you will also consider recommendations on broker dealer finders and board diversity.  I very much look forward to the discussion and these recommendations, and thank you again for your time and commitment to helping us think through these issues.</p><p>      HANKS:  Thank you, Commissioner.  Now we're going to quickly turn to the SEC staff from the division of Corporation Finance.  We send our best wishes to Keith Higgins, who has moved on after more than three years since the divisions director.</p><p>      I am reliably informed that he left just in time to enjoy staying up late on a school night to watch the New England Patriots win the Super Bowl, which I am equally reliably informed has something to do with American Football.  Who the hell knows.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>The division is now in the capable, skilled and steady hands of Acting Director Shelley Parratt and we are very pleased to have her this morning.  Shelley?</p><p>      PARRATT:  Thank you, Sarah, good morning.  </p><p>      Good morning Acting Chairman Piwowar, Commissioner Stein and the committee members.  I am very happy to be here with you this morning.</p><p>      This is my first time speaking at one of your Advisory Committee meetings and as part of the leadership of the division's disclosure review program I have always appreciated your thoughtful discussions and have carefully watched you develop recommendations.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to thank you in person for your time and for sharing your experience and insights with the staff, the commission, and the public.</p><p>      Each and every staff member in the Division of Corporation Finance takes seriously the agencies charge of facilitating capital formation, while at the same time protecting investors.  We will be listening closely to your discussion this morning on ideas to improve secondary market liquidity for investors, which in turn, should help facilitate capital formation for issuers.  We also look forward to your afternoon discussion and welcome any ideas you may have that would promote further activity in the IPO market.</p><p>      Before closing, I want to acknowledge the other members of the Corporation Finance staff at the table with me.  To my right, Betsy Murphy, a very important member of the Division Senior Leadership; next to Betsy is Sebastian Gomez, the chief of the Office of Small Business Policy; and to his right is Julie Davis, the senior special counsel in that office.</p><p>      As you are all well aware, I need to give the standard disclaimer for any staff member speaking today which is that any remarks made by any of the SEC staff members reflect his or her own views and not necessarily those of the commission or any other member of the commission staff.</p><p>      And with that I'd like to thank you for letting me join you this morning and I look forward to listening to your discussions.</p><p>      HANKS:  Thank you, Shelley.  </p><p>      So we're going to move on to the secondary market liquidity.  As you've known over the course of the last few years, in a variety of formal and informal ways, this committee has taken up issues surrounding the lack of sufficient liquidity in the securities of small companies.</p><p>      Today we'd like to focus more narrowly on the topic of secondary liquidity in the context of issuers that is subject to ongoing reporting requirements and thus have updated information available in the marketplace.</p><p>      In the case of a company that's done a Regulation A offering, they are obligated to file and (inaudible) annual and semi-annual ongoing reports and current reports.  Companies that have done a public offering, i.e.  Registered Public Offering; they are subject to the ongoing disclosure regime which includes quarterly reports.</p><p>      The availability of these ongoing updates means there is available information to help establish pricing and its transparency in the secondary market.  Yet, as we have heard in our previous discussions, investors in Reg A securities are likely to have a difficult time when they're ready to resell their shares.</p><p>      One key factor in this space is the friction that comes with having to find state exemptions for each trade since Blue Sky -- state Blue Sky laws do apply to secondary sales.  We have invited today two highly regarded attorneys who specialize in Blue Sky matters and can help educate us on the current legal framework.</p><p>      First I'd like to introduce Richard Alvarez, principal of the Law Office of Richard Alvarez.  Richard currently serves as vice chair of the State Regulation Of Securities Committee of the ABA, American Bar Association.</p><p>      And next to him is Martin Hewitt.  Martin is chair of the same State Regulation Securities Committee of the ABA.  Martin may look familiar to you because he often attends these meetings and the SEC staff think maybe he;s a member of the Advisory Committee fan club.</p><p>      We're very happy to have both of you here to share your expertise and help us delve further into this very important topic.  And I think Richard you're going to first?</p><p>      ALVAREZ:  Yes, I will.  Thank you, Sarah.  </p><p>      HANKS:  Thank you.</p><p>      ALVAREZ:  Thanks.  </p><p>      Unfortunately, I didn't bring my own membership key for the Advisory Committee.  Martin decided not to share that with you.</p><p>      HANKS:  We're designating you a member right now.</p><p>      ALVAREZ:  Well, thank you Sarah, that's very gracious.  </p><p>      Good morning everyone.  Thank you for inviting Martin and I to speak with you today on the topic of Blue Sky compliance that is applicable to Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings; and more broadly, to the securities of non-listed non-reporting publicly traded companies.</p><p>      I'd like to particularly thank Acting Commissioner Piwowar and Commissioner Stein for their comments and certainly for their continued support in promoting the work done by this Advisory Committee.</p><p>      Our presentation this morning will offer our views on the effects of state Blue Sky regulations on promoting or hindering secondary market liquidity for Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings and our discussion will hopefully be in the structure of a point, counterpoint presentation.  Not quite Kudlow and Cramer, for those of you who have long memories, but hopefully providing countervailing viewpoints.</p><p>      Let me start basically at the end.  I believe that secondary market liquidity for Reg A plus offerings and for securities of non- listed non-reporting public companies will never be fully achieved unless state Blue Sky laws and regulations that are applicable to secondary market transactions in these securities are pre-empted by federal law, either through congressional action or through SEC rulemaking to revise and enhance existing provisions dealing with transactions and the securities in the secondary markets.      For the reasons I will explain in detail further on in our presentation, it is clear to me from the vantage point of over 30 years having dealt with Blue Sky -- state Blue Sky laws issues that while likely unpopular with many state regulators, the existing state regulatory framework that is applicable to secondary trading activities for certain types of securities and market participants has become overly burdensome.  Rooted in a view of a National Securities market that defers to larger, more mature companies at the expense of newer and untested companies.</p><p>      This bias has the effect of stunting growth and innovation and is not in my view, responsive to both the rapid evolution of the markets resulting from technological innovation and to the shifting imperatives of Congress reflecting the desires of their constituents for greater opportunities for capital formation and investment opportunity.</p><p>      This is not to say of course that these imperatives demand that investor protection, which is one of the principal mandates or state regulators should be diminished or eliminated.  However, to me it does mean that as security markets -- securities markets evolve and the objectives of the markets overall change by emphasizing the importance of capital formation and job creation through more robust marketing opportunities for issuers and investors alike, existing regulation should also evolve.  Often times evolution cannot be incremental, disruptive change is sometimes necessary.</p><p>      At this point I'd like to sidebar for a moment to give a brief overview of the state-of-play regarding state regulatory secondary market trading exemptions.  As we all know, the securities of companies who are listed on a National Securities Exchange enjoy full pre-emption.  Certainly, the listing standards and the abundance of available real-time information for those companies offers the basis for reducing the amount of needed regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>      Pre-emption is also available for securities that are the subject of non-issuer secondary market transactional exemptions under section 481, that is for transactions by a person other than an issuer underwriter or dealer and for broker transactions executed in reliance on 4A3 or securities of companies who report under 13 and 15D of the Exchange Act.</p><p>      We should note here that for securities that are sold in reliance on 4A3 while enjoying coverage security status there are a handful of states that obligate an issuer to file a notice to claim pre-emption if you will for securities to be eligible, to be traded in their state in reliance on that pre-emptive provision.</p><p>      There is also federal pre-emption of state regulation enjoyed by transactions in securities made in reliance on Section 4A4 of the 33 Act which deals with unsolicited broker transactions.  It would seem obvious that exemption has some limitations, particularly in the context of a desire to create and develop a robust secondary market in outstanding securities.</p><p>      Certainly, if a broker cannot solicit its customers it cannot create a market and certainly if a broker seeks to share its research for a particular company with its clients that will also defeat an assertion that the transaction, if it were initiated by the client would be wholly unsolicited, making that exemption unavailable.</p><p>      There is also an institutional investor exemption which all of you are familiar with, again that focuses on the nature of the investor as opposed to the type of transaction.  Although transactions with institutional investors don't enjoy coverage security status, it is a universal exemption at the state level.</p><p>      The trouble of course in mentioning that exemption in the context of Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings or for the securities of very small emerging growth companies is that category of investor is not normally found making investments for those insecurities of those issuers.</p><p>      So I question whether in the discussion about developing a robust secondary liquid market for Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers and securities of non-reporting non-listed public companies, whether the institutional investor exemption has any real validity.</p><p>      Last, but certainly not least, is the exemption that Sarah mentioned, the so-called manual exemption.  Most of you are familiar with the state exemption that is currently available and depending on who you speak to 39 or 44 states.  And there that simple statement demonstrates why this is such a problem area.  There is not even unanimity on which states actually offer an exemption that is usable for secondary market purposes.</p><p>      What does the manual exemption provide?  It offers an exemption for secondary trades in by non-issuers through a licensed broker- dealer, provided that the issuing company has financial and other information published in a designated standard manual.</p><p>      Up until the middle of last year the two main reporting manuals were emergency Standard &amp; Poor's.  Standard &amp; Poor's has given up the ghost and it is no longer involved in the space.  However, I do understand that the OTC market has been developing its own manual to replace -- I suppose to replace the Standard &amp; Poor's manual that is their best markets.</p><p>      And as I understand it with Vermont Michael, his state leading the way, it is now an accepted manual in 19 jurisdictions.  I think that's right with two others on board to adopt the manual as part of its manual exemption.</p><p>      The obvious problem for purposes of our discussion this morning with the manual exemption is the -- A, the lack of complete coverage in all 54 U.S. jurisdictions of that exemption.  And further the fact that even among the states that have adopted a manual exemption there are substantive differences in how those exemptions are applied, focused on the type of uniform Securities Act that the state follows.  </p><p>      There are -- for those of you who do not know, two uniform acts that the states generally model their statutes after.  One is a 1956 Vintage Act that has been around for quite some time obviously, and the second is a more current updated version adopted in 2002, which about 20 states have adopted.</p><p>      But again, the exemptions under both of those model acts differ, perhaps not substantially, but sufficiently that the lack of uniformity doesn't lend itself to promoting a national secondary trading exemption that is usable for companies that don't enjoy federal pre-emption.</p><p>      A secondary market that must rely on these desperate exemptive provisions at the state level will of course be fragmented and far from the liquid secondary markets enjoyed by larger cap listed companies.  The question then is why our robust liquid secondary markets for smaller company is important, whether owning securities in large or small companies, investors generally don't want to hold their investments indefinitely.</p><p>      A liquid secondary market allows investors to realize gains, minimize losses, generally make decisions to manage their portfolios and investments.  A liquid secondary market also helps issuers since even the prospect of a liquid secondary market makes it more likely that they will attract needed investment capital from potential investors who are short of an exit ramp for their investment, thus providing capital to foster job creation and entrepreneurial innovation.</p><p>      Regulatory impediments to a robust secondary market frustrate those objectives.  This picture is not all wine and roses however, and unchecked market will undoubtedly offer opportunities for unscrupulous operators to gain the system to the financial disadvantage of the groups that would benefit from the most -- from a less rigid regulatory scheme; smaller companies and their investors.</p><p>      So outer balance is equally important, but competing interests are robust and liquid secondary market is currently exists for exchange listed in SEC reporting company securities, must be based on real-time availability of information about a company.</p><p>      The ability of an investor defined examine and rely on information that he or she deems critical to an investment decision, fosters investor confidence in the markets as much as the knowledge that regulators are standing by to protect their interests.</p><p>      Certainly, though not ideal, the states manual exemption recognizes this fact since it relies on the availability of accurate, current information about an issuer as the basis for the availability of that exemption.</p><p>      However, the lack of uniformity as I mentioned before, between and among the states in applying this exemption, coupled with the fact that more than a dozen states don't even recognize the exemption, frustrates investor efforts in many states to make investments based on what should be a coordinated, consistent regulatory environment.</p><p>      Here then are my suggestions for addressing the lack of a meaningful secondary market liquidity for Reg A plus Tier 2 securities.  I'll address that first.      In my view federal pre-emption should be extended to include all secondary market trades insecurities for the securities of a Reg A plus Tier 2 issuer.  This can be done through SEC rulemaking by refining the definition of qualified purchaser under section 18 to include any person who, in a secondary market transaction buys or sells a security of a Tier 2 issuer that is current in its reporting obligations.</p><p>      This would result in any such security being a coverage security under Section 18 of the 33 Act, thereby allowing a secondary market for such securities to develop without the regulatory burden of having to ensure compliance with state law requirements for secondary market traits.</p><p>      The current definition of qualified purchaser which is any person to whom securities are offered or sold in a Tier 2 offering contains a limitation on the amount of Tier 2 securities and non-accredited investor can purchase in a Tier 2 offering.  It's my belief that QP definition should be revised to make clear that this limitation would not apply to investors purchasing Tier 2 securities in a bonafide secondary market transaction.</p><p>      To continue to allow disparate state regulatory requirements to apply to secondary market transactions in what are at the initial offering covered securities, frustrates the objectives of promoting creation and growth of vibrant small emerging companies by continuing to impose restrictions on the secondary market for these securities.</p><p>      While taking the step to grant full pre-emption of State Securities Law to all transactions or Tier 2 securities is significant, the impediments imposed by continued regulation of secondary market transactions in Tier 2 securities to the ultimate success of Reg A plus will, to a large extent, be tied to relieving the duplicative and non-uniform state regulatory structure that exists today with a more market and investor-friendly approach.</p><p>      Each Tier 2 issuer has substantial initial disclosure and ongoing reporting requirements which should work to relieve concerns of inefficient -- insufficient information available in the market for these issuers which is vital to the success of a robust secondary market.</p><p>      I also have a proposal that I would like to share with the committee for facilitating secondary market trading by non-reporting, non-listed publicly trading companies.  For these issuers, available information may not be as fulsome as the type of ongoing reporting required under Title 4, and certainly under the Exchange Act.  </p><p>State concerns over the type and quality of information for these companies argues for an increase in reporting that should be required of these non-Reg A Tier 2 non-reporting issuers.  The possible solution in my mind lies ironically, in the very regulatory structure that impedes the formation and maintenance of liquid secondary markets for these types of issuers.</p><p>      A standard disclosure system comprised of a national standard securities manual model after the disclosures currently required to be included in the manuals that are accepted understate manual exemptions as the basis for supporting pre-emption of state law requirements over secondary market trading of securities of non-reporting, non-listed, non-rate Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers.</p><p>      By requiring these issuers to include information that is consistent with what existing manuals currently require state concerns about a lack of current available information should be addressed, particularly if the states are partners in the development of such a national standard manual.  </p><p>      An example of a model that may be useful here, which I had mentioned earlier, is the recent success enjoyed by the OTC best markets manual, though I am not endorsing this particular vendor.</p><p>      My intention is to mention it as an example of a disclosure delivery system that offers a way for non-reporting companies to deliver the breadth and depth of information that will help investors while also demonstrating to the states that their concerns about disclosure as a basis for assuring that investors can make fully informed decisions about companies they seek to invest in are being met.</p><p>      Rulemaking that requires non-reporting public companies to publish information as required under current standards and including securities of issuers that need these heightened disclosure and reporting requirements could be added as a category of covered security in connection solely with secondary market trading of those securities.</p><p>      I certainly recognize that this proposal would increase the cost to small issuers.  Of course they would have to pay fees in order to have their information included in this new standard manual.  However, on balance, the cost would be significantly less than would be incurred if such an issuer were to become a reporting issuer.</p><p>      Moreover, the pre-emption problem for the states is, in my view addressed by having the states participate in setting the standards for disclosure.  Since a majority of states already offer a manual exemption assuming the new national manual provides the same or greater information.  The regulatory concerns of most states should be satisfied.  </p><p>      In closing I would, the advisory committee to recommend to the commission that each of these proposals be seriously considered as a means of starting or restarting the conversation around market liquidity for Tier 2 and non-reporting company issuers.  </p><p>      HANKS:  Thank you.  </p><p>      Martin?</p><p>      HEWITT:  First of all I would like to thank Acting Chair Piwowar and Commissioner Stein and all of you for having us here today.  I want to take a different view of this, and step back from the \"P\" word, pre-emption, for just a moment.      The question that I think is really important is what are the concerns of regulators generally and specifically the states.  And what I believe the problem is at this point is a concern by the states and others that there is not sufficient information available to the small investor on the buy side and sell side, obviously they hopefully know, although that's questionable too and I'll bring that up in a moment -- that there is a sufficient information for somebody to make an educated investment decision.</p><p>      And I believe as someone pointed out, I'm to hear this for all the meetings, a while back, I believe that the Acting Chair Piwowar are made an interesting observation.  I hope I have this right and you are talking about the fact that in some ways we are no longer looking at capital formation and investor protection, but protection from fraud and prohibition of investing.</p><p>      And that is something that sort of got me thinking back then, I have been thinking of sense and to me the question could be further refined of not investor protection, as investors I do not believe have to be protected per se.  What they need is to be empowered and by that I mean have sufficient information to make intelligent investment decisions.</p><p>      I think that there are concerns from the states that when you do not have sufficient information, there are certainly various things that can take place, and although not necessarily in the Reg A plus market, I think to a certain extent it could be in publicly traded non-listed REITs and BDC's.</p><p>      What often happens in against a similar sort of lack of liquidity situation you end up with what's called a many tender where vultures of some sort -- I'm probably not picking the best word -- would make an offer to unsuspecting investors to sell their securities way below the value of whatever it is at that time, even if it is depressed from the actual purchase price.  </p><p>      That is troubling on many levels because yes, there are disclosure requirements under Reg A plus, but are they as robust as they would be for listed company.  That is a question that I think has to be considered.  Also, to the extent that when you have a private offering, if somebody is interested in buying -- to get information from the company what you end up having is -- the bigger players have access to information that the small investor doesn't have.</p><p>      So in fact, if we're concerned about is a level playing field and investor empowerment.  I think before we get to a discussion of pre- emption, we have the first think about what it is that is needed as a minimum for investors to be able to in fact make that intelligent decision.</p><p>      And I think to a certain extent, 4A7 was a good indicator that which is -- Sarah knows that better than anyone -- that it had the backing of NASA because it had certain informational requirements, including knowledge of the you know, whose running the company, is it a going concern, up-to-date financials.      So my concern is more a shift away from how we normally look at the situation and trying to look at this in a slightly different way which is instead of concentrating on pre-emption, we should all be discussing together not separately, as in leave the states out of with pre-emption, what is it that we can all agree on it as information required add a minimum as I said to make a cogent investor decision.</p><p>      At this point, there are plenty of times where in fact you have situations in which the investor has very little information, reports to be filed are one thing, but if they just have the most basic of information, is that really what they need to make the decision and I suspect it is not, at least not in all cases.  So one thing that we would have to...</p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)</p><p>      HEWITT:  ... in fact it is not, at least not in all cases.</p><p>      So one thing that we would have to consider is -- I know I am saying it a few times, but when -- another way looking at this is, what is it that all of us would like to see before making an investment decision and doesn't every investor have a right to have that which we all think we need to see personally sitting around the table.</p><p>      And to the extent that we do, the question isn't necessarily pre- emption and I am not sure the states would even have a problem with pre-emption to the extent that their concerns about the information required is actually addressed now as Richard said, if you want to you, whether you have a more far-reaching manual exemption that is acceptable to all parties.</p><p>      I don't think that is a bad place to start to think that in many ways it has worked except for there are a few holdouts states and for whatever reason.  But to the extent of there has to be pre-emption, I think it has to more not as in removing people from the table but making sure that everyone is able to see -- to say what -- they know that one of the states has one time said -- states has one time said to me that we want to facilitate investment not speculation.  With that information it can only be called speculation, and I think that really drives home the point.  </p><p>      So I think that if there is any recommendation I have it isn't so much to worry about pre-emption per se, it's to worry about address the concerns of the states as to information that at a bare minimum, we should have all et cetera.  But how we get there is a matter of discussion.</p><p>      I just think that if one rushes to quickly to the pre-emption, to go to pre-emption without considering several things, including what is it that the states are concerned about so I won't take up too much time because I know we both plowed through a lot of it already.  </p><p>      HANKS:  Well, thank you both.  </p><p>      If I could just sort of kick-off the questions here, so we are focusing on the information is available before we get to the \"P\" word, does anyone here have any experience in how different disclosure under Reg A ongoing reporting is to what's in a manual.  I've got to confess that it's been a long time since I looked in manuals.  Maybe I was a junior associate sometime back in the 80s when I last looked at these things.  </p><p>      Seems to me, and I am hoping someone can challenge this, that when you look at the disclosure that's made under Regulation A and we have had now several companies go through a year's worth of disclosure, you have got ongoing reporting, you've got some annual reporting with audited financials, you got semi-annual with the unaudited financials, you've got one years -- you got a lot of companies filing 253 G2's supplement information to keep the information rolling.</p><p>      How does those compare?  Is there anything in is there any way in which Reg A is not what you would want to see in manual because I remember those manuals, you just -- it was kind of unreadable.  Can we compare and contrast those two sources of information.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm actually glad that you brought up the fact that they are unreadable.  That's the other problem is that whatever information is available has to be in plain language, which I know is always a goal.  But since the more that we try to make plain language the goal, the document becomes thicker and thicker which is great for killing trees, but that's about it.</p><p>      The comparison between the two, I couldn't tell you to the nth (ph) degree, but I think we also have to look at is obviously Reg A plus these offerings are of companies with little or no history and of course if you just, if somebody is flipping out of that in six months to a year, where is that investor during the interim report supposed to get information, the purchaser.</p><p>      And I think that's the concern that although there may be information out there, is it of sufficient detail and also of sufficient comprehensibility to be of any use to the investor.</p><p>      HANKS:  But would that be any different under the manual requirements, I am totally not up-to-date with manual requirements.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sarah I think that, it's fair to say that the reporting requirements that Tier 2 issuers are subject to while something less than 34 Act reporting, is something more than what is included in a manual.</p><p>      The manual includes things like balance sheets, officers and directors, description of business, things that you would normally see that is a synopsis of a company and I think part of the thinking on the manual exemption is that that is certainly a starting point for an investor.</p><p>      It is a collection of information that if an investor wants more information than they can go and find it either on Edger or wherever else.  But I think it's fair to say that Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers fall somewhere greater in their reporting responsibilities and of the information that they are required to report under Reg A plus, then they would need to under -- in a manual.</p><p>      I would perhaps refer to Michael who may have more intimate experience with what his manual requires.</p><p>      HANKS:  And well, we'll get to Michael and then to Emma.</p><p>      EMMA:  Potentially in a unique situation, which is I actually got security qualified under the manual exception three years ago, I think that I am not mistaken, but they no longer publish information in a book.  What they do is they will only allow you to qualify for the manual exemption of this is S&amp;P, where they are still doing the business.  If the information was being disseminated by a regulator.</p><p>      So the only entities who could qualify for manual exemption at all, were banks, thrives, entities that were required to publicly provide information to a regulator or companies that were qualified to train an OTC markets under the alternative reporting standards.</p><p>      So you can't just qualify for the manual exemption you actually have to be regulated in order to qualify for manual exemptions.  So I think that's a really important point to understand, you can't just put out Reg A plus Tier 2 materials to the SEC and qualify for manual exemption unless the manual exemption has been amended to make that clear.  </p><p>      Secondly, I think that -- and at least alternative reporting standards under OTC required more information than Reg A plus Tier 2, but that was to provide a trading market, it also has a $20,000 year cost, that some companies may not be able to bear with a manual exemption or S&amp;P.</p><p>      I think the initial fee was maybe like 6000-5000 and so it was much less expensive to be qualified under (inaudible) than it is to do qualification under the alternative reporting centres, but you do get a trading market so I think it is really important to understand it's not just that you put some information in a book someplace that is no longer the case.</p><p>      It is literally it has to go out through regulator and that is how they track that information is been updated and there is a cost associated with that.  </p><p>      HANKS:  Michael?</p><p>      PIWOWAR:  Thank you Sarah and good morning everybody.  </p><p>      So, I think that question specifically about what the differences are, when you're talking about the reporting requirements in the manual.  I think probably the Reg A Tier 2 reporting the things I reported are pretty equal if not greater, as Richard had said you know, I think some of the other requirements getting beyond was in the manual as components of the manual exemption like the fact it goes through a broker-dealer and that would be a distinction difference.</p><p>      And (inaudible) there is -- you know, there is sort of baseline in terms of what type of company can qualify for manual exemption and I believe I had to, you know, had to look back at our statute, but you know, there is a period of time in which it has to be operating in a period of there's an asset value which has to be on its balance sheet. </p><p>      So there is a sort of minimum standard, but the not familiar with the requirement that has to wither bank calling company or insurance company, but...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It wasn't that I said that information had to be disseminated by own regulator, it could just be on the company's website that was very clear (inaudible) we had a public website, (inaudible) put the information on the website to qualify and they said, no, you have to be -- that information has to be disseminated through a regulated entity so it was OTC, it was the banking regulators and it was OTC markets with the only option that would satisfy that condition according to S&amp;P three years ago.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But we're talking about the access to the information under the manual exemption?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So, again this is three years ago, I don't believe S&amp;P is going this anymore, when S&amp;P said us your offering document, we will review that but you have to have a system for sending information on ongoing basis and it has to be through a regulator, it could not just be our website.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But the exemption, the manual exemption at the state level is predicated on an independent third-party publication containing information that is provided by the issuer, right?</p><p>      The problem, of course, in the context of a discussion on a liquid trading market for these types of issuers is the fact that not all states cover the -- recognize a manual exemption, and even in those states that do recognize the manual, we have a variety of different requirements, whether it's a 90 day waiting period or restricting trading to securities by non-affiliates.</p><p>      So having the manual, the existing state manual be the basis for creating a robust secondary liquid market in these kinds of securities.  I don't -- I am not confident is achievable, which is why I suggested that the \"P\" word -- or why the \"P\" word has again raised its ugly head.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  However I think one of the things we have to consider as we're talking about the manual exemption right now is which is all well and good and perhaps there is one that can be the gold standard.</p><p>      But in the meantime, part of what happens -- part of what I think the states are concerned about, you know, obviously part of the thing of being empowered investors also having the ability to get guidance from an advisor of some sort -- emption and removal of the broker- dealer or advisor so that the of the day it is a one-on-one transaction and the question is, the person who's selling, there's no oversight there whatsoever.  </p><p>      They are not, they are not representative of the company, they are not part of the issuer, they are selling and there's very little that, at this point, as far as I am concerned, that an unsuspecting and uneducated investor can rely upon in that situation, at least if there is a broker-dealer involved, you would hope that there is a minimal amount of guidance.</p><p>      So I think that well, we're talking about the manual exemption, we have to also consider a slightly different point which is if it is on a one-to-one basis, how is that investor being protected by the seller?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Counter-point?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Go ahead.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  This is a Jane Curtin and (inaudible) sort of stuff going on and that's OK.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The one to one transaction is already covered under 4A1 and we have federal pre-emption for those kinds of transactions. I mean the one to one transaction doesn't concern me and I don't think is impassioned doesn't concern me and I don't think is impacted by the problems that we have spoken about relating to Blue Sky law.</p><p>      I think the challenge is trying to figure out how to fit the current federal state regulatory scheme to facilitate a liquid secondary market where people come and go into the market, whether through market participants or otherwise without any significant impediment which is what we see today.  </p><p>      We see smaller companies struggling to convince their investors that they will have an exit strategy because there is no comprehensive uniform way for a company to tell a broker or to tell investors that their securities can be bought and sold in Iowa, as an example and I don't mean to pick on Iowa, if Iowa was listening.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Pick on Vermont instead.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Patrick, go ahead.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I can't remember Tier 2 requires to have a transfer agent?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I think so.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But if you had a transfer agent, I mean you could condition execution of the transfer -- the transfer agent get some sort of proof or representation that there was an exemption so that is a thought that I have had and you see that under rule 144, the transfer agent will transfer the trade -- will register the trade unless there is an opinion or form used to be -- I am not sure what exactly they require now.</p><p>      That seems to me something you should think about, but I want to add this general observation and then another observation.  First of all, the illiquidity creates a discount so you can't go and sell then the weigh of your company is less, and so we all need to keep that in mind.</p><p>      And the second thing is my observation has been that when regulation steps up and says you cannot do something, something in business people wanted to do, you cannot do it or it is very difficult to do it.  That's when you get noncompliance.  That's when people start looking, sneaking off from what their lawyers or whoever their broker is and they go in and they go around the law and do the deal.</p><p>      I have said this before, I think our policy, state and federal, is that we facilitate compliance.  We shouldn't make compliance so hard people opt to violate the law.  That's just because it's difficult to or impossible, some cases you are just saying impossible.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Because you have conflict of laws between states or states and federal.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean it's just got -- it needs to be something there.  The other thing is that I think, I don't mean to pick on you, but I think the Blue Sky people are, you know, we have two conflict of interest here, we have investor protection of capital formation.  I think when you go into any securities regulator SEC, federal, state securities law -- OK, how many people here have ever signed the front of a buisness check?  (inaudible) you're gonna get very few hands raised.</p><p>      So you need to educate people, it's regulatory agencies, capital formation, as part of their goal to say no and protect in the investor is not -- and at the end of the day, if you do that, there's no business (inaudible) trade or treasury.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But here's the thing in respond to that.  First of all you said that they are conflicting and I don't necessarily agree with that statement because it is not sufficient and not investor protection is again I think it is investment empowerment.</p><p>      If there is a sufficient empowerment, if there is all just emphasis on capital formation then there will be furious people out there.  They are there and then what happens is the integrity of market fails and people will not invest and there goes your capital formation.  The point being is it has a balancing act and it's a very delicate one at that.</p><p>      But I don't think anyone saying that these people shouldn't be able to invest.  I do not think the states are saying that, I think what the issue is really one of information and education.  How you get there is what the discussion has to be about with all the regulators all the regulars in the room.</p><p>      That's basically what I am saying but I don't think that you can say that those are conflicting at all because without one the other is going to fail either way.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Ultimately, you are right.      (UNKNOWN):  Thank you.</p><p>      HANKS:  We'll get to Jonathon (ph).  I just wanted to respond on behalf of transfer agents who probably all turned white when you said that. </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      We are looking at -- trying to make something less friction, we're trying to reduce friction and I think taking free trading securities and requiring the transfer agent to do something I think it's going to introduce our frictions.  I just wanted to make that point.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And is that a broker's job too?</p><p>      HANKS:  To reduce friction or to increase the friction?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I mean to the point of asking...</p><p>      HANKS:  Yes I think that if you are looking at that who in this transaction has a role in doing the agent's information, it's going to be broker as opposed to and they do have those requirements as opposed to imposing these numerals on them on transfer agents.  We'll go to Jonathan.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  One of my experiences in the heavily regulated industries in a past life when I was a nurse and I worked in five different states and every state had a specific licensure that you actually had to maintain as a nurse.</p><p>      But the number of states had actually gotten together and they had said you know what, we are going to give each other reciprocity, where if you actually qualify in the states as a nurse, it's a regulative simple process to go through to get a license in another state.  There is also a series of states called compact states.  I think there's about 23 states where they said we will just honor everybody else's licenses.  </p><p>      I think one of the interesting things about you know, about the SEC in government is you know, yes we regulate, but I also think that we have the ability to ask for to convene, do state securities regulators get together on a regular basis?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Absolutely.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  I mean has there been discussion and -- I mean forgive my ignorance, is there discussion about can we create a program where there is reciprocity across these states?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  No, plain and simple.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  There is a -- and we're going to barge the words, I'm just (inaudible) this point.  There is a uniform process at least on the registration level with the states now when you go through Reg A plus Tier 2, so it's not like there is just a morass I think that the states are certainly working towards the goal of more uniformity and of course the punch line to the 56 Act and the 2002 Uniform Securities Act is nothing's uniform by the time the legislators get done with it. So, you know, that -- that's part of the problem.  </p><p>      The one thing I just wanted to address very quickly though is when it came to the one-to-one transaction, I still think that there is potential there pre-emption or not for the small investor to be taken advantage of by somebody who just wants to dump their stock and I think is that is probably a concern of the states, although I can't speak for them.  But in terms of what you are saying, especially with the nurses license, it's actually in fact, now lawyers is a common BAR exam, my grand-son should have started for a couple on them.</p><p>      So, there is more reciprocity in various areas within the states now, has it risen to the blue skylight area yet?  Not to that level, but that doesn't mean that -- that they are not working or trying to get the states together to make it more uniform or more user-friendly.</p><p>      Because again I don't think the states are trying to prohibit capital formation.  I think as you said, sometimes -- or I think Patrick said, sometimes you can actually protect the investor ultimately, by just not letting him invest and therefore there will be no problem.</p><p>      But that doesn't really solve the issue, which is why it is a true balancing act and again, although I keep on drumming this point, is that we have to make sure that those issues that those scenarios that have resulted in investors being defrauded are addressed.  I mean we can't do away with all fraud.  The key is to minimize as much as you can like a perfectionist isn't perfect, they just try damn hard not to make as many mistakes as everyone else.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But counterpoint.  In answer to your question, as the discussion about the standard manual illustrates that, exemption has been around from the beginning of time, OK?  It's an accepted exemption, but there are 54 different jurisdictions, each one of them has their own view about what that exemption means.</p><p>      Yes, I get that investor protection is a significant interest that needs to be recognized, but I question whether this lack of uniformity as a basis for regulation, is protecting anyone.  I mean, certainly the states continue to retain their fraud authority and if there is a bad actor and an investor is harmed, they will complain to their state regulator and that regulator has the full breath of its of its securities law, arsenal to go after those fraudsters.</p><p>      But different to, you know, your experience with nursing licenses.  The states jealously guard their own interests particularly by insisting that they alone understand the specific needs of investors and their particular jurisdiction, which I don't doubt, but -- and perhaps has validity in the context of primary offering review, I get that.  In the case of a secondary market transaction, particularly for companies where there will be information available.      For example, Reg A plus Tier 2 issuer which says, fulsome disclosures under the new law or non-reporting public companies that have information including in a national manual.</p><p>      The particular needs of the state I think, need to take -- a backseat is the wrong word, but a backseat to the interests of developing a market, a liquid market in securities that benefits everyone, not just the people in Iowa and not just the people in Vermont.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I just -- every single lawyer that I have ever talked to about, if you are actually going to sell a security and going to the Blue Sky laws, they are just like too dumb.  But that is the third rail.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Give them my number.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But it's essentially -- I do not think that there is an efficient market at all because you just can't create it.  And I think ultimately, that ends up hurting the smaller, less wealthy states, and it essentially starts concentrating business in large wealthy cities because it tends to become who you know and it tends to be who you went to school with and if you went to a school with a bunch of wealthy people then you can essentially go and start a business and create security and end up selling it.</p><p>      And if you are poor and you want to start a business, you really can't start a business unless you can completely bootstrapping without any capital.  I am just saying, it feels very, very, very broken to me and can we convene these state regulators and just say, dudes let's just sit in a room and let's just work it out.\"</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You got to understand that first of all, NASA has several meetings throughout the year of the states, but again you put all of us in this room we have different ideas slightly or greatly. But I think one thing you have to understand -- I've been in securities industry now for 35 years which frightens me on many levels, but you know, there was a day when there was between the states and practitioners and issuers.</p><p>      But overtime I have seen that shift dramatically and you know, one thing that that NASA is always trying to do and they do meet with several groups throughout the year and we are always trying to talk about quote, \"low hanging fruit\", what can we accomplish.  And this is one of those areas where I don't think anyone is saying that there shouldn't be more information or there should not be more easily understood information.  </p><p>      I think it's a matter of having that discussion, but not everyone their own little corner, but you out in the open and having the robust discussion but I don't think the states are all sitting and going, wow, how can I make myself so different as to totally derail anyone trying to either sell a security or raise funds to build a business. I don't think that's the mentality.      (UNKNOWN):  But wasn't that discussion had -- during the lead up to the adoption of Title 4?  My recollection is that there was...</p><p>      HANKS:  I just want to get to Laura (ph), she's been trying to get a word in.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I just want to take this back to I think something the committees talked about several times which is, what is the public policy benefit of requiring a Tier 2 reporting company to also qualify for manual exemption or to list under the attorney of reporting standards under OTC markets.</p><p>      That prohibition means as Jonathon was saying, there is no opportunity for another market to develop, there's not an opportunity for another broker-dealer or ECN or any other parkit to try to create an efficient trading system for what are generally publicly offered and should be (inaudible) securities.</p><p>      So I think we go back to the original conversation, I think back (inaudible) there was a real push to get pre-emption for Tier 2 securities where the information being made publicly available that end up coming off the table in the final vote, but we've had, you know, some time now to look at how the market is adjusting.  I've made the comments before at least one or two times that we did a real deep dive and look at Reg A plus after it got enacted and all of the banks that we spoke to for the most part so they would not be touching Reg A as an offering option for their client companies because their investors (inaudible) unless there was clear liquidity for securities, people are not going to invest in securities.</p><p>      An idea that right now if you are investing in one of the 103 companies that have been qualified issue Reg A plus securities, there's no trading market for the securities, how's that beneficial to the people who are investing in that?</p><p>      They're stuck in securities unless the company goes through a process and I -- you know, fully supported and respect OTC markets, they are providing a great option, they are the only option for trading the securities, and you have to go through a process, you have to pay, you know, not insubstantial annual fee.  And you have to find more disclosure than it is actually required in the offering, or in the ongoing voluntary reporting.  </p><p>      It just doesn't seem it is (inaudible) policy or investor protection benefit that I see as being provided by that kind of activity and it's a detrement to Reg A plus and to the market developing and I tell people that's (inaudible) in dealing with insurers regulatory dates.</p><p>      And just from a cost perspective, regulatory compliance because each of the states are different very much like we are talking about here only, they are low bit more advanced and they are complaints for all the things we are going to get together with, you know, work together and they come up with this common thing and they put it together and they put it on top of all their existing requirements.</p><p>      So, it's fine that it created jobs, it's great, it's a cost that gets passed on to the consumer, cost of operating for the company so in the company that I worked at, I probably had about 15 percent dedicated only to state compliance reporting.</p><p>      So, think about what that means, 15 percent of that body count that we had and if we are actually only making the 6 percent bottom line and some bad years because it's insurance.  But best maybe 20, that compliance component, even though it is not for the whole component, it was costing.  So therefore, what happens if you want a state -- company to do business in all 50 states, you got to be big.  </p><p>      I worked with a big company and they said we just wanted to be able to say that we were listed in all 50 states and you know, it gave them additional market branding, et cetera.  Or you have small companies, insurance companies, and the only specialized in one, sounding familiar here, right?</p><p>      And so therefore anybody in the middle, it's economically infeasible.  So (inaudible) I think it is great, but better people probably have tried before so unfortunately, as much as it pains me to say this federal is probably the only way to go at that point and time.  </p><p>      However, the second point that I want to get to is, we are talking about increasing the availability of -- just increase in the market right so we don't worry about the institutional investors out there, they can take care of themselves.</p><p>      We don't worry about the small people, you know, they're dealing all the small people, they are doing the one offs who actually know the business that they are investing in and again now we are talking about the mid, and the mid just disappears, right?</p><p>      And so to add (inaudible) down into the details and whatever, if we have our goal to accelerate the investment at mid-level which means they're theoretically much more (inaudible) not investor, there's probably something in between regarding a regulatory perspective that we can take which I totally understand about working within the context we have because I don't think we are going to be able to check mid-level, which means there business people feel that it is a viable investment alternative.  </p><p>      They will figure out a way to create that which will probably, it could be 90 percent of the time it really works, the 10 percent that fails but (inaudible) it will be enough to kill it.  Eventually, and then as an economy all we do is heard so that's a (inaudible).</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  If I could add to that, I think if you are looking for something to sell pre-emption I think pretty sure for states in fraud and (inaudible) fraud, in coordination with the SEC and the Justice Department, I don't know how you would do that.  I mean I think everybody agrees that there is finally a fraud out there to go and trace it.  </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Are the Russians doing this?</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      Anyway, I think that's my only comment really, I don't have anything to add, but I think that does seem to me if we're bellybutton gazing and thinking deep thoughts that is one off thought put the states in fraud, if that matter regulating transactions.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Mr. Patrick, we'll get to Michael and then Jenny.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Thank you.  So I just want to address quickly (inaudible) a point that was made by Patrick and Jonathan, just to give some information in terms of what the states do and whatnot and the insurance regulator context, you know, I mean the state regulators are the only regulator of insurance market and states do coordinate quite efficiently on the insurance side.</p><p>      My opinion of his accreditation for states they have to have certain requirements, or they are not part of the NAIC and similarly on the NASA side, you know, we have two annual meetings a year, we have a Board of Directors, we have a whole structure that works up issues through committees up to the board, you know, disseminated out to the membership and I encourage you to come to the NASA meeting you know, when you have an opportunity to and I'm sure we would appreciate inviting you.</p><p>      But to again serve some veins to Patrick's point, I mean you know, the states have been very -- in my opinion they are very responsiveness in capital formation arena in the last few years, we take to heart this issue of the balance you know, the balance between investor protection capital formation because you know, on one hand, as you mentioned what happens if we focus too much in capital formation.</p><p>      But if we focus too much on investor protection, the opportunities to invest, the opportunities to grow retirement, to create jobs that goes way too which is not good for the investors. That balance is very important.  </p><p>      Martin alluded to the coordinator review that the states implemented in Tier 1 Reg A , this in our opinion, takes the burden off the individual issuer, puts it on the states to coordinate and get the specific comments out to the issuer's (inaudible) capital formation arena in the last few years.</p><p>      We take to heart this issue of the balance you know, that the balance between investor protection capital formation because you know the one hand, as you mentioned, what happens if we focus too much on capital formation, but if we focus too much on investor protection you know the opportunities to invest, the opportunities to grow retirement to create jobs that goes way too which is not good for the investors.  </p><p>      That balance is very important, Martin alluded to the coordinator review that the states implemented in Tier 1 Reg A , this in our opinion, takes the burden off the individual issuer, puts it on the states to coordinate and get the specific comments out to the issuers.</p><p>      We have grade of capital formation amount of those discussions, we have worked more collaboratively with the SEC in recent years, rule 147 A and other initiatives and I hope we can continue to do that.  So states have been very proactive in this area and we have you know, vendor engagement, the OTC markets just to comment, OTC markets came to us in March or April of last year to Vermont and said you know, the S&amp;P manual is going away.  </p><p>      There is only merchants now we look to that state regulators and said there should be more options we were concerned about that, we were the first movers they came to us in March we had a rule implemented in July of that same year, 19 states as Richard had said followed suit, three others have announced they are going to.  So the states do act and we do communicate regularly and you know, try to lead these initiatives on quite ongoing basis.  </p><p>      Announced they are going to so the states do act and we do communicate regularly and you know, try to lead these initiatives on quite ongoing basis.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I have a question about state and regional secondary markets.  I know in the past we had a lot of more local exchanges -- state-level exchanges...</p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  ... there is some benefit to being able to buy and sell securities in your own states.  I am just curious if that has been tried at all.  You know, what was the success of that, is that something we can consider reviving.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think the demise of the regional exchanges was clearly an economic issue.  I mean, you know, it costs a lot of money to do that stuff.  And while you know, there may be some theoretical benefit to reviving the concept of regional exchange while you know, there may be some theoretical benefit to reviving the concept of regional exchange, I mean Reg A plus Tier 2 is billed as a platform for national securities offerings.</p><p>      So, at least in the context, and correct me if I am wrong, but at least in the context of Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings, regional exchanges I don't think would necessarily solve the problem.</p><p>      And then I suppose the one way that you could implement that is to designate whatever regional exchanges are formed as national securities exchanges under section 18, but if I remember my section 18 provisions correctly, any national exchange has to meet the same standards or similar standards to the NYSE, NASDAQ.</p><p>      So, you know, I wonder whether we could ever get back to what used to be the Midwest exchange, specific exchange in Cincinnati and like.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I would love to hear Michael's comments on that too and also whether this is been discussed at NASA and maybe it doesn't have to be an exchange, maybe it could be some kind of bulletin board or something like that.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I guess my initial reaction sort of piggyback on Richard's saying you know, economic component, not just running the exchange, but on the other side, I mean the supply, the demand, I mean the business element, I mean the illiquidity, lack of people wanting to buy the securities and I don't think -- I think that is probably the discussion that we should have in terms secondary trading now and its larger discussion as well because regardless of, you know, the regulations or whatever in place I mean it is actually demand.  </p><p>      You know, people want to achieve liquidity and sell their investment, but if somebody willing to buy it and we are talking about, what we are talking about today we're talking about smaller companies, small investors, mom-and-pop investors that are doing initial buying and doing subsequent buying and selling so is not institutional investors, not largely sophisticated investors.</p><p>      I think that's why the investor protection elements you know, are important to considerations.  So, you know, I think it's economic and, you know, and businessmen in terms of supply and the demand of the securities.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Just a couple of points.  One is and I think that Richard mentioned it when he was talking about the different exemptions and secondary trading at the state level.  There is a complete disconnect between the secondary trading exemption at the state level for broker-dealers and at the federal level, so the context of IPS for example, and I think (inaudible) original offerings.</p><p>      A broker dealer who has an existing relationship and I think I have said to the committee before, a broker dealer has a pre-existing relationship with a client, has done suitability, understands their investment criteria, has confirmed the status in the investor.  </p><p>      Can market any opportunity in a primary context to their clients as long as they believe that are suitable for them.  It is the exact opposite in the secondary context because of the state law, the sky requirements which are that a transactions for a broker dealer must be unsolicited.</p><p>      That means that if I'm a broker-dealer, I can go out to every one of you if we have a relationship say would you like to buy Reg A plus primary offering, but I can't touch any of you to ask you if you want to buy the securities and secondary market, that doesn't make any sense.  </p><p>      It has never made sense to me, these are clients of broker- dealers and again pre-emption solves that problem.  Pre-emption allows a broker dealer to go out and touch their existing clients, not in a personal way, but (inaudible) way and asked them are you interested in investing in these securities.</p><p>      That is the only way we're going to develop a robust secondary market around these type of securities, brokers have to be able to do their job.  They have to be able to locate by said interest, they have to make sure that the investment suitable for their investors, that's how you get the investor protection.</p><p>      You have the disclosure point already out there, then you have the broker-dealer protection and to Jenny's point, I don't think you're going to see NASA exchanges come back into the fray as a result of electronic trading -- I'm sorry regional exchanges because of electronic trading the cost structure is just not there I think to support regional exchanges, which is why most of them were acquired and as a matter of financial interest.</p><p>      Yeah, but I think where you are seeing is and maybe an increased proliferation of platforms, web-based platforms that are in the primary space that could be in the secondary space for Reg A plus securities crowd funding portals that there are a multitude of players who are out there, who would be able to create a business model around this if it made economic sense if they had the pre-emption for secondary training.</p><p>      HANKS:  I think where it was saying on that point time.  If you look at how many ATS there are at the moment I was just counting them from the other day from the most recent update.  I think this might 41 and some of those and some of those are clients are looking to be secondary markets for Reg A securities as well.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And they can't because the Blue Sky...</p><p>      HANKS:  It is more difficult for them because that, yes.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  When I worked on getting the security approved first for Blue Sky manual purposes, it's a big deal that you cannot do it in all 50 states.  It should not underplay that, it's a big deal.  What if you are issuer in state that doesn't have a manual exemption, you can't actually -- why would anybody buy your securities if they know for sure, you can't ever get secondary liquidity, it is a big deal that it is not in every state.  It is a big deal, that is a patchwork of requirements that it takes significant expertise such as these gentlemen to hire a lawyer, to walk you through the requirements in every single state.</p><p>      We did that when I was in second market, we did a big deep dive into the secondary market.  You guys have seen me, I have presented to NASA, it is a patchwork of unintelligible requirements that are driven by legislation securities commissioner interpretations.  That sort of thing it is not consistent across all 50 states.  So, again don't underplay the fact that OTC zoning approved in potentially 19 states, that's a big deal.  And that is a real fiction impediment to market being created around Reg A securities.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Michael?</p><p>      PIWOWAR:  So I think there is -- I just want to address the one point the unsolicited broker.  I am not expert in this arena, but there certainly securities as you probably heard the phrase that are not bought but are sold, you know and I think that sort of the driving impetus behind the unsolicited portion of the broker dealer unsolicited exemption may not -- you know, on the OTC piece and I will just mention, you know, there's 19 states are within the last seven or eight months...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      PIWOWAR:  Yes, but you know, the speed in which we have done it I think is pretty rapid, particularly when you look at some other historical context.  So you know, I think that's an element to take into place.  And then I think the other point is, don't want to lose -- I made this point already but I don't want us to lose this idea about the information requirements that these investors need to make an intelligible investment decision.</p><p>      You look at the SEC Joshua White, I think it was an interesting report recently, study that looked at the OTC and I encourage everybody to read it but essentially look to the three tiers and as you move down in the tiers, the outcome for the investor and also liquidity decreases and I won't put an adjective there, I won't say rapidly decreased, but there's a -- there's a there is a correspondingly decrease in investor outcome when there's less information as a correspondent to decrease in liquidity when there's information.</p><p>      So I think the requirements in the framework that we're talking about are not all just for investor protection.  I mean there are investor protection, but you know, there are also for the efficiency of the capital markets and ensuring there are sufficient information there for the flow of funds, flow of information, flow of securities.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So what you are saying is information drives the markets.</p><p>      PIWOWAR:  That's what this report would suggest.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, exactly.  And that's why as I was saying earlier, it has to do with making sure that the investors in power to be able to make those decisions without that information they are not going to buy anything.</p><p>      PIWOWAR:  And doesn't that argue for pre-empting the non-uniform current state regulatory scheme with a category of covered securities specific to Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers who are subject to fulsome information requirements.  </p><p>      I mean, would you be satisfied as a regulator that the information that Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers are required to provide under statute sufficient for purposes of allowing a secondary market transaction in your state if they were -- let's assume that they were included in your manual, they would meet that requirement and you would be fine, right?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean speaking of solely Vermont regulator, you know, are manual exemption requirements are self-executing as I think they are everywhere so you know, what that means is for those in the committee is that they do not file a notice fine with us if they don't get our prior approval and they don't contact us, they look at the requirements, they meet them, they execute the transaction which, you know, provides efficiency on the transaction side.      So, you know, for Vermont, if those guardrails stayed in place, you know, whether it's in our stature or federal statute you know, the guardrails are in place, the investors are protected, the information is out there.  But you know, there is certain -- that's a Vermont standard and I can't say the same for even those in New England or those in another part of the country.</p><p>      PIWOWAR:  But that's all more important fact that in coming up with whatever that federal \"X\" might be, it has to be in consultation with the states that there is a standard upon which the states can agree.  And then there is really no need at that point, you are satisfied with the information being provided and you take it from there, but I don't -- as you said this is self-explanatory, point one.</p><p>      Point two is, I don't think the issue is pre-emption or not.  As I said earlier, I think it is making sure there is consistent information, if that takes the form of pre-emption, I would think as long as it is in consultation with NASA with the states and some they can get behind, well at least that's an easier road to take I think.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But the framework already exists.  The informational framework already exists at the state level in a majority of states. And the effort here would be to unify what is a fragmented regulatory scheme and if the only way to achieve that is through pre-emption, well you know, it's an unfortunate situation.  </p><p>      I suppose if you are a state regulator, but the majority of state regulators currently offer exemptions for secondary market trades provided there is information available, 39, 44, whatever the number is so in order to get to that goal line of full compliance 54 jurisdictions so that you can then give the secondary markets for these kinds of issuers a fighting chance to survive.  Well, then perhaps pre-emption is the fix.</p><p>      HANKS:  Can we say on the point of pre-emption and the secondary markets here because a point you made earlier Richard was, if we do pre-emption we should do pre-emption on the basis of the qualified purchases being just someone who buys and Reg A, period.  No restrictions on the investment levels as they are on primary market.  </p><p>      This is a question for both of you, is the secondary market, why would you make that distinction?  Is there less pressure in the secondary trade and I don't think I am hearing that front from Martin. Or is that the information somehow more sufficient in a secondary trade than is primary trade?  Why make that distinction and how is the secondary trade different than the primary?</p><p>      ALVAREZ:  Well, I think with the secondary trade at that point, you know, you're one generation sort of speaker removed from the issuer and from the IPO and the need for more robust disclosure, I think it's primal critical on the secondary trade, if I understand your question correctly.</p><p>      HANKS:  So you would need more information...</p><p>      ALVAREZ:  Not necessarily more, but equal too.  Because what happens is there is you know as -- once you've done with the IPO, the company, the issuer has the money now we are just talking about moving money between moving money and securities between investors and the question is, since you can't go -- the investor cannot go and call up the chief financial officer of the issuer, you do not kick the tires for speaking the same way for institutional investor might.  I think that what you are saying is you need sufficient information, what that is again is obviously up to discussion and disagreement.</p><p>      But I think that's why it's important at the secondary level to make sure that what you may not have disclosure equal to that which is on a national exchange -- although that's to me the goal of standard and I understand there is a lot of expense involved with that and it could be prohibitive for it to produce information, there still has to be sufficient information, such that the investor is going in with his or her eyes wide open as to the risks and rewards.</p><p>      HANKS:  And that is different than in the primary situation and try to (inaudible) on the one on one thing here that way you gone a buyer who is just going out there with and posted some securities and said -- sorry a seller who has posted securities, I am selling securities and then as a seller who comes along with and there is no broker involved so they are searching, \"oh this is an interesting company\", is there a different dynamic there in the secondary market than it would have been in the primary?</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it has to do with the relation...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sorry what's that?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  If there prohibition secondary market right now, you know the issuer as an obligation, I think to make sure that it is unclear thing under Reg A who has the obligation to make sure that the cap's not exceeded, but how would you do that in the secondary sense.</p><p>      HANKS:  It's self-certification anyway.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes OK.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But the question is whether or not, as you said there is a difference.  I know I would venture to say the primary distribution, the investor is relying on the issuer to provide the information that it needs to make that to make that investment, and in the secondary market, it's just you know, a normal contract.  </p><p>      You know, you have a good to sell, and I can decide whether or not to buy it based on whatever information is out there.  The fact that I am or am not a qualified purchaser or a suitable purchaser should not matter because those funds are not going to the issuer, which is where suitability requirements are normally found.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You think that makes a difference from the investor protection point of view and as that's actually a question from (inaudible).</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think at that point, there has to be some watchdog, some minimal amount of -- and I hate to use the words protection and empowerment of the investor so that they -- at that point they really just left their own resources so they can find the information great, if they can't that's too bad.  And to the extent that they decide to buy from this person, well why are they buying is it because they have done thorough research or is it just because it is a dartboard investment.</p><p>      And for the small investor dartboard investment can be devastating to the retirement so my concern is that as you move further away from the issuer, the investor really is going out of haphazardly and not necessarily getting all the information that could be out there, whether it is accurate or not.  I mean to getting this from the seller at that point.  So, it's only so much diligence the a small investor can do for his or herself.  And I think that's a concern to me which is why a universal manual exemption which I don't think we disagree unnecessarily, is certainly stepping in the right direction.</p><p>      Now whether or not that takes the form of pre-emption.  You know, that depends again as long as the if you can get the states on board, there some errors in which look -- even Bill Baydian, his testimony before Congress in May 1, 2014, clearly stated there sometimes there are some instances in which it is not every wrong that there is pre- emption.  It is not that it should never occur.  The thing is to make sure that what you are doing is well-thought-out and addresses the issues that the states if they were not pre-empted would address.</p><p>      And I think that's one of the key considerations here is to figure out exactly where, how much information, what sort of information, how it is verified for the small investor.  The larger investor can get all the information he or she wants.  You know, that is that is not an issue.  The question is what is the small investor getting from whom and how can they rely on and that's that is my concern.  I suspect that might be the concern of states, but I'm not speaking on their behalf.</p><p>      HANKS:  Is it Andrew or Laura?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I actually wanted to just bring out a comment, no matter what we do or we choose not to do I think we really need to understand what the implication is to the general economy and all states.  So, right now as how it's in my opinion, how it's laid out, it favors certain economic areas.  So even if we stay status quo, we don't do anything else, to Jonathan's point, frankly everybody here, the money's going to stay where the money knows, has the relationship in certain economic centers.  </p><p>      And what we do is continue that process as we go along and then actually to the point, Michael I think you know, when you were talking you are asking Sarah about that secondary you know, what's the difference between the first and secondary?  And we are talking (inaudible) basically longer the company has been in business isn't that assigning in another self that this has a higher...      (UNKNOWN):  But the question is how are these companies necessarily in business when somebody flips out this...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We don't ask these questions about listed companies.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Exactly, you don't do that.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It should be noticed that, noted that during 2008 during the crash, almost a third of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange went away.  So it's not that there is any guarantee there either and that's what is important for people to understand the small investor.  I mean all of us we get this, is that an investment is not a guaranteed rate of return and the problem is, a lot of investors think that they invest, they sit there in the money rolls in.  So, that is another different educational standpoint.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The question to me occurs are we here and are we really just trying to protect a certain layer of investor or what about the balance on the other side to encourage business.  I will...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it is balancing.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It is both, that's what I'm saying.  So I think that when we're talking about -- and I could be wrong, totally wrong.  I want to protect the investor to the extent that the investor should be protected.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't disagree with you.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And part of me says that you made the comment...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Is someone taking their whole investment portfolio, and they are buying stock in the secondary market without a bigger issue, right?  So really realistic where we're trying to target our efforts here is to that middle layer of investor's that has funds, OK? That is knowledgeable and can actually flow a lot of capital into that to grow companies.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But that's not probably company on the secondary market.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Just thought of an idea, so I just thought you know, we created a regime where there is this new type of platform under Title 3 of the Jobs Act.  What if there was a platform for secondary trading of Reg A securities that if things were traded on the -- you know, in the same way with the platform for Title 3, there is pre- emption, but the platforms have to meet certain requirements, they have to do certain kinds of investor education, could that be a potential solution?      (UNKNOWN):  Yes.  But on the crowd funding side, there were very, very discreet and particular requirements on who can operate a portal I mean that's you know, that's but -- and I think that that...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Not that hard to become a portal believe me.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But -- OK.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You should see some of the portals out there, no offense.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't know, I guess I am biased, I view crowd funding a little differently than I view standard securities offerings.  And in the context of Reg A plus and Reg A plus Tier 2 specifically, as I commented earlier, I think the expectation is that this new regulatory scheme will promote a national type of a securities market and it should look more like what we are accustomed to seeing exchange listed, reporting company, securities rather than what is currently in place for crowdfunding which is at least for me as a Blue Sky lawyer a totally different end (ph).</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I think crowdfunding for a lot of Blue Sky attorneys is -- yes, thank you.  It's a scary area because there is so much potential for chicanery there as opposed to Reg A plus.</p><p>      But that doesn't mean that there are not issues to address there as well.  But I think the crowdfunding platform is not necessarily, although it's a good idea.  I don't know how it would actually work because again it is apples and oranges in terms of the caliber of what is being offered.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right, I'm just making the analogy of a platform that has to be qualified by the SEC and in exchange for meeting a bunch of requirements.  There is pre-emption at the state level filings.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But Sarah mentioned there are a boatload of ATS out there that could serve as that platform.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  They went through already registered broker dealers.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Registered broker-dealers, right.  And then the question becomes if you're looking to use that as a vehicle to pre- empt state law under Section 18 there are particular criteria that have to be met for these ATS's and these exchanges to be able to have securities listed on them be deemed covered securities.</p><p>      HANKS:  Do you have a question?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I also think a great way to lose a lot of money in a private market investment is to make like two investments or one.  And the proper way to do it is to actually build a portfolio of 20 to 25 companies so you have things like angel groups, and that sort of stuff that actively encourage a lot more of this type of investment.</p><p>      And so I think that the current regulatory scheme not only does it not form a capital formation, but with the very, very, very low, almost non-existent volume of secondary transactions, investors are actually really hurt because they can't build portfolios.</p><p>      And one of the frequent comments that I hear from angel investors who are actively building these portfolios is liquidity.  And so were essentially dependent on a very active merger and acquisition market which ends up consolidating companies which ends up decreasing the number of jobs because the merger and acquisition process is about consolidation, making large companies much more profitable.</p><p>      And so the current way that we have is investors aren't making money, when they can make these sorts of investments they are at very high risk to actually lose the money, we're not having capital B-form for small businesses and we're having a lot of these really large massive corporations be formed and we're having less and less public companies.</p><p>      And if -- the Angel Capital Association, how much money is actually invested in annual basis by angels to have that data?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Last year it was around $27 billion, right.  $27 billion.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I think venture is about $50 billion a year, so that's about $75 billion.  But the lottery is a $65 billion a year business.  And I know that the lottery is targeting poor people and they are losing a ton of money at that.</p><p>      I don't know, it feels like something is very broken and if we're expecting these small businesses to create these jobs, especially non- urban areas, I really think that something just got to change.  I would be interested like on the committee, you know, pre-emption versus not pre-emption.  I'm just interested in going around the table what do people think should be done.</p><p>      HANKS:  That was going to be my next question because we've got like 10 minutes left and I'd like to see if we can make this into a recommendation.  Are we interested in giving a recommendation?  Bear in mind that the people that we give recommendations to here is the SEC, not to the States, alright.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sarah, before the recommendation I just make one statement which is that -- I mentioned this in my earlier statements but the SEC and the states, that are really collaborative productive relationship I think for long time but -- well, go ahead Sebastian.</p><p>      GOMEZ:  I second on that.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I know and particularly as of late and we very much enjoy working Betsy and Sebastian and when Keith was here -- so when you're considering the recommendation I mean, you know, looking for ways for the states and the SEC to collaborate on this issue together I hope will be part of the consideration.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sarah, if I just make one other editorial comment that -- recall that the original Regulation A died on the vine, principally because of concerns relating to burdensome state requirements.  No one used that form and it went away.  So you know, this latest iteration should be given a chance to grow.</p><p>      And to Mike's point, I mean as I suggested in my comment about perhaps a solution being the establishment of the national manual, states certainly have a role to play in that.  They have -- they need to have a seat at the table because they are the policeman, those are the folks who are going to be enforcing the fraud actions when these investors lose their money.</p><p>      And you know, if it involves a recommendation to pre-empt Tier 2 securities and secondary market transactions well the state should be involved in that discussion as well.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So we are in complete agreement now.</p><p>      HANKS:  Duly noted regarding the State SEC dynamic that we want to encourage but can we just go around the table and hear what people have to say, especially people who you haven't heard much from this morning.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sure.  I'm all for having a centralized information portal I guess, for lack of a better word that would allow the secondary transactions to happen.  I think definitely the states should be involved in that and what the standard is.</p><p>      But there needs to be some sort of regulation on it and if we're taking the states out of that decision and then having them regulated. That's not a very good solution.  So I guess my answer is, yes, I'm all for having an essential information repository.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't think we'll get anywhere with that.  The state involvement, I think -- I do think like the apprehension from Reg A plus Tier 2 but I do think anything is going to have to have state involvement with it.</p><p>      I'll commit from a small copy like that worrying about trying to raise money in different states, it is a big concern from our standpoint.  It's very, very difficult to have state to go through this.  But again, it's going to have to be a joint effort here.</p><p>      HANKS:  Generally pre-emption, not pre-emption?</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't know, I think there is room for a lot of creativity here.  I like the idea of some kind of a pilot program, maybe just within a single state.  I think Jonathan and I would volunteer to help out with that in our state, California.</p><p>      And look at what would -- because California is a huge economy, if we limited secondary trading to just California we might learn a lot from that without having to do pre-emption and then maybe go from there.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sarah, I am in favor of the pre-emption.  One of the things I think about -- again, coming from investor's point of view, is I look at the impact on the economy, what happens when we get a liquidity event and we put that money into play into other companies, other start-up companies or we put it into play buying a piece of real estate or we put it into play to buy other things and so that what you get is the multiplier effect on the economy.</p><p>      And when you can't -- when you don't have liquidity, you impact the economy and we don't know what that impact is.  So let's see, I'd be very much in favor of something that's capitally efficient.  It's a balance that includes the states and it's another opportunity for us to have a very vibrant economy.  Thank you.</p><p>      HANKS:  Jonathan?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think the best way to create a market is to make it as big as possible and have as many buyers at the table and as many sellers at the table as possible.  The last time I talked to someone about doing a California State exemption, the California state regulators said that they were ready to do dozens of these approvals every single year.</p><p>      That just doesn't feel like a very large volume and it's not saying that -- it's not saying that they are not doing an amazing job and that is not a very hard job, and it's a thankless job because if there is fraud you get spanked and if there is capital formation, no one cares that you did your job.</p><p>      But I think that these markets need to be as big as possible and they need to be as liquid as possible.  Otherwise the investors get spanked.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Michael, I don't know who first said it, genius is somebody who sees a trend coming and runs to embrace it.  I think this -- I mean we're dealing with ancient laws, 1933.  Even I weren't born right then.  So -- but they don't fit where we are right now, OK.</p><p>      And it seems to me that there are two choices, either pre-emption which your group don't want and I understand or we got to have something that does work that involves states.  My approach would be that there are some period of time, two years strikes me as reasonable that NASA, your organization, gets together and comes up with something that's 50 states or 53 -- is that the number of agencies, 54, by answer, OK and you're willing to live with.</p><p>      And then we all get hand-in-hand and go walking up to Congress and do whatever we can to make it happen, but I think if the organization don't do that pre-emption is coming and then you won't have any jurisdiction over it all.  I mean we have to have some sort liquidity for these investors.</p><p>      And I hate fraud, I really do.  I mean I've thrown away many clients that were coming to me that they weren't going to do the right thing and I've said hit the bricks.  So I mean, believe it or not, I seem like a ruthless businessman but I am not, I'm on your side.</p><p>      But that's what I see the trend is being and you obviously got to run and embrace it.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm not quite as eloquent as Patrick.  But I think throughout the entire discussion now and being from Iowa or the typical flyover Midwest, I want to make sure that as we move forward the recommendation that we take into consideration that a lot of these regulations and items that we've been discussing maybe were based upon a reactionary or fear fraud and protecting.</p><p>      So we need to make sure that is it protection or is it elimination?  So we need to make sure that as we take that next step that we are looking at everything; and so I don't mean to sound like on the fence over Switzerland or anything like that but I do have to agree with Catherine and am that would be where I stand.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it's really important for the committee to remember that Reg A plus has three options, right.  You have Tier 1 where there is no information being disseminated after the offering takes place.  There is Tier 2 where there is no information voluntarily disseminated after the offering takes place.</p><p>      In both of those situations I would love to see the states come up with some kind of common approach to information requirements that allows for secondary transactions to occur in all 50 states, a 100 percent.  With respect to Tier 2 voluntary reporting, going various point, the centralized information portal is EDGAR.</p><p>      Those companies are filing public information with the Securities Exchange Commission as available on the SEC's website.  So that information is out there, as long as those companies are voluntarily reporting, I don't see how the states interest to acquire information dissemination through a manual is more efficient or effective than dissemination through the SEC's EDGAR Website with SEC oversight enforcement and everything else to create fraud prevention and an investor protection.</p><p>      So my vote would be pre-emption for Tier 2 securities that are voluntarily reporting on an ongoing basis.  Once that volunteer reporting stops, then they fall on to the other buckets and they have to satisfy the state requirements but again.</p><p>      I want to reiterate my point about the fact that broker-dealers cannot create secondary markets in these securities; and also that the manual exemption is not available in every jurisdiction.  So it could definitely be detrimental to capital information for small companies in states where they cannot actually legally provide secondary transactions, even under Tier 1 or Tier 2 non-reporting.</p><p>      HANKS:  I just want to point out that with respect to the words voluntarily, I mean there is an obligation in most circumstances to keep going.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Actually it's -- there is -- as Sarah said, it is not just the first year, it is just -- it's an obligation in which there is an ability to suspend that report, obligation or terminate the report immigration just a specific categories.  But so I think when we say voluntarily I think it's in a different census voluntarily just because I want to -- the rules do require them to do it.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That's what I meant, (inaudible) the company is dessemning information through the SEC, they should be in the pre- emption bucket.  I'm using the long-term (inaudible).</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right.  I didn't want to let any of my clients get the wrong idea when I told them they have to do this.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, first stuff I want to say; I don't think we're going to do anything (inaudible) and I do appreciate that.  I have family members who work for the State so I think it's a very important function actually that occurs, but I think and we're stronger when we work together, right.</p><p>      And I'm glad the SEC states have been working actually much better than the insurance.  So I mean that is very; so kudos and props.  But with all said and done, I think when I look at our perspective and what we need to do from an overall basis, unfortunately, because I don't take -- I hate to put down regulation on top of regulation.</p><p>      The data (ph) market, that is controlled -- that protects the investors while encourages investment at that next level because that's a gap we're missing.  When we see -- you know, Jonathan gave a great example of how it's supposed to work and unfortunately I think we have a little bit of gap here because you use the capital both number of companies that are forming -- are down, the number of people that are growing our organizations, they are growing IPO is down.</p><p>      The number of large entities actually is down through consolidation and the actual numbers look really good but it's not just a matter of dollars, right, sometimes it is a matter of large numbers.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Michael, I'm not going to ask you -- but is there anything that you and Michelle too would like to add before we move on?</p><p>      PIWOWAR:  Well, I do want to thank Richard and Martin, they did a nice job presenting the points and counter points.  The only other their thing I wanted to mention which I didn't get to bring up was the relative newness of this general concept of allowing investors to invest smaller or what would previously be privately held, potentially private offerings or private companies.</p><p>      And I think we see it on the primary market side and I assume it's the same thing on the secondary market side that from an investor demand perspective these exemptions are so new that investors saying, wait a minute, I didn't think I could invest in something like that or I've always been told this was the case or they do not know what a Reg A offering is or they don't know what a crowdfunding offering is.      So I think there is some element of investor education and further sort of maturity in these arenas that need to happen as well and in terms of secondary liquidity ever happening regardless of what the regulatory framework (inaudible) so I just want to put that out as an additional point.</p><p>      HANKS:  (Inaudible).  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Thank you very much.  Really fascinating to walk into this and I think as part of an ongoing dialogue and trying to catch up on this, completely persuaded on the side that this would be filling an important gap area in our economy, we see that the area that where access to capital is most needed is in that area like $1 million and below EBITDA.</p><p>      And so despite all of our efforts on SBA's side and to encourage investors to get more early-stage, more local we're still not meeting the markets.  So I think I'm very much persuaded by a uniform platform of information in order to try to put more vibrancy and predictability into this segment of the market.</p><p>      In terms of pre-emption, I really would like to defer to all of you.  My gut instinct is that there's something very inefficient about all 54 units trying to get to this uniformity, but hesitant to move in the pre-emption direction prematurely.  Thank you.</p><p>      HANKS:  So with that I think I'm going to put some thoughts together and we'll discuss this afternoon whether we move on with a recommendation on try and pull of these things together and see whether you agree with the way that I've summarized it.</p><p>      We're going to move on to discussion of the broker dealer status of finders and so thank you to Richard and Martin.  I really appreciate it.</p><p>      So moving on to the broker-dealer issue; we've talked many times about the finders issue, urging the commission to take steps to clarify the current ambiguity and broker-dealer regulation for people who act as intermediaries in private placements or find potential investors.</p><p>      And one of the reasons we care so much about this is the fact that to the extent a small company uses someone to help find capital and that person should have been registered as a broker-dealer and wasn't then that deal is -- by its nature resendable (ph), which is a terrible source of uncertainty for small companies to have to live with.  But they do it and they do it all the time and we've talked about this just because they are so desperately in need of capital.</p><p>      So the prior iteration of this committee made a recommendation to the commission along those lines, just before the committee was renewed in September 2015.  I think you've all got a copy of that on your -- at your desks.  Shout if you don't have it.</p><p>      Some of us were members of during the development of that recommendation and others have joined since then.  I would also note that the American Bar Association task force on private placement brokers has existed for some like 17 years now.  It's also urged clarity in this area with some progress; the broker, the M&amp;A broker no action position, which was very much appreciated, but there is still areas of significant uncertainty.</p><p>      Knowing the importance of this issue to so many of us, we wanted to do sort of bring him down to see whether we wanted to reissue this recommendation since we have a new chairman and senior leadership coming into the SEC, new Congress in session.</p><p>      It seems that if we're not satisfied with the status quote and I think -- I hope I am not jumping the gun in saying that many of us are not satisfied that we want to make sure that this is not overlooked.</p><p>      So with that, does anybody wants to reiterate some of that the points they've made and I don't know if we have our representatives from (inaudible); do you guys want to say anything?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's Joanne (ph) from Division of Trading Markets.  I know Steve Looperelo (ph), our former director spoke to last fall and he just pointed out that we totally hear you but there is also two competing regulatory concerns; one is capital formation and the other is the protection of investors, particularly retail investors.</p><p>      And so I think the one thing we would ask you as you go forward is to sort of address; if you could, the protections for the retail investors.  And with that I will here to answer your questions if we can.  Thank you.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'll be happy to speak.  Jenny, will you?</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      HANKS:  I think Jenny and then you.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I just had a quick question on the fourth point before the recommendation, it's say deal only with accredited investors but I don't think the recommendation actually says that.  So I personally would be very concerned about limiting this to people that deal only with accredited investors.  So I just wanted to see if we could get some clarity on that because it looks like it's in the preamble but not in the recommendation itself.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think the thinking those to the extent an exemption were to be developed then it would be appropriate to take the investor status into account but I'm interested to hear that.  And again, to answer Joanne's question, I mean to the extent we were to encourage a broker deal -- a limited broker-dealer exemption and it would not to have anything be dependent on the investor status as accredited or sophisticated; how would you protect the investor?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  This kind of goes back to our discussion about accredited and you know, whether the definition of accredited is actually protecting investors but I just think it's something we should think about.  I think limiting company -- you know, most of my clients -- I work with small businesses to raise money and most of my clients raise money from both accredited and unaccredited investors using usually under Rule 504 and state level exemptions.</p><p>      And I think if this recommendation only applies to companies raising money from accredited investors, I think it really limits the applicability to companies that I want to talk to more than just accredited investors.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Commissioner Stein I want to direct this to you particularly because I think this is -- at the commission level where this belongs.  We had -- as far as I'm concerned a very unsatisfactory conversation, Mr. Luperela (ph), at our last meeting.</p><p>      And as I told him, I think this is a worst case of bureaucratic waiting for (inaudible) I've ever seen.  They've been sitting on this for 16 years -- 16 or 17, I count 19, I don't know, but it's a long time.  And as obviously they are dissembling and wasting taxpayer time and I have no intention of ever moving on this that is the division of trading markets.  I don't know if that comes from the commissioner or not, but I do know this, that a tremendous amount of taxpayer time has been wasted on this.</p><p>      If they could have just say we're never going to act on this and we're just playing -- stringing you along, it would have been very, very helpful and we could have done something else or going to licked our wounds and forgotten about the idea.</p><p>      But instead we've had this constant teasing and even today we're hearing more from the division about what you want talk about, we understand your concerns -- I don't think they care about our concerns over there, frankly ma'am.  I think that you've got your own agenda and the public and the taxpayer be damned.</p><p>      And I have no -- as far as my recommendation for the division, I don't know how to speak to the commissioners but to the division, I'm trying to figure a recommendations and that's not obscene.  I mean, I am -- I am so frustrated with this, I don't think anybody over there really cares or pretending to be listening; and I am convinced that if anything is going to be done on this, it will come from Capitol Hill.</p><p>      HANKS:  Patrick if we could, I'm glad we skipped the bit about the obscene bid, so thank you for that.  But to addresses this, I mean I think there are some legitimate concerns when we see and we have raised this every time wet consent about the small companies who are absolutely desperate and there is this guy at the golf club who knows some folks and can introduce them.</p><p>      Do you have an answer to that, though, what if the guy at the golf club is like -- well, I know some folks and they were part of my Elks club or whatever and I know they are pretty rich.  What about investor protection?  Are we saying that we don't need it there or is there an alternative way that we can loop into this recommendation?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We've got the recommendations by the American Bar Association that promulgated 10 years -- roughly 10 years ago.  David Barton, over at Heritage Foundation recommendations.  I mean as far as I am concerned we don't need to tail that soil again, their recommendations and you can and get any number of -- I mean if you like for me to bring him to the next meeting?</p><p>      HANKS:  I think we actually have someone.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I mean I don't see why we need to put the metal horsepower and to making recommendations that will be ignored once again.  And I just -- you know, maybe bang my head against the wall for 16 years; I've decided it's time to stop.</p><p>      I mean I haven't been working on this for 16 years, but people have and I am not willing, frankly, to do anymore head banging.  I've given up, I'm completely dissatisfied that any regulatory action will ever be taken on this, 16 years is enough.</p><p>      HANKS:  I will know that a couple of the members of the ABA taskforce have celebrated the 80th birthdays while they were waiting for...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I know two of those lovely ladies.</p><p>      HANKS:  So nothing other than what's already in the record with respect to...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  What's already in the record; as I said to in that meeting; this topic has been studied as much as anything, but the Bible and the Torah, so it's time for action or just say we're not going to do anything.</p><p>      HANKS:  And saying we're not going to do anything that I think part of the problem; one of the reasons that we do keep circling back to this is that there is a certain amount of uncertainty -- there is at least one no action letter out there and we know that no action letters only apply to the specific pop star that they apply to.</p><p>      But to the extent there are still people out there relying on that and saying that statement is still out there that no action letter has not been withdrawn.  And there are people doing these deals and doing the golf club deals and one of the things that I have said is, we're at a point, it matters so much as what the answer is but just that there is an answer.</p><p>      And then make a point that I've made before as well.  It's not fair on the guys who are playing by the rules.  That there are some -- and for my own industry, the online capital formation industry, there are electronic platforms who are not playing by the rules.</p><p>      And then I've got clients saying well they get away with it and nobody is arrested.  And to the extent some -- and I was explaining, well, the SEC doesn't have handcuffs because they are a civil agency; they don't have the right to do that, but as long as they keep saying nobody's been arrested for doing that, you're going to have this dichotomy waived.</p><p>      You've got the guys who are playing by the rules and paying for it, and the guys who are kind of getting away with it; everyone is saying there is nothing out there.  So certainty, even if it's bad certainty to certain extent is helpful, but that's just my own opinion.  I'd be interested to note who else in the room would like even bad certainly.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  A quick question and going back to the whole question of state dialogue; even if there was certainty at the federal level wouldn't we still have to deal with...</p><p>      HANKS:  You're absolutely right.  I mean to the extent to go about to another discussion, to the extent there's no pre-emption and I don't see it.  I'm one of the things that we've seen again in the online communities; some people saying well those platforms have there no action letters, but we, state regulators, that's just their silly federal thing, we don't recognize it.</p><p>      And as far in state acts; as far as we're concerned, there is still broker-dealers, so we do have uncertainty at the state level as well.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, that happened with the company called Profounder in California, I remember that.</p><p>      HANKS:  It was California and not the Fed CTM.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Exactly.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  When I think about this, you know, how we're defining the difference is between someone who provides names versus someone who sells the transaction, right?  A broker dealer sells a transaction, a finder simply introduces.</p><p>      HANKS:  It depends which side of the interpretation you fall on. I mean there are some folks would say anybody who brings together buyers and sellers of securities and takes money for doing that is going to be a broker-dealer.  Even if the compensation is not derived or calculated on the basis of the amount of security solved.</p><p>      There are some people who say, so long as it is not a transaction-based compensation, then they say it's not a broker- dealer, but I don't think anyone has ever agreed that.  And so you get a wide range of interpretations at both federal and state level.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But how much is the issuer responsible for ensuring that the information is provided in that -- they're accredited; that kind of thing.  I mean that really comes on down the issue at that point; after that point, right?</p><p>      HANKS:  The issue has got a whole bunch of things to worry about including if I raise money by using a non-registered broker-dealer who should have been registered, that transaction could be rescinded.  And so you've got a put hanging over your head forever.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The visions position also is if a lawyer participates with a run registered broker, the lawyers violate the securities laws too.  So the fact is they are separating the business person from his or her lawyer.</p><p>      HANKS:  Anyone in favor of more certainty even if it's wrong or -- because we keep making the recommendations -- and it would be nice if we could sort of move this ahead in some way?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm struggling with this, not because I don't think we should move ahead with it.  I'm struggling because I think about the situations in which someone gets introduced or hears about the opportunity to invest in something and -- I mean it's going to happen and, you know, it's -- when I think about the private investor market; if there is a great deal of it, that is to say formalized, but there is still a lot of unformalized capital out there.</p><p>      So I think we should put -- I think this puts some structure around that unformalized capital, that's why I like it.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  (inaudible)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's really hard sitting next to Patrick sometimes. But...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I noticed it may be closer to the door.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But overall and I think it -- I feel like we have opened Pandora's Box and we have really animated debates regarding a lot of the issues that have come out and even when I am going back to the Midwest, and talking to people; it's like well you have to do this, this is what the rules are.</p><p>      But we need to make sure that there is something -- that something moves forward, that we move the needle off zero.  We have to take action and it needs to be though collaborative, you can't have a mom versus dad.  Well, here is how I'm going to interpret this because this works better for us.  Here is how I'm going to interpret this.</p><p>      And versus you know, what's the worst that could happen?  In only hurts if you get caught.  We need to make sure that you know, are we playing the protectionism in too far and making so much, but not being able to work together to achieve our goal.</p><p>      And at the same time I think we've really shifted on what is our actual goal?  Is it fully a regulatory and here is what we want to do so that things fit into our funnel or we looking at what the markets are out there and what entrepreneurs and small businesses are actually defining as the new way of doing business and how they need to achieve that capital and get business done.</p><p>      And I think that kind of lead us into our debate later this afternoon, but I want to see -- there needs to be a movement somewhere.</p><p>      HANKS:  Which direction would you like the movement to be?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So that it works better for our companies.  And that would be my answer.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      HANKS:  I vote in favor of workability.  Ann Marie (ph), since you go to background in the broker industry?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't know that I'm qualified to comment on what team colleague said, but I'd probably agree with her.</p><p>      HANKS:  And then it just -- one of the questions is whether we would -- whether and to what extent we wanted to reissue the comments that we made in September with respect to getting some -- get behind as reduced -- reducing ambiguity, but the question then is; in what direction does that -- does the reduction in ambiguity go?</p><p>      One of the things that I've said is even having the wrong answer, at least it's an answer and it gives us some certainty.  What are your feelings on that?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, you know, we've talked that this as a committee.  Patrick is very passionate about the subject and...</p><p>      HANKS:  He reiterated his passion.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I heard it.  It's very worthwhile listening to.  </p><p>      I think the fact is that I was -- and that you were talking about Mr. Luprello (ph) as I left the room.  I was disappointed in his answer to the committee we're talking about that.  I think that we know that there is bad practices in the market, we know that there are people who don't understand the rules, we know there are platforms out there that are not registered and following the rules in a way that makes sense to me.</p><p>      So I think I would definitely like to see the SEC take more specific action in the context of finders and platforms involved in primary and secondary transactions that may not be registered broker- dealers, you've got some no action letters out there from treating in markets to certain platforms that are helpful but potentially not being followed by the rest of the market.  So maybe more obvious disclosure efforts -- sorry, more obvious enforcement efforts to the extent -- you know, necessary no Patrick feels like there is not enough enforcement, obvious enforcement in this space.</p><p>      I really do worry about companies hiring people to help them find capital and then not having that debt in a way that's consistent with the security's laws; that's not good for the investors and not the market.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I agree with you Sarah that having nothing sends the message that if you I have no enforcement to Patrick's perspective for looking the other way, it sends the message that it's really not an important regulation.  It's really not relevant.</p><p>      So I am of the point that if we have something out there we probably should -- we can't selectively apply, right?  You can't selectively enforce because if you do that exists down a hole in another rabbit hole, so let's get off the bucket.      HANKS:  And any thoughts in what this initiative would look like and do we still -- do you still agree with the some of the things said out in the 2015 letter?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, personally no but I'm willing to say let's go, let's just -- let's do something.  I think we all don't agree with everything all the time and so it's just -- if -- I don't really understand why this is happening and -- so I just want to register out there, the fact that if we don't do something, that sends a message out there to people to take the risk.</p><p>      And so therefore by again non-action, we're creating the environment, we're creating the environment.  And if we are OK with that, I know we're not happy with that, but if we are -- if we accept the consequences of non-action then we need to be prepared down the line (inaudible).</p><p>      HANKS:  OK.  So if I were to -- it's kind of difficult to summarize because it's clear that not everybody agrees with the exact specifications in the 2015, but if we were to say that we would like greater certainty and that certainly could take a number of different shapes, including compliance and disclosure typing initiatives, answers to Q&amp;As.</p><p>      I mean -- I think there -- not to put words into the mouth of the TNM guys,  but I think there has always been this some -- well, there is a slippery slope here and if we let this happen then what happens next?  But Q&amp;A type interpretations of who is a broker and who isn't might be tremendously helpful, even if it doesn't go as far as no action letter.</p><p>      All right, that seems like a very innocent sort of thing to encourage and also to encourage that the staff also took to the states because one of the things that we are seeing -- we see this in the Reg A field.  We see for example, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Dakota have completely different interpretations of the dealer requirements. And so some kind of coordination at that level as well would be tremendously helpful.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It sounds like we're kind of talking about a speed limit issue aren't we.  Like what's the speed limit in your city or on a highway in New York City (ph)?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I have no idea.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Like 65?  Do they give you five miles an hour, do they give you 10 miles an hour or 15?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  My cousin's a state trooper, so I get a little bit...</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it's six because just for the margin of error.      (UNKNOWN):  And so -- you know, what is the actual rule in -- what is the actual speed limit and what actually gets enforced are sometimes diverse and sometimes -- I actually think you're getting your answer, Patrick.</p><p>      I love you, but I think what I am hearing is that the SEC is saying, well, this is the speed limit, but we might give you five, we might give you 10 over, but at the same point in time don't be a jerk about it otherwise we might come down and pull you over and give you a ticket.</p><p>      HANKS:  I'm not sure that we do have a speed limit even with the Anne-Marie rider.  And I think that's the problem.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And that and applying private litigation.</p><p>      HANKS:  And I think that is a really good point, I mean in private litigation this is what's hanging over the heads of small companies is; you do a deal that was put together by the dude at the golf club who knows some guys.  And then it turns out that that was really bad investment.</p><p>      And so what happens is a plaintiff's lawyer gets hold of it and goes OK, we are going to get your money back because that was a broker-dealer and he wasn't registered.  And that's what hangs over the heads of small companies all the time.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sarah, I mean what I was looking at is the document that Greg sent -- e-mailed this evening.  I couldn't be here.</p><p>      HANKS:  That's the ABA one?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So, it means what we are doing is we're classifying people to be intermediaries by making an introduction, and if they disclose or form -- or they're acting as an intermediary they are not selling and that the issuer says, you know, I understand this that this person is not selling and that these people that I am being introduced to are accredited investors.</p><p>      I will not take anyone, but accredited investors.  What's the problem because they are not selling, they are acting as -- and if we define immediary (ph) and intermediary, if someone who does not sell, does not provide the PPM, does not provide -- you know, then that person all they are doing is an introduction.</p><p>      HANKS:  All right, which is what we -- but we can't define the law and the guys who do interpret that the regulations are the guys we need the guidance from.  And that's one of the things that we were encouraging is this sort of limited purpose introductory.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I mean I -- that's what I'm thinking is, just what we've done here to me works fine because we're just -- we're just putting structure so let's define it.  Let's have a form.</p><p>      HANKS:  And anybody against a rewrite of recommendation -- that be one of the courses that we would like to see from trading markets.      (UNKNOWN):  And to abstain from any further action from a regulatory standpoint on this.</p><p>      HANKS:  Even if it's good action?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sixteen years of good action.</p><p>      HANKS:  Anyone else wanted to weigh in on the form that I captured?  That's the one that was circulated from (inaudible).  That would at least be something.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'd like to get the SEC's opinion on what that letter -- what they would do if a case came in front of them and somebody had the exemption letter that was referred to in the document?</p><p>      HANKS:  I'm sorry, I'm not sure we've seen that, but I think that there is a vehicle for requesting no action or an exemptive order if you want some regulatory certainty, some clarity.  So there are established processes if this is something you'd like to pursue.</p><p>      This is the -- I think it's from the ABA recommendations that you're looking at that.  But it's right at the moment.  So I mean I think the answer is, this is -- that's just a privately produced piece of paper and then if you took that to the SEC and said, if we did this, would it be OK?  Then I think the appropriate action would be to request no actual position.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      HANKS:  Which I received on a case-by-case basis and only apply to the people they received to.  And we would like it to go a little further from that.  Anyone else on the brokers?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm wondering what the reaction was when -- you know, to the recommendations that were made by the ABA.  What was the response?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think this is going back, but it contemplate a limit purpose registration scheme without the participation.  And the question is then, who monitors, who examines?  We, right now, are taking on all the investment advisory industry, so we're little short on resources.</p><p>      So it's a question of you bringing folks in, we're putting additional regulatory burns on the SEC and we don't really have a lot of resources; you know, quite apart from the merits, you know, what you might think on particular point?  I think I was saying that Steve had told the folks from the ABA last summer.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Maybe again -- I'll analogize again to Title 3 of the Jobs Act; there is this new type of entity that is not a full broker- dealer, but it's regulated by FINRA.  You know, maybe that could be a solution that you know we have this limited type of registration, that's not a full broker-dealer, but it's a finder and it does become a member of FINRA, but with much more limited regulation.  I would support that.      HANKS:  A limited purpose broker-dealer and in fact...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right, similar to that (inaudible) portals.</p><p>      HANKS:  And you would of course need regulations to create that both with at the SEC and FINRA.  And also you would need -- I mean one of the things that we should point out -- some of those Title 3 crowdfunding platforms is; this one is bitten the dust for regulatory reasons already.  So there is a regulatory burden and keeping an eye on those folks.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, I'm not one to create more regulation, but I think that -- I agree with Jenny there.  I think that would be a good solution, but there is also the idea of -- when somebody doesn't do it; I mean are they being reserved, are there consequences for that. It sounds like there is quite a few transactions that are considered securities transactions that are not being monitored regulation as imposed on those.</p><p>      HANKS:  Does anyone else have any other questions or comments on the (inaudible).  I just want to say thank you guys for coming by and I know this is the typical Washington poly (ph) game of lining people up and yelling at them.</p><p>      And we want say thank you very much for coming back and hearing us and hopefully we don't take it personally but we do appreciate what you're doing.  But you hear us, I mean we want some certainty here.</p><p>      Thank you everybody.  We are now going to adjourn until 1:45. And we will be talking then about why more companies are staying private.  Thank you.</p><p>      (RECESS)</p><p>      HANKS:  OK.  Thanks and welcome back everybody.  Sorry for the delay to those of you on the webinar, we had bit of a technical problem.  So we're now going to talk about why more companies are staying private or try and answer that question,</p><p>      There was an interesting article in the January 6th Wall Street Journal focused on the lower number of U.S. IPOs over the last decade and calling the -- referring to a gusher of private capital.  We all know plenty of small companies that would love to benefit from this gusher of small capital and who are not seeing it probably but it's absolutely true that the decrease in the number of companies going public is no news to any of us.</p><p>      The article talked about several possible theories as to why the private markets have proven more attractive in recent years, the companies that traditionally would have been candidates for an IPO.  I am pretty sure everybody here has got their own thoughts on the topic and we'll be discussing those.  But it's definitely a topic that we want to discuss in depth and further, and see what the trends are that are influencing companies decisions to stay private.</p><p>      We're going to hear from three separate presenters, each of whom has extremely relevant experience in this area.  I don't know if this is the order you're going in, but it's order I've got.  So is James Hutchinson or Jamie, a partner in the private equity group of the law firm Goodwin Procter, as well as a member of Goodwin's technology and emerging companies FinTech and impact on responsible investing practice.</p><p>      Jamie has extensive experience advising funds in the portfolio companies in a wide variety of transactions.  He has been a key contributor to his firm's online resources for start-ups, emerging companies and the entrepreneurial community.</p><p>      Next we have Glen Giovannoni of the Global Life Sciences Leader at accounting from Ernst &amp; Young.  He has close to 30 years of experience with Ernst &amp; Young, at the majority serving clients in the biotech and medical device industries.  He has extensive experience -- sorry, he published a blog in response to the Wall Street Journal article I mentioned earlier which we will have.  So I look forward to hearing his thoughts on the topic.</p><p>      And finally, we welcome Yanev Suissa, founder of SineWave Ventures.  Yaniv was formally with the large VC firm New Enterprise Associates, where he focused on early-stage investments in tech and energy companies.  He also helped form the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program, where he was engaged in the underwriting of billions of dollars of debt for estimates to companies within the energy technology industry.</p><p>      And please take it from here.  Is it Jamie, you first or...</p><p>      HUTCHINSON:  Glenn's got it.</p><p>      HANKS:  Alright, Glenn, thank you.</p><p>      GIOVANNONI:  Well, thank you and thanks to the entire committee for the invitation, it's great to here.  We're hopeful we can -- we catalyze some good discussion; we were talking earlier, I mean I'm sure there is a definitive answer on this, but we'll put forth some ideas.  And thank you for promoting the blog, that was a bit of a coincidence.</p><p>      I read that same article heading out to the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference every year in San Francisco, kind of kicks off the year for life science companies; and sat there and said, really 30 percent your public companies; that can't be the case in biotech.  And I think what explore today is it, you know, biotech is obviously only one small part of the entire economy and it may be the exception that proves the rule for firm certain unique attributes of that of the particular sector.</p><p>      And in fact, what I was pointing out the blog was that the number of publicly listed biotech companies is up 40 percent over the same period of time.  So the trend has actually reversed, but we'll explore it, the broader issues and answers if there is some relevance from biotech, I'll introduce that.</p><p>      I thought what I do is -- start just with some bigger picture context setting and run through just a number of the data charge test hopefully help inform structure around it and then will dive into some of the real specific issues around this question of why are more staying staying private.  And we've had a chance to talk a little bit ahead of the session so little bit -- hopefully Jamie will be in everywhere so.  And of course please stop us any point, we don't need to make presentation -- we're have to entertain questions.  </p><p>      So what's here and maybe a little hard to see the distance. There were a couple of academic studies that spurred some of this media coverage.  This particular one I think was actually quoted in a Bloomberg story about six months before the Wall Street Journal picked up the story there in early January.  And you know, coming on the fact that we've seen this significant decrease in the number of publicly traded companies and looking at why.</p><p>      And (inaudible) so summarize some of the data from that study itself, just in 10 year blocks.  So their data when through 2012; so it's a little bit dated.  But you can kind of see some of the trend here of the rise in public companies up until 1995 and then a decrease.  </p><p>      Since then and just pictorially, the green bars here are the number of IPOs.  The grey bars are the number of M&amp;A transactions where companies effectively delisted a transaction, and the red are our delisting's for a cause, right?  Which you see were pretty significant leading up to and late 90s leading up to the sort of the dotcom frenzy of quite a few IPOs.  And even in the decade after and they've diminished a bit; so we can argue whether it is positive or negative, but I think the number of companies going public today are less likely to be delisted.  There a little bit more substantial, they been private a little longer, they probably have a little more capital right.</p><p>      So you know, I think it's person fair to say maybe they are more sustainable than say the average company that was listing in the late 90s.  The next slide is just to make the point; I've got a couple of slides on this, but quickly we want to look at this from the standpoint of -- is this is a U.S. phenomenon, a global phenomenon, you know what's happening here where we have a delisting -- or not delisting I'm sorry, but a decrease in the number listed companies.</p><p>      This slide is not very interesting because the data didn't change very much, but basically what it says is 90 percent plus that 94 percent last year of IPOs happen on domestic exchanges, only six percent are cross-border.</p><p>      And then if you say, well the U.S. have a particular problem, because certainly listings arts or going quite a rapid in many exchanges around the world.  Does U.S. have a problem or when companies choose to list cross-border, they come here is what the take away here is.  The yellow bar a number of foreign private issuers coming to the U.S. and you can see the other markets; how they compare.</p><p>      So it suggests that we don't have some unique problem where our companies are finding their way to go public in other places and that sort of capped up on this slide which shows that in 2016 the only two U.S. companies chose to list exclusively overseas.  So they may have -- there may be other, there is quite a few others who probably want to do list but they are also listed, not a primary list here.</p><p>      You know, a handful of year saw, there is another market for me. I'm not going to choose a here in the U.S.  So then more to what's going on with private companies.  This is data from venture source, and I'd direct you to the yellow line there and the grey line towards the bottom.  Those represent seed and first round; so by translation I guess company formations rate over the last many years.</p><p>      And the numbers you can't read there on the right are you know running around last several years, 15 to 1,800 venture-backed companies created.  So that's sort that sort of the inflow of likely IPO candidates not exclusively but earnings go public because family owned businesses, non-venture backed companies can make the way to the public market but this is a pretty big indication of the funnel.  And we see since we kind of created after the dotcom frenzy back to the beginning of the 2000's, with a little hiccup there around the financial crisis.</p><p>      There has been a relatively steady climb up, so it's not necessarily that the funnel is not there for companies that you know, would otherwise choose to seek an IPO.  The IPOs haven't increased at the same pace and that's a large part of the reason we're having this conversation, we'll get into the more larger -- some of the larger dynamics the way that is but you can see IPOs prior to 2000 were running at 400 or 500 a year.</p><p>      Since the financial crisis you know we're in the 200 to 300 depending on -- I'm sorry, since the -- sort of dotcom highs and the recovery there in the 200 to 300 IPOs a year, last year was quite a bit lower than that.  And so there has been a different bar set relative to the number of IPOs.  And what we're experiencing is that companies are staying private longer.</p><p>      Now the company that gets through is represented by these numbers and gets public, probably is a little bit more substantial in terms of it's time to grow as a private company, perhaps a little better financed and sent -- hence received fewer of the delisting's.  This is the same data, I won't go over that -- it excludes the foreign private issuers; this is just purely U.S.  company is going public on U.S. exchanges.</p><p>      And then you know, the other -- the other way companies disappear is they get bought of course, and this data is from dialogic (ph) and its acquisitions of all private companies; venture backed, not venture backed by strategic investors, by PE or financial investors, it's kind of an all in numbers.</p><p>      So it's maybe not right on point relative to the population of companies that may go public but it gives you an indication that we're in a robust M&amp;A environment, and have been for quite some time as the industries are consolidating and we see that at the top end with the Fortune 500 in terms of -- pardon me, the amount of revenue and assets, and the economy they control is also a trend of greater externalization for larger companies looking for innovation and be willing to buy it.</p><p>      So there is an awful lot of deal activity that -- you know, these are companies that otherwise may have matriculated to the public market that better acquired while private.</p><p>      Another cut of the data, much smaller numbers; these are the same dataset but deals over $100 million.  So this is the group of companies that might have been IPO-ready if you want to think about it that way relative to the market cap, you know, whether that's 100 or up to $300 million to $400 million takeout price.</p><p>      So you know, if you're looking at a couple of hundred in a year on the IPO side, there is double that number of private companies that otherwise may have considered an IPO that are selling in M&amp;A transactions.</p><p>      This is just for your information, the number of publicly traded companies that are coming out -- this isn't really germane to the private company story, this is existing public companies that are being acquired, and you can see that while it's pretty steady, it's actually quite a bit lower, more of that acquisition activity have been much earlier in the decade and even into the late 1990s.</p><p>      So that kind of leads us to the question today of -- you know, why our company is staying more private and/or staying private longer? And not to be flipped but the kind of short answer we come up with this because they can and we'll talk about what's behind all of that but if you look on the left hand side, you know, why would I go public?</p><p>      That list there is the common reasons, the companies would have pursued a public offering; number one, their business model really requires it.  Right, that they have a highly capital intensive business model, they need to access capital to grow their business and public markets, typically -- historically, have been provided a lower cost of capital, we can argue with if that's still the case with all the private money out there.</p><p>      They need public currency to do acquisitions, they are looking for liquidity for their founders, for their investors.  Importantly, when we talk about tech and biotech companies for their employees; although Jamie also some stuff to say about that because he has part of creating alternatives for private companies in that respect.</p><p>      And they just want brand identity, you know, that comes from being a public company.  I would say there is one here a particular that's more biotech focused; when we get over on the right side, you know many companies are staying private because there is this gusher of private capital to Sarah's comment from the article.</p><p>      There is there is an unprecedented amount of private capital out there, it's not finding its way everywhere; the kinds of private capital that is going into some of the large technology companies in multi-billion dollar rounds -- if we go back to the biotech example for a minute, very few if any investors are going to write that kind of a check for a biotech company and wait five years and turnover a card and see if they got a drug or not, right.</p><p>      It just doesn't fit -- the financing model doesn't fit the business model and that's one of the reasons we see biotech companies go public.  They not only need the capital, they need a wider shareholder base; right, that's sort of publicly traded stock provides them.</p><p>      So on the why stay private?  You know the biggest issue is because they can, there is lots of capital out there, right, and if you can avail yourself to that capital and instead of a reasonable valuation it's not such a large haircut from one of public market might give you than you can still grow your business, your -- it's not as dilutive as it may have been at one point in time and certainly with -- you know, there is new pools of capital; the amount of capital, the pool is coming from and the evaluations; I think we've seen that to a large degree.</p><p>      And then it sort of insulates you from what's the rest of the list there, right.  So obviously as a public company, a lot more infrastructure needed for disclosure and regulatory compliance, some perception of this was brought up in The Wall Street Journal Article about disclosure leading to loss of competitive advantage, especially for technology companies trying to build something new.</p><p>      Just a general lack of operating flexibility or lower operating flexibility when you're public and you have investors that are much more focused on short-term quarterly profits, and your business model might be one off -- long-term growth and world domination in a particular category, right, that dichotomy.</p><p>      And then a variety of other -- you know, just the risk of being a public company subject to activists and short-sellers and shareholder lawsuits and alike.  So, you know, we really have factors foreign against but the answer that we will set up here and I'll pass the baton here to Jamie is because they can live.</p><p>      HUTCHINSON:  Again, switch some slides.  So again, I'm Jamie Hutchinson, I'm a partner in Goodwin's Private Equity and tech practice units.  We do a lot of work representing emerging stage companies and the folks that invest in them.</p><p>      And we've actually kind of had a front row seat over the -- about the past decade to what we kind of call the large-cap growth equity. So a lot of the very big rounds into the high-profile tech companies, sort of the unicorn set, and a lot of those transactions come with some interesting dynamics including secondary pieces.</p><p>      And so that the press has written a little bit about private IPOs which I think is not a good -- it's probably a misnomer but there are certainly a different type of transaction, much larger than had secondary liquidity and we've sort of had a front row seat to that. So I think we should be able to give some ideas of why this is happening.</p><p>      So -- and certainly, during this presentation we're going to jump in and if anybody has questions and want to jump in and draw down on the stuff, you should do that, it can make it more interesting.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      HUTCHINSON:  Yes, I've noted.  I've seen that over the years Ann- Marie.  So here is the summary of some of the reasons; there is large amounts of private capital and it's really on a global level.  It's not just the U.S.  anymore.  Employees don't demand a company go public; there is -- there are alternatives to liquidity now that there weren't in the past.</p><p>      Early investors don't need an IPO and maybe even want an IPO. The idea of a clean exit is something that can be particularly appealing to closed-end funds that have a lifespan.  Certain securities laws become more flexible, especially the 500 charter rule moving to 2,000 shareholders of record.</p><p>      There is a new generation of entrepreneurs that have a different set of priorities and you know, this is perhaps the case now, maybe than in a different way historically, and we've had direct interaction with a lot of these folks and they think of the world differently, and maybe it's a millennial thing, but there -- you know, I think we're all seeing in the market, particularly the companies that are going public, there are focus -- the focus is on things like control, maybe then immediate sort of wealth creation, changing the world, winning the space, things like that.</p><p>      There is negative -- this is negative press phenomena that can occur with public companies, and we'll drilldown onto that a little bit.  So cash as the new acquisition currency is shocking, but debts cheap and a lot of companies, both public and private are able to tap very deep pools of debt financing to do M&amp;A where in the past it might have been best done with a public company security.</p><p>      M&amp;A equal's innovation, strategies are serial acquirers and they do that to continue to innovate.  And they are affected by, not only the cash they have on the balance sheet, but their ability to tap into cheap debt.  The high cost of being a public company or perhaps keeping folks from moving towards an IPO; and then there's sort of other set of pitfalls that we'll touch on.</p><p>      So first the large amounts of private capital; so the capital is coming from different places, then maybe was historically the case. VC funds themselves, many have gotten bigger and their investment mandates have expanded where maybe in the 80s, 90s, even the early 2000's it was -- VCs were really doing early-stage start-up type investing; now their mandates are really across the spectrum from early-stage to late-stage.</p><p>      The traditional private equity funds; buyout funds the (inaudible), the KKRs, they did not historically focus on minority deals; deals that they didn't have control and that has changed substantially.  Firms like Silver Lake investing in Zinga and Alibaba taking minority positions; TPG and these are all publicly available; TPG and Airbnb and Uber.  KKR just announced a growth equity funds.</p><p>      So these are really traditional buyout shops that are moving into growth equity and have deep pools of capital, corporate venture capital, Google ventures, Dell ventures; they are out there and investing heavily and that's sort of a new and different source of capital over the past decade.</p><p>      Hedged funds, so you know some people refer them as crossover funds, historically, hedge funds would invest in public securities. They were open-ended funds and they were structured in a way that having the liquidity of public securities kind of meshed with their structures, but that is no longer the case.  A lot of the big hedge funds, Tiger Global, for example, has been extraordinary successful and extraordinary active, investing all over the world into private companies.</p><p>      The sovereign wealth funds; they have and over the past sort of five to ten years; well, historically they would invest as LP's in the big venture and private equity funds and they sort of have come around based on their expertise may be doing that to build their own infrastructure, they build their own investment teams and they are able to make direct investments.</p><p>      GIC, Thomasic, the Saudi Fund that recently invested in Uber; the Abu Dhabi fund that's invested in Spotify (ph); you know, there is a long list of the sovereign wealth funds no longer being passive investors in private equity and venture but investing directly.  And they have very deep pools in their super-patient investors, so it's added things to the market.</p><p>      Mutual fund complexes; so one of the things in the Wall Street Journal article that mentioned how the average investor doesn't sort of get access to these fast-growing sort of unicorn companies and you know, as I was reading that I was thinking well, that's actually not true.</p><p>      I suspect a lot of people in this room have 401(k)s in mutual funds and through the public filings and a lot of -- you've seen it in the press, the big mutual fund complexes are one of the most active investors in private companies these days, and they too are very large pools of capital and they are very patient to different model.  They don't have an end to their fund life.</p><p>      So that -- and we'll talk a bit more about that because that has been a really dramatic shift that sort of changed things, particularly with shareholder liquidity.  And then family offices; just like the sovereign wealth funds, they've build infrastructure to direct invest. Gates, that (inaudible) network, the founder of eBay, folks like that are now out there making direct investments.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Essentially we're going through is and might have been; I would also note that these are not all smart investors in the venture space and what I mean by that is not that they are not smart people but that these business models that they have historically been in are not the same business model as venture, right.</p><p>      We are not typical finance; I do not do ratios on a daily basis, I do not write where building teams, building strategies, building technologies, innovating, often being a personal counsellor; or quite frankly, and a recruiter.  And you have all these guys moving in and I think they all have different motivations.</p><p>      So for the big banks and funds and the more financial folks you have a phenomenon since the recession where people whether it's true or not, people believed that the public markets are not a place to make money or not place to make money safely, and you do have this phenomenon of it's hard to get in, so there must be something special about this that the small group of people of access to the set of special deals that you need to be in.</p><p>      And there is a definite like you need to be in it mentality, right.  If you're not in Facebook, you're not a relevant investor in the technology space, regardless of whether you think Facebook is a good company or not, right.  And so similar for every other -- a lot of other big tech companies.</p><p>      So that's where the banks come from; for the sovereign wealth funds we've seen a phenomenon where technology and innovation as you guys know has been promoted much more, more in the press as a way to -- and venture for that matter as a way to grow jobs right.</p><p>      And learner skills had built businesses and build economies, and a lot of sovereign wealth funds are doing this not just to make money, but because they believe that having access to the understanding of these tech companies will then give them the ability to bring that technology to their country.</p><p>      This is particularly relevant among the Middle East sovereign funds, where they say, we're going to invest in this because we want you to build an office here and train our people to do this.  So I think -- and then, and families are similar; there is also this phenomenon I don't want to pay managers fees, I just want to go at it directly because I think I am just as smart, right.</p><p>      And so I am going to go out all these things that I really know nothing about it and keep going.  And I do think that that's a dangerous phenomenon, more generally, maybe not relevant to the going public point that were talking about today but you are seeing this change.  I think so all the really smart ones came in early, they realized -- because they are smart, that they didn't know what they were doing and they've pulled back significantly.</p><p>      And then you have the second tier of just as smart, maybe not as smart people coming in and it will continue to kind of move that direction until people realize it really is a different game, and unless they are really focused on it and understand it, they are really just playing with fire.</p><p>      So I think that's part of this dynamic.  It's not -- it's a reaction to hey, we as financial institutions are not making money right now and so we need to -- and everyone's asking us like why aren't you making money?  Why aren't you in this so we need to do something.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And to your point on sort of the -- not wanting to pay fees; we see these things that we call rifle-shot funds; so it's like a managed account almost where big investors will aggregate money; it might be led by a brand-name VC, but they will set up site, it looks just like a venture fund, feels like a venture fund, it's got a GP, it's got LPs, but invest in a single asset, a rifle-shot into one company.</p><p>      Goldman kind of kicked that office in some respects when it did a big common round in Facebook and brought in a bunch of their investors in a special purpose vehicle.  So we're seeing that phenomenon too with some of this new money that doesn't want to pay fees but will -- once they co-invest alongside of some of the more traditional investors.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And in that case, once step is on the IPO?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, right.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Just one -- maybe a question or comment; (inaudible) was saying because I agree with -- you know, one thing to keep in mind is where do we think we are largely in this wave of private capital. So we're on the second wave and you know, many of these unicorns will make it no value to what but someone right and so where does not sort of app flow occur?</p><p>      And if you go back to one-slide showed about venture-backed company formation.  There is a bolus of companies that are now three or four years into their venture stage development and so one of the dynamics on the pure IPO account could be -- A) that we see a little bit less of this gusher of private money and we've got a whole load of IPO ready companies.</p><p>      So you these things ban, right -- they come, they have inflow with the couple availability.  And so can you guys talk, you guys keep on talking about discussion of private capital into small businesses or discussions of private capital in emerging businesses; what's the average check size attire global rights to a company?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I suspect it's not less than $100 million.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  What would be the small check-size that a mutual fund would write to a company?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, I suspect it's not less than $100 million, maybe $50 million.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I would just caution putting all those companies in the same bag and saying that all of this money just is going into -- the market is awash with capital because there is well over 100,000 small businesses in this country and you're talking about dozens if not hundreds of deals.</p><p>      So the amount -- the check size in terms of gross stage private equity; so the check size is huge, the number of deal size is smaller. I mean we were just talking on the earlier session, you weren't here but you know, venture is about $50 billion a year right now; Angel is about $25 billion a year right now; and $75 billion a year right now; the lottery is a $65 billion a year business.</p><p>      So I would -- I just I guess I take issue with that because I speak with thousands of entrepreneurs were capital start.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, can I make few quick comments to that.  So I will tell you -- there are VCs competing with certain one of these names, I'm not going to -- names that you would have no idea we're doing seed deals and that is, and when entrepreneur has to choose between a VC, who knows how to get there ownership and someone who doesn't because they are just taking dips on something, we're just spreading money or just trying to please investors who think they should be in the private markets, it's a different game, right.</p><p>      And I will also say there are -- so I think a phenomenon that happened with the recession and they say I don't know which companies you know and this is going to sound horribly arrogant, but there are a lot of companies that shouldn't be companies out there.  Like -- so when the recession happened, you saw a huge surge in the word entrepreneurship, let alone people who wanted to be entrepreneurs because they got fired.</p><p>      My friends got fired from their jobs in the law firms and the banks and the consulting firms and OK, great, we're young and risky and with all this stuff we'll start a company and it's exciting and it's cool and we'll do that.  And money is pouring into companies that wouldn't.</p><p>      I think if you -- and this maybe comes from my background or where I invest from, but if you really look at -- if you had to go through and everyone has their own opinion; if you were to go to and say which one of these companies that are getting funding period actually should be; the answer is probably very high that they shouldn't be.  And so I do think there is that phenomenon going on as well.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  What would you decide a company that should get funding?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, so when you invest in a company, right, you're looking for a particular return...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  What would your return be?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think that phenomenon has been permitted (inaudible) and most VCs when they answer this question because they have to have an answer even if it's not true.  Too often say that we're almost guaranteed a 3X and yet have the potential for like 50X.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And so how many start-ups would you actually talk to before you actually come across one of those deals?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think most -- it depends on the firm and where you're looking but most the big VCs will probably look at at least 200 companies and maybe invest in one of those.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So it's 0.5 percent of the companies that you look like actually get funding that you think you have a reasonable chance of getting a 50X return on?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So for every 200 companies?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You know, it depends on the firm and where you're looking but most the big VCs will probably look at least 200 companies; and maybe invest in one of those.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So it's 0.5 percent of the companies that you look like actually get funding that you think you have a reasonable chance of getting a 50X return on.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So for every 200 companies -- for every 200 CEOs or entrepreneurs that out there that are actually interested in capitalizing the company, about 0.5 percent of them actually do.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right.  But what I -- when I say the one out of the 200, I mean the 199 shouldn't have the capital or they should form a different form of capital.  So what I'm -- you know, I'm coming about this from venture money, there is other money out there that might be looking for different kind of motive but or return profile.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  May I shift gears here for a minute since you jumped in.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Not it's good, really good.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So will you think about the rate of innovation; when you look at the rate of innovation, you know, maybe even 10 or 20 year segments; you know how much of the capital that's pouring in is more a reflection of the opportunity because of the greater rate of innovation?  Is that something to considered or is now I'm off-base?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  More investable opportunities.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, because of the rate of innovation, it's not -- I keep thinking; I started my firm 15 years ago and I think about the companies we had to invest in, quality companies we had to invest in. And here in the United States but I'm seeing it all over the world now, it's very different.</p><p>      I mean, I went to The Netherlands and I walked away looking at some companies I thought we're very enough great opportunities and (inaudible) is a good example of that too.  So it's not just -- some not talk about the rate of innovation and I've seen in the past 15 years there is much more robust than I think it was 15-20 years ago, other a dotcom.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, I absolutely agree with that.  And I think you just -- I know where -- we've kind of degenerate a little bit into like -- where is all the money coming from but I do think that's the reason that it is if we go back to the bigger topic, right, that there are more opportunities; I mean they are growing and they are out there but they are still not -- regardless of whether they are getting financing or not, they are still not turning to the public markets.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)      (UNKNOWN):  You know, different than MySpace where it's a lot of capital intensity, a lot of the innovative companies have a really asset light kind of model with (inaudible) you're in software you can avail yourself to cloud and computing power that's so cheap; your demand for capital as a small percentage of what it was 10-15 years ago.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I think part of the focus on what we were talking about here as wire companies you know stay in private and so a lot of -- I think it's right, a lot of younger companies aren't getting the financing they might want or and the money is moving down, it's pouring into sort of the biggest one's and it's keeping those biggest ones, that otherwise would have gone public, private, longer.</p><p>      And so that's kind of the -- at least the lends were looking at this but I take the point that you know, it's not being spread across equally.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, and that's what's allowing some of these most successful tech companies to push out an IPO where before these huge pulls of capital just weren't there and so you know, the Google's and Microsoft -- you know, I don't know, four/five years old and its market cap was $400 million to $500 million when it public where you know -- let's go to this slide, which is actually pretty interesting, it's a little hard to see but -- super hard to see but the...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The blue is how long they are private -- the little orange dot is when they go public, and the black dot is when they hit 10 billion.  And what you're seeing is just looking at it.  It's -- they are hitting 10 billion before they are going public.</p><p>      It goes from 1980 to 2015, yes, but it's interesting; so all those companies are up top were private for shorter period of time went public when they were smaller and they were -- they wrote the public markets up to a much bigger evaluation.</p><p>      And so what we're seeing now is just the opposite; companies are staying private a lot longer, you're actually hitting these big valuations even before they go public and one of the -- I think one of the primary reasons that's happening is really the mutual fund investors; and they too have backed off recently but for a while that's how they made their money, they invested in our lives orange dot when they went public, they didn't used to invest in private companies same way, but they still got the same value creation because they were in at that inflection point.</p><p>      And then the company went public and they got to rise that value now; they have to get in when it's private or they miss out.  And that's their whole business model, it's just sort of ride the growth. So we've seen what otherwise would have been an IPO in terms of the size of the round and in terms of the liquidity being offered to the employees happening when it's a private company driven by mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and the like.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And along with that point and maybe this ties to Jonathan and Catherine, they were mentioning earlier valuations because there is a lot of money for these companies were talking about, valuations get pushed up very high it before they should be, in almost every case before they should be.</p><p>      And it's because there is competition and you can take money from whoever you want, there was one company that's like need to go public this year that in the past round said we are raising money in two days and you have no access to any information, period.  Put your money down, and they raise several hundreds of billions of dollars in two days.  So it is just the dynamic is happening.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean (inaudible) price in Twitter and $800 million round shortly before they went public, Fidelity and Facebook, Morgan Stanley funds and Air B&amp;B.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Uber...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, Uber.  I mean these are the types of company that's getting these big rounds and then what's happening with them and is sort of a secondary component which is kind of a traditional IPO thing, right?  You have selling shareholders, the employees are able then to exercise options and get liquidity and what we have seen in these adjacent snippets, you know, Yelp did a pretty small primary round and did a $100 million buyback from employees.</p><p>      Ali Baba before it went public probably did the largest private tender offer that ever, and certainly they were aware of to you know, thousands of employees led by Silverlake and DST Global you know, were north of the billion dollars.  And Mark Zuckerberg in Facebook were really innovators in many respects because they were losing the talent work, they were 4-5 years old people, working for less than market rates in terms of salary, they saw their friends engineers at Google or Apple able after a couple years seem to exercise options and make money and Zuckerberg and that management teams said we got to fix this.  </p><p>      We are not going to be able to track the best talent, how do we do it and so back in 2009 where everybody thought it was crazy, some investors put in a lot of money in a primary and a really high valuation and put in a lot of money in a private tender offer to the employee base that allowed for the exercise of options and for employees to get a little bit of liquidity, you know, a little bit, a million bucks, right?  Which is a lot of money to a 25-year-old engineer, but just a small fraction of what their value they had on paper.</p><p>      And then we saw -- it went from the wild West of secondary trading that people kind of read about with Facebook employees selling shares to their dentist and things like that, not a lot of control to a very controlled private liquidity programs that were done purposefully and methodically to allow employees to get the type of liquidity they might either and early investors the type of liquidity they might have otherwise gotten in IPO.      So founder liquidities no longer a taboo, we are seeing it as early as series B rounds these days and new technologies outfits like NASDAQ private markets are able to allow these transactions to happen way that's you know, better, faster, cheaper, and said that they would become through routine, they are periodic private liquidity programs for these big tech unicorns and allow them to act like a public company in terms of giving their employees that equity incentive that actually can turn into money.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I'll also say that applies to the investors too so with VCs, we now have other opportunities for getting out in the private markets at these high valuations and there are some of these companies where the early VCs already completely out right.  I mean people don't realize that but we were able to get out without it being a signalling mechanism which matters.</p><p>      And because remember, even with these new big growth rounds, its they are not joining the board or advising the CEO, it still the early VCs who are doing that and so unless we feel the compulsion it's hard to have the entrepreneur feel the same compulsion.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So you know, at some point we are seeing early-stage VCs sell to the growth equity investors, sell to the mutual funds and sovereign wealth funds, where you know, 10-15 years ago it would have been really a bad signal for early-stage investor to get liquidity before the company was sold or went public.  Now, it's just sort of become a little more routine and there are pockets of capital that will -- the institutional investors will be able to get liquidity from one another.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Can I ask a question?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  1980, I worked on an initial public offering for contract drilling company in Houston.  I don't mind telling you the name, it was Drillers Inc.  and I know exactly what (inaudible) they were in.  I was a $20 million IPO and now let's work, I'll just calculated here roughly, $58 million would be the equivalent of going -- taking up and doing a IPO.</p><p>      Now is that size IPO because frankly I don't think our charger here is for the company that does an IPO to billion-dollar valuation. We are much smaller than that, we are worried about the guy would do dry cleaners.  You know, is $58 million IPO just currently off the table, you would never do that now?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think my answer is it absolute wouldn't happen.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Would not happen?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Would not happen.  Because the market changed historically, they were investment banks that would do that sort of deal and then cover it, have coverage in the backside so that company would actually build and get market attention so they are like the (inaudible) of the world, they are gone.  Hambrecht &amp; Quist, they are gone...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Roberts and Stevens...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Roberts and Stevens they are gone, the four (inaudible) they called them and they were these sort of these super regional investment bank that would take a company like that.  And also companies like Microsoft, you know, which was kind of a smaller business public and that doesn't really exist anymore.  I don't know if you have seen...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Doesn't not going to happen.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So, they got buyed out around late 90s going into -- so JP Morgan buyed Hambrecht and Quist, they all got buyed...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  (Inaudible).</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And you try to get into this you know, innovative high-growth space but other things changed too so there is profitability, the whole analyst market banks and so that's why one of the reasons analyst coverage is hard to get and build your you know there is, we all know that -- I'm sure you all are aware there is a pilot going on around (inaudible) right so lower cap less liquid stock, it's harder for banks to make a trading profits so does that deal look as interesting anymore.  </p><p>      Even if A&amp;Q still existed, that would be a problem with you that that deal probably is not as profitable anymore.  Even investment banking fees, there is good competition investment banking and the IPO is 7 percent fee but you see a lot of follow-on offerings that get squeezed down so you know, the 3 percent or 4 percent because enough competition.</p><p>      Now that's really happening at the you know, one's everyone wanted to but generally that whole banking model is less profitable. So, that is a challenge and then you have investors who have a lot of capital to put to work and so it'd 25 or now 50 with inflation.</p><p>      You know, and you are going to get 10 percent allocation of do you want to write a $5 million cheque, some may, but lot mutual funds like I need to put $40 million or $50 million to work at a time because of so much capital.  If I'm going to spent all that time to listen to the banker pitch, understand the company, get excited about it, I can't just put $4 million to $5 million to work, I got to put more to work.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's an interesting problem and this goes to Jonathan's point you know, partially me coming from the tech world, I think of things and everything that is happening in my world in California right, but there are lots of companies growing in other parts of the country that a VC wouldn't step foot in and this money is not going to go to no matter how well they are doing, right?  And so and that that probably goes to your broader point.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I mean in, in California and I have a 55 company portfolio in an aggregate there was about $600 million, they have raised about $100 million but 40 percent of my portfolio have women founders and 4 percent of venture funded start-ups have women executives and half of my portfolio is Hispanic founders which is less than 0.1 which is less than 1 percent, 10 percent of my portfolio have black founders which is less than 1 percent and so and those percentages are probably 500 percent of the percent of the other VCs.</p><p>      I mean I've worked for the White House on you know, on diversity sort of stuff and we just we have a blind selection process so we just remove people's names and pictures and that's where it stops.  And I speak Spanish and so that is part of this Spanish thing.  But I just -- it's hard for me, what I see is that there is a broad bottom.</p><p>      You know, people get to accelerators, they might be able to get a $1 million to $2 million and there is this huge scrunch and then if I need $100 million cheque, that's actually a lot easier to come by.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That's right.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And 7 to 10 million is tough money.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And you know, so which is why we are talking about secondary liquidity options, why that's an issue and which is what Catherine was talking about, angel investor fatigue because there is no liquidity for this investors and it just -- it feels broken for those small sub $100 million businesses.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think you are right Jonathan and I'm not worried about you guys, you are going to make out, you are going to make out how it makes out, don't worry and keep doing what you are and do it some more.  Unfortunately or fortunately, I think what we are here for is to figure out 99.99995 percent that don't fit into this model.</p><p>      So I think your information actually is very interesting, it helps understand why that perception among you know, the pressures of capital and we saw it like where are those pressures other than what's there in the Silicon Valley.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Only got gushing in the valley.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Very narrow path right?  Within Monday's drive all those steps whatever so I think our challenge is to identify what you guys are doing really well, why you are doing it and how can actually we roll it out to where a greater portion, in fact greater numbers, may be not in dollars but greater numbers that people are going to participate in the core growing jobs, growing businesses, growing capital helped out.</p><p>      Maybe not to the extent that your demographics work out but is there something that we can take, apply and learn.  This is just like going to the moon versus going to the grocery store, this does not apply at all.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it's little off topic from this, but certainly when there is a tremendous matter competition for very few deals, venture capitalists at their heart, are you know, entrepreneurs and selves and very smart and they will seek opportunities that not everyone else is chasing, because it is too hard or too expensive.</p><p>      So you know, Steve's case in revolution talking about looking into jurisdictions that aren't Silicon Valley and I think I just anecdotally we're seeing more of that, things like companies and in New Orleans, Louisiana that you know, have never done a deal there and all of a sudden the past couple of months we are starting to see things.</p><p>North Carolina has historically had a solid base and we're seeing more activity there.  So, I think because of this phenomena and it hyper competition for the best deals, you could see smart money, saying I don't want to overpay, there are smart people in other places in this country, let's go see if we can find unearth some of that. But maybe you might have a different perspective.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I agree with that and so our funds (inaudible) because I came from some of the bigger funds like NEA, we only invest with those funds actually for financing risk, which is at the heart of what a lot of you are talking about.  And I will say that the really top-tier funds are not, they'll pretend they are and the press will say that and they will deny it to the nth degree, but they are not doing a lot of deals right now at all.</p><p>      That I know that because I am looking to invest to them, I invest a alongside to them, I monitor and I work with them as partners, and they are just not doing a lot of deals right now but we are more than happy to watch all the others bump up our existing deals, right.</p><p>      So that is an important phenomenon and you see some firms who used to be investing all the time taking on different industries all of a sudden VCs like insurance.  Like no one ever paid attention to insurance before all of a sudden they like yes sure, that's right it changes and people will follow where the opportunities are.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Could I ask another question?  Julie or Sebastian in the lot of tasks last year, at the end of the year, creating (inaudible) for small business so it was a definition small business was $100 million assets, is that what it was?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So, I think you are referring to the fact that when the bill created the committee portion of the bill, this committee codified.  It uses the same definition that this committee has of looking for private and public companies up to $250 million.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  $250 million, I'm a lawyer, not good with numbers. Alright, I got a company, it's worth $250 million or it is going to be worth $250 million, but it's not, it was a bank industry.  It's not blood testing or anything, it's Silicon Valley, it may be smokestack industry, it may be in Texas.  It maybe conventional oil and gas.</p><p>      We are not going to finance it, what's the answer there, putting aside all the all the glitz and glamour and stuff it's going public at $1 billion and it's producing two to three times return of money.</p><p>      I mean just in Iowa or Texas or wherever are from, the flyover zone, we've got companies out there, they need money, they pull in people, they pay taxes, they make a decent profit.  Where do we go to get money from those companies?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So I think it's hard to finance them from an equity finance perspective.  I think that they will be able to tap into the debt markets but the reality is it is harder to finance it than it is to sell it.</p><p>      There is a huge part of the private equity industry and the buyout side is focused on the middle-market and a $250 million company that's making money in a traditional industry, there will be a line 20 deep to buy the company by private equity sponsors.</p><p>      But if you want to sell 10 percent of it and try to build it, it's a harder one because the buyout shops will take control all day long and they'll actually, you know it's almost universal in deals right now where the management team will probably be asked to \"rollover\" so sell 80 percent of the company or 75 percent of the company and keep a minority position from the original founder but it is hard for those sorts of traditional businesses to find equity financing, my opinion.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So this may be a little bit of a tangent, but I think all of this, including the bigger topic comes down to marketing and the reason -- I think the number one reason.  If you asked me why should a company go public, I don't think any of the ones we all just dismissed a lot of the ones as not being relevant anymore.</p><p>      The only one that I still think resonates is the legitimacy point right be being able to be, I am a public company, I am real. Everything else can be done elsewhere.  But when that marketing thing turns against you right, like when companies go public and they are already criticized in the first quarter for thinking you know, for not producing, the number one thing when our companies go public is they are not profitable.  </p><p>      And because they are throwing all their money into growth right that is what they are supposed to do, like we don't look for them to breakeven.  We look for them to grow and grow and grow and it ends up killing them right.</p><p>      Like you have a model and I am not arguing about any particular company's value, but you have a model like Groupon who says that the way we do our business is different than the way you think about things.</p><p>      So we are going to approach this a little bit differently right and that may be good or bad or legal or not legal about whatever the drama was, but that was a problem for them right and they pulled back. And that really hurt them right in a big way.  </p><p>      Similarly with these companies right, the ones that you are talking about Patrick, it's a marketing thing right if I view you as this little company in the middle of why is so much in the Valley right?  It's in the valley and people think you need to come to the Valley because you need that stamp in order to attract capital and you need that step in order to attract talent and everybody thinks they need to go there in order to work at a great tech firm.      So everything starts to congeal in one place right and if you market and so people are really interested in growth and that's why venture is really hot, but I will tell you people are pulling back from that right now.  </p><p>      People are interested in stable returns right now and so there is an opportunity in some of these other places where there are stable businesses in traditionally stable industries that have stable returns and give you an alternative to just give you an opportunity for -- a lot of them don't think there are alternatives and I don't know what that means but I do think it's about how you spin it, how you market it and how the people who need to hear that marketing hear it, right.</p><p>      So how do you publicize that to the folks who are in Dallas or are in New Orleans like Jamie mentioned.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  Now, let's say I got this company that I have that I did public offering for in 1980 and let's use $60 million around number is.  This private company's got $60 million, write what you want it.  If I wanted to get it to be a $250 million company in its -- they don't have any molecular chemist working for them or anything like that.  It's something that is this one of those ugly businesses just much makes money, OK.</p><p>      And so what I did finance it to get it to maybe it has potential, it has it core of a billion assets, I mean venture capital comes to mind, angels come to mind.  </p><p>      I mean angels are local venture capital.  You know, we do have some financing sources and taxes.  Are those choices or industry partners I am assuming you can do joint ventures or something like that or (inaudible) buying they may do a JV or something like that. Are those the options that are available if we can do a public offering.</p><p>      I'm just trying to figure out and I realize I am outside your fairway but little smaller but help me here understand what the financing options are from not in a whiz banks sizzling business, but is just one of those ugly...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And debt is not an option?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, you can only take debt so far and at some point someone's going whys up and say I'm not going to get my money back.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, it depends how much cash flows coming into our business.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right, but suppose it's all going back in the growth and maybe if you are building smokestack there is collateral being created there that the banks gets excited about but we know bank and we have banks.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean I think the quickest way to 250 million and we see it all the time is through a cell control to a private equity fund and they invest in you, so you sell 60 to 75 percent of it to you know, middle-market buyout fund in Boston or Chicago and they will then invest into that company to do more acquisitions to consolidate smaller players and that's sort of the path of least resistance, but that the quid pro quo is the founder's give up control.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But you got some liquidity once and we have seen it work really well for founders and families to give up that control, turnover you know, that control to institutional investors, professional boards go out do a couple of acquisitions and the next thing you know you have increased the value to 250 million in that second bite of the apple for that rollover piece can be meaningful.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That's the path of least resistance, but there are joint ventures and taking debt and trying to find a family office.  We have seen sort of real expansion of what we call fund-less sponsors, you know, individuals that are out of the big private equity shops, they don't have committed pools of capital but know how to do deals, they will find a company like that and say look, I will bring in you know, some private equity partners and help you build the business.</p><p>      We are seeing a lot of transactions and those are particularly at $50 million T-shirt company in Atlanta, you know, or healthcare services company in Cleveland.  And those are the sort of things where you are seeing private middle-market, private equity really play a role.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm sorry, I'll pass on my next question, I'll let Jonathon speak.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  If you guys were going to design a system, (inaudible) and we are going a design system for investors to be able to raise $10 million, $20 million, $50 million or for companies to be able to raise from, I don't know from $1 to $100 million and then achieve liquidity on the backend, what would that do or what would you tweak about the current system?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Depends who you are, right?  So as a VC, I have different incentives and an entrepreneur has different incentives, et cetera, right?  So, a big ends to my interests and talk as an entrepreneur right and so already see things developing of this nature right like kick starter is a very basic example of an alternative way to raise money that takes us out of the equation.  But sometimes I think it is a dumb choice to go and kick-start and sometimes it is a smart choice, right?</p><p>      And similarly, Angel list is another great example of that.  You also have several of these kind of family office networks or middle tier institutional networks probably ones that are relevant to what Patrick's doing actually, creating these kind of, groups that deals can post on the platform when anyone sees it, people can comment and it kind of like an angels but for all stages of things including for funds, right.      And I do think that it's about the information right so it's about if entrepreneurs there is a lot of people looking at finances things and a lot of people looking for the money.  So it's about making the connection between the two right?</p><p>      And so I do see the proliferation of platforms allowing that.  So the answer is, the more information the more you can connect the parties, the better.  For me the reason I say it's different for VCs because you know, the less options you have, the more you got to go with me, the better deals for me, right?  So that is, you know, (inaudible).</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So that's basically a more efficient markets?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  To a degree.  It's also why you see the development of -- so my firm is a good example of this, as is kind of a phenomenon that entries and Horowitz has said the VC world two, which is another value-added investor, right, which was kind of a fake term in a decade ago and is now a realtor.</p><p>      If you have a choice, then the model needs to change right, we need to find other ways to help our companies and add value.  You can get in and so I think that is a similar element to it so the more information, the more opportunity, the more I have to do more which, by the ways in all the incentives of what you guys are trying to accomplish.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So I would like to switch back please to liquidity. So one of the things we have been discussing, we want to try to understand the impact on and the fact that investors invest and hold things longer therefore that you know, there is less money coming back into the market.</p><p>      So I see that as -- OK so typically they would be out liquidity event the money, the profits would be ploughed right back into that into the economy and some new other new start-ups or maybe they took it and bought another house somewhere so again it's fuelling the economy.</p><p>      So what we're trying to understand is, what can we do for or how can we understand this is in sublet, at some point in time, and I agree with you, you know, there is a lot of not smart money out there and at some point will they experience investor for take it and just get out of the market.  And things settle down a little bit and so we are trying to work through this.  Other piece we've talked about is I think there is -- and I'm anxious to hear from SEC how their tick pilot is going.  </p><p>      So one time there was a lower tier public market and doesn't exist anymore in and does that seem like it is something that we should be exploring or considering so that again we can create this and I'm calling it velocity of money, but that's probably an incorrect term, that's a treasury term and I'm probably using it wrong.</p><p>      So what are your thoughts about you know, liquidity, how that impacts IRR, how it impacts the -- the flow of money into the economy long-term.  Even though, there's like -- to me I look at it and say supply demand and supply is pretty big right now and so that's impacting what we are seeing, supply so what are your thoughts on liquidity options.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'll just say one thing and then these guys chime in because I think they know more about it.  I don't think there is a lack of liquidity at all.  I just think it's in different places than you think it is so and that's kind the point of the conversation right.  There's other ways to get out, there's other ways to move money, there's other ways to exit at all different stages and that is actually why less companies are going public in my opinion because it is not the only option for liquidity.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  There is more liquidity now than ever.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I agree.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And things like 487, to make it a little clearer that yes, there is a way to do it but you know, in 2000 and before the 2007, you know, you would really never see founders and employees getting liquidity until the venture investors got liquidity and now we see.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes like in the series B round is sort of the first place we see it which is pretty early.  You know companies still have a long way to go but we're seeing you founders and some early employees be able to get liquidity and then seeing programmatic frequent you know, what's a quarter or twice a year type of liquidity for the larger private companies that didn't exist.</p><p>      Things, technologies that allow that to occur, easier -- sort of all contributing to this additional liquidity that we have now.  And these people are buying houses and I think the real estate prices in the Silicon Valley reflect liquidity.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It is not without conflict either, right?  People are concerned about it still because you know, it misalign incentives ,right?  So you know, the part of the reason it is happening is because of the talent crunch.  People need to be able to keep their talent, but then it's also when you are giving talent the way out of being locked into the incentive structure, it creates response.  So people are still trying to figure it out.  I don't think any of the companies that figured it out.  You know, to a T.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I was going to say would you say also on life science biotech's I mean, my sense of what they are doing with their capital is really has to be in clinical development, I mean clinical trials so I mean we are totally -- so that would be different.  Would you agree?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes and they still adopt much more of a traditional model of you know, may not be found in three years and I feel maybe five or eight depending on where the market is, but they don't really have a choice because you know, at this point of you have to get your employees liquidity, you only have to get them there because there is massive source of private capital that can keep you private and you get to keep control and there is a benefit, right.</p><p>      If that didn't exist, you wouldn't do an IPO.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That's a good point.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's only capital, right?  All of this phenomena are about the larger market forces at work.  To the extent that many of those do not apply in biotech, we see more of a traditional model and so we don't see founders getting out until after the lockups on IPO but it's just the way tech was 15 years ago, it really hasn't changed.</p><p>      I do think just to the -- you brought up the tick size pilot, that is interesting to watch and we'll see what the results are that as well as whether that will create float for some of the smaller cap stocks and keep banks and analysts in the games so you might have a different calculus in going public.  It's not going to change the calculus of how it got private capital, I don't need to go public.</p><p>      But you know, if your company is otherwise is or that market dries up, I still don't think it is going to overcome, anything like this can overcome the fact that a lot of public investors you may want to put big chunks of capital to work and Scott have enough flow to make that work for them, right.  That's just for a lot of capital, the pools that is invested from that's a phenomenon that can be difficult to overcome but you know, this can be helpful.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Can I raise a question that's going to tie into something that we are told about this morning which was liquidity in the Regulation A space.  When you talk about some companies as early as Series B rounds, what size of company we are talking about because I have the feeling that the companies we are talking about this morning are very much smaller than the guys who are now going and getting liquidity as early as Series B.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So maybe you know, $12 million to $15 million pre- money value, maybe up to $20 million and they are raising you know, through $5 million to $10 million.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Is that for Series B?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, on the small side.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Oh OK.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Very small.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And that's like what the A is now because the valuations have gone up typical series.  I mean, traditionally a series B company was a company you know, had us maybe 5 million in revenue, 5 to 10 in revenue kind of thing like early revenue around the like, you know, 30s, 40s, 50s and valuation your 10 X would be high right of that revenue multiple.      Now like a typical soup you know, A can get that high you know more like the 20s, 30s, but there -- things have just been pushed up but traditionally Jamie is correct that's the right side.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Fenwick does a really nice study every quarter and showings sort of where the value from a B is I was actually just looking at bears and so I think things it that definitely it's creeping higher for every round.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And size wise too this used to be like $15 million in infusion and now they can be up to like 40 million -- 50 million.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I know biotech but everything that really has changed is I can't remember the last time I helped an entrepreneur with the business plan and pitched into a VC.  VCs create their own companies, they know where the sciences is, they go find the management team, they license and it's really much of a build your own so that I look at 200 deals like the way it is intact where you can start something with low capital, you are going to need a lot of capital to begin with.</p><p>      And in the 90s when it was Hambrecht &amp; Quist, I did a lot of IPOs were the funds raised to 20 million, 25 million, I can remember 15 million, we won't even really look serious about getting involved with accompanies who is A if they haven't (inaudible) raised 20 -- 25 because it's a couple years of burn.</p><p>      You know, if they only raised 5, it's like by the time we get involved in, they may not be here right?  So that the scale is completely different but it has also come from the fact that investors have learned saying it's too risky, the way to go to the entrepreneur, so to speak.  </p><p>      They wanted -- they are already walking the holes and the labs to figure out who the potential entrepreneurs and recruiting them out. So it's a very different dynamic.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Can you talk a little bit more about what it was like when you have a smaller investment banks raising smaller rounds for more companies, like what were their economics like if-</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  They were doing 7 percent on the IPO same they were probably making a little while and I am not a banking expert, they were probably making a little more on the trades after and at least in life sciences a lot in tech, you would count on two or three pretty fast follow on to that same 70 percent so you could see a you know, even though it's a small dollar, maybe it was 15 or secondary as 25 and then you did a 30 down the road.</p><p>      You know, that's not a bad income stream right for smaller bank and you got some trading out of them.  It was decent enough to hook up out of pretty good multiples of time that tech was taking off.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  This might be a switch a little bit but I have been thinking about Jonathan what you were saying about your firm and the numbers and how it had -- and also the question how do we fix some of these things.  A mentor of mine, Steve Coltie writes a lot on entrepreneurship, has this whole list of things that are required for successful entrepreneurship ecosystem and one of the ones I was remember is celebrating the wins and I think that's key, right.</p><p>      So when you go invest in the middle of the country, it happened with New York like so when New York became a big venture ecosystem people threw tons of money and then tons of money and they all stopped because everyone was like where are the IPOs, where are the exits?</p><p>      It's like a nice idea for few years and all will jump on the bandwagon because by nature human beings are lemmings, including investors.  And what they all would do it is they'll go after it but until you see the wins, no one's going to do it and when you do see the wins if no one knows about it, that might be good for you as an investor because you're dibs on those great opportunities, but it doesn't encourage more money to come in.</p><p>      So there is something about you know, identifying the wins or identifying the success stories and being able to make them more clear so in your business with the different minorities and women and gender, in running things, you know, show the wins we have that NEA with care.com when Sheila took her company public so the more you give them, the more you publicize the more people see that it actually works and you know affects the bottom line, the more they are interested.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We've only got a few minutes left, I just wanted make sure is there anything from the panellists that you think we missed any insightful slides, I'm pleased that the conversation is going exactly the way that we needed to go but are we missing anything from your point of view.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):I think maybe just you know, one of the points about why companies aren't going public is there is a lot of M&amp;A still and you are seeing in the big strategies and could you see more of it the repatriation of cash in the new administration is allowed in a tax efficient way.</p><p>      It can underestimate the effect that that has on a lot of companies just to get big enough and then Google or oral courses go comes in and makes a compelling offer and they sell before they would even get the chance to go public.</p><p>      And just recently we are seeing you know, these dual track where a company will file to go public and right before they go, big strategic will snap them up, Cisco did that with that dynamics, Stone Canyon did it with Mouser and those are just in the past couple months so I think that is it.</p><p>      We touched on it, but that's important issue why companies just staying private, longer or just not going not even ever getting the chance to go public because there are deep pools of capital.  The big strategic have a lot of equity cash, debt is cheap and they are able to pay your top dollar take these companies is out of play.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And you are showing the big guys tech but this is happening in other sectors.  The banking and insurance they are monitoring the FinTech start-ups.  We have started to keep a database of 5000 FinTech companies because the banks want to know where they are so we buy them, are they innovators, are they competition, who's going to need a lunch kind of thing.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's happening in consumer products.  So a lot of companies who have set up their own internal innovation, arms realizes that it's hard to create an innovative culture yourself, and so there are much more looking externally saying to a partner they'll do a buy it in and you know, it's not always tech, but it also got a tech feel to it, but the acquirers not always a tech company.  So there is many I would put in the cereal, acquirer category.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And it is not even a public company, maybe we are starting to see the tip of the iceberg as Uber and DD and.  Air BNB, for example, recently announced acquisitions have been able to borrow a bunch of money, could we see that sort of strategic expand outside of the large public companies, did that sort of M&amp;A.  Go ahead Jamie.</p><p>      HUTCHINSON:  And I think the last issue, it's still expensive to be public and to Jonathan's point may be around why we are not seeing some of these smaller public companies is you know, the compliance makes it expensive.  It is real money, it's millions of dollars to go public and its millions of dollars to stay public.  It has to sort of be economically make economic sense to do that and make that investment.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That's probably biggest one we didn't touch on.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I had a subjective one that I think is worth mentioning.  So, the mentality aspect of things is really important so entrepreneurs as Jamie mentioned this early you know, they believe in their company, they want their word, they are long-term, they do not care about this stuff and they do not want to hear you telling them that they are not you know, that their passion is not real or not working because you don't understand it right and so I think that's what kinds of pulls them away, but the VCs are really important too.</p><p>      So VCs when they invest in something or they have a bad experience, they wear their scars forever.  They just don't forget, it's amazing.  We'll have meetings like what you remember 15 years ago when we did this thing is like there were no phones, like Apple didn't exist or whatever, right.</p><p>      So and they don't forget and when they do take the lead back in which they ultimately do often, if they get hurt again, it almost kills the opportunity set and I would say VCs have been significantly I would say they feel scars whether they admit it or not from the most recent IPOs or the past IPOs.  Some recent examples we have already gave examples of and all of them have had it with some things because we are all in different deals, but all and a lot of the same deals too.</p><p>      This year is a very crucial year because there are a lot of tech companies going public this year or that are expected to and the good news for the bigger point is there does get a point in which we say this is ridiculous, you need to go public like there is a point at which everyone is like this just needs to happen.  I do not have any insider knowledge, but I would bet Uber's feeling that, I would bet Air BNB is real feeling that right?</p><p>      So there are these -- there is a point at which it has to happen, but if it doesn't go well, it will especially given all the new opportunities and options and alternative routes, it will kill it.  So fingers crossed and if there is a way to mediate that that be a great thing.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Thank you.  Are any follow-up questions, wind up questions?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Just my personal stuff is on my sleeve of course, but I am actively taught looking at taking companies like doing a reggae offering and then seeing if the compliance is actually about the same as taking company in public under London AIM exchange.</p><p>      For them $5 million a year going 30 percent year-over-year is actually a nice IPO or even looking at the Australian stock exchange and you know, being public but actively traded on a foreign exchange.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think just one thing some of the things that you guys have touched on, there was a market for small IPOs that does not exist anymore.  These companies do not belong in the public markets at you know, even like (inaudible) billion dollar market capital, companies they struggle.</p><p>      You are not going to get research written about your company, are not going have a bank getting you to your next deal.  The cost of being public it says 2.5 out there, I have talked about being the General Counsel public company Brian has as well.  </p><p>      There is a real cost so it's great to say we want companies to go public and we do.  There are definitely wonderful reasons and (inaudible) probably the public, but until we sorted out some the things like (inaudible) decimalization, that does provide more spread for research and others sort of things that came with you know, penny increment trading before that change.</p><p>      There are enough market forces right now that I think our goal should also be -- we talked about earlier days try to find a way to help create off public exchange liquidity for these companies that are very successful.  </p><p>      They are just not you know, tech unicorns so I think that has to continue to be part of what we focus on because those companies are private, they are getting funding, they can get that whenever they are not, the ones we are seeing in the news but they probably also shouldn't be in a highly liquid public market listing.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Anybody else.  Oh, thank you very much indeed.  That was really useful.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Thanks for having us.      (UNKNOWN):  Jamie can we have the slides sent around?  OK guys, we are going to move on to the final piece of today's program which is (inaudible) diversity.  We have now had a couple of discussions on the recommendations.  I spent a good time of, a good portion of our time on October 5th as well as they a conference call on December 7th.</p><p>      As you recall currently regulation SK in item 407C2, little Roman at six, request company to disclose in the proxy statements whether a nominating committee considers diversity in identifying nominees for the company's Board of Directors.  The rule also requires that if the company has a policy with respect to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, how that policy is implemented and how its effectiveness is assessed.</p><p>      As we have discussed the disclosure requirement is soft, diversity is not defined, which means a regulation hasn't been as helpful in generating useful information as it could be.  Based on our prior discussions we come up with a draft recommendation, you should all have both.</p><p>      I have received soft and now you got hardcopies all of the recommendation and so I think you have also seen that they are suggestions that Greg Yardley sent around to make changes to that wording and the changes that Greg had suggested where to change the recommendation.  </p><p>      The recommendation is at the bottom of the page and his, now I have lost his statement.  He says instead of saying \"while generally the definition of diversity should be up to each issuer, issuer should include disclosure regarding race, gender and ethnicity of each member/nominee and self-identified by the individual,\" that's in our current draft.</p><p>      The alternative language being suggested is, \"while generally the definition of diversity should be up to each issuer, issuer should include disclosure whether race, gender and ethnicity of each member/nominee and self-identified by the individual are considered.\"</p><p>      Anybody got any opinions as to -- so looking at the sentence that begins \"while generally\" and it would the alternative that Greg is suggesting is \"while generally the definition of diversity should be up to each issuer, issuer should include disclosure whether race, gender and ethnicity of each member/nominee as self-identified by the individual are considered\" is slightly different term spin on the -</p><p>      The race, gender and ethnicity of each member would be still self-identified.  That is still included.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  He just changed the word regarding to whether.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I will consider it.  Yes.  It's did you think about that.  Did you consider it?  I mean that's a big change between the date the two.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  From my standpoint it strikes me as less useful information.  The answer is yes/no and it doesn't give you granularity on gender, racial, ethnic to the representation which is really what the value add of this kind of reporting could be.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The original is more what have you got on your board and then that the new one was did you think about who you have got on your board.  And apologies to Greg if he is listening, I'm totally misphrasing that.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes but we discussed that...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We have these words as well...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I know, I know.  And we went back -- OK so we discussed it and my preference was for the details.  I like the original language that we have.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Any opposing.  All right so I think the sense of the panel is that so we would leave the language as it is currently drafted and what about the last sentence.  Greg is asking this is the sentence, \"while disclosures should be the default issuer should have the option to opt out\", do we keep that sentence?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The way I am reading is that we're saying if you don't want to answer, you don't have to.  If you leave it, if you put it in or leave it out they are going to be obligated to answer.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I am not sure if you they are going be obligated.  I suppose you would, yes.  I think you are right.  If you want to disclose...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And to Michelle's point, if we think the information is relevant, then because my opinion is the people who do not want to answer are going to be the ones who downright so why do we want to put compliance in for people who-</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Any objections to that and so what the proposal is right now is that we keep the language as disclosed as said out in this draft.  We need to vote on that?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I thought we were saying that we wanted to remove the last sentence.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, the suggestion was to remove it, but I think...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I thought Laura was agreeing with that and I think I do too.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You agree to remove it?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sorry, the way I read it -- OK, let me go back again, is if we leave it in, they can opt out of it.  So do we want them to be able to opt out or not report.  And if the answer is yes, then we leave it in.  If we really want this information...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You want to force the information?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  If you want to force the information, I would remove the sentence.      (UNKNOWN):  It's not quite relevant here, but on a program at SBA that we run where we have an opt out portion, we're finding that a lot of women owned businesses opt out because they do not want to be -- they public feel like they will be disadvantaged by being identified.</p><p>      So there can be -- maybe opt out, can be used in ways that one doesn't intend and if the information useful eliminating the opt out, I would indoors eliminating it.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Lisa?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We had a lot of discussion surrounding that and I am more in favor of leaving it there, and that's why we put the language in for the default to be to answer and put this out there because the other argument as well is, was giving everyone the opportunity to self-identify which gave us more flexibility there.</p><p>      And the default being this and then the opt out is a decision on the backend.  So my preference is to leave it in as it is.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Any other thoughts?  I mean it does provide the option for them to define diversity however they want, so that kind of allows them flexibility there if they really don't want to talk about ethnicity, gender and race.  So I think I feel comfortable taking it out.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think if we look back at the fifth sentence, the role failed to generate the information that's useful.  We leave that sentence in it.  I think the same result -- we're going to get the same result as we're currently getting.  So I would agree that we should take that sentence out.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  Can we have a proposal to take this language and take the last sentence out?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And the second.  All in favour?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Aye.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't want to force a premature vote.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I would like it to be kept in.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And Catherine?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm sorry, I'm not sure because I'm trying to think through the implications of leaving it in or taking it out based on the wording that already exists there.  So maybe our attorney can help us.  I mean...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The first part, does it require SUS to describe?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Catherine, I mean -- I don't know what the right solution is, I try to refer to you all, and I've talked enough on other things.  But I mean it's a sticky wicket, however, you do it.  I mean it's -- I mean I think just go with your gut because it is -- I mean I think, the only think or thought I had was is our system or the SEC system is not mine is one of disclosure.</p><p>      I don't think we mandate unless there is a special statutory admonition about the diversity and disclosure of it, is there -- I mean, we're not mandating you to have a board that's diverse; we're just saying you disclose it and so -- I mean I think that seems to me to be within the powers of the SEC to say you need to disclose that and so -- then it becomes a matter of policy, and what we all think is in the best interests.</p><p>      Corporate America knows that diversity is a hot button, and rightly so I think some people would say and I agree with that to an extent; Jonathan and I talked about it at the last meeting that -- there is any number of use in this and I'm trying to be sensitive and not step on any toes.  So I think it don't matter, at the end of the day the commission is going to give it a lot more thought and they will come to probably a more considered decision than I am capable of doing.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  This is of course only a recommendation, that is not the actual wording of whatever we think the commission showed up. Would it change anybody's mind if the final sentence said something along the lines of while disclosures should be the default; issuer should have the option to opt out if they explain why.  Make any difference?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, I'll just live it on.  Then you get into what is an adequate explanation.  I mean I keep -- I mean this is such, I have -- this young lawyer, you heard me mention the young lawyer whose -- who went to Washington and I've known since he was a freshman at college.</p><p>      Well, I talked to him recently and he said well, and that was about this very issue and I said Chad, you know, I mean -- and we were talking about and I think I mentioned on one of the calls that I knew a woman who was European ancestry but she had grown up in Zimbabwe and moved to Fort Worth and I meet her and she said well, I'm African- American.  She used to color her eye (ph).</p><p>      And -- I mean this whole thing is rather imprecise and my friend Chad whose parents are -- his father is African-American, his mother is white, he says I check both boxes.  So there is no precision here. And I mean, you just -- you do the best you can and we go from there, we have same situation with our former President, who was -- his father was not African-American, he was African; his mother was white, he self identifies as African-American.  I mean it's too complicated for me.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So we'll leave the box checking for the people who write the rules.  Lucy?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, what is their overall intent with the disclosure?  Is it data that we're going to utilize?  Is it data for decision-making?  What did we determine from that originally?      (UNKNOWN):  It's for potential investors.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, I mean I think the summary of the discussions in the two previous discussions -- I like after considering that -- I mean those I think are our objectives and the aim at which the recommendation looks to underscore.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I will support whichever way we go but since there is full self-disclosure and we're not going through in redefining each of the categories; you know, the data could be skewed either way, that's why I was more in favor of the act outside of it because you are going to do other due diligence; you are going to do other items that are to be important as well.</p><p>      This is really, really important; I am just worried that we won't have as consistent as data as what we think we would have.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't think you're always going to get a lot of data from this, not that you can put into chance, I think.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I think that's the case.  I think that we're always going to have my own children right, think I want which box should I check in?  Frankly, I hope we get to the point where you know the box is always checked up the bottom or whatever it is.</p><p>      But for today and for now, we've had multiple discussions about this and I think we've all identified and come to the conclusion statistically from studies etcetera that -- that it is a business benefit to include diversity.</p><p>      And which is why maybe investors would like to know that in the -- regards to disclosure the Patrick speaking about this is just another piece of information to disclose.  It isn't going to perfect, no, absolutely not, but it's going to give an essence of perhaps a picture once they -- once people do all their other due diligence and so it gives them a first place to start; and this is the case may be depending where they're at.</p><p>      So that's why we really think it's important that we instead of letting people, organizations, whatever maintain the status quo because that's what we're talking about that we take out that option.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it's also really useful for fund managers and wealth advisors who are investing in public equities because their clients are asking for -- you know, I want to invest in companies that have diverse boards, I want invest in companies that have women in leadership, for example.</p><p>      So I just can't imagine any downside; I mean if the company really doesn't want to talk about race and gender, they can say we have people from the following 10 states or we have people from the following three age groups.  You know, it's totally up to them to define diversity.  I just don't see any problem with it.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Alright.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Also you can take it out.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  So before we get to that bit, does anyone have any objections to any of the rest of the language?  Are we are OK?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So I have the same concern that I had when we discussed this last time which is it says, provide information regarding each member nominee self-identified by the individual but what happens if an individual chooses not to be -- chooses not to self-identify, right.</p><p>      So I don't love the idea of opt out if we're going to think this important I think we should make it important, opt out against the opt out and nobody will understand why some companies have it and some companies don't have it but I do think we need to have some mechanism for companies to acknowledge that some other members were not willing to self-identify, otherwise you will have 10 board members with information on five and no information on the other five because those people choose not to self-identify but it's going to raise an SEC comment I would think.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Presumably, the rule when written would say, in the event the individual declines to provide that information, put NA in the box.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK, that's just my concern.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I'm just going to punt that and say, I'll bet that you guys at the SEC who are good at writing these rules, we'll manage to work that one out.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  NA.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  NA, Box 1, Box 2, NA.  All good alternatives. Alright, so can we move to the -- the proposal is the language as drafted without the last sentence.  So can we -- again, you repropose? OK, and then all in favour.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Aye.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Anyone against?  We're good, we have language, thank you.  Just keep it on.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I gave out a comparison.  We don't need to talk about, if you have any comments or you -- maybe not helpful after the discussion today but anybody wants to assume any comments to it, it's just something I did in dealing with business people and I found that tabular presentation side-by-side are useful and help people grasp the issues.</p><p>      So I did that just because I felt like it helped me just drafting it, it helped me crystallize some of the thoughts but anyway, you will all see the typo in the first page and I will correct that.  But Julie, if you're interested in posting it on the website, I will get you the digital flap.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And thanks for doing that, it's useful resource. Before we completely wind up, I will work with the staff to put together the recommendations from the discussions this morning. Interestingly, I thought the overall viewers, I would have -- if I had to predict anything, I would have said, no pre-empt everything but there is a much more subtle and reasoned newest opinion that wants to take the states thoughts into account in both of the proposals that we discussed and we will be reflecting that and we'll be getting drafts out on those.</p><p>      So thank you very much for those discussions.  And just one thing before we leave; any thoughts on what goes on to the agenda for next time.  I know Catherine had.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm very curious, I know I brought this up last time too but whenever the tick pilot is completed, I really would like to see that data and hear the remarks from the SEC on that.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I would love to hear him aggregate data statistics on fraud, just because if we're protecting -- trying to protect unaccredited investors it would actually be helpful to say, OK, these are the instances when they -- when things have gone south.</p><p>      I would also love to talk about getting data on how much capital small businesses think that they need.  And what are ways that we could actually suggest to get that data because all of our opinions are anecdotal.  I don't think we actually have any hard date on the subtle; if it's possible.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And to that point, elaborating your point Jonathan; I thought it was really interesting because clearly we have different communities, right.  Here the gushers and the gusher and that's great. Would that like to have a better sense of -- you now, is it 90 percent and how many billion is that for 200 companies versus the companies I think Patrick you're talking about the ones that I see that are -- that de-capitalization above leverage, OK, but below IPO or access to that type of capital.</p><p>      So if there is any data out there, I don't -- you know, what is that -- what does it look like?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, and -- you know, there are so many companies that completely count themselves out of even thinking about being able to raise capital and because it's so complicated they hear about these laws and they hear, oh I can only talk to wealthy people and I don't know any wealthy people, so even if we were to get data on how many companies are trying to raise capital unsuccessfully that would leave out a huge number that just don't even think that it's possible for them.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  If we could just get the tip of the iceberg; but I don't know how -- I know that's really hard.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Not sure where we would look for that iceberg.  Any thoughts on where the iceberg might be?  Gratefully received.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  QuickBooks.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Interesting.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Also keep in mind that in some exemptions you can't use general solicitation to the extent that you have company self- identifying themselves as publicly looking to raise capital, query whether that puts them already in the category of an exemption that would need to permit general solicitations.</p><p>      So I think part of the challenge is; how do you get data on the aggregate without actually going to the particulars of a specific company such that particular company doesn't have to publicly indicate to the world that they are looking for capital?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That would be kind of ironic.  Hey companies, who would like to self-identify as violating Section 5?  We maybe shouldn't do that then.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But I also think there is a census, there is a census committee -- they do it like an annual census of businesses; and this is where they get the jobs numbers from and this is where they get that sort of stuff.  If we could in that census, while the census actually going on getting that data to say hey zero to 10; you know, how much would you like to have more money to grow your business or something along those lines.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I do know there are surveys that are out there because I filled them out.  But and I don't think we're going to get a precision and data; it's not like we're going to get a census or whatever but just something to -- so that when -- you know, people like Jonathan and Patrick, when they're throwing out numbers; there is something -- you know, and I don't have to sink a billion, right.</p><p>      We have more precision in the amount of numbers because, again, intuitively through anecdotal qualitative experience, and the people in my world.  They feel -- they fall into more of the industries, the number of businesses that Patrick is.  So if we can just get a -- or spoke if we just get kind of a data field that it would be really great to put something in the ground, continuing quest.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We have (inaudible) capital market survey, we find it useful for at least the lower and middle market comparisons.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That would be good if we can get.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  All right, anything else, am I missing anything before we wind up.  All right, thank you very much.  Thank you everybody in the Internet land.  Thanks.</p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-1872273923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N04-MF71-DY0W-41TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"39685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 Roll Call, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 20, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0003FJ1</classCode><className>GOODWIN PROCTER LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0003BNV</classCode><className>ERNST &amp;

Welcome to the Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies.  And first I need to ask Sebastian if we have a quorum for the meeting.  Are we quorate?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOMEZ</emphasis>:  We do Sarah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  OK, excellent.  I am Sarah Hanks and I am here without my coach Steve Graham this morning.  He is by the side of his wife Joanne, who is recovering successfully from a major surgery.    </p><p>      Steve, if you're watching this, know that everybody in this room is thinking of you and sending thoughts and prayers for Joanne's continued recovery.  And we're looking forward to seeing you next time.  </p><p>      We have a wide-ranging agenda today.  We're starting this morning with a discussion on the limited liquidity and secondary markets for holders of shares of smaller companies.  We want to focus in particular on two types of companies; companies that are providing annual and semi-annual reports following a Regulation A Tier 2 offering, as well as SEC registered and reporting companies who are filing quarterly reports, but are not listed on any exchange. </p><p>      When have asked two preeminent Blue Sky lawyers to present to the committee in order to help us navigate these issues because as you know, one of the big problems in this area is that there is no state pre-emption for resales of the securities.  </p><p>      Following that we are going to return to a topic of loan-held interest to many of us, the broker-dealer status of find us, that is, people who help small companies find sources of capital.  During our October meeting, we received an update on this topic from Stephen Luparello, the then director of the Division of Trading and Markets.  </p><p>      It was clear at that time that there was nothing in the immediate works, in terms of rulemaking or other division action to redefine the definition of broker-dealer.  So we're going to spend some time this morning discussing whether we'd like to reiterate, once again, a recommendation for action in this space.  </p><p>      After lunch we're going to take up a question that many have been asking which is, why more companies choosing to stay private?  Or to put it a different way, why aren't more companies choosing to do an IPO?  We're going to be joined by a lawyer, accountant and the venture capitalists who have lots of direct experience with companies making these decisions and it's going to tee up a very interesting discussion.  </p><p>      Finally, I'm hoping that we going to finalize our recommendation to the commission regarding divested yield and corporate boards and the ways that the SECs disclosure requirement in this area could be improved.  But before we move into the agenda for the day, we are pleased to have with us this morning for opening remarks, Acting Chairman Mike Piwowar and Commissioner Kara Stein.  </p><p>      Chairman Piwowar.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIWOWAR</emphasis>:  Thank you, Sarah.    </p><p>      Good morning everyone and Steve if you're listening as Sarah mentioned all of us are sending our best wishes your direction.  </p><p>      I've always enjoyed these Advisory Committee meetings and I am pleased to be here in my new role as Acting Chairman.  I'd like to extend a special welcome to our newest committee member Michele Schimpp, who's representing the Small Business Administration.  We very much appreciate having the SBA's insights and we look forward to working with Michele.  Welcome.  </p><p>      No matter where you are in the United States, small and emerging companies raise the tide for so many people to succeed.  The freedom to innovate and grow has always been fundamental to American success. And we as regulators must constantly assess how our work meets the needs of today's innovators.  That's why this committee is so valuable.  </p><p>      Committee recommendations put forward in early 2012 about lifting the ban on general solicitations, expanding Regulation A and raising that Section 12G registration thresholds helped lead to the enactment of the Jobs Act.  In 2015 the committee recommended that the commission modernize Rule 147 to help facilitate intra-state offerings and I am pleased the commission did just that.  </p><p>      As of last month, the related rule -- amended Rule 504 is now in effect and the new Rule 147 Cap A will go into effect in April, providing more options for companies looking to raise capital.  The committee also recommended raising the financial thresholds in the smaller reporting company definition to expand the number of smaller companies that qualify for scale disclosures.  </p><p>      In line with that recommendation, the commission proposed amendments to raise those thresholds last year.  The list of your valuable recommendations and discussion topics goes on and on.  And it seems Congress was so impressed with your efforts that in December it codified the committee into law.  </p><p>      The bipartisan Small Business Advocate Act of 2016 put into the Exchange Act two new provisions.  The first establishes the Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation headed by a new advocate for small business capital formation.  </p><p>      The second establishes a Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee.  These are parallel provisions to the Dodd-Frank Act that established the Office of Investor Advocate and the Investor Advisory Committee.  I'm proud to say that we are already taking steps, including working with our appropriations committees to stand up the new office.  </p><p>      I anticipate that we will begin the search for a new advocate for small business capital formation in the near future.  The law requires that the new advocate be someone who is not a current SEC employee. So I hope you all will encourage good candidates that you may know to apply.  </p><p>      In the meantime, we want you to continue down this exciting path. The charter of this Advisory Committee doesn't expire until September and I know that between now and then you will continue your efforts to bring forward ideas to facilitate capital formation for small and emerging companies.  </p><p>      Your agenda today, as Sarah mentioned, secondary market liquidity finders and why private companies are not going public reflect important topics facing small and emerging companies.  Secondary market liquidity for shares being held by investors in Reg A securities is becoming an increasingly important issue.  </p><p>      Between June 19, 2015, the day when amendments to Reg A took effect in January 31st of this year, there were 181 offerings filed using Regulation A; 103, which have been qualified by SEC staff for the issuer to begin making sales, 28 issuers have reported selling approximately $259 million in the aggregate.  </p><p>      I look forward to any recommendations on ways to remove frictions that may stand in the way of investors being able to readily exit their investment.  I'm also please that you are discussing why more companies are choosing not to go the route of an IPO. </p><p>      While the menu of capital raising choices available today for small businesses presents more flexibility and more alternatives than ever before, there is always more we can do to provide robust public capital markets.  I look forward to your input on these and the other topics on your agenda today.  </p><p>      Thank you again for your service on this committee, and your continued commitment to facilitating capital raising by small businesses.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      Commissioner Stein.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEIN</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p>      I also want to extend my thoughts and good wishes to Steve and his wife, welcome Michelle.  Good morning to everyone else.  In this dynamic environment I think the ability to work on consensus topics is even more important.  </p><p>      This committee remains focused on fostering and supporting healthy marketplaces for fledgling smaller companies while protecting investors.  And this is a focus that we can all stand behind, and your commitment and work towards this goal as always is much appreciated.  </p><p>      Today's agenda re-examines topics that have been previously discussed, but we now have the added benefit of the inflow of initial information and data about how certain Jobs Act regulations are working in practice.  One aspect of your discussion concerns secondary market liquidity for smaller companies that are using the new Reg A plus rag.  And secondary market liquidity, I think from my perspective is a rather complicated topic.  For example, our Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee has also looked at this issue.  </p><p>      One of the things that's been most interesting to me is the availability of more data and current research that seems to be informing us on the role of information and transparency and the relationship to secondary market liquidity and firm value for OTC firms.  </p><p>      While your discussion today may be primarily focused n state securities laws and their impact on secondary market liquidity, I don't think it needs to end there.  Blue Sky requirements that apply to secondary sales of Reg A securities also are intended to provide a layer of protection for investors against fraudulent activities within each state in which the transactions occur.  </p><p>      I think from my perspective, state laws have often provided a protective guard rail in an attempt to balance efficient capital formation with robust investor protections.  That said, I mean I think it's fair to examine whether the current Blue Sky regime may negatively be affecting secondary market liquidity.  </p><p>      I am particularly interested in learning more about how compliance with state securities laws is working for Reg A non- exchange listed securities.  I look forward to the discussion of the pros and cons of Blue Sky laws and what if any improvements need to be made.  </p><p>      Finally, if there are inefficiencies with Blue Sky compliance regimes how can the current regime be adjusted?  For example, is there means by which NASA working with the states can improve the availability of manual exemptions across more states?  </p><p>      The other item on your agenda that I am sure will generate significant discussion and concerns the relative lack of IPOs as compared to prior periods.  What does the data reveal?  What are their current observations and explanations?  I can tell you again from my perspective, depending on what market participant you talk to, they are very different explanations.  </p><p>      One thing I'm interested in is has the Jobs Act provisions that change the registration thresholds or basically they have allowed for greater private capital raising contributed in any way to companies remaining private for a longer period of time I think that's another thing we should be thinking about as how different jobs at provisions interacted with one another.  </p><p>      I look forward to the discussion and I hope we'll delve into the very factors that are changing this whole ecosystem of our markets for capital formation including the effects of the economic environment and the regulatory structure.  </p><p>      Finally, you will also consider recommendations on broker dealer finders and board diversity.  I very much look forward to the discussion and these recommendations, and thank you again for your time and commitment to helping us think through these issues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Commissioner.  Now we're going to quickly turn to the SEC staff from the division of Corporation Finance.  We send our best wishes to Keith Higgins, who has moved on after more than three years since the divisions director.  </p><p>      I am reliably informed that he left just in time to enjoy staying up late on a school night to watch the New England Patriots win the Super Bowl, which I am equally reliably informed has something to do with American Football.  Who the hell knows.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      The division is now in the capable, skilled and steady hands of Acting Director Shelley Parratt and we are very pleased to have her this morning.  Shelley?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PARRATT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Sarah, good morning.    </p><p>      Good morning Acting Chairman Piwowar, Commissioner Stein and the committee members.  I am very happy to be here with you this morning.  </p><p>      This is my first time speaking at one of your Advisory Committee meetings and as part of the leadership of the division's disclosure review program I have always appreciated your thoughtful discussions and have carefully watched you develop recommendations.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to thank you in person for your time and for sharing your experience and insights with the staff, the commission, and the public.  </p><p>      Each and every staff member in the Division of Corporation Finance takes seriously the agencies charge of facilitating capital formation, while at the same time protecting investors.  We will be listening closely to your discussion this morning on ideas to improve secondary market liquidity for investors, which in turn, should help facilitate capital formation for issuers.  We also look forward to your afternoon discussion and welcome any ideas you may have that would promote further activity in the IPO market.  </p><p>      Before closing, I want to acknowledge the other members of the Corporation Finance staff at the table with me.  To my right, Betsy Murphy, a very important member of the Division Senior Leadership; next to Betsy is Sebastian Gomez, the chief of the Office of Small Business Policy; and to his right is Julie Davis, the senior special counsel in that office.  </p><p>      As you are all well aware, I need to give the standard disclaimer for any staff member speaking today which is that any remarks made by any of the SEC staff members reflect his or her own views and not necessarily those of the commission or any other member of the commission staff.  </p><p>      And with that I'd like to thank you for letting me join you this morning and I look forward to listening to your discussions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Shelley.    </p><p>      So we're going to move on to the secondary market liquidity.  As you've known over the course of the last few years, in a variety of formal and informal ways, this committee has taken up issues surrounding the lack of sufficient liquidity in the securities of small companies.  </p><p>      Today we'd like to focus more narrowly on the topic of secondary liquidity in the context of issuers that is subject to ongoing reporting requirements and thus have updated information available in the marketplace.  </p><p>      In the case of a company that's done a Regulation A offering, they are obligated to file and (inaudible) annual and semi-annual ongoing reports and current reports.  Companies that have done a public offering, i.e.  Registered Public Offering; they are subject to the ongoing disclosure regime which includes quarterly reports.  </p><p>      The availability of these ongoing updates means there is available information to help establish pricing and its transparency in the secondary market.  Yet, as we have heard in our previous discussions, investors in Reg A securities are likely to have a difficult time when they're ready to resell their shares.  </p><p>      One key factor in this space is the friction that comes with having to find state exemptions for each trade since Blue Sky -- state Blue Sky laws do apply to secondary sales.  We have invited today two highly regarded attorneys who specialize in Blue Sky matters and can help educate us on the current legal framework.  </p><p>      First I'd like to introduce Richard Alvarez, principal of the Law Office of Richard Alvarez.  Richard currently serves as vice chair of the State Regulation Of Securities Committee of the ABA, American Bar Association.  </p><p>      And next to him is Martin Hewitt.  Martin is chair of the same State Regulation Securities Committee of the ABA.  Martin may look familiar to you because he often attends these meetings and the SEC staff think maybe he;s a member of the Advisory Committee fan club.  </p><p>      We're very happy to have both of you here to share your expertise and help us delve further into this very important topic.  And I think Richard you're going to first?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALVAREZ</emphasis>:  Yes, I will.  Thank you, Sarah.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALVAREZ</emphasis>:  Thanks.    </p><p>      Unfortunately, I didn't bring my own membership key for the Advisory Committee.  Martin decided not to share that with you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  We're designating you a member right now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALVAREZ</emphasis>:  Well, thank you Sarah, that's very gracious.    </p><p>      Good morning everyone.  Thank you for inviting Martin and I to speak with you today on the topic of Blue Sky compliance that is applicable to Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings; and more broadly, to the securities of non-listed non-reporting publicly traded companies.  </p><p>      I'd like to particularly thank Acting Commissioner Piwowar and Commissioner Stein for their comments and certainly for their continued support in promoting the work done by this Advisory Committee.  </p><p>      Our presentation this morning will offer our views on the effects of state Blue Sky regulations on promoting or hindering secondary market liquidity for Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings and our discussion will hopefully be in the structure of a point, counterpoint presentation.  Not quite Kudlow and Cramer, for those of you who have long memories, but hopefully providing countervailing viewpoints.  </p><p>      Let me start basically at the end.  I believe that secondary market liquidity for Reg A plus offerings and for securities of non- listed non-reporting public companies will never be fully achieved unless state Blue Sky laws and regulations that are applicable to secondary market transactions in these securities are pre-empted by federal law, either through congressional action or through SEC rulemaking to revise and enhance existing provisions dealing with transactions and the securities in the secondary markets. </p><p>      For the reasons I will explain in detail further on in our presentation, it is clear to me from the vantage point of over 30 years having dealt with Blue Sky -- state Blue Sky laws issues that while likely unpopular with many state regulators, the existing state regulatory framework that is applicable to secondary trading activities for certain types of securities and market participants has become overly burdensome.  Rooted in a view of a National Securities market that defers to larger, more mature companies at the expense of newer and untested companies.  </p><p>      This bias has the effect of stunting growth and innovation and is not in my view, responsive to both the rapid evolution of the markets resulting from technological innovation and to the shifting imperatives of Congress reflecting the desires of their constituents for greater opportunities for capital formation and investment opportunity.  </p><p>      This is not to say of course that these imperatives demand that investor protection, which is one of the principal mandates or state regulators should be diminished or eliminated.  However, to me it does mean that as security markets -- securities markets evolve and the objectives of the markets overall change by emphasizing the importance of capital formation and job creation through more robust marketing opportunities for issuers and investors alike, existing regulation should also evolve.  Often times evolution cannot be incremental, disruptive change is sometimes necessary.  </p><p>      At this point I'd like to sidebar for a moment to give a brief overview of the state-of-play regarding state regulatory secondary market trading exemptions.  As we all know, the securities of companies who are listed on a National Securities Exchange enjoy full pre-emption.  Certainly, the listing standards and the abundance of available real-time information for those companies offers the basis for reducing the amount of needed regulatory scrutiny.  </p><p>      Pre-emption is also available for securities that are the subject of non-issuer secondary market transactional exemptions under section 481, that is for transactions by a person other than an issuer underwriter or dealer and for broker transactions executed in reliance on 4A3 or securities of companies who report under 13 and 15D of the Exchange Act.  </p><p>      We should note here that for securities that are sold in reliance on 4A3 while enjoying coverage security status there are a handful of states that obligate an issuer to file a notice to claim pre-emption if you will for securities to be eligible, to be traded in their state in reliance on that pre-emptive provision.  </p><p>      There is also federal pre-emption of state regulation enjoyed by transactions in securities made in reliance on Section 4A4 of the 33 Act which deals with unsolicited broker transactions.  It would seem obvious that exemption has some limitations, particularly in the context of a desire to create and develop a robust secondary market in outstanding securities.  </p><p>      Certainly, if a broker cannot solicit its customers it cannot create a market and certainly if a broker seeks to share its research for a particular company with its clients that will also defeat an assertion that the transaction, if it were initiated by the client would be wholly unsolicited, making that exemption unavailable.  </p><p>      There is also an institutional investor exemption which all of you are familiar with, again that focuses on the nature of the investor as opposed to the type of transaction.  Although transactions with institutional investors don't enjoy coverage security status, it is a universal exemption at the state level.  </p><p>      The trouble of course in mentioning that exemption in the context of Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings or for the securities of very small emerging growth companies is that category of investor is not normally found making investments for those insecurities of those issuers.  </p><p>      So I question whether in the discussion about developing a robust secondary liquid market for Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers and securities of non-reporting non-listed public companies, whether the institutional investor exemption has any real validity.  </p><p>      Last, but certainly not least, is the exemption that Sarah mentioned, the so-called manual exemption.  Most of you are familiar with the state exemption that is currently available and depending on who you speak to 39 or 44 states.  And there that simple statement demonstrates why this is such a problem area.  There is not even unanimity on which states actually offer an exemption that is usable for secondary market purposes.  </p><p>      What does the manual exemption provide?  It offers an exemption for secondary trades in by non-issuers through a licensed broker- dealer, provided that the issuing company has financial and other information published in a designated standard manual.  </p><p>      Up until the middle of last year the two main reporting manuals were emergency Standard &amp; Poor's.  Standard &amp; Poor's has given up the ghost and it is no longer involved in the space.  However, I do understand that the OTC market has been developing its own manual to replace -- I suppose to replace the Standard &amp; Poor's manual that is their best markets.  </p><p>      And as I understand it with Vermont Michael, his state leading the way, it is now an accepted manual in 19 jurisdictions.  I think that's right with two others on board to adopt the manual as part of its manual exemption.  </p><p>      The obvious problem for purposes of our discussion this morning with the manual exemption is the -- A, the lack of complete coverage in all 54 U.S. jurisdictions of that exemption.  And further the fact that even among the states that have adopted a manual exemption there are substantive differences in how those exemptions are applied, focused on the type of uniform Securities Act that the state follows.    </p><p>      There are -- for those of you who do not know, two uniform acts that the states generally model their statutes after.  One is a 1956 Vintage Act that has been around for quite some time obviously, and the second is a more current updated version adopted in 2002, which about 20 states have adopted.  </p><p>      But again, the exemptions under both of those model acts differ, perhaps not substantially, but sufficiently that the lack of uniformity doesn't lend itself to promoting a national secondary trading exemption that is usable for companies that don't enjoy federal pre-emption.  </p><p>      A secondary market that must rely on these desperate exemptive provisions at the state level will of course be fragmented and far from the liquid secondary markets enjoyed by larger cap listed companies.  The question then is why our robust liquid secondary markets for smaller company is important, whether owning securities in large or small companies, investors generally don't want to hold their investments indefinitely.  </p><p>      A liquid secondary market allows investors to realize gains, minimize losses, generally make decisions to manage their portfolios and investments.  A liquid secondary market also helps issuers since even the prospect of a liquid secondary market makes it more likely that they will attract needed investment capital from potential investors who are short of an exit ramp for their investment, thus providing capital to foster job creation and entrepreneurial innovation.  </p><p>      Regulatory impediments to a robust secondary market frustrate those objectives.  This picture is not all wine and roses however, and unchecked market will undoubtedly offer opportunities for unscrupulous operators to gain the system to the financial disadvantage of the groups that would benefit from the most -- from a less rigid regulatory scheme; smaller companies and their investors.  </p><p>      So outer balance is equally important, but competing interests are robust and liquid secondary market is currently exists for exchange listed in SEC reporting company securities, must be based on real-time availability of information about a company.  </p><p>      The ability of an investor defined examine and rely on information that he or she deems critical to an investment decision, fosters investor confidence in the markets as much as the knowledge that regulators are standing by to protect their interests.  </p><p>      Certainly, though not ideal, the states manual exemption recognizes this fact since it relies on the availability of accurate, current information about an issuer as the basis for the availability of that exemption.  </p><p>      However, the lack of uniformity as I mentioned before, between and among the states in applying this exemption, coupled with the fact that more than a dozen states don't even recognize the exemption, frustrates investor efforts in many states to make investments based on what should be a coordinated, consistent regulatory environment.  </p><p>      Here then are my suggestions for addressing the lack of a meaningful secondary market liquidity for Reg A plus Tier 2 securities.  I'll address that first. </p><p>      In my view federal pre-emption should be extended to include all secondary market trades insecurities for the securities of a Reg A plus Tier 2 issuer.  This can be done through SEC rulemaking by refining the definition of qualified purchaser under section 18 to include any person who, in a secondary market transaction buys or sells a security of a Tier 2 issuer that is current in its reporting obligations.  </p><p>      This would result in any such security being a coverage security under Section 18 of the 33 Act, thereby allowing a secondary market for such securities to develop without the regulatory burden of having to ensure compliance with state law requirements for secondary market traits.  </p><p>      The current definition of qualified purchaser which is any person to whom securities are offered or sold in a Tier 2 offering contains a limitation on the amount of Tier 2 securities and non-accredited investor can purchase in a Tier 2 offering.  It's my belief that QP definition should be revised to make clear that this limitation would not apply to investors purchasing Tier 2 securities in a bonafide secondary market transaction.  </p><p>      To continue to allow disparate state regulatory requirements to apply to secondary market transactions in what are at the initial offering covered securities, frustrates the objectives of promoting creation and growth of vibrant small emerging companies by continuing to impose restrictions on the secondary market for these securities.  </p><p>      While taking the step to grant full pre-emption of State Securities Law to all transactions or Tier 2 securities is significant, the impediments imposed by continued regulation of secondary market transactions in Tier 2 securities to the ultimate success of Reg A plus will, to a large extent, be tied to relieving the duplicative and non-uniform state regulatory structure that exists today with a more market and investor-friendly approach.  </p><p>      Each Tier 2 issuer has substantial initial disclosure and ongoing reporting requirements which should work to relieve concerns of inefficient -- insufficient information available in the market for these issuers which is vital to the success of a robust secondary market.  </p><p>      I also have a proposal that I would like to share with the committee for facilitating secondary market trading by non-reporting, non-listed publicly trading companies.  For these issuers, available information may not be as fulsome as the type of ongoing reporting required under Title 4, and certainly under the Exchange Act.    </p><p>      State concerns over the type and quality of information for these companies argues for an increase in reporting that should be required of these non-Reg A Tier 2 non-reporting issuers.  The possible solution in my mind lies ironically, in the very regulatory structure that impedes the formation and maintenance of liquid secondary markets for these types of issuers.  </p><p>      A standard disclosure system comprised of a national standard securities manual model after the disclosures currently required to be included in the manuals that are accepted understate manual exemptions as the basis for supporting pre-emption of state law requirements over secondary market trading of securities of non-reporting, non-listed, non-rate Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers.  </p><p>      By requiring these issuers to include information that is consistent with what existing manuals currently require state concerns about a lack of current available information should be addressed, particularly if the states are partners in the development of such a national standard manual.    </p><p>      An example of a model that may be useful here, which I had mentioned earlier, is the recent success enjoyed by the OTC best markets manual, though I am not endorsing this particular vendor.  </p><p>      My intention is to mention it as an example of a disclosure delivery system that offers a way for non-reporting companies to deliver the breadth and depth of information that will help investors while also demonstrating to the states that their concerns about disclosure as a basis for assuring that investors can make fully informed decisions about companies they seek to invest in are being met.  </p><p>      Rulemaking that requires non-reporting public companies to publish information as required under current standards and including securities of issuers that need these heightened disclosure and reporting requirements could be added as a category of covered security in connection solely with secondary market trading of those securities.  </p><p>      I certainly recognize that this proposal would increase the cost to small issuers.  Of course they would have to pay fees in order to have their information included in this new standard manual.  However, on balance, the cost would be significantly less than would be incurred if such an issuer were to become a reporting issuer.  </p><p>      Moreover, the pre-emption problem for the states is, in my view addressed by having the states participate in setting the standards for disclosure.  Since a majority of states already offer a manual exemption assuming the new national manual provides the same or greater information.  The regulatory concerns of most states should be satisfied.    </p><p>      In closing I would, the advisory committee to recommend to the commission that each of these proposals be seriously considered as a means of starting or restarting the conversation around market liquidity for Tier 2 and non-reporting company issuers.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p>      Martin?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEWITT</emphasis>:  First of all I would like to thank Acting Chair Piwowar and Commissioner Stein and all of you for having us here today.  I want to take a different view of this, and step back from the \"P\" word, pre-emption, for just a moment. </p><p>      The question that I think is really important is what are the concerns of regulators generally and specifically the states.  And what I believe the problem is at this point is a concern by the states and others that there is not sufficient information available to the small investor on the buy side and sell side, obviously they hopefully know, although that's questionable too and I'll bring that up in a moment -- that there is a sufficient information for somebody to make an educated investment decision.  </p><p>      And I believe as someone pointed out, I'm to hear this for all the meetings, a while back, I believe that the Acting Chair Piwowar are made an interesting observation.  I hope I have this right and you are talking about the fact that in some ways we are no longer looking at capital formation and investor protection, but protection from fraud and prohibition of investing.  </p><p>      And that is something that sort of got me thinking back then, I have been thinking of sense and to me the question could be further refined of not investor protection, as investors I do not believe have to be protected per se.  What they need is to be empowered and by that I mean have sufficient information to make intelligent investment decisions.  </p><p>      I think that there are concerns from the states that when you do not have sufficient information, there are certainly various things that can take place, and although not necessarily in the Reg A plus market, I think to a certain extent it could be in publicly traded non-listed REITs and BDC's.  </p><p>      What often happens in against a similar sort of lack of liquidity situation you end up with what's called a many tender where vultures of some sort -- I'm probably not picking the best word -- would make an offer to unsuspecting investors to sell their securities way below the value of whatever it is at that time, even if it is depressed from the actual purchase price.    </p><p>      That is troubling on many levels because yes, there are disclosure requirements under Reg A plus, but are they as robust as they would be for listed company.  That is a question that I think has to be considered.  Also, to the extent that when you have a private offering, if somebody is interested in buying -- to get information from the company what you end up having is -- the bigger players have access to information that the small investor doesn't have.  </p><p>      So in fact, if we're concerned about is a level playing field and investor empowerment.  I think before we get to a discussion of pre- emption, we have the first think about what it is that is needed as a minimum for investors to be able to in fact make that intelligent decision.  </p><p>      And I think to a certain extent, 4A7 was a good indicator that which is -- Sarah knows that better than anyone -- that it had the backing of NASA because it had certain informational requirements, including knowledge of the you know, whose running the company, is it a going concern, up-to-date financials. </p><p>      So my concern is more a shift away from how we normally look at the situation and trying to look at this in a slightly different way which is instead of concentrating on pre-emption, we should all be discussing together not separately, as in leave the states out of with pre-emption, what is it that we can all agree on it as information required add a minimum as I said to make a cogent investor decision.  </p><p>      At this point, there are plenty of times where in fact you have situations in which the investor has very little information, reports to be filed are one thing, but if they just have the most basic of information, is that really what they need to make the decision and I suspect it is not, at least not in all cases.  So one thing that we would have to...  </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEWITT</emphasis>:  ... in fact it is not, at least not in all cases.  </p><p>      So one thing that we would have to consider is -- I know I am saying it a few times, but when -- another way looking at this is, what is it that all of us would like to see before making an investment decision and doesn't every investor have a right to have that which we all think we need to see personally sitting around the table.  </p><p>      And to the extent that we do, the question isn't necessarily pre- emption and I am not sure the states would even have a problem with pre-emption to the extent that their concerns about the information required is actually addressed now as Richard said, if you want to you, whether you have a more far-reaching manual exemption that is acceptable to all parties.  </p><p>      I don't think that is a bad place to start to think that in many ways it has worked except for there are a few holdouts states and for whatever reason.  But to the extent of there has to be pre-emption, I think it has to more not as in removing people from the table but making sure that everyone is able to see -- to say what -- they know that one of the states has one time said -- states has one time said to me that we want to facilitate investment not speculation.  With that information it can only be called speculation, and I think that really drives home the point.    </p><p>      So I think that if there is any recommendation I have it isn't so much to worry about pre-emption per se, it's to worry about address the concerns of the states as to information that at a bare minimum, we should have all et cetera.  But how we get there is a matter of discussion.  </p><p>      I just think that if one rushes to quickly to the pre-emption, to go to pre-emption without considering several things, including what is it that the states are concerned about so I won't take up too much time because I know we both plowed through a lot of it already.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Well, thank you both.    </p><p>      If I could just sort of kick-off the questions here, so we are focusing on the information is available before we get to the \"P\" word, does anyone here have any experience in how different disclosure under Reg A ongoing reporting is to what's in a manual.  I've got to confess that it's been a long time since I looked in manuals.  Maybe I was a junior associate sometime back in the 80s when I last looked at these things.    </p><p>      Seems to me, and I am hoping someone can challenge this, that when you look at the disclosure that's made under Regulation A and we have had now several companies go through a year's worth of disclosure, you have got ongoing reporting, you've got some annual reporting with audited financials, you got semi-annual with the unaudited financials, you've got one years -- you got a lot of companies filing 253 G2's supplement information to keep the information rolling.  </p><p>      How does those compare?  Is there anything in is there any way in which Reg A is not what you would want to see in manual because I remember those manuals, you just -- it was kind of unreadable.  Can we compare and contrast those two sources of information.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm actually glad that you brought up the fact that they are unreadable.  That's the other problem is that whatever information is available has to be in plain language, which I know is always a goal.  But since the more that we try to make plain language the goal, the document becomes thicker and thicker which is great for killing trees, but that's about it.  </p><p>      The comparison between the two, I couldn't tell you to the nth (ph) degree, but I think we also have to look at is obviously Reg A plus these offerings are of companies with little or no history and of course if you just, if somebody is flipping out of that in six months to a year, where is that investor during the interim report supposed to get information, the purchaser.  </p><p>      And I think that's the concern that although there may be information out there, is it of sufficient detail and also of sufficient comprehensibility to be of any use to the investor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  But would that be any different under the manual requirements, I am totally not up-to-date with manual requirements.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sarah I think that, it's fair to say that the reporting requirements that Tier 2 issuers are subject to while something less than 34 Act reporting, is something more than what is included in a manual.  </p><p>      The manual includes things like balance sheets, officers and directors, description of business, things that you would normally see that is a synopsis of a company and I think part of the thinking on the manual exemption is that that is certainly a starting point for an investor.  </p><p>      It is a collection of information that if an investor wants more information than they can go and find it either on Edger or wherever else.  But I think it's fair to say that Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers fall somewhere greater in their reporting responsibilities and of the information that they are required to report under Reg A plus, then they would need to under -- in a manual.  </p><p>      I would perhaps refer to Michael who may have more intimate experience with what his manual requires.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  And well, we'll get to Michael and then to Emma.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EMMA</emphasis>:  Potentially in a unique situation, which is I actually got security qualified under the manual exception three years ago, I think that I am not mistaken, but they no longer publish information in a book.  What they do is they will only allow you to qualify for the manual exemption of this is S&amp;P, where they are still doing the business.  If the information was being disseminated by a regulator.  </p><p>      So the only entities who could qualify for manual exemption at all, were banks, thrives, entities that were required to publicly provide information to a regulator or companies that were qualified to train an OTC markets under the alternative reporting standards.  </p><p>      So you can't just qualify for the manual exemption you actually have to be regulated in order to qualify for manual exemptions.  So I think that's a really important point to understand, you can't just put out Reg A plus Tier 2 materials to the SEC and qualify for manual exemption unless the manual exemption has been amended to make that clear.    </p><p>      Secondly, I think that -- and at least alternative reporting standards under OTC required more information than Reg A plus Tier 2, but that was to provide a trading market, it also has a $20,000 year cost, that some companies may not be able to bear with a manual exemption or S&amp;P.  </p><p>      I think the initial fee was maybe like 6000-5000 and so it was much less expensive to be qualified under (inaudible) than it is to do qualification under the alternative reporting centres, but you do get a trading market so I think it is really important to understand it's not just that you put some information in a book someplace that is no longer the case.  </p><p>      It is literally it has to go out through regulator and that is how they track that information is been updated and there is a cost associated with that.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Michael?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIWOWAR</emphasis>:  Thank you Sarah and good morning everybody.    </p><p>      So, I think that question specifically about what the differences are, when you're talking about the reporting requirements in the manual.  I think probably the Reg A Tier 2 reporting the things I reported are pretty equal if not greater, as Richard had said you know, I think some of the other requirements getting beyond was in the manual as components of the manual exemption like the fact it goes through a broker-dealer and that would be a distinction difference.  </p><p>      And (inaudible) there is -- you know, there is sort of baseline in terms of what type of company can qualify for manual exemption and I believe I had to, you know, had to look back at our statute, but you know, there is a period of time in which it has to be operating in a period of there's an asset value which has to be on its balance sheet.   </p><p>      So there is a sort of minimum standard, but the not familiar with the requirement that has to wither bank calling company or insurance company, but...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It wasn't that I said that information had to be disseminated by own regulator, it could just be on the company's website that was very clear (inaudible) we had a public website, (inaudible) put the information on the website to qualify and they said, no, you have to be -- that information has to be disseminated through a regulated entity so it was OTC, it was the banking regulators and it was OTC markets with the only option that would satisfy that condition according to S&amp;P three years ago.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But we're talking about the access to the information under the manual exemption?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So, again this is three years ago, I don't believe S&amp;P is going this anymore, when S&amp;P said us your offering document, we will review that but you have to have a system for sending information on ongoing basis and it has to be through a regulator, it could not just be our website.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But the exemption, the manual exemption at the state level is predicated on an independent third-party publication containing information that is provided by the issuer, right?  </p><p>      The problem, of course, in the context of a discussion on a liquid trading market for these types of issuers is the fact that not all states cover the -- recognize a manual exemption, and even in those states that do recognize the manual, we have a variety of different requirements, whether it's a 90 day waiting period or restricting trading to securities by non-affiliates.  </p><p>      So having the manual, the existing state manual be the basis for creating a robust secondary liquid market in these kinds of securities.  I don't -- I am not confident is achievable, which is why I suggested that the \"P\" word -- or why the \"P\" word has again raised its ugly head.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  However I think one of the things we have to consider as we're talking about the manual exemption right now is which is all well and good and perhaps there is one that can be the gold standard.  </p><p>      But in the meantime, part of what happens -- part of what I think the states are concerned about, you know, obviously part of the thing of being empowered investors also having the ability to get guidance from an advisor of some sort -- emption and removal of the broker- dealer or advisor so that the of the day it is a one-on-one transaction and the question is, the person who's selling, there's no oversight there whatsoever.    </p><p>      They are not, they are not representative of the company, they are not part of the issuer, they are selling and there's very little that, at this point, as far as I am concerned, that an unsuspecting and uneducated investor can rely upon in that situation, at least if there is a broker-dealer involved, you would hope that there is a minimal amount of guidance.  </p><p>      So I think that well, we're talking about the manual exemption, we have to also consider a slightly different point which is if it is on a one-to-one basis, how is that investor being protected by the seller?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Counter-point?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Go ahead.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  This is a Jane Curtin and (inaudible) sort of stuff going on and that's OK.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The one to one transaction is already covered under 4A1 and we have federal pre-emption for those kinds of transactions. I mean the one to one transaction doesn't concern me and I don't think is impassioned doesn't concern me and I don't think is impacted by the problems that we have spoken about relating to Blue Sky law.  </p><p>      I think the challenge is trying to figure out how to fit the current federal state regulatory scheme to facilitate a liquid secondary market where people come and go into the market, whether through market participants or otherwise without any significant impediment which is what we see today.    </p><p>      We see smaller companies struggling to convince their investors that they will have an exit strategy because there is no comprehensive uniform way for a company to tell a broker or to tell investors that their securities can be bought and sold in Iowa, as an example and I don't mean to pick on Iowa, if Iowa was listening.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Pick on Vermont instead.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Patrick, go ahead.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I can't remember Tier 2 requires to have a transfer agent?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I think so.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But if you had a transfer agent, I mean you could condition execution of the transfer -- the transfer agent get some sort of proof or representation that there was an exemption so that is a thought that I have had and you see that under rule 144, the transfer agent will transfer the trade -- will register the trade unless there is an opinion or form used to be -- I am not sure what exactly they require now.  </p><p>      That seems to me something you should think about, but I want to add this general observation and then another observation.  First of all, the illiquidity creates a discount so you can't go and sell then the weigh of your company is less, and so we all need to keep that in mind.  </p><p>      And the second thing is my observation has been that when regulation steps up and says you cannot do something, something in business people wanted to do, you cannot do it or it is very difficult to do it.  That's when you get noncompliance.  That's when people start looking, sneaking off from what their lawyers or whoever their broker is and they go in and they go around the law and do the deal.  </p><p>      I have said this before, I think our policy, state and federal, is that we facilitate compliance.  We shouldn't make compliance so hard people opt to violate the law.  That's just because it's difficult to or impossible, some cases you are just saying impossible.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Because you have conflict of laws between states or states and federal.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean it's just got -- it needs to be something there.  The other thing is that I think, I don't mean to pick on you, but I think the Blue Sky people are, you know, we have two conflict of interest here, we have investor protection of capital formation.  I think when you go into any securities regulator SEC, federal, state securities law -- OK, how many people here have ever signed the front of a buisness check?  (inaudible) you're gonna get very few hands raised.  </p><p>      So you need to educate people, it's regulatory agencies, capital formation, as part of their goal to say no and protect in the investor is not -- and at the end of the day, if you do that, there's no business (inaudible) trade or treasury.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But here's the thing in respond to that.  First of all you said that they are conflicting and I don't necessarily agree with that statement because it is not sufficient and not investor protection is again I think it is investment empowerment.  </p><p>      If there is a sufficient empowerment, if there is all just emphasis on capital formation then there will be furious people out there.  They are there and then what happens is the integrity of market fails and people will not invest and there goes your capital formation.  The point being is it has a balancing act and it's a very delicate one at that.  </p><p>      But I don't think anyone saying that these people shouldn't be able to invest.  I do not think the states are saying that, I think what the issue is really one of information and education.  How you get there is what the discussion has to be about with all the regulators all the regulars in the room.  </p><p>      That's basically what I am saying but I don't think that you can say that those are conflicting at all because without one the other is going to fail either way.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Ultimately, you are right. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  We'll get to Jonathon (ph).  I just wanted to respond on behalf of transfer agents who probably all turned white when you said that.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      We are looking at -- trying to make something less friction, we're trying to reduce friction and I think taking free trading securities and requiring the transfer agent to do something I think it's going to introduce our frictions.  I just wanted to make that point.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And is that a broker's job too?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  To reduce friction or to increase the friction?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I mean to the point of asking...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Yes I think that if you are looking at that who in this transaction has a role in doing the agent's information, it's going to be broker as opposed to and they do have those requirements as opposed to imposing these numerals on them on transfer agents.  We'll go to Jonathan.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  One of my experiences in the heavily regulated industries in a past life when I was a nurse and I worked in five different states and every state had a specific licensure that you actually had to maintain as a nurse.  </p><p>      But the number of states had actually gotten together and they had said you know what, we are going to give each other reciprocity, where if you actually qualify in the states as a nurse, it's a regulative simple process to go through to get a license in another state.  There is also a series of states called compact states.  I think there's about 23 states where they said we will just honor everybody else's licenses.    </p><p>      I think one of the interesting things about you know, about the SEC in government is you know, yes we regulate, but I also think that we have the ability to ask for to convene, do state securities regulators get together on a regular basis?    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Absolutely.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  I mean has there been discussion and -- I mean forgive my ignorance, is there discussion about can we create a program where there is reciprocity across these states?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  No, plain and simple.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  There is a -- and we're going to barge the words, I'm just (inaudible) this point.  There is a uniform process at least on the registration level with the states now when you go through Reg A plus Tier 2, so it's not like there is just a morass I think that the states are certainly working towards the goal of more uniformity and of course the punch line to the 56 Act and the 2002 Uniform Securities Act is nothing's uniform by the time the legislators get done with it. So, you know, that -- that's part of the problem.    </p><p>      The one thing I just wanted to address very quickly though is when it came to the one-to-one transaction, I still think that there is potential there pre-emption or not for the small investor to be taken advantage of by somebody who just wants to dump their stock and I think is that is probably a concern of the states, although I can't speak for them.  But in terms of what you are saying, especially with the nurses license, it's actually in fact, now lawyers is a common BAR exam, my grand-son should have started for a couple on them.  </p><p>      So, there is more reciprocity in various areas within the states now, has it risen to the blue skylight area yet?  Not to that level, but that doesn't mean that -- that they are not working or trying to get the states together to make it more uniform or more user-friendly.  </p><p>      Because again I don't think the states are trying to prohibit capital formation.  I think as you said, sometimes -- or I think Patrick said, sometimes you can actually protect the investor ultimately, by just not letting him invest and therefore there will be no problem.  </p><p>      But that doesn't really solve the issue, which is why it is a true balancing act and again, although I keep on drumming this point, is that we have to make sure that those issues that those scenarios that have resulted in investors being defrauded are addressed.  I mean we can't do away with all fraud.  The key is to minimize as much as you can like a perfectionist isn't perfect, they just try damn hard not to make as many mistakes as everyone else.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But counterpoint.  In answer to your question, as the discussion about the standard manual illustrates that, exemption has been around from the beginning of time, OK?  It's an accepted exemption, but there are 54 different jurisdictions, each one of them has their own view about what that exemption means.  </p><p>      Yes, I get that investor protection is a significant interest that needs to be recognized, but I question whether this lack of uniformity as a basis for regulation, is protecting anyone.  I mean, certainly the states continue to retain their fraud authority and if there is a bad actor and an investor is harmed, they will complain to their state regulator and that regulator has the full breath of its of its securities law, arsenal to go after those fraudsters.  </p><p>      But different to, you know, your experience with nursing licenses.  The states jealously guard their own interests particularly by insisting that they alone understand the specific needs of investors and their particular jurisdiction, which I don't doubt, but -- and perhaps has validity in the context of primary offering review, I get that.  In the case of a secondary market transaction, particularly for companies where there will be information available. </p><p>      For example, Reg A plus Tier 2 issuer which says, fulsome disclosures under the new law or non-reporting public companies that have information including in a national manual.  </p><p>      The particular needs of the state I think, need to take -- a backseat is the wrong word, but a backseat to the interests of developing a market, a liquid market in securities that benefits everyone, not just the people in Iowa and not just the people in Vermont.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I just -- every single lawyer that I have ever talked to about, if you are actually going to sell a security and going to the Blue Sky laws, they are just like too dumb.  But that is the third rail.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Give them my number.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But it's essentially -- I do not think that there is an efficient market at all because you just can't create it.  And I think ultimately, that ends up hurting the smaller, less wealthy states, and it essentially starts concentrating business in large wealthy cities because it tends to become who you know and it tends to be who you went to school with and if you went to a school with a bunch of wealthy people then you can essentially go and start a business and create security and end up selling it.  </p><p>      And if you are poor and you want to start a business, you really can't start a business unless you can completely bootstrapping without any capital.  I am just saying, it feels very, very, very broken to me and can we convene these state regulators and just say, dudes let's just sit in a room and let's just work it out.\"  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You got to understand that first of all, NASA has several meetings throughout the year of the states, but again you put all of us in this room we have different ideas slightly or greatly. But I think one thing you have to understand -- I've been in securities industry now for 35 years which frightens me on many levels, but you know, there was a day when there was between the states and practitioners and issuers.  </p><p>      But overtime I have seen that shift dramatically and you know, one thing that that NASA is always trying to do and they do meet with several groups throughout the year and we are always trying to talk about quote, \"low hanging fruit\", what can we accomplish.  And this is one of those areas where I don't think anyone is saying that there shouldn't be more information or there should not be more easily understood information.    </p><p>      I think it's a matter of having that discussion, but not everyone their own little corner, but you out in the open and having the robust discussion but I don't think the states are all sitting and going, wow, how can I make myself so different as to totally derail anyone trying to either sell a security or raise funds to build a business. I don't think that's the mentality. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But wasn't that discussion had -- during the lead up to the adoption of Title 4?  My recollection is that there was...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  I just want to get to Laura (ph), she's been trying to get a word in.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I just want to take this back to I think something the committees talked about several times which is, what is the public policy benefit of requiring a Tier 2 reporting company to also qualify for manual exemption or to list under the attorney of reporting standards under OTC markets.  </p><p>      That prohibition means as Jonathon was saying, there is no opportunity for another market to develop, there's not an opportunity for another broker-dealer or ECN or any other parkit to try to create an efficient trading system for what are generally publicly offered and should be (inaudible) securities.  </p><p>      So I think we go back to the original conversation, I think back (inaudible) there was a real push to get pre-emption for Tier 2 securities where the information being made publicly available that end up coming off the table in the final vote, but we've had, you know, some time now to look at how the market is adjusting.  I've made the comments before at least one or two times that we did a real deep dive and look at Reg A plus after it got enacted and all of the banks that we spoke to for the most part so they would not be touching Reg A as an offering option for their client companies because their investors (inaudible) unless there was clear liquidity for securities, people are not going to invest in securities.  </p><p>      An idea that right now if you are investing in one of the 103 companies that have been qualified issue Reg A plus securities, there's no trading market for the securities, how's that beneficial to the people who are investing in that?  </p><p>      They're stuck in securities unless the company goes through a process and I -- you know, fully supported and respect OTC markets, they are providing a great option, they are the only option for trading the securities, and you have to go through a process, you have to pay, you know, not insubstantial annual fee.  And you have to find more disclosure than it is actually required in the offering, or in the ongoing voluntary reporting.    </p><p>      It just doesn't seem it is (inaudible) policy or investor protection benefit that I see as being provided by that kind of activity and it's a detrement to Reg A plus and to the market developing and I tell people that's (inaudible) in dealing with insurers regulatory dates.  </p><p>      And just from a cost perspective, regulatory compliance because each of the states are different very much like we are talking about here only, they are low bit more advanced and they are complaints for all the things we are going to get together with, you know, work together and they come up with this common thing and they put it together and they put it on top of all their existing requirements.  </p><p>      So, it's fine that it created jobs, it's great, it's a cost that gets passed on to the consumer, cost of operating for the company so in the company that I worked at, I probably had about 15 percent dedicated only to state compliance reporting.  </p><p>      So, think about what that means, 15 percent of that body count that we had and if we are actually only making the 6 percent bottom line and some bad years because it's insurance.  But best maybe 20, that compliance component, even though it is not for the whole component, it was costing.  So therefore, what happens if you want a state -- company to do business in all 50 states, you got to be big.    </p><p>      I worked with a big company and they said we just wanted to be able to say that we were listed in all 50 states and you know, it gave them additional market branding, et cetera.  Or you have small companies, insurance companies, and the only specialized in one, sounding familiar here, right?  </p><p>      And so therefore anybody in the middle, it's economically infeasible.  So (inaudible) I think it is great, but better people probably have tried before so unfortunately, as much as it pains me to say this federal is probably the only way to go at that point and time.    </p><p>      However, the second point that I want to get to is, we are talking about increasing the availability of -- just increase in the market right so we don't worry about the institutional investors out there, they can take care of themselves.  </p><p>      We don't worry about the small people, you know, they're dealing all the small people, they are doing the one offs who actually know the business that they are investing in and again now we are talking about the mid, and the mid just disappears, right?  </p><p>      And so to add (inaudible) down into the details and whatever, if we have our goal to accelerate the investment at mid-level which means they're theoretically much more (inaudible) not investor, there's probably something in between regarding a regulatory perspective that we can take which I totally understand about working within the context we have because I don't think we are going to be able to check mid-level, which means there business people feel that it is a viable investment alternative.    </p><p>      They will figure out a way to create that which will probably, it could be 90 percent of the time it really works, the 10 percent that fails but (inaudible) it will be enough to kill it.  Eventually, and then as an economy all we do is heard so that's a (inaudible).  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  If I could add to that, I think if you are looking for something to sell pre-emption I think pretty sure for states in fraud and (inaudible) fraud, in coordination with the SEC and the Justice Department, I don't know how you would do that.  I mean I think everybody agrees that there is finally a fraud out there to go and trace it.    </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Are the Russians doing this?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Anyway, I think that's my only comment really, I don't have anything to add, but I think that does seem to me if we're bellybutton gazing and thinking deep thoughts that is one off thought put the states in fraud, if that matter regulating transactions.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Mr. Patrick, we'll get to Michael and then Jenny.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Thank you.  So I just want to address quickly (inaudible) a point that was made by Patrick and Jonathan, just to give some information in terms of what the states do and whatnot and the insurance regulator context, you know, I mean the state regulators are the only regulator of insurance market and states do coordinate quite efficiently on the insurance side.  </p><p>      My opinion of his accreditation for states they have to have certain requirements, or they are not part of the NAIC and similarly on the NASA side, you know, we have two annual meetings a year, we have a Board of Directors, we have a whole structure that works up issues through committees up to the board, you know, disseminated out to the membership and I encourage you to come to the NASA meeting you know, when you have an opportunity to and I'm sure we would appreciate inviting you.  </p><p>      But to again serve some veins to Patrick's point, I mean you know, the states have been very -- in my opinion they are very responsiveness in capital formation arena in the last few years, we take to heart this issue of the balance you know, the balance between investor protection capital formation because you know, on one hand, as you mentioned what happens if we focus too much in capital formation.  </p><p>      But if we focus too much on investor protection, the opportunities to invest, the opportunities to grow retirement, to create jobs that goes way too which is not good for the investors. That balance is very important.    </p><p>      Martin alluded to the coordinator review that the states implemented in Tier 1 Reg A , this in our opinion, takes the burden off the individual issuer, puts it on the states to coordinate and get the specific comments out to the issuer's (inaudible) capital formation arena in the last few years.  </p><p>      We take to heart this issue of the balance you know, that the balance between investor protection capital formation because you know the one hand, as you mentioned, what happens if we focus too much on capital formation, but if we focus too much on investor protection you know the opportunities to invest, the opportunities to grow retirement to create jobs that goes way too which is not good for the investors.    </p><p>      That balance is very important, Martin alluded to the coordinator review that the states implemented in Tier 1 Reg A , this in our opinion, takes the burden off the individual issuer, puts it on the states to coordinate and get the specific comments out to the issuers.  </p><p>      We have grade of capital formation amount of those discussions, we have worked more collaboratively with the SEC in recent years, rule 147 A and other initiatives and I hope we can continue to do that.  So states have been very proactive in this area and we have you know, vendor engagement, the OTC markets just to comment, OTC markets came to us in March or April of last year to Vermont and said you know, the S&amp;P manual is going away.    </p><p>      There is only merchants now we look to that state regulators and said there should be more options we were concerned about that, we were the first movers they came to us in March we had a rule implemented in July of that same year, 19 states as Richard had said followed suit, three others have announced they are going to.  So the states do act and we do communicate regularly and you know, try to lead these initiatives on quite ongoing basis.    </p><p>      Announced they are going to so the states do act and we do communicate regularly and you know, try to lead these initiatives on quite ongoing basis.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I have a question about state and regional secondary markets.  I know in the past we had a lot of more local exchanges -- state-level exchanges...  </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  ... there is some benefit to being able to buy and sell securities in your own states.  I am just curious if that has been tried at all.  You know, what was the success of that, is that something we can consider reviving.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think the demise of the regional exchanges was clearly an economic issue.  I mean, you know, it costs a lot of money to do that stuff.  And while you know, there may be some theoretical benefit to reviving the concept of regional exchange while you know, there may be some theoretical benefit to reviving the concept of regional exchange, I mean Reg A plus Tier 2 is billed as a platform for national securities offerings.  </p><p>      So, at least in the context, and correct me if I am wrong, but at least in the context of Reg A plus Tier 2 offerings, regional exchanges I don't think would necessarily solve the problem.  </p><p>      And then I suppose the one way that you could implement that is to designate whatever regional exchanges are formed as national securities exchanges under section 18, but if I remember my section 18 provisions correctly, any national exchange has to meet the same standards or similar standards to the NYSE, NASDAQ.  </p><p>      So, you know, I wonder whether we could ever get back to what used to be the Midwest exchange, specific exchange in Cincinnati and like.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I would love to hear Michael's comments on that too and also whether this is been discussed at NASA and maybe it doesn't have to be an exchange, maybe it could be some kind of bulletin board or something like that.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I guess my initial reaction sort of piggyback on Richard's saying you know, economic component, not just running the exchange, but on the other side, I mean the supply, the demand, I mean the business element, I mean the illiquidity, lack of people wanting to buy the securities and I don't think -- I think that is probably the discussion that we should have in terms secondary trading now and its larger discussion as well because regardless of, you know, the regulations or whatever in place I mean it is actually demand.    </p><p>      You know, people want to achieve liquidity and sell their investment, but if somebody willing to buy it and we are talking about, what we are talking about today we're talking about smaller companies, small investors, mom-and-pop investors that are doing initial buying and doing subsequent buying and selling so is not institutional investors, not largely sophisticated investors.  </p><p>      I think that's why the investor protection elements you know, are important to considerations.  So, you know, I think it's economic and, you know, and businessmen in terms of supply and the demand of the securities.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Just a couple of points.  One is and I think that Richard mentioned it when he was talking about the different exemptions and secondary trading at the state level.  There is a complete disconnect between the secondary trading exemption at the state level for broker-dealers and at the federal level, so the context of IPS for example, and I think (inaudible) original offerings.  </p><p>      A broker dealer who has an existing relationship and I think I have said to the committee before, a broker dealer has a pre-existing relationship with a client, has done suitability, understands their investment criteria, has confirmed the status in the investor.    </p><p>      Can market any opportunity in a primary context to their clients as long as they believe that are suitable for them.  It is the exact opposite in the secondary context because of the state law, the sky requirements which are that a transactions for a broker dealer must be unsolicited.  </p><p>      That means that if I'm a broker-dealer, I can go out to every one of you if we have a relationship say would you like to buy Reg A plus primary offering, but I can't touch any of you to ask you if you want to buy the securities and secondary market, that doesn't make any sense.    </p><p>      It has never made sense to me, these are clients of broker- dealers and again pre-emption solves that problem.  Pre-emption allows a broker dealer to go out and touch their existing clients, not in a personal way, but (inaudible) way and asked them are you interested in investing in these securities.  </p><p>      That is the only way we're going to develop a robust secondary market around these type of securities, brokers have to be able to do their job.  They have to be able to locate by said interest, they have to make sure that the investment suitable for their investors, that's how you get the investor protection.  </p><p>      You have the disclosure point already out there, then you have the broker-dealer protection and to Jenny's point, I don't think you're going to see NASA exchanges come back into the fray as a result of electronic trading -- I'm sorry regional exchanges because of electronic trading the cost structure is just not there I think to support regional exchanges, which is why most of them were acquired and as a matter of financial interest.  </p><p>      Yeah, but I think where you are seeing is and maybe an increased proliferation of platforms, web-based platforms that are in the primary space that could be in the secondary space for Reg A plus securities crowd funding portals that there are a multitude of players who are out there, who would be able to create a business model around this if it made economic sense if they had the pre-emption for secondary training.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  I think where it was saying on that point time.  If you look at how many ATS there are at the moment I was just counting them from the other day from the most recent update.  I think this might 41 and some of those and some of those are clients are looking to be secondary markets for Reg A securities as well.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And they can't because the Blue Sky...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  It is more difficult for them because that, yes.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  When I worked on getting the security approved first for Blue Sky manual purposes, it's a big deal that you cannot do it in all 50 states.  It should not underplay that, it's a big deal.  What if you are issuer in state that doesn't have a manual exemption, you can't actually -- why would anybody buy your securities if they know for sure, you can't ever get secondary liquidity, it is a big deal that it is not in every state.  It is a big deal, that is a patchwork of requirements that it takes significant expertise such as these gentlemen to hire a lawyer, to walk you through the requirements in every single state.  </p><p>      We did that when I was in second market, we did a big deep dive into the secondary market.  You guys have seen me, I have presented to NASA, it is a patchwork of unintelligible requirements that are driven by legislation securities commissioner interpretations.  That sort of thing it is not consistent across all 50 states.  So, again don't underplay the fact that OTC zoning approved in potentially 19 states, that's a big deal.  And that is a real fiction impediment to market being created around Reg A securities.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Michael?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIWOWAR</emphasis>:  So I think there is -- I just want to address the one point the unsolicited broker.  I am not expert in this arena, but there certainly securities as you probably heard the phrase that are not bought but are sold, you know and I think that sort of the driving impetus behind the unsolicited portion of the broker dealer unsolicited exemption may not -- you know, on the OTC piece and I will just mention, you know, there's 19 states are within the last seven or eight months...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIWOWAR</emphasis>:  Yes, but you know, the speed in which we have done it I think is pretty rapid, particularly when you look at some other historical context.  So you know, I think that's an element to take into place.  And then I think the other point is, don't want to lose -- I made this point already but I don't want us to lose this idea about the information requirements that these investors need to make an intelligible investment decision.  </p><p>      You look at the SEC Joshua White, I think it was an interesting report recently, study that looked at the OTC and I encourage everybody to read it but essentially look to the three tiers and as you move down in the tiers, the outcome for the investor and also liquidity decreases and I won't put an adjective there, I won't say rapidly decreased, but there's a -- there's a there is a correspondingly decrease in investor outcome when there's less information as a correspondent to decrease in liquidity when there's information.  </p><p>      So I think the requirements in the framework that we're talking about are not all just for investor protection.  I mean there are investor protection, but you know, there are also for the efficiency of the capital markets and ensuring there are sufficient information there for the flow of funds, flow of information, flow of securities.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So what you are saying is information drives the markets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIWOWAR</emphasis>:  That's what this report would suggest.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, exactly.  And that's why as I was saying earlier, it has to do with making sure that the investors in power to be able to make those decisions without that information they are not going to buy anything.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIWOWAR</emphasis>:  And doesn't that argue for pre-empting the non-uniform current state regulatory scheme with a category of covered securities specific to Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers who are subject to fulsome information requirements.    </p><p>      I mean, would you be satisfied as a regulator that the information that Reg A plus Tier 2 issuers are required to provide under statute sufficient for purposes of allowing a secondary market transaction in your state if they were -- let's assume that they were included in your manual, they would meet that requirement and you would be fine, right?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean speaking of solely Vermont regulator, you know, are manual exemption requirements are self-executing as I think they are everywhere so you know, what that means is for those in the committee is that they do not file a notice fine with us if they don't get our prior approval and they don't contact us, they look at the requirements, they meet them, they execute the transaction which, you know, provides efficiency on the transaction side. </p><p>      So, you know, for Vermont, if those guardrails stayed in place, you know, whether it's in our stature or federal statute you know, the guardrails are in place, the investors are protected, the information is out there.  But you know, there is certain -- that's a Vermont standard and I can't say the same for even those in New England or those in another part of the country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIWOWAR</emphasis>:  But that's all more important fact that in coming up with whatever that federal \"X\" might be, it has to be in consultation with the states that there is a standard upon which the states can agree.  And then there is really no need at that point, you are satisfied with the information being provided and you take it from there, but I don't -- as you said this is self-explanatory, point one.  </p><p>      Point two is, I don't think the issue is pre-emption or not.  As I said earlier, I think it is making sure there is consistent information, if that takes the form of pre-emption, I would think as long as it is in consultation with NASA with the states and some they can get behind, well at least that's an easier road to take I think.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But the framework already exists.  The informational framework already exists at the state level in a majority of states. And the effort here would be to unify what is a fragmented regulatory scheme and if the only way to achieve that is through pre-emption, well you know, it's an unfortunate situation.    </p><p>      I suppose if you are a state regulator, but the majority of state regulators currently offer exemptions for secondary market trades provided there is information available, 39, 44, whatever the number is so in order to get to that goal line of full compliance 54 jurisdictions so that you can then give the secondary markets for these kinds of issuers a fighting chance to survive.  Well, then perhaps pre-emption is the fix.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Can we say on the point of pre-emption and the secondary markets here because a point you made earlier Richard was, if we do pre-emption we should do pre-emption on the basis of the qualified purchases being just someone who buys and Reg A, period.  No restrictions on the investment levels as they are on primary market.    </p><p>      This is a question for both of you, is the secondary market, why would you make that distinction?  Is there less pressure in the secondary trade and I don't think I am hearing that front from Martin. Or is that the information somehow more sufficient in a secondary trade than is primary trade?  Why make that distinction and how is the secondary trade different than the primary?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALVAREZ</emphasis>:  Well, I think with the secondary trade at that point, you know, you're one generation sort of speaker removed from the issuer and from the IPO and the need for more robust disclosure, I think it's primal critical on the secondary trade, if I understand your question correctly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  So you would need more information...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALVAREZ</emphasis>:  Not necessarily more, but equal too.  Because what happens is there is you know as -- once you've done with the IPO, the company, the issuer has the money now we are just talking about moving money between moving money and securities between investors and the question is, since you can't go -- the investor cannot go and call up the chief financial officer of the issuer, you do not kick the tires for speaking the same way for institutional investor might.  I think that what you are saying is you need sufficient information, what that is again is obviously up to discussion and disagreement.  </p><p>      But I think that's why it's important at the secondary level to make sure that what you may not have disclosure equal to that which is on a national exchange -- although that's to me the goal of standard and I understand there is a lot of expense involved with that and it could be prohibitive for it to produce information, there still has to be sufficient information, such that the investor is going in with his or her eyes wide open as to the risks and rewards.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  And that is different than in the primary situation and try to (inaudible) on the one on one thing here that way you gone a buyer who is just going out there with and posted some securities and said -- sorry a seller who has posted securities, I am selling securities and then as a seller who comes along with and there is no broker involved so they are searching, \"oh this is an interesting company\", is there a different dynamic there in the secondary market than it would have been in the primary?  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it has to do with the relation...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sorry what's that?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  If there prohibition secondary market right now, you know the issuer as an obligation, I think to make sure that it is unclear thing under Reg A who has the obligation to make sure that the cap's not exceeded, but how would you do that in the secondary sense.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  It's self-certification anyway.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes OK.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But the question is whether or not, as you said there is a difference.  I know I would venture to say the primary distribution, the investor is relying on the issuer to provide the information that it needs to make that to make that investment, and in the secondary market, it's just you know, a normal contract.    </p><p>      You know, you have a good to sell, and I can decide whether or not to buy it based on whatever information is out there.  The fact that I am or am not a qualified purchaser or a suitable purchaser should not matter because those funds are not going to the issuer, which is where suitability requirements are normally found.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You think that makes a difference from the investor protection point of view and as that's actually a question from (inaudible).  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think at that point, there has to be some watchdog, some minimal amount of -- and I hate to use the words protection and empowerment of the investor so that they -- at that point they really just left their own resources so they can find the information great, if they can't that's too bad.  And to the extent that they decide to buy from this person, well why are they buying is it because they have done thorough research or is it just because it is a dartboard investment.  </p><p>      And for the small investor dartboard investment can be devastating to the retirement so my concern is that as you move further away from the issuer, the investor really is going out of haphazardly and not necessarily getting all the information that could be out there, whether it is accurate or not.  I mean to getting this from the seller at that point.  So, it's only so much diligence the a small investor can do for his or herself.  And I think that's a concern to me which is why a universal manual exemption which I don't think we disagree unnecessarily, is certainly stepping in the right direction.  </p><p>      Now whether or not that takes the form of pre-emption.  You know, that depends again as long as the if you can get the states on board, there some errors in which look -- even Bill Baydian, his testimony before Congress in May 1, 2014, clearly stated there sometimes there are some instances in which it is not every wrong that there is pre- emption.  It is not that it should never occur.  The thing is to make sure that what you are doing is well-thought-out and addresses the issues that the states if they were not pre-empted would address.  </p><p>      And I think that's one of the key considerations here is to figure out exactly where, how much information, what sort of information, how it is verified for the small investor.  The larger investor can get all the information he or she wants.  You know, that is that is not an issue.  The question is what is the small investor getting from whom and how can they rely on and that's that is my concern.  I suspect that might be the concern of states, but I'm not speaking on their behalf.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Is it Andrew or Laura?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I actually wanted to just bring out a comment, no matter what we do or we choose not to do I think we really need to understand what the implication is to the general economy and all states.  So, right now as how it's in my opinion, how it's laid out, it favors certain economic areas.  So even if we stay status quo, we don't do anything else, to Jonathan's point, frankly everybody here, the money's going to stay where the money knows, has the relationship in certain economic centers.    </p><p>      And what we do is continue that process as we go along and then actually to the point, Michael I think you know, when you were talking you are asking Sarah about that secondary you know, what's the difference between the first and secondary?  And we are talking (inaudible) basically longer the company has been in business isn't that assigning in another self that this has a higher... </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But the question is how are these companies necessarily in business when somebody flips out this...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We don't ask these questions about listed companies.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Exactly, you don't do that.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It should be noticed that, noted that during 2008 during the crash, almost a third of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange went away.  So it's not that there is any guarantee there either and that's what is important for people to understand the small investor.  I mean all of us we get this, is that an investment is not a guaranteed rate of return and the problem is, a lot of investors think that they invest, they sit there in the money rolls in.  So, that is another different educational standpoint.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The question to me occurs are we here and are we really just trying to protect a certain layer of investor or what about the balance on the other side to encourage business.  I will...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it is balancing.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It is both, that's what I'm saying.  So I think that when we're talking about -- and I could be wrong, totally wrong.  I want to protect the investor to the extent that the investor should be protected.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't disagree with you.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And part of me says that you made the comment...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Is someone taking their whole investment portfolio, and they are buying stock in the secondary market without a bigger issue, right?  So really realistic where we're trying to target our efforts here is to that middle layer of investor's that has funds, OK? That is knowledgeable and can actually flow a lot of capital into that to grow companies.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But that's not probably company on the secondary market.    </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Just thought of an idea, so I just thought you know, we created a regime where there is this new type of platform under Title 3 of the Jobs Act.  What if there was a platform for secondary trading of Reg A securities that if things were traded on the -- you know, in the same way with the platform for Title 3, there is pre- emption, but the platforms have to meet certain requirements, they have to do certain kinds of investor education, could that be a potential solution? </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes.  But on the crowd funding side, there were very, very discreet and particular requirements on who can operate a portal I mean that's you know, that's but -- and I think that that...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Not that hard to become a portal believe me.    </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But -- OK.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You should see some of the portals out there, no offense.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't know, I guess I am biased, I view crowd funding a little differently than I view standard securities offerings.  And in the context of Reg A plus and Reg A plus Tier 2 specifically, as I commented earlier, I think the expectation is that this new regulatory scheme will promote a national type of a securities market and it should look more like what we are accustomed to seeing exchange listed, reporting company, securities rather than what is currently in place for crowdfunding which is at least for me as a Blue Sky lawyer a totally different end (ph).  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I think crowdfunding for a lot of Blue Sky attorneys is -- yes, thank you.  It's a scary area because there is so much potential for chicanery there as opposed to Reg A plus.  </p><p>      But that doesn't mean that there are not issues to address there as well.  But I think the crowdfunding platform is not necessarily, although it's a good idea.  I don't know how it would actually work because again it is apples and oranges in terms of the caliber of what is being offered.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right, I'm just making the analogy of a platform that has to be qualified by the SEC and in exchange for meeting a bunch of requirements.  There is pre-emption at the state level filings.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But Sarah mentioned there are a boatload of ATS out there that could serve as that platform.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  They went through already registered broker dealers.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Registered broker-dealers, right.  And then the question becomes if you're looking to use that as a vehicle to pre- empt state law under Section 18 there are particular criteria that have to be met for these ATS's and these exchanges to be able to have securities listed on them be deemed covered securities.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Do you have a question?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I also think a great way to lose a lot of money in a private market investment is to make like two investments or one.  And the proper way to do it is to actually build a portfolio of 20 to 25 companies so you have things like angel groups, and that sort of stuff that actively encourage a lot more of this type of investment.  </p><p>      And so I think that the current regulatory scheme not only does it not form a capital formation, but with the very, very, very low, almost non-existent volume of secondary transactions, investors are actually really hurt because they can't build portfolios.  </p><p>      And one of the frequent comments that I hear from angel investors who are actively building these portfolios is liquidity.  And so were essentially dependent on a very active merger and acquisition market which ends up consolidating companies which ends up decreasing the number of jobs because the merger and acquisition process is about consolidation, making large companies much more profitable.  </p><p>      And so the current way that we have is investors aren't making money, when they can make these sorts of investments they are at very high risk to actually lose the money, we're not having capital B-form for small businesses and we're having a lot of these really large massive corporations be formed and we're having less and less public companies.  </p><p>      And if -- the Angel Capital Association, how much money is actually invested in annual basis by angels to have that data?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Last year it was around $27 billion, right.  $27 billion.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I think venture is about $50 billion a year, so that's about $75 billion.  But the lottery is a $65 billion a year business.  And I know that the lottery is targeting poor people and they are losing a ton of money at that.  </p><p>      I don't know, it feels like something is very broken and if we're expecting these small businesses to create these jobs, especially non- urban areas, I really think that something just got to change.  I would be interested like on the committee, you know, pre-emption versus not pre-emption.  I'm just interested in going around the table what do people think should be done.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  That was going to be my next question because we've got like 10 minutes left and I'd like to see if we can make this into a recommendation.  Are we interested in giving a recommendation?  Bear in mind that the people that we give recommendations to here is the SEC, not to the States, alright.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sarah, before the recommendation I just make one statement which is that -- I mentioned this in my earlier statements but the SEC and the states, that are really collaborative productive relationship I think for long time but -- well, go ahead Sebastian.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOMEZ</emphasis>:  I second on that.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I know and particularly as of late and we very much enjoy working Betsy and Sebastian and when Keith was here -- so when you're considering the recommendation I mean, you know, looking for ways for the states and the SEC to collaborate on this issue together I hope will be part of the consideration.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sarah, if I just make one other editorial comment that -- recall that the original Regulation A died on the vine, principally because of concerns relating to burdensome state requirements.  No one used that form and it went away.  So you know, this latest iteration should be given a chance to grow.  </p><p>      And to Mike's point, I mean as I suggested in my comment about perhaps a solution being the establishment of the national manual, states certainly have a role to play in that.  They have -- they need to have a seat at the table because they are the policeman, those are the folks who are going to be enforcing the fraud actions when these investors lose their money.  </p><p>      And you know, if it involves a recommendation to pre-empt Tier 2 securities and secondary market transactions well the state should be involved in that discussion as well.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So we are in complete agreement now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Duly noted regarding the State SEC dynamic that we want to encourage but can we just go around the table and hear what people have to say, especially people who you haven't heard much from this morning.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sure.  I'm all for having a centralized information portal I guess, for lack of a better word that would allow the secondary transactions to happen.  I think definitely the states should be involved in that and what the standard is.  </p><p>      But there needs to be some sort of regulation on it and if we're taking the states out of that decision and then having them regulated. That's not a very good solution.  So I guess my answer is, yes, I'm all for having an essential information repository.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't think we'll get anywhere with that.  The state involvement, I think -- I do think like the apprehension from Reg A plus Tier 2 but I do think anything is going to have to have state involvement with it.  </p><p>      I'll commit from a small copy like that worrying about trying to raise money in different states, it is a big concern from our standpoint.  It's very, very difficult to have state to go through this.  But again, it's going to have to be a joint effort here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Generally pre-emption, not pre-emption?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't know, I think there is room for a lot of creativity here.  I like the idea of some kind of a pilot program, maybe just within a single state.  I think Jonathan and I would volunteer to help out with that in our state, California.  </p><p>      And look at what would -- because California is a huge economy, if we limited secondary trading to just California we might learn a lot from that without having to do pre-emption and then maybe go from there.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sarah, I am in favor of the pre-emption.  One of the things I think about -- again, coming from investor's point of view, is I look at the impact on the economy, what happens when we get a liquidity event and we put that money into play into other companies, other start-up companies or we put it into play buying a piece of real estate or we put it into play to buy other things and so that what you get is the multiplier effect on the economy.  </p><p>      And when you can't -- when you don't have liquidity, you impact the economy and we don't know what that impact is.  So let's see, I'd be very much in favor of something that's capitally efficient.  It's a balance that includes the states and it's another opportunity for us to have a very vibrant economy.  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Jonathan?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think the best way to create a market is to make it as big as possible and have as many buyers at the table and as many sellers at the table as possible.  The last time I talked to someone about doing a California State exemption, the California state regulators said that they were ready to do dozens of these approvals every single year.  </p><p>      That just doesn't feel like a very large volume and it's not saying that -- it's not saying that they are not doing an amazing job and that is not a very hard job, and it's a thankless job because if there is fraud you get spanked and if there is capital formation, no one cares that you did your job.  </p><p>      But I think that these markets need to be as big as possible and they need to be as liquid as possible.  Otherwise the investors get spanked.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Michael, I don't know who first said it, genius is somebody who sees a trend coming and runs to embrace it.  I think this -- I mean we're dealing with ancient laws, 1933.  Even I weren't born right then.  So -- but they don't fit where we are right now, OK.  </p><p>      And it seems to me that there are two choices, either pre-emption which your group don't want and I understand or we got to have something that does work that involves states.  My approach would be that there are some period of time, two years strikes me as reasonable that NASA, your organization, gets together and comes up with something that's 50 states or 53 -- is that the number of agencies, 54, by answer, OK and you're willing to live with.  </p><p>      And then we all get hand-in-hand and go walking up to Congress and do whatever we can to make it happen, but I think if the organization don't do that pre-emption is coming and then you won't have any jurisdiction over it all.  I mean we have to have some sort liquidity for these investors.  </p><p>      And I hate fraud, I really do.  I mean I've thrown away many clients that were coming to me that they weren't going to do the right thing and I've said hit the bricks.  So I mean, believe it or not, I seem like a ruthless businessman but I am not, I'm on your side.  </p><p>      But that's what I see the trend is being and you obviously got to run and embrace it.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm not quite as eloquent as Patrick.  But I think throughout the entire discussion now and being from Iowa or the typical flyover Midwest, I want to make sure that as we move forward the recommendation that we take into consideration that a lot of these regulations and items that we've been discussing maybe were based upon a reactionary or fear fraud and protecting.  </p><p>      So we need to make sure that is it protection or is it elimination?  So we need to make sure that as we take that next step that we are looking at everything; and so I don't mean to sound like on the fence over Switzerland or anything like that but I do have to agree with Catherine and am that would be where I stand.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it's really important for the committee to remember that Reg A plus has three options, right.  You have Tier 1 where there is no information being disseminated after the offering takes place.  There is Tier 2 where there is no information voluntarily disseminated after the offering takes place.  </p><p>      In both of those situations I would love to see the states come up with some kind of common approach to information requirements that allows for secondary transactions to occur in all 50 states, a 100 percent.  With respect to Tier 2 voluntary reporting, going various point, the centralized information portal is EDGAR.  </p><p>      Those companies are filing public information with the Securities Exchange Commission as available on the SEC's website.  So that information is out there, as long as those companies are voluntarily reporting, I don't see how the states interest to acquire information dissemination through a manual is more efficient or effective than dissemination through the SEC's EDGAR Website with SEC oversight enforcement and everything else to create fraud prevention and an investor protection.  </p><p>      So my vote would be pre-emption for Tier 2 securities that are voluntarily reporting on an ongoing basis.  Once that volunteer reporting stops, then they fall on to the other buckets and they have to satisfy the state requirements but again.  </p><p>      I want to reiterate my point about the fact that broker-dealers cannot create secondary markets in these securities; and also that the manual exemption is not available in every jurisdiction.  So it could definitely be detrimental to capital information for small companies in states where they cannot actually legally provide secondary transactions, even under Tier 1 or Tier 2 non-reporting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  I just want to point out that with respect to the words voluntarily, I mean there is an obligation in most circumstances to keep going.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Actually it's -- there is -- as Sarah said, it is not just the first year, it is just -- it's an obligation in which there is an ability to suspend that report, obligation or terminate the report immigration just a specific categories.  But so I think when we say voluntarily I think it's in a different census voluntarily just because I want to -- the rules do require them to do it.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That's what I meant, (inaudible) the company is dessemning information through the SEC, they should be in the pre- emption bucket.  I'm using the long-term (inaudible).  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right.  I didn't want to let any of my clients get the wrong idea when I told them they have to do this.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, first stuff I want to say; I don't think we're going to do anything (inaudible) and I do appreciate that.  I have family members who work for the State so I think it's a very important function actually that occurs, but I think and we're stronger when we work together, right.  </p><p>      And I'm glad the SEC states have been working actually much better than the insurance.  So I mean that is very; so kudos and props.  But with all said and done, I think when I look at our perspective and what we need to do from an overall basis, unfortunately, because I don't take -- I hate to put down regulation on top of regulation.  </p><p>      The data (ph) market, that is controlled -- that protects the investors while encourages investment at that next level because that's a gap we're missing.  When we see -- you know, Jonathan gave a great example of how it's supposed to work and unfortunately I think we have a little bit of gap here because you use the capital both number of companies that are forming -- are down, the number of people that are growing our organizations, they are growing IPO is down.  </p><p>      The number of large entities actually is down through consolidation and the actual numbers look really good but it's not just a matter of dollars, right, sometimes it is a matter of large numbers.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Michael, I'm not going to ask you -- but is there anything that you and Michelle too would like to add before we move on?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PIWOWAR</emphasis>:  Well, I do want to thank Richard and Martin, they did a nice job presenting the points and counter points.  The only other their thing I wanted to mention which I didn't get to bring up was the relative newness of this general concept of allowing investors to invest smaller or what would previously be privately held, potentially private offerings or private companies.  </p><p>      And I think we see it on the primary market side and I assume it's the same thing on the secondary market side that from an investor demand perspective these exemptions are so new that investors saying, wait a minute, I didn't think I could invest in something like that or I've always been told this was the case or they do not know what a Reg A offering is or they don't know what a crowdfunding offering is. </p><p>      So I think there is some element of investor education and further sort of maturity in these arenas that need to happen as well and in terms of secondary liquidity ever happening regardless of what the regulatory framework (inaudible) so I just want to put that out as an additional point.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  (Inaudible).    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Thank you very much.  Really fascinating to walk into this and I think as part of an ongoing dialogue and trying to catch up on this, completely persuaded on the side that this would be filling an important gap area in our economy, we see that the area that where access to capital is most needed is in that area like $1 million and below EBITDA.  </p><p>      And so despite all of our efforts on SBA's side and to encourage investors to get more early-stage, more local we're still not meeting the markets.  So I think I'm very much persuaded by a uniform platform of information in order to try to put more vibrancy and predictability into this segment of the market.  </p><p>      In terms of pre-emption, I really would like to defer to all of you.  My gut instinct is that there's something very inefficient about all 54 units trying to get to this uniformity, but hesitant to move in the pre-emption direction prematurely.  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  So with that I think I'm going to put some thoughts together and we'll discuss this afternoon whether we move on with a recommendation on try and pull of these things together and see whether you agree with the way that I've summarized it.  </p><p>      We're going to move on to discussion of the broker dealer status of finders and so thank you to Richard and Martin.  I really appreciate it.  </p><p>      So moving on to the broker-dealer issue; we've talked many times about the finders issue, urging the commission to take steps to clarify the current ambiguity and broker-dealer regulation for people who act as intermediaries in private placements or find potential investors.  </p><p>      And one of the reasons we care so much about this is the fact that to the extent a small company uses someone to help find capital and that person should have been registered as a broker-dealer and wasn't then that deal is -- by its nature resendable (ph), which is a terrible source of uncertainty for small companies to have to live with.  But they do it and they do it all the time and we've talked about this just because they are so desperately in need of capital.  </p><p>      So the prior iteration of this committee made a recommendation to the commission along those lines, just before the committee was renewed in September 2015.  I think you've all got a copy of that on your -- at your desks.  Shout if you don't have it.  </p><p>      Some of us were members of during the development of that recommendation and others have joined since then.  I would also note that the American Bar Association task force on private placement brokers has existed for some like 17 years now.  It's also urged clarity in this area with some progress; the broker, the M&amp;A broker no action position, which was very much appreciated, but there is still areas of significant uncertainty.  </p><p>      Knowing the importance of this issue to so many of us, we wanted to do sort of bring him down to see whether we wanted to reissue this recommendation since we have a new chairman and senior leadership coming into the SEC, new Congress in session.  </p><p>      It seems that if we're not satisfied with the status quote and I think -- I hope I am not jumping the gun in saying that many of us are not satisfied that we want to make sure that this is not overlooked.  </p><p>      So with that, does anybody wants to reiterate some of that the points they've made and I don't know if we have our representatives from (inaudible); do you guys want to say anything?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's Joanne (ph) from Division of Trading Markets.  I know Steve Looperelo (ph), our former director spoke to last fall and he just pointed out that we totally hear you but there is also two competing regulatory concerns; one is capital formation and the other is the protection of investors, particularly retail investors.  </p><p>      And so I think the one thing we would ask you as you go forward is to sort of address; if you could, the protections for the retail investors.  And with that I will here to answer your questions if we can.  Thank you.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'll be happy to speak.  Jenny, will you?  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  I think Jenny and then you.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I just had a quick question on the fourth point before the recommendation, it's say deal only with accredited investors but I don't think the recommendation actually says that.  So I personally would be very concerned about limiting this to people that deal only with accredited investors.  So I just wanted to see if we could get some clarity on that because it looks like it's in the preamble but not in the recommendation itself.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think the thinking those to the extent an exemption were to be developed then it would be appropriate to take the investor status into account but I'm interested to hear that.  And again, to answer Joanne's question, I mean to the extent we were to encourage a broker deal -- a limited broker-dealer exemption and it would not to have anything be dependent on the investor status as accredited or sophisticated; how would you protect the investor?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  This kind of goes back to our discussion about accredited and you know, whether the definition of accredited is actually protecting investors but I just think it's something we should think about.  I think limiting company -- you know, most of my clients -- I work with small businesses to raise money and most of my clients raise money from both accredited and unaccredited investors using usually under Rule 504 and state level exemptions.  </p><p>      And I think if this recommendation only applies to companies raising money from accredited investors, I think it really limits the applicability to companies that I want to talk to more than just accredited investors.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Commissioner Stein I want to direct this to you particularly because I think this is -- at the commission level where this belongs.  We had -- as far as I'm concerned a very unsatisfactory conversation, Mr. Luperela (ph), at our last meeting.  </p><p>      And as I told him, I think this is a worst case of bureaucratic waiting for (inaudible) I've ever seen.  They've been sitting on this for 16 years -- 16 or 17, I count 19, I don't know, but it's a long time.  And as obviously they are dissembling and wasting taxpayer time and I have no intention of ever moving on this that is the division of trading markets.  I don't know if that comes from the commissioner or not, but I do know this, that a tremendous amount of taxpayer time has been wasted on this.  </p><p>      If they could have just say we're never going to act on this and we're just playing -- stringing you along, it would have been very, very helpful and we could have done something else or going to licked our wounds and forgotten about the idea.  </p><p>      But instead we've had this constant teasing and even today we're hearing more from the division about what you want talk about, we understand your concerns -- I don't think they care about our concerns over there, frankly ma'am.  I think that you've got your own agenda and the public and the taxpayer be damned.  </p><p>      And I have no -- as far as my recommendation for the division, I don't know how to speak to the commissioners but to the division, I'm trying to figure a recommendations and that's not obscene.  I mean, I am -- I am so frustrated with this, I don't think anybody over there really cares or pretending to be listening; and I am convinced that if anything is going to be done on this, it will come from Capitol Hill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Patrick if we could, I'm glad we skipped the bit about the obscene bid, so thank you for that.  But to addresses this, I mean I think there are some legitimate concerns when we see and we have raised this every time wet consent about the small companies who are absolutely desperate and there is this guy at the golf club who knows some folks and can introduce them.  </p><p>      Do you have an answer to that, though, what if the guy at the golf club is like -- well, I know some folks and they were part of my Elks club or whatever and I know they are pretty rich.  What about investor protection?  Are we saying that we don't need it there or is there an alternative way that we can loop into this recommendation?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We've got the recommendations by the American Bar Association that promulgated 10 years -- roughly 10 years ago.  David Barton, over at Heritage Foundation recommendations.  I mean as far as I am concerned we don't need to tail that soil again, their recommendations and you can and get any number of -- I mean if you like for me to bring him to the next meeting?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  I think we actually have someone.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I mean I don't see why we need to put the metal horsepower and to making recommendations that will be ignored once again.  And I just -- you know, maybe bang my head against the wall for 16 years; I've decided it's time to stop.  </p><p>      I mean I haven't been working on this for 16 years, but people have and I am not willing, frankly, to do anymore head banging.  I've given up, I'm completely dissatisfied that any regulatory action will ever be taken on this, 16 years is enough.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  I will know that a couple of the members of the ABA taskforce have celebrated the 80th birthdays while they were waiting for...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I know two of those lovely ladies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  So nothing other than what's already in the record with respect to...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  What's already in the record; as I said to in that meeting; this topic has been studied as much as anything, but the Bible and the Torah, so it's time for action or just say we're not going to do anything.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  And saying we're not going to do anything that I think part of the problem; one of the reasons that we do keep circling back to this is that there is a certain amount of uncertainty -- there is at least one no action letter out there and we know that no action letters only apply to the specific pop star that they apply to.  </p><p>      But to the extent there are still people out there relying on that and saying that statement is still out there that no action letter has not been withdrawn.  And there are people doing these deals and doing the golf club deals and one of the things that I have said is, we're at a point, it matters so much as what the answer is but just that there is an answer.  </p><p>      And then make a point that I've made before as well.  It's not fair on the guys who are playing by the rules.  That there are some -- and for my own industry, the online capital formation industry, there are electronic platforms who are not playing by the rules.  </p><p>      And then I've got clients saying well they get away with it and nobody is arrested.  And to the extent some -- and I was explaining, well, the SEC doesn't have handcuffs because they are a civil agency; they don't have the right to do that, but as long as they keep saying nobody's been arrested for doing that, you're going to have this dichotomy waived.  </p><p>      You've got the guys who are playing by the rules and paying for it, and the guys who are kind of getting away with it; everyone is saying there is nothing out there.  So certainty, even if it's bad certainty to certain extent is helpful, but that's just my own opinion.  I'd be interested to note who else in the room would like even bad certainly.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  A quick question and going back to the whole question of state dialogue; even if there was certainty at the federal level wouldn't we still have to deal with...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  You're absolutely right.  I mean to the extent to go about to another discussion, to the extent there's no pre-emption and I don't see it.  I'm one of the things that we've seen again in the online communities; some people saying well those platforms have there no action letters, but we, state regulators, that's just their silly federal thing, we don't recognize it.  </p><p>      And as far in state acts; as far as we're concerned, there is still broker-dealers, so we do have uncertainty at the state level as well.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, that happened with the company called Profounder in California, I remember that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  It was California and not the Fed CTM.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Exactly.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  When I think about this, you know, how we're defining the difference is between someone who provides names versus someone who sells the transaction, right?  A broker dealer sells a transaction, a finder simply introduces.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  It depends which side of the interpretation you fall on. I mean there are some folks would say anybody who brings together buyers and sellers of securities and takes money for doing that is going to be a broker-dealer.  Even if the compensation is not derived or calculated on the basis of the amount of security solved.  </p><p>      There are some people who say, so long as it is not a transaction-based compensation, then they say it's not a broker- dealer, but I don't think anyone has ever agreed that.  And so you get a wide range of interpretations at both federal and state level.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But how much is the issuer responsible for ensuring that the information is provided in that -- they're accredited; that kind of thing.  I mean that really comes on down the issue at that point; after that point, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  The issue has got a whole bunch of things to worry about including if I raise money by using a non-registered broker-dealer who should have been registered, that transaction could be rescinded.  And so you've got a put hanging over your head forever.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The visions position also is if a lawyer participates with a run registered broker, the lawyers violate the securities laws too.  So the fact is they are separating the business person from his or her lawyer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Anyone in favor of more certainty even if it's wrong or -- because we keep making the recommendations -- and it would be nice if we could sort of move this ahead in some way?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm struggling with this, not because I don't think we should move ahead with it.  I'm struggling because I think about the situations in which someone gets introduced or hears about the opportunity to invest in something and -- I mean it's going to happen and, you know, it's -- when I think about the private investor market; if there is a great deal of it, that is to say formalized, but there is still a lot of unformalized capital out there.  </p><p>      So I think we should put -- I think this puts some structure around that unformalized capital, that's why I like it.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  (inaudible)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's really hard sitting next to Patrick sometimes. But...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I noticed it may be closer to the door.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But overall and I think it -- I feel like we have opened Pandora's Box and we have really animated debates regarding a lot of the issues that have come out and even when I am going back to the Midwest, and talking to people; it's like well you have to do this, this is what the rules are.  </p><p>      But we need to make sure that there is something -- that something moves forward, that we move the needle off zero.  We have to take action and it needs to be though collaborative, you can't have a mom versus dad.  Well, here is how I'm going to interpret this because this works better for us.  Here is how I'm going to interpret this.  </p><p>      And versus you know, what's the worst that could happen?  In only hurts if you get caught.  We need to make sure that you know, are we playing the protectionism in too far and making so much, but not being able to work together to achieve our goal.  </p><p>      And at the same time I think we've really shifted on what is our actual goal?  Is it fully a regulatory and here is what we want to do so that things fit into our funnel or we looking at what the markets are out there and what entrepreneurs and small businesses are actually defining as the new way of doing business and how they need to achieve that capital and get business done.  </p><p>      And I think that kind of lead us into our debate later this afternoon, but I want to see -- there needs to be a movement somewhere.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Which direction would you like the movement to be?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So that it works better for our companies.  And that would be my answer.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  I vote in favor of workability.  Ann Marie (ph), since you go to background in the broker industry?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't know that I'm qualified to comment on what team colleague said, but I'd probably agree with her.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  And then it just -- one of the questions is whether we would -- whether and to what extent we wanted to reissue the comments that we made in September with respect to getting some -- get behind as reduced -- reducing ambiguity, but the question then is; in what direction does that -- does the reduction in ambiguity go?  </p><p>      One of the things that I've said is even having the wrong answer, at least it's an answer and it gives us some certainty.  What are your feelings on that?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, you know, we've talked that this as a committee.  Patrick is very passionate about the subject and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  He reiterated his passion.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I heard it.  It's very worthwhile listening to.    </p><p>      I think the fact is that I was -- and that you were talking about Mr. Luprello (ph) as I left the room.  I was disappointed in his answer to the committee we're talking about that.  I think that we know that there is bad practices in the market, we know that there are people who don't understand the rules, we know there are platforms out there that are not registered and following the rules in a way that makes sense to me.  </p><p>      So I think I would definitely like to see the SEC take more specific action in the context of finders and platforms involved in primary and secondary transactions that may not be registered broker- dealers, you've got some no action letters out there from treating in markets to certain platforms that are helpful but potentially not being followed by the rest of the market.  So maybe more obvious disclosure efforts -- sorry, more obvious enforcement efforts to the extent -- you know, necessary no Patrick feels like there is not enough enforcement, obvious enforcement in this space.  </p><p>      I really do worry about companies hiring people to help them find capital and then not having that debt in a way that's consistent with the security's laws; that's not good for the investors and not the market.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I agree with you Sarah that having nothing sends the message that if you I have no enforcement to Patrick's perspective for looking the other way, it sends the message that it's really not an important regulation.  It's really not relevant.  </p><p>      So I am of the point that if we have something out there we probably should -- we can't selectively apply, right?  You can't selectively enforce because if you do that exists down a hole in another rabbit hole, so let's get off the bucket. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  And any thoughts in what this initiative would look like and do we still -- do you still agree with the some of the things said out in the 2015 letter?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, personally no but I'm willing to say let's go, let's just -- let's do something.  I think we all don't agree with everything all the time and so it's just -- if -- I don't really understand why this is happening and -- so I just want to register out there, the fact that if we don't do something, that sends a message out there to people to take the risk.  </p><p>      And so therefore by again non-action, we're creating the environment, we're creating the environment.  And if we are OK with that, I know we're not happy with that, but if we are -- if we accept the consequences of non-action then we need to be prepared down the line (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  OK.  So if I were to -- it's kind of difficult to summarize because it's clear that not everybody agrees with the exact specifications in the 2015, but if we were to say that we would like greater certainty and that certainly could take a number of different shapes, including compliance and disclosure typing initiatives, answers to Q&amp;As.  </p><p>      I mean -- I think there -- not to put words into the mouth of the TNM guys,  but I think there has always been this some -- well, there is a slippery slope here and if we let this happen then what happens next?  But Q&amp;A type interpretations of who is a broker and who isn't might be tremendously helpful, even if it doesn't go as far as no action letter.  </p><p>      All right, that seems like a very innocent sort of thing to encourage and also to encourage that the staff also took to the states because one of the things that we are seeing -- we see this in the Reg A field.  We see for example, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Dakota have completely different interpretations of the dealer requirements. And so some kind of coordination at that level as well would be tremendously helpful.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It sounds like we're kind of talking about a speed limit issue aren't we.  Like what's the speed limit in your city or on a highway in New York City (ph)?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I have no idea.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Like 65?  Do they give you five miles an hour, do they give you 10 miles an hour or 15?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  My cousin's a state trooper, so I get a little bit...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it's six because just for the margin of error. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And so -- you know, what is the actual rule in -- what is the actual speed limit and what actually gets enforced are sometimes diverse and sometimes -- I actually think you're getting your answer, Patrick.  </p><p>      I love you, but I think what I am hearing is that the SEC is saying, well, this is the speed limit, but we might give you five, we might give you 10 over, but at the same point in time don't be a jerk about it otherwise we might come down and pull you over and give you a ticket.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  I'm not sure that we do have a speed limit even with the Anne-Marie rider.  And I think that's the problem.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And that and applying private litigation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  And I think that is a really good point, I mean in private litigation this is what's hanging over the heads of small companies is; you do a deal that was put together by the dude at the golf club who knows some guys.  And then it turns out that that was really bad investment.  </p><p>      And so what happens is a plaintiff's lawyer gets hold of it and goes OK, we are going to get your money back because that was a broker-dealer and he wasn't registered.  And that's what hangs over the heads of small companies all the time.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sarah, I mean what I was looking at is the document that Greg sent -- e-mailed this evening.  I couldn't be here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  That's the ABA one?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So, it means what we are doing is we're classifying people to be intermediaries by making an introduction, and if they disclose or form -- or they're acting as an intermediary they are not selling and that the issuer says, you know, I understand this that this person is not selling and that these people that I am being introduced to are accredited investors.  </p><p>      I will not take anyone, but accredited investors.  What's the problem because they are not selling, they are acting as -- and if we define immediary (ph) and intermediary, if someone who does not sell, does not provide the PPM, does not provide -- you know, then that person all they are doing is an introduction.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  All right, which is what we -- but we can't define the law and the guys who do interpret that the regulations are the guys we need the guidance from.  And that's one of the things that we were encouraging is this sort of limited purpose introductory.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I mean I -- that's what I'm thinking is, just what we've done here to me works fine because we're just -- we're just putting structure so let's define it.  Let's have a form.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  And anybody against a rewrite of recommendation -- that be one of the courses that we would like to see from trading markets. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And to abstain from any further action from a regulatory standpoint on this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Even if it's good action?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sixteen years of good action.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Anyone else wanted to weigh in on the form that I captured?  That's the one that was circulated from (inaudible).  That would at least be something.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'd like to get the SEC's opinion on what that letter -- what they would do if a case came in front of them and somebody had the exemption letter that was referred to in the document?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  I'm sorry, I'm not sure we've seen that, but I think that there is a vehicle for requesting no action or an exemptive order if you want some regulatory certainty, some clarity.  So there are established processes if this is something you'd like to pursue.  </p><p>      This is the -- I think it's from the ABA recommendations that you're looking at that.  But it's right at the moment.  So I mean I think the answer is, this is -- that's just a privately produced piece of paper and then if you took that to the SEC and said, if we did this, would it be OK?  Then I think the appropriate action would be to request no actual position.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Which I received on a case-by-case basis and only apply to the people they received to.  And we would like it to go a little further from that.  Anyone else on the brokers?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm wondering what the reaction was when -- you know, to the recommendations that were made by the ABA.  What was the response?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think this is going back, but it contemplate a limit purpose registration scheme without the participation.  And the question is then, who monitors, who examines?  We, right now, are taking on all the investment advisory industry, so we're little short on resources.  </p><p>      So it's a question of you bringing folks in, we're putting additional regulatory burns on the SEC and we don't really have a lot of resources; you know, quite apart from the merits, you know, what you might think on particular point?  I think I was saying that Steve had told the folks from the ABA last summer.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Maybe again -- I'll analogize again to Title 3 of the Jobs Act; there is this new type of entity that is not a full broker- dealer, but it's regulated by FINRA.  You know, maybe that could be a solution that you know we have this limited type of registration, that's not a full broker-dealer, but it's a finder and it does become a member of FINRA, but with much more limited regulation.  I would support that. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  A limited purpose broker-dealer and in fact...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right, similar to that (inaudible) portals.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  And you would of course need regulations to create that both with at the SEC and FINRA.  And also you would need -- I mean one of the things that we should point out -- some of those Title 3 crowdfunding platforms is; this one is bitten the dust for regulatory reasons already.  So there is a regulatory burden and keeping an eye on those folks.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, I'm not one to create more regulation, but I think that -- I agree with Jenny there.  I think that would be a good solution, but there is also the idea of -- when somebody doesn't do it; I mean are they being reserved, are there consequences for that. It sounds like there is quite a few transactions that are considered securities transactions that are not being monitored regulation as imposed on those.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Does anyone else have any other questions or comments on the (inaudible).  I just want to say thank you guys for coming by and I know this is the typical Washington poly (ph) game of lining people up and yelling at them.  </p><p>      And we want say thank you very much for coming back and hearing us and hopefully we don't take it personally but we do appreciate what you're doing.  But you hear us, I mean we want some certainty here.  </p><p>      Thank you everybody.  We are now going to adjourn until 1:45. And we will be talking then about why more companies are staying private.  Thank you.  </p><p>      (RECESS)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  OK.  Thanks and welcome back everybody.  Sorry for the delay to those of you on the webinar, we had bit of a technical problem.  So we're now going to talk about why more companies are staying private or try and answer that question,  </p><p>      There was an interesting article in the January 6th Wall Street Journal focused on the lower number of U.S. IPOs over the last decade and calling the -- referring to a gusher of private capital.  We all know plenty of small companies that would love to benefit from this gusher of small capital and who are not seeing it probably but it's absolutely true that the decrease in the number of companies going public is no news to any of us.  </p><p>      The article talked about several possible theories as to why the private markets have proven more attractive in recent years, the companies that traditionally would have been candidates for an IPO.  I am pretty sure everybody here has got their own thoughts on the topic and we'll be discussing those.  But it's definitely a topic that we want to discuss in depth and further, and see what the trends are that are influencing companies decisions to stay private.  </p><p>      We're going to hear from three separate presenters, each of whom has extremely relevant experience in this area.  I don't know if this is the order you're going in, but it's order I've got.  So is James Hutchinson or Jamie, a partner in the private equity group of the law firm Goodwin Procter, as well as a member of Goodwin's technology and emerging companies FinTech and impact on responsible investing practice.  </p><p>      Jamie has extensive experience advising funds in the portfolio companies in a wide variety of transactions.  He has been a key contributor to his firm's online resources for start-ups, emerging companies and the entrepreneurial community.  </p><p>      Next we have Glen Giovannoni of the Global Life Sciences Leader at accounting from Ernst &amp; Young.  He has close to 30 years of experience with Ernst &amp; Young, at the majority serving clients in the biotech and medical device industries.  He has extensive experience -- sorry, he published a blog in response to the Wall Street Journal article I mentioned earlier which we will have.  So I look forward to hearing his thoughts on the topic.  </p><p>      And finally, we welcome Yanev Suissa, founder of SineWave Ventures.  Yaniv was formally with the large VC firm New Enterprise Associates, where he focused on early-stage investments in tech and energy companies.  He also helped form the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program, where he was engaged in the underwriting of billions of dollars of debt for estimates to companies within the energy technology industry.  </p><p>      And please take it from here.  Is it Jamie, you first or...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTCHINSON</emphasis>:  Glenn's got it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANKS</emphasis>:  Alright, Glenn, thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIOVANNONI</emphasis>:  Well, thank you and thanks to the entire committee for the invitation, it's great to here.  We're hopeful we can -- we catalyze some good discussion; we were talking earlier, I mean I'm sure there is a definitive answer on this, but we'll put forth some ideas.  And thank you for promoting the blog, that was a bit of a coincidence.  </p><p>      I read that same article heading out to the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference every year in San Francisco, kind of kicks off the year for life science companies; and sat there and said, really 30 percent your public companies; that can't be the case in biotech.  And I think what explore today is it, you know, biotech is obviously only one small part of the entire economy and it may be the exception that proves the rule for firm certain unique attributes of that of the particular sector.  </p><p>      And in fact, what I was pointing out the blog was that the number of publicly listed biotech companies is up 40 percent over the same period of time.  So the trend has actually reversed, but we'll explore it, the broader issues and answers if there is some relevance from biotech, I'll introduce that.  </p><p>      I thought what I do is -- start just with some bigger picture context setting and run through just a number of the data charge test hopefully help inform structure around it and then will dive into some of the real specific issues around this question of why are more staying staying private.  And we've had a chance to talk a little bit ahead of the session so little bit -- hopefully Jamie will be in everywhere so.  And of course please stop us any point, we don't need to make presentation -- we're have to entertain questions.    </p><p>      So what's here and maybe a little hard to see the distance. There were a couple of academic studies that spurred some of this media coverage.  This particular one I think was actually quoted in a Bloomberg story about six months before the Wall Street Journal picked up the story there in early January.  And you know, coming on the fact that we've seen this significant decrease in the number of publicly traded companies and looking at why.  </p><p>      And (inaudible) so summarize some of the data from that study itself, just in 10 year blocks.  So their data when through 2012; so it's a little bit dated.  But you can kind of see some of the trend here of the rise in public companies up until 1995 and then a decrease.    </p><p>      Since then and just pictorially, the green bars here are the number of IPOs.  The grey bars are the number of M&amp;A transactions where companies effectively delisted a transaction, and the red are our delisting's for a cause, right?  Which you see were pretty significant leading up to and late 90s leading up to the sort of the dotcom frenzy of quite a few IPOs.  And even in the decade after and they've diminished a bit; so we can argue whether it is positive or negative, but I think the number of companies going public today are less likely to be delisted.  There a little bit more substantial, they been private a little longer, they probably have a little more capital right.  </p><p>      So you know, I think it's person fair to say maybe they are more sustainable than say the average company that was listing in the late 90s.  The next slide is just to make the point; I've got a couple of slides on this, but quickly we want to look at this from the standpoint of -- is this is a U.S. phenomenon, a global phenomenon, you know what's happening here where we have a delisting -- or not delisting I'm sorry, but a decrease in the number listed companies.  </p><p>      This slide is not very interesting because the data didn't change very much, but basically what it says is 90 percent plus that 94 percent last year of IPOs happen on domestic exchanges, only six percent are cross-border.  </p><p>      And then if you say, well the U.S. have a particular problem, because certainly listings arts or going quite a rapid in many exchanges around the world.  Does U.S. have a problem or when companies choose to list cross-border, they come here is what the take away here is.  The yellow bar a number of foreign private issuers coming to the U.S. and you can see the other markets; how they compare.  </p><p>      So it suggests that we don't have some unique problem where our companies are finding their way to go public in other places and that sort of capped up on this slide which shows that in 2016 the only two U.S. companies chose to list exclusively overseas.  So they may have -- there may be other, there is quite a few others who probably want to do list but they are also listed, not a primary list here.  </p><p>      You know, a handful of year saw, there is another market for me. I'm not going to choose a here in the U.S.  So then more to what's going on with private companies.  This is data from venture source, and I'd direct you to the yellow line there and the grey line towards the bottom.  Those represent seed and first round; so by translation I guess company formations rate over the last many years.  </p><p>      And the numbers you can't read there on the right are you know running around last several years, 15 to 1,800 venture-backed companies created.  So that's sort that sort of the inflow of likely IPO candidates not exclusively but earnings go public because family owned businesses, non-venture backed companies can make the way to the public market but this is a pretty big indication of the funnel.  And we see since we kind of created after the dotcom frenzy back to the beginning of the 2000's, with a little hiccup there around the financial crisis.  </p><p>      There has been a relatively steady climb up, so it's not necessarily that the funnel is not there for companies that you know, would otherwise choose to seek an IPO.  The IPOs haven't increased at the same pace and that's a large part of the reason we're having this conversation, we'll get into the more larger -- some of the larger dynamics the way that is but you can see IPOs prior to 2000 were running at 400 or 500 a year.  </p><p>      Since the financial crisis you know we're in the 200 to 300 depending on -- I'm sorry, since the -- sort of dotcom highs and the recovery there in the 200 to 300 IPOs a year, last year was quite a bit lower than that.  And so there has been a different bar set relative to the number of IPOs.  And what we're experiencing is that companies are staying private longer.  </p><p>      Now the company that gets through is represented by these numbers and gets public, probably is a little bit more substantial in terms of it's time to grow as a private company, perhaps a little better financed and sent -- hence received fewer of the delisting's.  This is the same data, I won't go over that -- it excludes the foreign private issuers; this is just purely U.S.  company is going public on U.S. exchanges.  </p><p>      And then you know, the other -- the other way companies disappear is they get bought of course, and this data is from dialogic (ph) and its acquisitions of all private companies; venture backed, not venture backed by strategic investors, by PE or financial investors, it's kind of an all in numbers.  </p><p>      So it's maybe not right on point relative to the population of companies that may go public but it gives you an indication that we're in a robust M&amp;A environment, and have been for quite some time as the industries are consolidating and we see that at the top end with the Fortune 500 in terms of -- pardon me, the amount of revenue and assets, and the economy they control is also a trend of greater externalization for larger companies looking for innovation and be willing to buy it.  </p><p>      So there is an awful lot of deal activity that -- you know, these are companies that otherwise may have matriculated to the public market that better acquired while private.  </p><p>      Another cut of the data, much smaller numbers; these are the same dataset but deals over $100 million.  So this is the group of companies that might have been IPO-ready if you want to think about it that way relative to the market cap, you know, whether that's 100 or up to $300 million to $400 million takeout price.  </p><p>      So you know, if you're looking at a couple of hundred in a year on the IPO side, there is double that number of private companies that otherwise may have considered an IPO that are selling in M&amp;A transactions.  </p><p>      This is just for your information, the number of publicly traded companies that are coming out -- this isn't really germane to the private company story, this is existing public companies that are being acquired, and you can see that while it's pretty steady, it's actually quite a bit lower, more of that acquisition activity have been much earlier in the decade and even into the late 1990s.  </p><p>      So that kind of leads us to the question today of -- you know, why our company is staying more private and/or staying private longer? And not to be flipped but the kind of short answer we come up with this because they can and we'll talk about what's behind all of that but if you look on the left hand side, you know, why would I go public?  </p><p>      That list there is the common reasons, the companies would have pursued a public offering; number one, their business model really requires it.  Right, that they have a highly capital intensive business model, they need to access capital to grow their business and public markets, typically -- historically, have been provided a lower cost of capital, we can argue with if that's still the case with all the private money out there.  </p><p>      They need public currency to do acquisitions, they are looking for liquidity for their founders, for their investors.  Importantly, when we talk about tech and biotech companies for their employees; although Jamie also some stuff to say about that because he has part of creating alternatives for private companies in that respect.  </p><p>      And they just want brand identity, you know, that comes from being a public company.  I would say there is one here a particular that's more biotech focused; when we get over on the right side, you know many companies are staying private because there is this gusher of private capital to Sarah's comment from the article.  </p><p>      There is there is an unprecedented amount of private capital out there, it's not finding its way everywhere; the kinds of private capital that is going into some of the large technology companies in multi-billion dollar rounds -- if we go back to the biotech example for a minute, very few if any investors are going to write that kind of a check for a biotech company and wait five years and turnover a card and see if they got a drug or not, right.  </p><p>      It just doesn't fit -- the financing model doesn't fit the business model and that's one of the reasons we see biotech companies go public.  They not only need the capital, they need a wider shareholder base; right, that's sort of publicly traded stock provides them.  </p><p>      So on the why stay private?  You know the biggest issue is because they can, there is lots of capital out there, right, and if you can avail yourself to that capital and instead of a reasonable valuation it's not such a large haircut from one of public market might give you than you can still grow your business, your -- it's not as dilutive as it may have been at one point in time and certainly with -- you know, there is new pools of capital; the amount of capital, the pool is coming from and the evaluations; I think we've seen that to a large degree.  </p><p>      And then it sort of insulates you from what's the rest of the list there, right.  So obviously as a public company, a lot more infrastructure needed for disclosure and regulatory compliance, some perception of this was brought up in The Wall Street Journal Article about disclosure leading to loss of competitive advantage, especially for technology companies trying to build something new.  </p><p>      Just a general lack of operating flexibility or lower operating flexibility when you're public and you have investors that are much more focused on short-term quarterly profits, and your business model might be one off -- long-term growth and world domination in a particular category, right, that dichotomy.  </p><p>      And then a variety of other -- you know, just the risk of being a public company subject to activists and short-sellers and shareholder lawsuits and alike.  So, you know, we really have factors foreign against but the answer that we will set up here and I'll pass the baton here to Jamie is because they can live.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTCHINSON</emphasis>:  Again, switch some slides.  So again, I'm Jamie Hutchinson, I'm a partner in Goodwin's Private Equity and tech practice units.  We do a lot of work representing emerging stage companies and the folks that invest in them.  </p><p>      And we've actually kind of had a front row seat over the -- about the past decade to what we kind of call the large-cap growth equity. So a lot of the very big rounds into the high-profile tech companies, sort of the unicorn set, and a lot of those transactions come with some interesting dynamics including secondary pieces.  </p><p>      And so that the press has written a little bit about private IPOs which I think is not a good -- it's probably a misnomer but there are certainly a different type of transaction, much larger than had secondary liquidity and we've sort of had a front row seat to that. So I think we should be able to give some ideas of why this is happening.  </p><p>      So -- and certainly, during this presentation we're going to jump in and if anybody has questions and want to jump in and draw down on the stuff, you should do that, it can make it more interesting.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTCHINSON</emphasis>:  Yes, I've noted.  I've seen that over the years Ann- Marie.  So here is the summary of some of the reasons; there is large amounts of private capital and it's really on a global level.  It's not just the U.S.  anymore.  Employees don't demand a company go public; there is -- there are alternatives to liquidity now that there weren't in the past.  </p><p>      Early investors don't need an IPO and maybe even want an IPO. The idea of a clean exit is something that can be particularly appealing to closed-end funds that have a lifespan.  Certain securities laws become more flexible, especially the 500 charter rule moving to 2,000 shareholders of record.  </p><p>      There is a new generation of entrepreneurs that have a different set of priorities and you know, this is perhaps the case now, maybe than in a different way historically, and we've had direct interaction with a lot of these folks and they think of the world differently, and maybe it's a millennial thing, but there -- you know, I think we're all seeing in the market, particularly the companies that are going public, there are focus -- the focus is on things like control, maybe then immediate sort of wealth creation, changing the world, winning the space, things like that.  </p><p>      There is negative -- this is negative press phenomena that can occur with public companies, and we'll drilldown onto that a little bit.  So cash as the new acquisition currency is shocking, but debts cheap and a lot of companies, both public and private are able to tap very deep pools of debt financing to do M&amp;A where in the past it might have been best done with a public company security.  </p><p>      M&amp;A equal's innovation, strategies are serial acquirers and they do that to continue to innovate.  And they are affected by, not only the cash they have on the balance sheet, but their ability to tap into cheap debt.  The high cost of being a public company or perhaps keeping folks from moving towards an IPO; and then there's sort of other set of pitfalls that we'll touch on.  </p><p>      So first the large amounts of private capital; so the capital is coming from different places, then maybe was historically the case. VC funds themselves, many have gotten bigger and their investment mandates have expanded where maybe in the 80s, 90s, even the early 2000's it was -- VCs were really doing early-stage start-up type investing; now their mandates are really across the spectrum from early-stage to late-stage.  </p><p>      The traditional private equity funds; buyout funds the (inaudible), the KKRs, they did not historically focus on minority deals; deals that they didn't have control and that has changed substantially.  Firms like Silver Lake investing in Zinga and Alibaba taking minority positions; TPG and these are all publicly available; TPG and Airbnb and Uber.  KKR just announced a growth equity funds.  </p><p>      So these are really traditional buyout shops that are moving into growth equity and have deep pools of capital, corporate venture capital, Google ventures, Dell ventures; they are out there and investing heavily and that's sort of a new and different source of capital over the past decade.  </p><p>      Hedged funds, so you know some people refer them as crossover funds, historically, hedge funds would invest in public securities. They were open-ended funds and they were structured in a way that having the liquidity of public securities kind of meshed with their structures, but that is no longer the case.  A lot of the big hedge funds, Tiger Global, for example, has been extraordinary successful and extraordinary active, investing all over the world into private companies.  </p><p>      The sovereign wealth funds; they have and over the past sort of five to ten years; well, historically they would invest as LP's in the big venture and private equity funds and they sort of have come around based on their expertise may be doing that to build their own infrastructure, they build their own investment teams and they are able to make direct investments.  </p><p>      GIC, Thomasic, the Saudi Fund that recently invested in Uber; the Abu Dhabi fund that's invested in Spotify (ph); you know, there is a long list of the sovereign wealth funds no longer being passive investors in private equity and venture but investing directly.  And they have very deep pools in their super-patient investors, so it's added things to the market.  </p><p>      Mutual fund complexes; so one of the things in the Wall Street Journal article that mentioned how the average investor doesn't sort of get access to these fast-growing sort of unicorn companies and you know, as I was reading that I was thinking well, that's actually not true.  </p><p>      I suspect a lot of people in this room have 401(k)s in mutual funds and through the public filings and a lot of -- you've seen it in the press, the big mutual fund complexes are one of the most active investors in private companies these days, and they too are very large pools of capital and they are very patient to different model.  They don't have an end to their fund life.  </p><p>      So that -- and we'll talk a bit more about that because that has been a really dramatic shift that sort of changed things, particularly with shareholder liquidity.  And then family offices; just like the sovereign wealth funds, they've build infrastructure to direct invest. Gates, that (inaudible) network, the founder of eBay, folks like that are now out there making direct investments.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Essentially we're going through is and might have been; I would also note that these are not all smart investors in the venture space and what I mean by that is not that they are not smart people but that these business models that they have historically been in are not the same business model as venture, right.  </p><p>      We are not typical finance; I do not do ratios on a daily basis, I do not write where building teams, building strategies, building technologies, innovating, often being a personal counsellor; or quite frankly, and a recruiter.  And you have all these guys moving in and I think they all have different motivations.  </p><p>      So for the big banks and funds and the more financial folks you have a phenomenon since the recession where people whether it's true or not, people believed that the public markets are not a place to make money or not place to make money safely, and you do have this phenomenon of it's hard to get in, so there must be something special about this that the small group of people of access to the set of special deals that you need to be in.  </p><p>      And there is a definite like you need to be in it mentality, right.  If you're not in Facebook, you're not a relevant investor in the technology space, regardless of whether you think Facebook is a good company or not, right.  And so similar for every other -- a lot of other big tech companies.  </p><p>      So that's where the banks come from; for the sovereign wealth funds we've seen a phenomenon where technology and innovation as you guys know has been promoted much more, more in the press as a way to -- and venture for that matter as a way to grow jobs right.  </p><p>      And learner skills had built businesses and build economies, and a lot of sovereign wealth funds are doing this not just to make money, but because they believe that having access to the understanding of these tech companies will then give them the ability to bring that technology to their country.  </p><p>      This is particularly relevant among the Middle East sovereign funds, where they say, we're going to invest in this because we want you to build an office here and train our people to do this.  So I think -- and then, and families are similar; there is also this phenomenon I don't want to pay managers fees, I just want to go at it directly because I think I am just as smart, right.  </p><p>      And so I am going to go out all these things that I really know nothing about it and keep going.  And I do think that that's a dangerous phenomenon, more generally, maybe not relevant to the going public point that were talking about today but you are seeing this change.  I think so all the really smart ones came in early, they realized -- because they are smart, that they didn't know what they were doing and they've pulled back significantly.  </p><p>      And then you have the second tier of just as smart, maybe not as smart people coming in and it will continue to kind of move that direction until people realize it really is a different game, and unless they are really focused on it and understand it, they are really just playing with fire.  </p><p>      So I think that's part of this dynamic.  It's not -- it's a reaction to hey, we as financial institutions are not making money right now and so we need to -- and everyone's asking us like why aren't you making money?  Why aren't you in this so we need to do something.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And to your point on sort of the -- not wanting to pay fees; we see these things that we call rifle-shot funds; so it's like a managed account almost where big investors will aggregate money; it might be led by a brand-name VC, but they will set up site, it looks just like a venture fund, feels like a venture fund, it's got a GP, it's got LPs, but invest in a single asset, a rifle-shot into one company.  </p><p>      Goldman kind of kicked that office in some respects when it did a big common round in Facebook and brought in a bunch of their investors in a special purpose vehicle.  So we're seeing that phenomenon too with some of this new money that doesn't want to pay fees but will -- once they co-invest alongside of some of the more traditional investors.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And in that case, once step is on the IPO?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, right.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Just one -- maybe a question or comment; (inaudible) was saying because I agree with -- you know, one thing to keep in mind is where do we think we are largely in this wave of private capital. So we're on the second wave and you know, many of these unicorns will make it no value to what but someone right and so where does not sort of app flow occur?  </p><p>      And if you go back to one-slide showed about venture-backed company formation.  There is a bolus of companies that are now three or four years into their venture stage development and so one of the dynamics on the pure IPO account could be -- A) that we see a little bit less of this gusher of private money and we've got a whole load of IPO ready companies.  </p><p>      So you these things ban, right -- they come, they have inflow with the couple availability.  And so can you guys talk, you guys keep on talking about discussion of private capital into small businesses or discussions of private capital in emerging businesses; what's the average check size attire global rights to a company?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I suspect it's not less than $100 million.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  What would be the small check-size that a mutual fund would write to a company?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, I suspect it's not less than $100 million, maybe $50 million.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I would just caution putting all those companies in the same bag and saying that all of this money just is going into -- the market is awash with capital because there is well over 100,000 small businesses in this country and you're talking about dozens if not hundreds of deals.  </p><p>      So the amount -- the check size in terms of gross stage private equity; so the check size is huge, the number of deal size is smaller. I mean we were just talking on the earlier session, you weren't here but you know, venture is about $50 billion a year right now; Angel is about $25 billion a year right now; and $75 billion a year right now; the lottery is a $65 billion a year business.  </p><p>      So I would -- I just I guess I take issue with that because I speak with thousands of entrepreneurs were capital start.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, can I make few quick comments to that.  So I will tell you -- there are VCs competing with certain one of these names, I'm not going to -- names that you would have no idea we're doing seed deals and that is, and when entrepreneur has to choose between a VC, who knows how to get there ownership and someone who doesn't because they are just taking dips on something, we're just spreading money or just trying to please investors who think they should be in the private markets, it's a different game, right.  </p><p>      And I will also say there are -- so I think a phenomenon that happened with the recession and they say I don't know which companies you know and this is going to sound horribly arrogant, but there are a lot of companies that shouldn't be companies out there.  Like -- so when the recession happened, you saw a huge surge in the word entrepreneurship, let alone people who wanted to be entrepreneurs because they got fired.  </p><p>      My friends got fired from their jobs in the law firms and the banks and the consulting firms and OK, great, we're young and risky and with all this stuff we'll start a company and it's exciting and it's cool and we'll do that.  And money is pouring into companies that wouldn't.  </p><p>      I think if you -- and this maybe comes from my background or where I invest from, but if you really look at -- if you had to go through and everyone has their own opinion; if you were to go to and say which one of these companies that are getting funding period actually should be; the answer is probably very high that they shouldn't be.  And so I do think there is that phenomenon going on as well.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  What would you decide a company that should get funding?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, so when you invest in a company, right, you're looking for a particular return...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  What would your return be?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think that phenomenon has been permitted (inaudible) and most VCs when they answer this question because they have to have an answer even if it's not true.  Too often say that we're almost guaranteed a 3X and yet have the potential for like 50X.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And so how many start-ups would you actually talk to before you actually come across one of those deals?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think most -- it depends on the firm and where you're looking but most the big VCs will probably look at at least 200 companies and maybe invest in one of those.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So it's 0.5 percent of the companies that you look like actually get funding that you think you have a reasonable chance of getting a 50X return on?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So for every 200 companies?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You know, it depends on the firm and where you're looking but most the big VCs will probably look at least 200 companies; and maybe invest in one of those.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So it's 0.5 percent of the companies that you look like actually get funding that you think you have a reasonable chance of getting a 50X return on.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So for every 200 companies -- for every 200 CEOs or entrepreneurs that out there that are actually interested in capitalizing the company, about 0.5 percent of them actually do.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right.  But what I -- when I say the one out of the 200, I mean the 199 shouldn't have the capital or they should form a different form of capital.  So what I'm -- you know, I'm coming about this from venture money, there is other money out there that might be looking for different kind of motive but or return profile.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  May I shift gears here for a minute since you jumped in.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Not it's good, really good.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So will you think about the rate of innovation; when you look at the rate of innovation, you know, maybe even 10 or 20 year segments; you know how much of the capital that's pouring in is more a reflection of the opportunity because of the greater rate of innovation?  Is that something to considered or is now I'm off-base?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  More investable opportunities.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, because of the rate of innovation, it's not -- I keep thinking; I started my firm 15 years ago and I think about the companies we had to invest in, quality companies we had to invest in. And here in the United States but I'm seeing it all over the world now, it's very different.  </p><p>      I mean, I went to The Netherlands and I walked away looking at some companies I thought we're very enough great opportunities and (inaudible) is a good example of that too.  So it's not just -- some not talk about the rate of innovation and I've seen in the past 15 years there is much more robust than I think it was 15-20 years ago, other a dotcom.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, I absolutely agree with that.  And I think you just -- I know where -- we've kind of degenerate a little bit into like -- where is all the money coming from but I do think that's the reason that it is if we go back to the bigger topic, right, that there are more opportunities; I mean they are growing and they are out there but they are still not -- regardless of whether they are getting financing or not, they are still not turning to the public markets.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK) </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You know, different than MySpace where it's a lot of capital intensity, a lot of the innovative companies have a really asset light kind of model with (inaudible) you're in software you can avail yourself to cloud and computing power that's so cheap; your demand for capital as a small percentage of what it was 10-15 years ago.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I think part of the focus on what we were talking about here as wire companies you know stay in private and so a lot of -- I think it's right, a lot of younger companies aren't getting the financing they might want or and the money is moving down, it's pouring into sort of the biggest one's and it's keeping those biggest ones, that otherwise would have gone public, private, longer.  </p><p>      And so that's kind of the -- at least the lends were looking at this but I take the point that you know, it's not being spread across equally.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, and that's what's allowing some of these most successful tech companies to push out an IPO where before these huge pulls of capital just weren't there and so you know, the Google's and Microsoft -- you know, I don't know, four/five years old and its market cap was $400 million to $500 million when it public where you know -- let's go to this slide, which is actually pretty interesting, it's a little hard to see but -- super hard to see but the...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The blue is how long they are private -- the little orange dot is when they go public, and the black dot is when they hit 10 billion.  And what you're seeing is just looking at it.  It's -- they are hitting 10 billion before they are going public.  </p><p>      It goes from 1980 to 2015, yes, but it's interesting; so all those companies are up top were private for shorter period of time went public when they were smaller and they were -- they wrote the public markets up to a much bigger evaluation.  </p><p>      And so what we're seeing now is just the opposite; companies are staying private a lot longer, you're actually hitting these big valuations even before they go public and one of the -- I think one of the primary reasons that's happening is really the mutual fund investors; and they too have backed off recently but for a while that's how they made their money, they invested in our lives orange dot when they went public, they didn't used to invest in private companies same way, but they still got the same value creation because they were in at that inflection point.  </p><p>      And then the company went public and they got to rise that value now; they have to get in when it's private or they miss out.  And that's their whole business model, it's just sort of ride the growth. So we've seen what otherwise would have been an IPO in terms of the size of the round and in terms of the liquidity being offered to the employees happening when it's a private company driven by mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and the like.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And along with that point and maybe this ties to Jonathan and Catherine, they were mentioning earlier valuations because there is a lot of money for these companies were talking about, valuations get pushed up very high it before they should be, in almost every case before they should be.  </p><p>      And it's because there is competition and you can take money from whoever you want, there was one company that's like need to go public this year that in the past round said we are raising money in two days and you have no access to any information, period.  Put your money down, and they raise several hundreds of billions of dollars in two days.  So it is just the dynamic is happening.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean (inaudible) price in Twitter and $800 million round shortly before they went public, Fidelity and Facebook, Morgan Stanley funds and Air B&amp;B.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Uber...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, Uber.  I mean these are the types of company that's getting these big rounds and then what's happening with them and is sort of a secondary component which is kind of a traditional IPO thing, right?  You have selling shareholders, the employees are able then to exercise options and get liquidity and what we have seen in these adjacent snippets, you know, Yelp did a pretty small primary round and did a $100 million buyback from employees.  </p><p>      Ali Baba before it went public probably did the largest private tender offer that ever, and certainly they were aware of to you know, thousands of employees led by Silverlake and DST Global you know, were north of the billion dollars.  And Mark Zuckerberg in Facebook were really innovators in many respects because they were losing the talent work, they were 4-5 years old people, working for less than market rates in terms of salary, they saw their friends engineers at Google or Apple able after a couple years seem to exercise options and make money and Zuckerberg and that management teams said we got to fix this.    </p><p>      We are not going to be able to track the best talent, how do we do it and so back in 2009 where everybody thought it was crazy, some investors put in a lot of money in a primary and a really high valuation and put in a lot of money in a private tender offer to the employee base that allowed for the exercise of options and for employees to get a little bit of liquidity, you know, a little bit, a million bucks, right?  Which is a lot of money to a 25-year-old engineer, but just a small fraction of what their value they had on paper.  </p><p>      And then we saw -- it went from the wild West of secondary trading that people kind of read about with Facebook employees selling shares to their dentist and things like that, not a lot of control to a very controlled private liquidity programs that were done purposefully and methodically to allow employees to get the type of liquidity they might either and early investors the type of liquidity they might have otherwise gotten in IPO. </p><p>      So founder liquidities no longer a taboo, we are seeing it as early as series B rounds these days and new technologies outfits like NASDAQ private markets are able to allow these transactions to happen way that's you know, better, faster, cheaper, and said that they would become through routine, they are periodic private liquidity programs for these big tech unicorns and allow them to act like a public company in terms of giving their employees that equity incentive that actually can turn into money.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I'll also say that applies to the investors too so with VCs, we now have other opportunities for getting out in the private markets at these high valuations and there are some of these companies where the early VCs already completely out right.  I mean people don't realize that but we were able to get out without it being a signalling mechanism which matters.  </p><p>      And because remember, even with these new big growth rounds, its they are not joining the board or advising the CEO, it still the early VCs who are doing that and so unless we feel the compulsion it's hard to have the entrepreneur feel the same compulsion.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So you know, at some point we are seeing early-stage VCs sell to the growth equity investors, sell to the mutual funds and sovereign wealth funds, where you know, 10-15 years ago it would have been really a bad signal for early-stage investor to get liquidity before the company was sold or went public.  Now, it's just sort of become a little more routine and there are pockets of capital that will -- the institutional investors will be able to get liquidity from one another.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Can I ask a question?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  1980, I worked on an initial public offering for contract drilling company in Houston.  I don't mind telling you the name, it was Drillers Inc.  and I know exactly what (inaudible) they were in.  I was a $20 million IPO and now let's work, I'll just calculated here roughly, $58 million would be the equivalent of going -- taking up and doing a IPO.  </p><p>      Now is that size IPO because frankly I don't think our charger here is for the company that does an IPO to billion-dollar valuation. We are much smaller than that, we are worried about the guy would do dry cleaners.  You know, is $58 million IPO just currently off the table, you would never do that now?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think my answer is it absolute wouldn't happen.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Would not happen?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Would not happen.  Because the market changed historically, they were investment banks that would do that sort of deal and then cover it, have coverage in the backside so that company would actually build and get market attention so they are like the (inaudible) of the world, they are gone.  Hambrecht &amp; Quist, they are gone...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Roberts and Stevens...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Roberts and Stevens they are gone, the four (inaudible) they called them and they were these sort of these super regional investment bank that would take a company like that.  And also companies like Microsoft, you know, which was kind of a smaller business public and that doesn't really exist anymore.  I don't know if you have seen...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Doesn't not going to happen.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So, they got buyed out around late 90s going into -- so JP Morgan buyed Hambrecht and Quist, they all got buyed...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  (Inaudible).  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And you try to get into this you know, innovative high-growth space but other things changed too so there is profitability, the whole analyst market banks and so that's why one of the reasons analyst coverage is hard to get and build your you know there is, we all know that -- I'm sure you all are aware there is a pilot going on around (inaudible) right so lower cap less liquid stock, it's harder for banks to make a trading profits so does that deal look as interesting anymore.    </p><p>      Even if A&amp;Q still existed, that would be a problem with you that that deal probably is not as profitable anymore.  Even investment banking fees, there is good competition investment banking and the IPO is 7 percent fee but you see a lot of follow-on offerings that get squeezed down so you know, the 3 percent or 4 percent because enough competition.  </p><p>      Now that's really happening at the you know, one's everyone wanted to but generally that whole banking model is less profitable. So, that is a challenge and then you have investors who have a lot of capital to put to work and so it'd 25 or now 50 with inflation.  </p><p>      You know, and you are going to get 10 percent allocation of do you want to write a $5 million cheque, some may, but lot mutual funds like I need to put $40 million or $50 million to work at a time because of so much capital.  If I'm going to spent all that time to listen to the banker pitch, understand the company, get excited about it, I can't just put $4 million to $5 million to work, I got to put more to work.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's an interesting problem and this goes to Jonathan's point you know, partially me coming from the tech world, I think of things and everything that is happening in my world in California right, but there are lots of companies growing in other parts of the country that a VC wouldn't step foot in and this money is not going to go to no matter how well they are doing, right?  And so and that that probably goes to your broader point.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I mean in, in California and I have a 55 company portfolio in an aggregate there was about $600 million, they have raised about $100 million but 40 percent of my portfolio have women founders and 4 percent of venture funded start-ups have women executives and half of my portfolio is Hispanic founders which is less than 0.1 which is less than 1 percent, 10 percent of my portfolio have black founders which is less than 1 percent and so and those percentages are probably 500 percent of the percent of the other VCs.  </p><p>      I mean I've worked for the White House on you know, on diversity sort of stuff and we just we have a blind selection process so we just remove people's names and pictures and that's where it stops.  And I speak Spanish and so that is part of this Spanish thing.  But I just -- it's hard for me, what I see is that there is a broad bottom.  </p><p>      You know, people get to accelerators, they might be able to get a $1 million to $2 million and there is this huge scrunch and then if I need $100 million cheque, that's actually a lot easier to come by.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That's right.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And 7 to 10 million is tough money.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And you know, so which is why we are talking about secondary liquidity options, why that's an issue and which is what Catherine was talking about, angel investor fatigue because there is no liquidity for this investors and it just -- it feels broken for those small sub $100 million businesses.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think you are right Jonathan and I'm not worried about you guys, you are going to make out, you are going to make out how it makes out, don't worry and keep doing what you are and do it some more.  Unfortunately or fortunately, I think what we are here for is to figure out 99.99995 percent that don't fit into this model.  </p><p>      So I think your information actually is very interesting, it helps understand why that perception among you know, the pressures of capital and we saw it like where are those pressures other than what's there in the Silicon Valley.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Only got gushing in the valley.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Very narrow path right?  Within Monday's drive all those steps whatever so I think our challenge is to identify what you guys are doing really well, why you are doing it and how can actually we roll it out to where a greater portion, in fact greater numbers, may be not in dollars but greater numbers that people are going to participate in the core growing jobs, growing businesses, growing capital helped out.  </p><p>      Maybe not to the extent that your demographics work out but is there something that we can take, apply and learn.  This is just like going to the moon versus going to the grocery store, this does not apply at all.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it's little off topic from this, but certainly when there is a tremendous matter competition for very few deals, venture capitalists at their heart, are you know, entrepreneurs and selves and very smart and they will seek opportunities that not everyone else is chasing, because it is too hard or too expensive.  </p><p>      So you know, Steve's case in revolution talking about looking into jurisdictions that aren't Silicon Valley and I think I just anecdotally we're seeing more of that, things like companies and in New Orleans, Louisiana that you know, have never done a deal there and all of a sudden the past couple of months we are starting to see things.  </p><p>North Carolina has historically had a solid base and we're seeing more activity there.  So, I think because of this phenomena and it hyper competition for the best deals, you could see smart money, saying I don't want to overpay, there are smart people in other places in this country, let's go see if we can find unearth some of that. But maybe you might have a different perspective.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I agree with that and so our funds (inaudible) because I came from some of the bigger funds like NEA, we only invest with those funds actually for financing risk, which is at the heart of what a lot of you are talking about.  And I will say that the really top-tier funds are not, they'll pretend they are and the press will say that and they will deny it to the nth degree, but they are not doing a lot of deals right now at all.  </p><p>      That I know that because I am looking to invest to them, I invest a alongside to them, I monitor and I work with them as partners, and they are just not doing a lot of deals right now but we are more than happy to watch all the others bump up our existing deals, right.  </p><p>      So that is an important phenomenon and you see some firms who used to be investing all the time taking on different industries all of a sudden VCs like insurance.  Like no one ever paid attention to insurance before all of a sudden they like yes sure, that's right it changes and people will follow where the opportunities are.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Could I ask another question?  Julie or Sebastian in the lot of tasks last year, at the end of the year, creating (inaudible) for small business so it was a definition small business was $100 million assets, is that what it was?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So, I think you are referring to the fact that when the bill created the committee portion of the bill, this committee codified.  It uses the same definition that this committee has of looking for private and public companies up to $250 million.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  $250 million, I'm a lawyer, not good with numbers. Alright, I got a company, it's worth $250 million or it is going to be worth $250 million, but it's not, it was a bank industry.  It's not blood testing or anything, it's Silicon Valley, it may be smokestack industry, it may be in Texas.  It maybe conventional oil and gas.  </p><p>      We are not going to finance it, what's the answer there, putting aside all the all the glitz and glamour and stuff it's going public at $1 billion and it's producing two to three times return of money.  </p><p>      I mean just in Iowa or Texas or wherever are from, the flyover zone, we've got companies out there, they need money, they pull in people, they pay taxes, they make a decent profit.  Where do we go to get money from those companies?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So I think it's hard to finance them from an equity finance perspective.  I think that they will be able to tap into the debt markets but the reality is it is harder to finance it than it is to sell it.  </p><p>      There is a huge part of the private equity industry and the buyout side is focused on the middle-market and a $250 million company that's making money in a traditional industry, there will be a line 20 deep to buy the company by private equity sponsors.  </p><p>      But if you want to sell 10 percent of it and try to build it, it's a harder one because the buyout shops will take control all day long and they'll actually, you know it's almost universal in deals right now where the management team will probably be asked to \"rollover\" so sell 80 percent of the company or 75 percent of the company and keep a minority position from the original founder but it is hard for those sorts of traditional businesses to find equity financing, my opinion.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So this may be a little bit of a tangent, but I think all of this, including the bigger topic comes down to marketing and the reason -- I think the number one reason.  If you asked me why should a company go public, I don't think any of the ones we all just dismissed a lot of the ones as not being relevant anymore.  </p><p>      The only one that I still think resonates is the legitimacy point right be being able to be, I am a public company, I am real. Everything else can be done elsewhere.  But when that marketing thing turns against you right, like when companies go public and they are already criticized in the first quarter for thinking you know, for not producing, the number one thing when our companies go public is they are not profitable.    </p><p>      And because they are throwing all their money into growth right that is what they are supposed to do, like we don't look for them to breakeven.  We look for them to grow and grow and grow and it ends up killing them right.  </p><p>      Like you have a model and I am not arguing about any particular company's value, but you have a model like Groupon who says that the way we do our business is different than the way you think about things.  </p><p>      So we are going to approach this a little bit differently right and that may be good or bad or legal or not legal about whatever the drama was, but that was a problem for them right and they pulled back. And that really hurt them right in a big way.    </p><p>      Similarly with these companies right, the ones that you are talking about Patrick, it's a marketing thing right if I view you as this little company in the middle of why is so much in the Valley right?  It's in the valley and people think you need to come to the Valley because you need that stamp in order to attract capital and you need that step in order to attract talent and everybody thinks they need to go there in order to work at a great tech firm. </p><p>      So everything starts to congeal in one place right and if you market and so people are really interested in growth and that's why venture is really hot, but I will tell you people are pulling back from that right now.    </p><p>      People are interested in stable returns right now and so there is an opportunity in some of these other places where there are stable businesses in traditionally stable industries that have stable returns and give you an alternative to just give you an opportunity for -- a lot of them don't think there are alternatives and I don't know what that means but I do think it's about how you spin it, how you market it and how the people who need to hear that marketing hear it, right.  </p><p>      So how do you publicize that to the folks who are in Dallas or are in New Orleans like Jamie mentioned.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  Now, let's say I got this company that I have that I did public offering for in 1980 and let's use $60 million around number is.  This private company's got $60 million, write what you want it.  If I wanted to get it to be a $250 million company in its -- they don't have any molecular chemist working for them or anything like that.  It's something that is this one of those ugly businesses just much makes money, OK.  </p><p>      And so what I did finance it to get it to maybe it has potential, it has it core of a billion assets, I mean venture capital comes to mind, angels come to mind.    </p><p>      I mean angels are local venture capital.  You know, we do have some financing sources and taxes.  Are those choices or industry partners I am assuming you can do joint ventures or something like that or (inaudible) buying they may do a JV or something like that. Are those the options that are available if we can do a public offering.  </p><p>      I'm just trying to figure out and I realize I am outside your fairway but little smaller but help me here understand what the financing options are from not in a whiz banks sizzling business, but is just one of those ugly...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And debt is not an option?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, you can only take debt so far and at some point someone's going whys up and say I'm not going to get my money back.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, it depends how much cash flows coming into our business.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right, but suppose it's all going back in the growth and maybe if you are building smokestack there is collateral being created there that the banks gets excited about but we know bank and we have banks.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I mean I think the quickest way to 250 million and we see it all the time is through a cell control to a private equity fund and they invest in you, so you sell 60 to 75 percent of it to you know, middle-market buyout fund in Boston or Chicago and they will then invest into that company to do more acquisitions to consolidate smaller players and that's sort of the path of least resistance, but that the quid pro quo is the founder's give up control.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But you got some liquidity once and we have seen it work really well for founders and families to give up that control, turnover you know, that control to institutional investors, professional boards go out do a couple of acquisitions and the next thing you know you have increased the value to 250 million in that second bite of the apple for that rollover piece can be meaningful.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Right.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That's the path of least resistance, but there are joint ventures and taking debt and trying to find a family office.  We have seen sort of real expansion of what we call fund-less sponsors, you know, individuals that are out of the big private equity shops, they don't have committed pools of capital but know how to do deals, they will find a company like that and say look, I will bring in you know, some private equity partners and help you build the business.  </p><p>      We are seeing a lot of transactions and those are particularly at $50 million T-shirt company in Atlanta, you know, or healthcare services company in Cleveland.  And those are the sort of things where you are seeing private middle-market, private equity really play a role.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm sorry, I'll pass on my next question, I'll let Jonathon speak.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  If you guys were going to design a system, (inaudible) and we are going a design system for investors to be able to raise $10 million, $20 million, $50 million or for companies to be able to raise from, I don't know from $1 to $100 million and then achieve liquidity on the backend, what would that do or what would you tweak about the current system?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Depends who you are, right?  So as a VC, I have different incentives and an entrepreneur has different incentives, et cetera, right?  So, a big ends to my interests and talk as an entrepreneur right and so already see things developing of this nature right like kick starter is a very basic example of an alternative way to raise money that takes us out of the equation.  But sometimes I think it is a dumb choice to go and kick-start and sometimes it is a smart choice, right?  </p><p>      And similarly, Angel list is another great example of that.  You also have several of these kind of family office networks or middle tier institutional networks probably ones that are relevant to what Patrick's doing actually, creating these kind of, groups that deals can post on the platform when anyone sees it, people can comment and it kind of like an angels but for all stages of things including for funds, right. </p><p>      And I do think that it's about the information right so it's about if entrepreneurs there is a lot of people looking at finances things and a lot of people looking for the money.  So it's about making the connection between the two right?  </p><p>      And so I do see the proliferation of platforms allowing that.  So the answer is, the more information the more you can connect the parties, the better.  For me the reason I say it's different for VCs because you know, the less options you have, the more you got to go with me, the better deals for me, right?  So that is, you know, (inaudible).  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So that's basically a more efficient markets?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  To a degree.  It's also why you see the development of -- so my firm is a good example of this, as is kind of a phenomenon that entries and Horowitz has said the VC world two, which is another value-added investor, right, which was kind of a fake term in a decade ago and is now a realtor.  </p><p>      If you have a choice, then the model needs to change right, we need to find other ways to help our companies and add value.  You can get in and so I think that is a similar element to it so the more information, the more opportunity, the more I have to do more which, by the ways in all the incentives of what you guys are trying to accomplish.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So I would like to switch back please to liquidity. So one of the things we have been discussing, we want to try to understand the impact on and the fact that investors invest and hold things longer therefore that you know, there is less money coming back into the market.  </p><p>      So I see that as -- OK so typically they would be out liquidity event the money, the profits would be ploughed right back into that into the economy and some new other new start-ups or maybe they took it and bought another house somewhere so again it's fuelling the economy.  </p><p>      So what we're trying to understand is, what can we do for or how can we understand this is in sublet, at some point in time, and I agree with you, you know, there is a lot of not smart money out there and at some point will they experience investor for take it and just get out of the market.  And things settle down a little bit and so we are trying to work through this.  Other piece we've talked about is I think there is -- and I'm anxious to hear from SEC how their tick pilot is going.    </p><p>      So one time there was a lower tier public market and doesn't exist anymore in and does that seem like it is something that we should be exploring or considering so that again we can create this and I'm calling it velocity of money, but that's probably an incorrect term, that's a treasury term and I'm probably using it wrong.  </p><p>      So what are your thoughts about you know, liquidity, how that impacts IRR, how it impacts the -- the flow of money into the economy long-term.  Even though, there's like -- to me I look at it and say supply demand and supply is pretty big right now and so that's impacting what we are seeing, supply so what are your thoughts on liquidity options.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'll just say one thing and then these guys chime in because I think they know more about it.  I don't think there is a lack of liquidity at all.  I just think it's in different places than you think it is so and that's kind the point of the conversation right.  There's other ways to get out, there's other ways to move money, there's other ways to exit at all different stages and that is actually why less companies are going public in my opinion because it is not the only option for liquidity.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  There is more liquidity now than ever.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes I agree.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And things like 487, to make it a little clearer that yes, there is a way to do it but you know, in 2000 and before the 2007, you know, you would really never see founders and employees getting liquidity until the venture investors got liquidity and now we see.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes like in the series B round is sort of the first place we see it which is pretty early.  You know companies still have a long way to go but we're seeing you founders and some early employees be able to get liquidity and then seeing programmatic frequent you know, what's a quarter or twice a year type of liquidity for the larger private companies that didn't exist.  </p><p>      Things, technologies that allow that to occur, easier -- sort of all contributing to this additional liquidity that we have now.  And these people are buying houses and I think the real estate prices in the Silicon Valley reflect liquidity.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It is not without conflict either, right?  People are concerned about it still because you know, it misalign incentives ,right?  So you know, the part of the reason it is happening is because of the talent crunch.  People need to be able to keep their talent, but then it's also when you are giving talent the way out of being locked into the incentive structure, it creates response.  So people are still trying to figure it out.  I don't think any of the companies that figured it out.  You know, to a T.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I was going to say would you say also on life science biotech's I mean, my sense of what they are doing with their capital is really has to be in clinical development, I mean clinical trials so I mean we are totally -- so that would be different.  Would you agree?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes and they still adopt much more of a traditional model of you know, may not be found in three years and I feel maybe five or eight depending on where the market is, but they don't really have a choice because you know, at this point of you have to get your employees liquidity, you only have to get them there because there is massive source of private capital that can keep you private and you get to keep control and there is a benefit, right.  </p><p>      If that didn't exist, you wouldn't do an IPO.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That's a good point.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's only capital, right?  All of this phenomena are about the larger market forces at work.  To the extent that many of those do not apply in biotech, we see more of a traditional model and so we don't see founders getting out until after the lockups on IPO but it's just the way tech was 15 years ago, it really hasn't changed.  </p><p>      I do think just to the -- you brought up the tick size pilot, that is interesting to watch and we'll see what the results are that as well as whether that will create float for some of the smaller cap stocks and keep banks and analysts in the games so you might have a different calculus in going public.  It's not going to change the calculus of how it got private capital, I don't need to go public.  </p><p>      But you know, if your company is otherwise is or that market dries up, I still don't think it is going to overcome, anything like this can overcome the fact that a lot of public investors you may want to put big chunks of capital to work and Scott have enough flow to make that work for them, right.  That's just for a lot of capital, the pools that is invested from that's a phenomenon that can be difficult to overcome but you know, this can be helpful.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Can I raise a question that's going to tie into something that we are told about this morning which was liquidity in the Regulation A space.  When you talk about some companies as early as Series B rounds, what size of company we are talking about because I have the feeling that the companies we are talking about this morning are very much smaller than the guys who are now going and getting liquidity as early as Series B.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So maybe you know, $12 million to $15 million pre- money value, maybe up to $20 million and they are raising you know, through $5 million to $10 million.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Is that for Series B?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, on the small side.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Oh OK.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Very small.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And that's like what the A is now because the valuations have gone up typical series.  I mean, traditionally a series B company was a company you know, had us maybe 5 million in revenue, 5 to 10 in revenue kind of thing like early revenue around the like, you know, 30s, 40s, 50s and valuation your 10 X would be high right of that revenue multiple. </p><p>      Now like a typical soup you know, A can get that high you know more like the 20s, 30s, but there -- things have just been pushed up but traditionally Jamie is correct that's the right side.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Fenwick does a really nice study every quarter and showings sort of where the value from a B is I was actually just looking at bears and so I think things it that definitely it's creeping higher for every round.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And size wise too this used to be like $15 million in infusion and now they can be up to like 40 million -- 50 million.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I know biotech but everything that really has changed is I can't remember the last time I helped an entrepreneur with the business plan and pitched into a VC.  VCs create their own companies, they know where the sciences is, they go find the management team, they license and it's really much of a build your own so that I look at 200 deals like the way it is intact where you can start something with low capital, you are going to need a lot of capital to begin with.  </p><p>      And in the 90s when it was Hambrecht &amp; Quist, I did a lot of IPOs were the funds raised to 20 million, 25 million, I can remember 15 million, we won't even really look serious about getting involved with accompanies who is A if they haven't (inaudible) raised 20 -- 25 because it's a couple years of burn.  </p><p>      You know, if they only raised 5, it's like by the time we get involved in, they may not be here right?  So that the scale is completely different but it has also come from the fact that investors have learned saying it's too risky, the way to go to the entrepreneur, so to speak.    </p><p>      They wanted -- they are already walking the holes and the labs to figure out who the potential entrepreneurs and recruiting them out. So it's a very different dynamic.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Can you talk a little bit more about what it was like when you have a smaller investment banks raising smaller rounds for more companies, like what were their economics like if-  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  They were doing 7 percent on the IPO same they were probably making a little while and I am not a banking expert, they were probably making a little more on the trades after and at least in life sciences a lot in tech, you would count on two or three pretty fast follow on to that same 70 percent so you could see a you know, even though it's a small dollar, maybe it was 15 or secondary as 25 and then you did a 30 down the road.  </p><p>      You know, that's not a bad income stream right for smaller bank and you got some trading out of them.  It was decent enough to hook up out of pretty good multiples of time that tech was taking off.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  This might be a switch a little bit but I have been thinking about Jonathan what you were saying about your firm and the numbers and how it had -- and also the question how do we fix some of these things.  A mentor of mine, Steve Coltie writes a lot on entrepreneurship, has this whole list of things that are required for successful entrepreneurship ecosystem and one of the ones I was remember is celebrating the wins and I think that's key, right.  </p><p>      So when you go invest in the middle of the country, it happened with New York like so when New York became a big venture ecosystem people threw tons of money and then tons of money and they all stopped because everyone was like where are the IPOs, where are the exits?  </p><p>      It's like a nice idea for few years and all will jump on the bandwagon because by nature human beings are lemmings, including investors.  And what they all would do it is they'll go after it but until you see the wins, no one's going to do it and when you do see the wins if no one knows about it, that might be good for you as an investor because you're dibs on those great opportunities, but it doesn't encourage more money to come in.  </p><p>      So there is something about you know, identifying the wins or identifying the success stories and being able to make them more clear so in your business with the different minorities and women and gender, in running things, you know, show the wins we have that NEA with care.com when Sheila took her company public so the more you give them, the more you publicize the more people see that it actually works and you know affects the bottom line, the more they are interested.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We've only got a few minutes left, I just wanted make sure is there anything from the panellists that you think we missed any insightful slides, I'm pleased that the conversation is going exactly the way that we needed to go but are we missing anything from your point of view.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):I think maybe just you know, one of the points about why companies aren't going public is there is a lot of M&amp;A still and you are seeing in the big strategies and could you see more of it the repatriation of cash in the new administration is allowed in a tax efficient way.  </p><p>      It can underestimate the effect that that has on a lot of companies just to get big enough and then Google or oral courses go comes in and makes a compelling offer and they sell before they would even get the chance to go public.  </p><p>      And just recently we are seeing you know, these dual track where a company will file to go public and right before they go, big strategic will snap them up, Cisco did that with that dynamics, Stone Canyon did it with Mouser and those are just in the past couple months so I think that is it.  </p><p>      We touched on it, but that's important issue why companies just staying private, longer or just not going not even ever getting the chance to go public because there are deep pools of capital.  The big strategic have a lot of equity cash, debt is cheap and they are able to pay your top dollar take these companies is out of play.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And you are showing the big guys tech but this is happening in other sectors.  The banking and insurance they are monitoring the FinTech start-ups.  We have started to keep a database of 5000 FinTech companies because the banks want to know where they are so we buy them, are they innovators, are they competition, who's going to need a lunch kind of thing.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's happening in consumer products.  So a lot of companies who have set up their own internal innovation, arms realizes that it's hard to create an innovative culture yourself, and so there are much more looking externally saying to a partner they'll do a buy it in and you know, it's not always tech, but it also got a tech feel to it, but the acquirers not always a tech company.  So there is many I would put in the cereal, acquirer category.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And it is not even a public company, maybe we are starting to see the tip of the iceberg as Uber and DD and.  Air BNB, for example, recently announced acquisitions have been able to borrow a bunch of money, could we see that sort of strategic expand outside of the large public companies, did that sort of M&amp;A.  Go ahead Jamie.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTCHINSON</emphasis>:  And I think the last issue, it's still expensive to be public and to Jonathan's point may be around why we are not seeing some of these smaller public companies is you know, the compliance makes it expensive.  It is real money, it's millions of dollars to go public and its millions of dollars to stay public.  It has to sort of be economically make economic sense to do that and make that investment.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That's probably biggest one we didn't touch on.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I had a subjective one that I think is worth mentioning.  So, the mentality aspect of things is really important so entrepreneurs as Jamie mentioned this early you know, they believe in their company, they want their word, they are long-term, they do not care about this stuff and they do not want to hear you telling them that they are not you know, that their passion is not real or not working because you don't understand it right and so I think that's what kinds of pulls them away, but the VCs are really important too.  </p><p>      So VCs when they invest in something or they have a bad experience, they wear their scars forever.  They just don't forget, it's amazing.  We'll have meetings like what you remember 15 years ago when we did this thing is like there were no phones, like Apple didn't exist or whatever, right.  </p><p>      So and they don't forget and when they do take the lead back in which they ultimately do often, if they get hurt again, it almost kills the opportunity set and I would say VCs have been significantly I would say they feel scars whether they admit it or not from the most recent IPOs or the past IPOs.  Some recent examples we have already gave examples of and all of them have had it with some things because we are all in different deals, but all and a lot of the same deals too.  </p><p>      This year is a very crucial year because there are a lot of tech companies going public this year or that are expected to and the good news for the bigger point is there does get a point in which we say this is ridiculous, you need to go public like there is a point at which everyone is like this just needs to happen.  I do not have any insider knowledge, but I would bet Uber's feeling that, I would bet Air BNB is real feeling that right?  </p><p>      So there are these -- there is a point at which it has to happen, but if it doesn't go well, it will especially given all the new opportunities and options and alternative routes, it will kill it.  So fingers crossed and if there is a way to mediate that that be a great thing.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Thank you.  Are any follow-up questions, wind up questions?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Just my personal stuff is on my sleeve of course, but I am actively taught looking at taking companies like doing a reggae offering and then seeing if the compliance is actually about the same as taking company in public under London AIM exchange.  </p><p>      For them $5 million a year going 30 percent year-over-year is actually a nice IPO or even looking at the Australian stock exchange and you know, being public but actively traded on a foreign exchange.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think just one thing some of the things that you guys have touched on, there was a market for small IPOs that does not exist anymore.  These companies do not belong in the public markets at you know, even like (inaudible) billion dollar market capital, companies they struggle.  </p><p>      You are not going to get research written about your company, are not going have a bank getting you to your next deal.  The cost of being public it says 2.5 out there, I have talked about being the General Counsel public company Brian has as well.    </p><p>      There is a real cost so it's great to say we want companies to go public and we do.  There are definitely wonderful reasons and (inaudible) probably the public, but until we sorted out some the things like (inaudible) decimalization, that does provide more spread for research and others sort of things that came with you know, penny increment trading before that change.  </p><p>      There are enough market forces right now that I think our goal should also be -- we talked about earlier days try to find a way to help create off public exchange liquidity for these companies that are very successful.    </p><p>      They are just not you know, tech unicorns so I think that has to continue to be part of what we focus on because those companies are private, they are getting funding, they can get that whenever they are not, the ones we are seeing in the news but they probably also shouldn't be in a highly liquid public market listing.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Anybody else.  Oh, thank you very much indeed.  That was really useful.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Thanks for having us. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Jamie can we have the slides sent around?  OK guys, we are going to move on to the final piece of today's program which is (inaudible) diversity.  We have now had a couple of discussions on the recommendations.  I spent a good time of, a good portion of our time on October 5th as well as they a conference call on December 7th.  </p><p>      As you recall currently regulation SK in item 407C2, little Roman at six, request company to disclose in the proxy statements whether a nominating committee considers diversity in identifying nominees for the company's Board of Directors.  The rule also requires that if the company has a policy with respect to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, how that policy is implemented and how its effectiveness is assessed.  </p><p>      As we have discussed the disclosure requirement is soft, diversity is not defined, which means a regulation hasn't been as helpful in generating useful information as it could be.  Based on our prior discussions we come up with a draft recommendation, you should all have both.  </p><p>      I have received soft and now you got hardcopies all of the recommendation and so I think you have also seen that they are suggestions that Greg Yardley sent around to make changes to that wording and the changes that Greg had suggested where to change the recommendation.    </p><p>      The recommendation is at the bottom of the page and his, now I have lost his statement.  He says instead of saying \"while generally the definition of diversity should be up to each issuer, issuer should include disclosure regarding race, gender and ethnicity of each member/nominee and self-identified by the individual,\" that's in our current draft.  </p><p>      The alternative language being suggested is, \"while generally the definition of diversity should be up to each issuer, issuer should include disclosure whether race, gender and ethnicity of each member/nominee and self-identified by the individual are considered.\"  </p><p>      Anybody got any opinions as to -- so looking at the sentence that begins \"while generally\" and it would the alternative that Greg is suggesting is \"while generally the definition of diversity should be up to each issuer, issuer should include disclosure whether race, gender and ethnicity of each member/nominee as self-identified by the individual are considered\" is slightly different term spin on the -  </p><p>      The race, gender and ethnicity of each member would be still self-identified.  That is still included.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  He just changed the word regarding to whether.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I will consider it.  Yes.  It's did you think about that.  Did you consider it?  I mean that's a big change between the date the two.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  From my standpoint it strikes me as less useful information.  The answer is yes/no and it doesn't give you granularity on gender, racial, ethnic to the representation which is really what the value add of this kind of reporting could be.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The original is more what have you got on your board and then that the new one was did you think about who you have got on your board.  And apologies to Greg if he is listening, I'm totally misphrasing that.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes but we discussed that...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We have these words as well...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I know, I know.  And we went back -- OK so we discussed it and my preference was for the details.  I like the original language that we have.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Any opposing.  All right so I think the sense of the panel is that so we would leave the language as it is currently drafted and what about the last sentence.  Greg is asking this is the sentence, \"while disclosures should be the default issuer should have the option to opt out\", do we keep that sentence?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The way I am reading is that we're saying if you don't want to answer, you don't have to.  If you leave it, if you put it in or leave it out they are going to be obligated to answer.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I am not sure if you they are going be obligated.  I suppose you would, yes.  I think you are right.  If you want to disclose...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And to Michelle's point, if we think the information is relevant, then because my opinion is the people who do not want to answer are going to be the ones who downright so why do we want to put compliance in for people who-  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Any objections to that and so what the proposal is right now is that we keep the language as disclosed as said out in this draft.  We need to vote on that?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I thought we were saying that we wanted to remove the last sentence.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Well, the suggestion was to remove it, but I think...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I thought Laura was agreeing with that and I think I do too.    </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You agree to remove it?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Sorry, the way I read it -- OK, let me go back again, is if we leave it in, they can opt out of it.  So do we want them to be able to opt out or not report.  And if the answer is yes, then we leave it in.  If we really want this information...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You want to force the information?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  If you want to force the information, I would remove the sentence. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's not quite relevant here, but on a program at SBA that we run where we have an opt out portion, we're finding that a lot of women owned businesses opt out because they do not want to be -- they public feel like they will be disadvantaged by being identified.  </p><p>      So there can be -- maybe opt out, can be used in ways that one doesn't intend and if the information useful eliminating the opt out, I would indoors eliminating it.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Lisa?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We had a lot of discussion surrounding that and I am more in favor of leaving it there, and that's why we put the language in for the default to be to answer and put this out there because the other argument as well is, was giving everyone the opportunity to self-identify which gave us more flexibility there.  </p><p>      And the default being this and then the opt out is a decision on the backend.  So my preference is to leave it in as it is.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Any other thoughts?  I mean it does provide the option for them to define diversity however they want, so that kind of allows them flexibility there if they really don't want to talk about ethnicity, gender and race.  So I think I feel comfortable taking it out.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think if we look back at the fifth sentence, the role failed to generate the information that's useful.  We leave that sentence in it.  I think the same result -- we're going to get the same result as we're currently getting.  So I would agree that we should take that sentence out.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  Can we have a proposal to take this language and take the last sentence out?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And the second.  All in favour?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Aye.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't want to force a premature vote.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I would like it to be kept in.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And Catherine?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm sorry, I'm not sure because I'm trying to think through the implications of leaving it in or taking it out based on the wording that already exists there.  So maybe our attorney can help us.  I mean...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  The first part, does it require SUS to describe?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Catherine, I mean -- I don't know what the right solution is, I try to refer to you all, and I've talked enough on other things.  But I mean it's a sticky wicket, however, you do it.  I mean it's -- I mean I think just go with your gut because it is -- I mean I think, the only think or thought I had was is our system or the SEC system is not mine is one of disclosure.  </p><p>      I don't think we mandate unless there is a special statutory admonition about the diversity and disclosure of it, is there -- I mean, we're not mandating you to have a board that's diverse; we're just saying you disclose it and so -- I mean I think that seems to me to be within the powers of the SEC to say you need to disclose that and so -- then it becomes a matter of policy, and what we all think is in the best interests.  </p><p>      Corporate America knows that diversity is a hot button, and rightly so I think some people would say and I agree with that to an extent; Jonathan and I talked about it at the last meeting that -- there is any number of use in this and I'm trying to be sensitive and not step on any toes.  So I think it don't matter, at the end of the day the commission is going to give it a lot more thought and they will come to probably a more considered decision than I am capable of doing.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  This is of course only a recommendation, that is not the actual wording of whatever we think the commission showed up. Would it change anybody's mind if the final sentence said something along the lines of while disclosures should be the default; issuer should have the option to opt out if they explain why.  Make any difference?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, I'll just live it on.  Then you get into what is an adequate explanation.  I mean I keep -- I mean this is such, I have -- this young lawyer, you heard me mention the young lawyer whose -- who went to Washington and I've known since he was a freshman at college.  </p><p>      Well, I talked to him recently and he said well, and that was about this very issue and I said Chad, you know, I mean -- and we were talking about and I think I mentioned on one of the calls that I knew a woman who was European ancestry but she had grown up in Zimbabwe and moved to Fort Worth and I meet her and she said well, I'm African- American.  She used to color her eye (ph).  </p><p>      And -- I mean this whole thing is rather imprecise and my friend Chad whose parents are -- his father is African-American, his mother is white, he says I check both boxes.  So there is no precision here. And I mean, you just -- you do the best you can and we go from there, we have same situation with our former President, who was -- his father was not African-American, he was African; his mother was white, he self identifies as African-American.  I mean it's too complicated for me.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So we'll leave the box checking for the people who write the rules.  Lucy?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, what is their overall intent with the disclosure?  Is it data that we're going to utilize?  Is it data for decision-making?  What did we determine from that originally? </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It's for potential investors.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, I mean I think the summary of the discussions in the two previous discussions -- I like after considering that -- I mean those I think are our objectives and the aim at which the recommendation looks to underscore.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I will support whichever way we go but since there is full self-disclosure and we're not going through in redefining each of the categories; you know, the data could be skewed either way, that's why I was more in favor of the act outside of it because you are going to do other due diligence; you are going to do other items that are to be important as well.  </p><p>      This is really, really important; I am just worried that we won't have as consistent as data as what we think we would have.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't think you're always going to get a lot of data from this, not that you can put into chance, I think.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I think that's the case.  I think that we're always going to have my own children right, think I want which box should I check in?  Frankly, I hope we get to the point where you know the box is always checked up the bottom or whatever it is.  </p><p>      But for today and for now, we've had multiple discussions about this and I think we've all identified and come to the conclusion statistically from studies etcetera that -- that it is a business benefit to include diversity.  </p><p>      And which is why maybe investors would like to know that in the -- regards to disclosure the Patrick speaking about this is just another piece of information to disclose.  It isn't going to perfect, no, absolutely not, but it's going to give an essence of perhaps a picture once they -- once people do all their other due diligence and so it gives them a first place to start; and this is the case may be depending where they're at.  </p><p>      So that's why we really think it's important that we instead of letting people, organizations, whatever maintain the status quo because that's what we're talking about that we take out that option.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I think it's also really useful for fund managers and wealth advisors who are investing in public equities because their clients are asking for -- you know, I want to invest in companies that have diverse boards, I want invest in companies that have women in leadership, for example.  </p><p>      So I just can't imagine any downside; I mean if the company really doesn't want to talk about race and gender, they can say we have people from the following 10 states or we have people from the following three age groups.  You know, it's totally up to them to define diversity.  I just don't see any problem with it.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Alright.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Also you can take it out.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  So before we get to that bit, does anyone have any objections to any of the rest of the language?  Are we are OK?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  So I have the same concern that I had when we discussed this last time which is it says, provide information regarding each member nominee self-identified by the individual but what happens if an individual chooses not to be -- chooses not to self-identify, right.  </p><p>      So I don't love the idea of opt out if we're going to think this important I think we should make it important, opt out against the opt out and nobody will understand why some companies have it and some companies don't have it but I do think we need to have some mechanism for companies to acknowledge that some other members were not willing to self-identify, otherwise you will have 10 board members with information on five and no information on the other five because those people choose not to self-identify but it's going to raise an SEC comment I would think.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Presumably, the rule when written would say, in the event the individual declines to provide that information, put NA in the box.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK, that's just my concern.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And I'm just going to punt that and say, I'll bet that you guys at the SEC who are good at writing these rules, we'll manage to work that one out.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  NA.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  NA, Box 1, Box 2, NA.  All good alternatives. Alright, so can we move to the -- the proposal is the language as drafted without the last sentence.  So can we -- again, you repropose? OK, and then all in favour.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Aye.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Anyone against?  We're good, we have language, thank you.  Just keep it on.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I gave out a comparison.  We don't need to talk about, if you have any comments or you -- maybe not helpful after the discussion today but anybody wants to assume any comments to it, it's just something I did in dealing with business people and I found that tabular presentation side-by-side are useful and help people grasp the issues.  </p><p>      So I did that just because I felt like it helped me just drafting it, it helped me crystallize some of the thoughts but anyway, you will all see the typo in the first page and I will correct that.  But Julie, if you're interested in posting it on the website, I will get you the digital flap.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And thanks for doing that, it's useful resource. Before we completely wind up, I will work with the staff to put together the recommendations from the discussions this morning. Interestingly, I thought the overall viewers, I would have -- if I had to predict anything, I would have said, no pre-empt everything but there is a much more subtle and reasoned newest opinion that wants to take the states thoughts into account in both of the proposals that we discussed and we will be reflecting that and we'll be getting drafts out on those.  </p><p>      So thank you very much for those discussions.  And just one thing before we leave; any thoughts on what goes on to the agenda for next time.  I know Catherine had.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm very curious, I know I brought this up last time too but whenever the tick pilot is completed, I really would like to see that data and hear the remarks from the SEC on that.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I would love to hear him aggregate data statistics on fraud, just because if we're protecting -- trying to protect unaccredited investors it would actually be helpful to say, OK, these are the instances when they -- when things have gone south.  </p><p>      I would also love to talk about getting data on how much capital small businesses think that they need.  And what are ways that we could actually suggest to get that data because all of our opinions are anecdotal.  I don't think we actually have any hard date on the subtle; if it's possible.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And to that point, elaborating your point Jonathan; I thought it was really interesting because clearly we have different communities, right.  Here the gushers and the gusher and that's great. Would that like to have a better sense of -- you now, is it 90 percent and how many billion is that for 200 companies versus the companies I think Patrick you're talking about the ones that I see that are -- that de-capitalization above leverage, OK, but below IPO or access to that type of capital.  </p><p>      So if there is any data out there, I don't -- you know, what is that -- what does it look like?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, and -- you know, there are so many companies that completely count themselves out of even thinking about being able to raise capital and because it's so complicated they hear about these laws and they hear, oh I can only talk to wealthy people and I don't know any wealthy people, so even if we were to get data on how many companies are trying to raise capital unsuccessfully that would leave out a huge number that just don't even think that it's possible for them.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  If we could just get the tip of the iceberg; but I don't know how -- I know that's really hard.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Not sure where we would look for that iceberg.  Any thoughts on where the iceberg might be?  Gratefully received.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  QuickBooks.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Interesting.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Also keep in mind that in some exemptions you can't use general solicitation to the extent that you have company self- identifying themselves as publicly looking to raise capital, query whether that puts them already in the category of an exemption that would need to permit general solicitations.  </p><p>      So I think part of the challenge is; how do you get data on the aggregate without actually going to the particulars of a specific company such that particular company doesn't have to publicly indicate to the world that they are looking for capital?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That would be kind of ironic.  Hey companies, who would like to self-identify as violating Section 5?  We maybe shouldn't do that then.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  But I also think there is a census, there is a census committee -- they do it like an annual census of businesses; and this is where they get the jobs numbers from and this is where they get that sort of stuff.  If we could in that census, while the census actually going on getting that data to say hey zero to 10; you know, how much would you like to have more money to grow your business or something along those lines.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I do know there are surveys that are out there because I filled them out.  But and I don't think we're going to get a precision and data; it's not like we're going to get a census or whatever but just something to -- so that when -- you know, people like Jonathan and Patrick, when they're throwing out numbers; there is something -- you know, and I don't have to sink a billion, right.  </p><p>      We have more precision in the amount of numbers because, again, intuitively through anecdotal qualitative experience, and the people in my world.  They feel -- they fall into more of the industries, the number of businesses that Patrick is.  So if we can just get a -- or spoke if we just get kind of a data field that it would be really great to put something in the ground, continuing quest.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We have (inaudible) capital market survey, we find it useful for at least the lower and middle market comparisons.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  That would be good if we can get.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  All right, anything else, am I missing anything before we wind up.  All right, thank you very much.  Thank you everybody in the Internet land.  Thanks.  </p><p>      END    </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MXM-07S1-JDPT-T2HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Goyal was against using free trade agreements to justify the free flow of data. Instead, he said, government restrictions on data flows would allow India to be able to use \"personal, community and public data\" generated in the country towards the welfare and development of its people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Undeniably, data sovereignty is an attractive concept. Anyone familiar with the business models of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon would have an uneasy feeling about the extent of access these companies have to our behaviours and habits, and the magnitude of value they have amassed from the promise of this data. Their growing power creates not just concerns of privacy, but extends to encroaching public infrastructure functions like transport, health care and finance, often bulldozing local interests. Pit this against the challenges of unemployment, and the worldwide rush by regulators to make amends to the asymmetry of power between companies and people, and data sovereignty looks like a seductive proposition.</p><p>But how much do the people of the country really have to gain from the government's flavour of data sovereignty? At first blush, the concept has an anti-colonial ring. But a closer look reveals that the government's approach to data sovereignty simply replaces foreign companies reaping benefits from technological solutionism with Indian companies, while leaving the dangers created by data extractivism for Indian people intact.</p><p>Indeed, if resisting data colonisation was really the issue, a broader and more thoughtful frame would need to be adopted - one that acknowledges the colonisation inherent in the intensified datafication of people and things, in the seamless facilitation of these data flows to private interests and the State, as well as in the unquestioned adoption of the Silicon Valley narrative that data is an objective truthteller. As long as these conditions remain unchanged, treating data as a sovereign asset takes away from individual rights over data, and trades them away for a higher GDP figure and greater State control. What follows are examples to illustrate the unhelpful frame of State sovereignty over data. Two notable instruments that animate the State's vision for data sovereignty are the draft e-commerce policy and the Personal Data Protection bill.</p><p>The data protection bill proposes a horizontal data localisation requirement, meaning that anyone systematically dealing with the personal data of Indians would have to store a copy of that data within the country. Such a measure would heighten and consolidate the access to data by the government for surveillance, while also reducing the range of options available for an individual to choose services on the Internet, creating a very real trade-off between state sovereignty over data and indi</p><p>vidual autonomy and choice.</p><p>While many parts of the e-commerce policy are worthy of attention, its creative categorisation of data is a cause for concern. The policy proposes a separate class of data called \"community data\". This is an important conceptual step that holds promise for thinking about a more collective approach to data ownership and management. Unfortunately, the policy uses community data as a means to automatically achieve data sovereignty vesting in the State. By conflating data belonging to the people of the country with data belonging to the country itself, the policy makes individual rights and collective interests subservient to an abstract national interest. It also ignores the fact that different groups necessarily have different and often conflicting interests.</p><p>There are alternative conceptions of sovereignty that aim to bring back control and autonomy to people. These conceptions provide a framework within which there is a possibility to articulate questions about the agency of the individual, and of collective interest. Without this, our experience of technologies is a choice between being tied to the exploitation by big tech companies, or being content with the tightening grip of the State over our data. The State does, however, have a role in enabling an exercise of individual or collective sovereignty through several concrete regulatory measures: through positive actions like instituting strong encryption policies and requiring the adoption of open source software in governance functions, as well as through abstaining from restricting data flows resulting in the restriction of choices.</p><p>So far, the government's conception of data sovereignty seems to mostly amount to an assertion of power over foreign companies and an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, vying to be leaders in artificial intelligence, while also strengthening control over the citizenry. However, it threatens the possibility of individuals' exercise of sovereignty, undermining the rights of the citizens, and is a lost chance to meaningfully grapple with data colonisation.</p><p>Nayantara Ranganathan is programme manager, the Internet Democracy Project.

Goyal was against using free trade agreements to justify the free flow of data. Instead, he said, government restrictions on data flows would allow India to be able to use \"personal, community and public data\" generated in the country towards the welfare and development of its people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Undeniably, data sovereignty is an attractive concept. Anyone familiar with the business models of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon would have an uneasy feeling about the extent of access these companies have to our behaviours and habits, and the magnitude of value they have amassed from the promise of this data. Their growing power creates not just concerns of privacy, but extends to encroaching public infrastructure functions like transport, health care and finance, often bulldozing local interests. Pit this against the challenges of unemployment, and the worldwide rush by regulators to make amends to the asymmetry of power between companies and people, and data sovereignty looks like a seductive proposition.</p><p>But how much do the people of the country really have to gain from the government's flavour of data sovereignty? At first blush, the concept has an anti-colonial ring. But a closer look reveals that the government's approach to data sovereignty simply replaces foreign companies reaping benefits from technological solutionism with Indian companies, while leaving the dangers created by data extractivism for Indian people intact.</p><p>Indeed, if resisting data colonisation was really the issue, a broader and more thoughtful frame would need to be adopted - one that acknowledges the colonisation inherent in the intensified datafication of people and things, in the seamless facilitation of these data flows to private interests and the State, as well as in the unquestioned adoption of the Silicon Valley narrative that data is an objective truth-teller. As long as these conditions remain unchanged, treating data as a sovereign asset takes away from individual rights over data, and trades them away for a higher GDP figure and greater State control. What follows are examples to illustrate the unhelpful frame of State sovereignty over data. Two notable instruments that animate the State's vision for data sovereignty are the draft e-commerce policy and the Personal Data Protection bill.</p><p>The data protection bill proposes a horizontal data localisation requirement, meaning that anyone systematically dealing with the personal data of Indians would have to store a copy of that data within the country. Such a measure would heighten and consolidate the access to data by the government for surveillance, while also reducing the range of options available for an individual to choose services on the Internet, creating a very real trade-off between state sovereignty over data and individual autonomy and choice.</p><p>While many parts of the e-commerce policy are worthy of attention, its creative categorisation of data is a cause for concern. The policy proposes a separate class of data called \"community data\". This is an important conceptual step that holds promise for thinking about a more collective approach to data ownership and management. Unfortunately, the policy uses community data as a means to automatically achieve data sovereignty vesting in the State. By conflating data belonging to the people of the country with data belonging to the country itself, the policy makes individual rights and collective interests subservient to an abstract national interest. It also ignores the fact that different groups necessarily have different and often conflicting interests.</p><p>There are alternative conceptions of sovereignty that aim to bring back control and autonomy to people. These conceptions provide a framework within which there is a possibility to articulate questions about the agency of the individual, and of collective interest. Without this, our experience of technologies is a choice between being tied to the exploitation by big tech companies, or being content with the tightening grip of the State over our data. The State does, however, have a role in enabling an exercise of individual or collective sovereignty through several concrete regulatory measures: through positive actions like instituting strong encryption policies and requiring the adoption of open source software in governance functions, as well as through abstaining from restricting data flows resulting in the restriction of choices.</p><p>So far, the government's conception of data sovereignty seems to mostly amount to an assertion of power over foreign companies and an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, vying to be leaders in artificial intelligence, while also strengthening control over the citizenry. However, it threatens the possibility of individuals' exercise of sovereignty, undermining the rights of the citizens, and is a lost chance to meaningfully grapple with data colonisation.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Lucknow.

Goyal was against using free trade agreements to justify the free flow of data. Instead, he said, government restrictions on data flows would allow India to be able to use \"personal, community and public data\" generated in the country towards the welfare and development of its people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Undeniably, data sovereignty is an attractive concept. Anyone familiar with the business models of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon would have an uneasy feeling about the extent of access these companies have to our behaviours and habits, and the magnitude of value they have amassed from the promise of this data. Their growing power creates not just concerns of privacy, but extends to encroaching public infrastructure functions like transport, health care and finance, often bulldozing local interests. Pit this against the challenges of unemployment, and the worldwide rush by regulators to make amends to the asymmetry of power between companies and people, and data sovereignty looks like a seductive proposition.</p><p>But how much do the people of the country really have to gain from the government's flavour of data sovereignty? At first blush, the concept has an anti-colonial ring. But a closer look reveals that the government's approach to data sovereignty simply replaces foreign companies reaping benefits from technological solutionism with Indian companies, while leaving the dangers created by data extractivism for Indian people intact.</p><p>Indeed, if resisting data colonisation was really the issue, a broader and more thoughtful frame would need to be adopted - one that acknowledges the colonisation inherent in the intensified datafication of people and things, in the seamless facilitation of these data flows to private interests and the State, as well as in the unquestioned adoption of the Silicon Valley narrative that data is an objective truth-teller. As long as these conditions remain unchanged, treating data as a sovereign asset takes away from individual rights over data, and trades them away for a higher GDP figure and greater State control. What follows are examples to illustrate the unhelpful frame of State sovereignty over data. Two notable instruments that animate the State's vision for data sovereignty are the draft e-commerce policy and the Personal Data Protection bill.</p><p>The data protection bill proposes a horizontal data localisation requirement, meaning that anyone systematically dealing with the personal data of Indians would have to store a copy of that data within the country. Such a measure would heighten and consolidate the access to data by the government for surveillance, while also reducing the range of options available for an individual to choose services on the Internet, creating a very real trade-off between state sovereignty over data and individual autonomy and choice.</p><p>While many parts of the e-commerce policy are worthy of attention, its creative categorisation of data is a cause for concern. The policy proposes a separate class of data called \"community data\". This is an important conceptual step that holds promise for thinking about a more collective approach to data ownership and management. Unfortunately, the policy uses community data as a means to automatically achieve data sovereignty vesting in the State. By conflating data belonging to the people of the country with data belonging to the country itself, the policy makes individual rights and collective interests subservient to an abstract national interest. It also ignores the fact that different groups necessarily have different and often conflicting interests.</p><p>There are alternative conceptions of sovereignty that aim to bring back control and autonomy to people. These conceptions provide a framework within which there is a possibility to articulate questions about the agency of the individual, and of collective interest. Without this, our experience of technologies is a choice between being tied to the exploitation by big tech companies, or being content with the tightening grip of the State over our data. The State does, however, have a role in enabling an exercise of individual or collective sovereignty through several concrete regulatory measures: through positive actions like instituting strong encryption policies and requiring the adoption of open source software in governance functions, as well as through abstaining from restricting data flows resulting in the restriction of choices.</p><p>So far, the government's conception of data sovereignty seems to mostly amount to an assertion of power over foreign companies and an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, vying to be leaders in artificial intelligence, while also strengthening control over the citizenry. However, it threatens the possibility of individuals' exercise of sovereignty, undermining the rights of the citizens, and is a lost chance to meaningfully grapple with data colonisation.</p><p>Nayantara Ranganathan is a programme manager at the Internet Democracy Project.

Continuing loose policy has brought forward debt financed private expenditure, thereby elongating an already protracted cycle in which extraordinary low or negative interest rates appear to be less and less effective in stimulating demand.</p><p>William White, who while head of the monetary and economics department at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel was one of the few economists to predict the financial crisis, says the subsequent great experiment in ultra-loose monetary policy is intensely morally hazardous. This, he argues, is because unconventional central bank policies may \"simply set the stage for the next boom and bust cycle, fuelled by ever declining credit standards and ever expanding debt accumulation\".</p><p>A comparison of today's circumstances with the period before the financial crisis is instructive. As well as a big post-crisis increase in government debt, an important difference now is that the debt focus in the private sector is not on property and mortgage lending, but on loans to the corporate sector.</p><p> A recent OECD report says that at the end of December 2019 the global outstanding stock of non-financial corporate bonds reached an all-time high of $13.5tn, double the level in real terms against December 2008.The rise is most striking in the US, where the Fed estimates that corporate debt has risen from $3.3tn before the financial crisis to $6.5tn last year.Given that Google parent Alphabet, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft alone held net cash at the end of last year of $328bn, this suggests that much of the debt is concentrated in old economy sectors where many companies are less cash generative than Big Tech.</p><p> Debt servicing is thus more burdensome.The shift to corporate indebtedness is in one sense less risky for the financial system than the earlier surge in subprime mortgage borrowing because banks, which by their nature are fragile because they borrow short and lend long, are not as heavily exposed to corporate debt as investors, such as insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds and exchange traded funds.</p><p>That said, banks cannot escape the consequences of a wider collapse in markets in the event of a continued loss of investor confidence and or a rise in interest rates from today's extraordinary low levels. Such an outcome would lead to increased defaults on banks' loans together with shrinkage in the value of collateral in the banking system.</p><p> And asset prices could be vulnerable even after the coronavirus scare because the central banks' asset purchases drove investors to search for yield regardless of the dangers. As a result, risk is still systematically mispriced around the financial system.</p><p>The OECD report notes that compared with previous credit cycles today's stock of corporate bonds has lower overall credit quality, longer maturities, inferior covenant protection  bondholder rights such as restrictions on future borrowing or dividend payments  and higher payback requirements. Longer maturities are associated with higher price sensitivity to changes in interest rates, so together with declining credit quality that makes bond markets more sensitive to changes in monetary policy.</p><p> Current market volatility is further exacerbated by banks' withdrawal from market-making activities in response to tougher capital adequacy requirements since the crisis.In a downturn, some of the disproportionately large recent issuance of BBB bonds  the lowest investment grade category  could end up being downgraded.</p><p> That would lead to big increases in borrowing costs because many investors are constrained by regulation or self-imposed restrictions from investing in non-investment grade bonds.The deterioration in bond quality is particularly striking in the $1.3tn global market for leveraged loans, which are loans arranged by syndicates of banks to companies that are heavily indebted or have weak credit ratings.</p><p> Such loans are called leveraged because the ratio of the borrower's debt to assets or earnings is well above industry norms. New issuance in this sector hit a record $788bn in 2017, higher than the peak of $762bn before the crisis.</p><p> The US accounted for $564bn of that total.Much of this debt has financed mergers and acquisitions and stock buybacks.</p><p> Executives have a powerful incentive to engage in buybacks despite very full valuations in the equity market because they boost earnings per share by shrinking the company's equity capital and thus inflate performance related pay. Yet this financial engineering is a recipe for systematically weakening corporate balance sheets.</p><p>Otmar Issing, former chief economist of the European Central Bank, says prolonged low central bank interest rates also have wider consequences because they lead to a serious misallocation of capital. This helps keep unproductive \"zombie\" banks and companies  those that cannot meet interest payments from earnings  alive.</p><p> The IMF's latest global financial stability report amplifies this point with a simulation showing that a recession half as severe as 2009 would result in companies with $19tn of outstanding debt having insufficient profits to service that debt.Overall, this huge accumulation of corporate debt of increasingly poor quality is likely to exacerbate the next recession.</p><p> The central banks' ultra-loose monetary policy has also fostered what economists call disaster myopia  complacency, in a word, which is a prerequisite of financial crises. The greatest complacency today is over inflation and the possibility that central banks will inflict a financial shock by raising interest rates sooner than most expect.</p><p>This myopia is understandable and not just because of the coronavirus. Since the financial crisis the debt laden advanced economies have suffered from deficient demand.</p><p> Hence the central banks' recent difficulties in meeting inflation targets. At the same time tightening labour markets have not led to increased wage inflation, leading many economists to assume the traditional relationship between falling unemployment and rising price inflation has broken down.</p><p>Clearly there is still a deflationary impulse at work in the global economy, causing growth to be both anaemic and debt dependent. Yet inflation may not be quiescent for as long as markets assume.</p><p> One reason is that with the central banks' unconventional measures becoming less effective, there is a pressing question about how to respond to stagnation when interest rates are close to zero, together with a growing consensus, helped by coronavirus, that a more activist fiscal policy may be necessary.With the rise of populism there are growing calls for monetary finance of increased fiscal deficits  that is, direct financing of government deficits by central banks of the kind currently happening in Japan.</p><p> Monetary finance has been a precursor of high inflation and while its proponents argue that the risks can be contained provided the quantity of such finance is controlled by independent central banks, central bank independence has been increasingly under threat since the crisis.Demography is also relevant.</p><p> Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics and Philipp Erfurth of Morgan Stanley have argued that low and negative interest rates are not the new normal because the world is on the cusp of a dramatic demographic shift. A decline in the working population relative to the retired population potentially returns bargaining power to labour.</p><p> Combined with a decline in household savings because elderly populations have become less thrifty, they say, this makes it almost inevitable that real interest rates will reverse trend and go back up.Nor, in the shorter term, is it clear that the relationship between unemployment and wage inflation has really broken.</p><p> Chris Watling, founder of Longview Economics, says the sogginess of wage data in the US is substantially to do with the oil-producing states, which suffered a marked slowdown last year as a result of the fall in crude prices in late 2018. Non-oil wage inflation has remained in a relatively robust uptrend as unemployment rates have fallen.A pressing question, in the light of the debt build-up, is whether the regulatory response to the great financial crisis has been sufficient to rule out another systemic crisis and whether the increase in banks' capital will provide an adequate buffer against the losses that will result from widespread mispricing of risk.</p><p>History matters here. The one period in the last 200 years when banking was relatively free of crises was between the 1930s and early 1970s.</p><p> This was because the regulatory response to the 1929 crash and the subsequent banking failures was so draconian that banking was turned into a low-risk, utility-like business. It was the progressive removal of this regulatory straitjacket, which began in the 1970s, that paved the way for the property based crises of the mid-1970s, the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, more property based crises of the early 1990s and the rest.</p><p>While there has been a plethora of reforms since 2008  though conspicuously not including the removal of the privileged tax status of debt relative to equity  the operations of the likes of Goldman Sachs, Barclays or Deutsche Bank could scarcely be called utility-like. And when very rapid changes in financial structure are taking place, as today, regulators are often left behind by the new reality and wrong footed by regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>It is impossible to predict the trigger or timing of a financial crisis. And it seems unlikely that a full-blown crisis is imminent, notwithstanding coronavirus.</p><p> But the potentially unsustainable accumulation of public sector debt and of debt in the non-financial corporate sector highlights serious vulnerabilities, notably in China and other emerging markets, but also in the US and UK. And the continental European banking system is conspicuously weaker than that of the US.</p><p>Against such a background, the conclusion has to be that of the late Herb Stein, the American economist who remarked that if something can't go on for ever, then it will stop. When coronavirus is long gone, that will be when systemic trouble starts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSDAY-BUSSDAY05032020003246</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSDAY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC0-3F51-JCH9-G52M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2134\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Day All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Day</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC6099 FUNCTIONS RELATED TO DEPOSITORY BANKING, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000165</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

A recent OECD report says that at the end of December 2019 the global outstanding stock of non-financial corporate bonds reached an all-time high of $13.5tn, double the level in real terms against December 2008.\u00a0</p><p>The rise is most striking in the US, where the Fed estimates that corporate debt has risen from $3.3tn before the financial crisis to $6.5tn last year.\u00a0</p><p>Given that Google parent\u00a0Alphabet,\u00a0Apple,\u00a0Facebook and\u00a0Microsoft alone held net cash at the end of last year of $328bn, this suggests that much of the debt is concentrated in old economy sectors where many companies are less cash generative than Big Tech. Debt servicing is thus more burdensome.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The shift to corporate</emphasis> indebtedness is in one sense less risky for the financial system than the earlier surge in subprime mortgage borrowing because banks, which by their nature are fragile because they borrow short and lend long, are not as heavily exposed to corporate debt as investors, such as insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds and exchange traded funds.\u00a0</p><p>That said, banks cannot escape the consequences of a wider collapse in markets in the event of a continued loss of investor confidence and or a rise in interest rates from today\u2019s extraordinary low levels. Such an outcome would lead to increased defaults on banks\u2019 loans together with shrinkage in the value of collateral in the banking system. And asset prices could be vulnerable even after the coronavirus scare because the central banks\u2019 asset purchases drove investors to search for yield regardless of the dangers. As a result, risk is still systematically mispriced around the financial system.\u00a0</p><p>The OECD report notes that compared with previous credit cycles today\u2019s stock of corporate bonds has lower overall credit quality, longer maturities, inferior covenant protection \u2014 bondholder rights such as restrictions on future borrowing or dividend payments \u2014 and higher payback requirements. Longer maturities are associated with higher price sensitivity to changes in interest rates, so together with declining credit quality that makes bond markets more sensitive to changes in monetary policy. Current market volatility is further exacerbated by banks\u2019 withdrawal from market-making activities in response to tougher capital adequacy requirements since the crisis.\u00a0</p><p>In a downturn, some of the disproportionately large recent issuance of BBB bonds \u2014 the lowest investment grade category \u2014 could end up being downgraded. That would lead to big increases in borrowing costs because many investors are constrained by regulation or self-imposed restrictions from investing in non-investment grade bonds.\u00a0</p><p>The deterioration in bond quality is particularly striking in the $1.3tn global market for leveraged loans, which are loans arranged by syndicates of banks to companies that are heavily indebted or have weak credit ratings. Such loans are called leveraged because the ratio of the borrower\u2019s debt to assets or earnings is well above industry norms. New issuance in this sector hit a record $788bn in 2017, higher than the peak of $762bn before the crisis. The US accounted for $564bn of that total.\u00a0</p><p>Much of this debt has financed mergers and acquisitions and stock buybacks. Executives have a powerful incentive to engage in buybacks despite very full valuations in the equity market because they boost earnings per share by shrinking the company\u2019s equity capital and thus inflate performance related pay. Yet this financial engineering is a recipe for systematically weakening corporate balance sheets.\u00a0</p><p>Otmar Issing, former chief economist of the European Central Bank, says prolonged low central bank interest rates also have wider consequences because they lead to a serious misallocation of capital.\u00a0This helps keep unproductive \u201czombie\u201d banks and companies \u2014 those that cannot meet interest payments from earnings \u2014 alive. The IMF\u2019s latest global financial stability report\u00a0amplifies this point with a simulation showing that a recession half as severe as 2009 would result in companies with $19tn of outstanding debt having insufficient profits to service that debt.\u00a0</p><p>Overall, this huge accumulation of corporate debt of increasingly poor quality is likely to exacerbate the next recession. The central banks\u2019 ultra-loose monetary policy has also fostered what economists call disaster myopia \u2014 complacency, in a word, which is a prerequisite of financial crises. The greatest\u00a0 complacency today is over inflation and the possibility that central banks will inflict a financial shock by raising interest rates sooner than most expect.</p><p>This myopia is understandable and not just because of the coronavirus. Since the financial crisis the debt laden advanced economies have suffered from deficient demand. Hence the central banks\u2019 recent difficulties in meeting inflation targets. At the same time tightening labour markets have not led to increased wage inflation, leading many economists to assume the traditional relationship between falling unemployment and rising price inflation has broken down.\u00a0</p><p>Clearly there is still a deflationary impulse at work in the global economy, causing growth to be both anaemic and debt dependent. Yet inflation may not be quiescent for as long as markets assume. One reason is that with the central banks\u2019 unconventional measures becoming less effective, there is a pressing question about how to respond to stagnation when interest rates are close to zero, together with a growing consensus, helped by coronavirus, that a more activist fiscal policy may be necessary.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">With the rise of</emphasis> populism there are\u00a0growing calls for monetary finance of increased fiscal deficits \u2014 that is, direct financing of government deficits by central banks of the kind currently happening in Japan. Monetary finance has been a precursor of high inflation and while its proponents argue that the risks can be contained provided the quantity of such finance is controlled by independent central banks, central bank independence has been increasingly under threat since the crisis.\u00a0</p><p>Demography is also relevant. Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics and Philipp Erfurth of Morgan Stanley have argued that low and negative interest rates are not the new normal because the world is on the cusp of a dramatic demographic shift. A decline in the working population relative to the retired population potentially returns bargaining power to labour. Combined with a decline in household savings because elderly populations have become less thrifty, they say, this makes it almost inevitable that real interest rates will reverse trend and go back up.\u00a0</p><p>Nor, in the shorter term, is it clear that the relationship between unemployment and wage inflation has really broken. Chris Watling, founder of Longview Economics, says the sogginess of wage data in the US is substantially to do with the oil-producing states, which suffered a marked slowdown last year as a result of the fall in crude prices in late 2018. Non-oil wage inflation has remained in a relatively robust uptrend as unemployment rates have fallen.</p><p>A pressing question, in the light of the debt build-up, is whether the regulatory response to the great financial crisis has been sufficient to rule out another systemic crisis and whether the increase in banks\u2019 capital will provide an adequate buffer against the losses that will result from\u00a0widespread mispricing of risk.\u00a0</p><p>History matters here. The one period in the last 200 years when banking was relatively free of crises was between the 1930s and early 1970s. This was because the regulatory response to the 1929 crash and the subsequent banking failures was so draconian that banking was turned into a low-risk, utility-like business. It was the progressive removal of this regulatory straitjacket, which began in the 1970s, that paved the way for the property based crises of the mid-1970s, the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, more property based crises of the early 1990s and the rest.</p><p>While there has been a plethora of reforms since 2008 \u2014 though conspicuously not including the removal of the privileged tax status of debt relative to equity \u2014 the operations of the likes of\u00a0 Goldman Sachs, Barclays or Deutsche Bank could scarcely be called utility-like. And when very rapid changes in financial structure are taking place, as today, regulators are often left behind by the new reality and wrong footed by regulatory arbitrage.\u00a0</p><p>It is impossible to predict the trigger or timing of a financial crisis. And it seems unlikely that a full-blown crisis is imminent, notwithstanding coronavirus. But the potentially unsustainable accumulation of public sector debt and of debt in the non-financial corporate sector highlights serious vulnerabilities, notably in\u00a0 China and other emerging markets, but also in the US and UK. And the continental European banking system is conspicuously weaker than that of the US.\u00a0</p><p>Against such a background, the conclusion has to be that of the late Herb Stein, the American economist who\u00a0remarked that if something can\u2019t go on for ever, then it will stop. When coronavirus is long gone, that will be when systemic trouble starts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A previous version of the chart on America\u2019s corporate debt was corrected on March 4.

Assuming the transaction dilutes the holdings of current shareholders, the founders each own stakes of 3.6 per cent, or $1.36bn apiece, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Mr Bowen, 43, and Mr Monsees, 38, each controlled 5.6 per cent of Juul after a July funding round that valued each of their holdings at $843m.</p><p>The deal makes San Francisco-based Juul more valuable than Airbnb and Elon Musk's SpaceX.</p><p>\"This is a disruptive technology and it shows where consumers want to go,\" says Ken Shea, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. \"It's growing so fast that the cigarette companies like Altria need to look at a way to mitigate not only cigarette use but also think for the future.\"</p><p>Mr Shea said he won't be surprised if Altria eventually tries to take a majority stake in Juul.</p><p>Mr Bowen and Mr Monsees came up with their big idea while pursuing master's degrees at Stanford University and founded Ploom in 2007. They sold the name to Japan Tobacco eight years later and renamed their company Pax Labs. Around the same time, the pair introduced a USB-shaped e-cigarette and called it the Juul. Last year, Juul was spun out from Pax and has gone on to dominate the market.</p><p>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, is among those backing Alphabet's new energy-storage project.

Michael Bloomberg, majority owner of Bloomberg, is also a Breakthrough investor and Mr Gates is chairman.</p><p>Other Malta backers include Hong Kong-based Concord New Energy Group, a wind and solar power developer, and Alfa Laval, a Swedish industrial company, X said earlier this month.</p><p>The money will help Malta further develop a system that uses large vats of molten salt and cooler liquid to store electricity generated from variable sources such as solar and wind. The startup likely will need additional funds to build a full facility, according to chief executive Ramya Swaminathan.</p><p>\"The challenge we have set for ourselves is to enter the age of storage with the next generation of technology,\" says Ms Swaminathan, who used to run Rye Development, a Boston-based developer of renewable energy projects.</p><p>Storing electricity produced by intermittent sources is becoming a critical tool to reduce carbon emissions and combat global warming. California wants all its electricity to come from carbon-free sources by 2045. The state sees as much as 30 per cent of its solar energy wasted during certain times of day, and a lack of storage options is a big part of that.</p><p>Malta's system can be located almost anywhere, including near solar panel arrays and wind turbines, and it has the potential to last longer than lithium-ion batteries, Mr Swaminathan said. The company would consider China among the possible places where it would locate a pilot project, she added.</p><p>Solar developers have tried using molten salt in other ways to store excess electricity, but full-scale applications remain limited. SaltX Technology Holding has developed a salt-based heating and cooling system.</p><p>Alphabet's X was once home to all of Google's free-wheeling experiments, incubating sci-fi projects like self-driving cars, delivery drones and the Google Glass wearable computer. Since 2015, when Alphabet was formed, the lab has trimmed project budgets and dialed back some of its ambitions.</p><p>Now X designs projects with two primary goals: to become a standalone Alphabet division or spin out into an independent company. Other options include shutting down or becoming part of Google. Alphabet once had far bigger plans around energy, but has trimmed those in favour of smaller efforts like Malta inside X. A geothermal project called Dandelion became a standalone startup in 2017.</p><p>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Funds managed by Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim's Inbursa posted an average return of 4.7 per cent this year. Photo: AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p>Carlos Slim</p><p>As Mexican stocks put in their worst performance for a decade, the cautious investment strategy of a pension fund controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim's bank is paying off.</p><p>Funds managed by Inbursa posted an average return of 4.7 per cent this year, compared with 0.4 per cent for the $164bn pension fund industry as a whole, according to data from Bloomberg and the regulator Consar. Each of Inbursa's funds have returned at least 3.8 per cent year-to-December 22.</p><p>Rising Fed rates, the US-China trade war and the arrival of left-wing populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to the presidency have pushed Mexican assets down. Mexican stocks have fallen 15.5 per cent this year, the worst performance since the economic crisis of 2008. In November, the fourth month of declines in Mexican stocks, Inbursa was the only pension fund to post positive returns.</p><p>\"This is not the result of circumstances, this is about our long term strategy,\" Marco Antonio Slim, the chairman of Grupo Financiero Inbursa and the son of Carlos Slim said. \"When you consider the low risk of our investments, Inbursa has been outperforming rival pension funds for four years.\"</p><p>Inbursa has historically been the safest bet among Mexico's pension funds, according to value-at-risk figures - a popular measure of fund exposure to riskier assets - posted by Consar. It is the second smallest of Mexico's pension funds after Azteca, with 162bn Mexican pesos (Dh1.48bn) in assets.</p><p>\"Nothing really matters until the retirement of a worker comes due, and we believe we offer the best risk-reward mix,\" Mr Slim said.</p><p>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook's founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's latest project is a digital token that will let users transfer money on WhatsApp. Photo: Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg</p><p>The idea that a company as powerful and autocratic as Facebook would ever dive into cryptocurrencies has always seemed unlikely.</p><p>Whether it's the Bitcoin model itself (Wild West capitalism where nobody's in charge) or the more corporate-friendly efforts to exploit the blockchain approach (distributed databases across networks within a business or industry) it's been hard to see how a billionaire like Mark Zuckerberg might find a use for it. His entire business depends on centrally harvesting data to sell advertisements at a profit.</p><p>So it's no surprise that Facebook's latest step toward a blockchain product, looks like more of a simple co-opting of the technology for a pretty humdrum payment system rather than any headlong rush to join the crypto-revolution.</p><p>The company's digital token, still in its infancy, would let users transfer money on WhatsApp, focusing first on the remittances market in India. It would be a so-called \"stablecoin,\" which are usually pegged to a currency like the dollar to minimise volatility. There would be a pool of assets stored in custody to protect it.</p><p>One can already hear the howls of anguish from the crypto-evangelists. This is not a token designed to displace fiat currencies or soar in price. In theory, one FaceCoin would never be more valuable than the $1 backing it (although in practice, markets can do funny things). It's essentially an online IOU.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg is hardly inventing the wheel here given that migrant workers already sent home $69bn to India last year, and India isn't a ripe crypto-market anyway after its central bank virtually outlawed digital currencies this year. Facebook would be competing instead with services like PayPal's Xoom, or WorldRemit, or even Western Union. Society might become more cashless as a result, but it's not going to be any more crypto.</p><p>The prophets of blockchain had once imagined that they could create a way for individuals to control and sell their own personal data rather than letting Big Tech profit from doing it. But Facebook's project looks like the reverse: Locking users more securely within its walled garden by offering them an in-house currency. Mr Zuckerberg and his lieutenants have long been resistant to giving up control of the data; naturally so, given how lucrative it is.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/17/154616452728.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/17/154616452728.jpg</url></p><p>Co-founders of US start-up Juul, Adam Bowen (left) and James Monsees.

Compensation for their financial and operational oversight usually ranges from tens of thousands of dollars to several hundred thousand dollars annually.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In this highly regulated environment, having that government experience is very important,\" said Jana Rich, founder and CEO of Rich Talent Group. Rich has been doing executive search work for the past 23 years, for the past five years at her own firm, which focuses on high-growth consumer tech companies.</p><p>Some former public officials, like former Vice President Al Gore, who has sat on Apple's board since 2003, have long been a presence on big tech's boards of directors. Reed Hundt, who served as chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission under President Bill Clinton, joined Intel's board back in 2001.</p><p>New faces have also appeared in the Bay Area's corporate board rooms following the Obama Administration's exit. Last year, former Obama adviser and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice was named to Netflix's board; in 2017, Valerie Jarrett, another senior adviser to Obama, joined Lyft's board.</p><p>\"For a lot of companies out here, they aren't aware of the general landscape when it's not the inside baseball of Silicon Valley,\" Rich said. \"Someone coming out of D.C. knows innately how to operate in that environment and can advise overarching strategy.\"</p><p>Salesforce has three board members with ties to government agencies: Colin Powell, secretary of state under President George W. Bush; a former ambassador to Japan, John Roos; and Neelie Kroes, a past vice president of the European Commission. Each is raking in over $500,000 for the 2019 fiscal year.</p><p>Hana Callaghan, director of government ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, said that restrictions on who can sit on corporate boards vary based on which government agency the director is coming from.</p><p>\"There are cooling off periods in terms of what former public officials can engage in,\" she said.</p><p>Current members of the House of Representatives, for instance, can serve on corporate boards as long as they're not compensated. Senators, however, cannot; nor can members of the executive branch. The <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.oge.gov/web/OGE.nsf/Post-Government%20Employment/5C506BC66E5C5C8F85257E96006364F0?opendocument\">U.S. Office of Government Ethics states</url> that after leaving the government, former political appointees are prohibited from engaging in lobbying activities with their past agency for five years, and for executive branch appointees, the remainder of the administration.</p><p>Separately, the Bay Area's tech giants are throwing money toward Washington at unprecedented rates. In 2010, Google spent just over $5.1 million on its federal lobbying efforts; Facebook paid $351,390, according to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=B13&amp;year=2018\">Open Secrets</url>. Last year, those amounts jumped to $21.7 million and $12.6 million, respectively - as internet companies' lobbying dollars hit an all-time high of $76.2 million.</p><p>\"Historically, companies in Silicon Valley prided themselves in being removed from Washington,\" said Keith Winstein, an assistant professor of computer science at Stanford. \"These companies have become bigger and bigger and intertwined with affairs of state, so they have to lobby like everyone else.\"</p><p>That said, companies are often nervous not to align themselves with a political party when bringing on high-level officials from either Democratic or Republican administrations to their boards, according to Rich. \"It's not always a slam dunk,\" she added.</p><p>Nor are the corporate board appointments always well received. When former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was appointed to Dropbox's board in 2014, protesters created a website called \"<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.drop-dropbox.com/\">Drop Dropbox</url>,\" which called the move \"problematic on a number of deeper levels\" and said that it invited \"serious concerns about Drew Houston and the senior leadership at Dropbox's commitment to freedom, openness, and ethics.\"</p><p>Still, Rich expects the number of former public servants on tech companies' boards only to grow.</p><p>\"There's been slightly more recently, but you'd think we'd have seen even more,\" she said, pointing to companies like Airbnb, which has confronted a bounty of regulatory blows, yet doesn't have any government expertise on its board of directors.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Nobody listened</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON \u2014 The seven young men sitting before some of Capitol Hill's most powerful lawmakers weren't graduate students or junior analysts from some think tank. No, Space Rogue, Kingpin, Mudge and the others were hackers who had come from the mysterious environs of cyberspace to deliver a terrifying warning to the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your computers, they told the panel of senators in May 1998, are not safe \u2014 not the software, not the hardware, not the networks that link them together. The companies that build these things don't care, the hackers continued, and they have no reason to care because failure costs them nothing. And the federal government has neither the skill nor the will to do anything about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you're looking for computer security, then the Internet is not the place to be,\" said Mudge, then 27 and looking like a biblical prophet with long brown hair flowing past his shoulders. The Internet itself, he added, could be taken down \"by any of the seven individuals seated before you\" with 30 minutes of well-choreographed keystrokes.</p><p>The senators \u2014 a bipartisan group including John Glenn, <person><nameText>Joe Lieberman </nameText></person>and Fred Thompson \u2014 nodded gravely, making clear that they understood the gravity of the situation. \"We're going to have to do something about it,\" Thompson said.</p><p>What happened instead was a tragedy of missed opportunity, and 17 years later the world is still paying the price in rampant insecurity.</p><p>The testimony from L0pht, as the hacker group called itself, was among the most audacious of a rising chorus of warnings delivered in the 1990s as the Internet was exploding in popularity, well on its way to becoming a potent global force for communication, commerce and criminality.</p><p>Hackers and other computer experts sounded alarms as the World Wide Web brought the transformative power of computer networking to the masses. This created a universe of risks for users and the critical real-world systems, such as power plants, rapidly going online as well.</p><p>Officials in Washington and throughout the world failed to forcefully address these problems as trouble spread across cyberspace, a vast new frontier of opportunity and lawlessness. Even today, many serious online intrusions exploit flaws in software first built in that era, such as Adobe Flash, Oracle's Java and Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p><p>\"We have the same security problems,\" said Space Rogue, whose real name is Cris Thomas. \"There's a lot more money involved. There's a lot more awareness. But the same problems are still there.\"</p><p>L0pht, born of the bustling hacker scene in the Boston area, rose to prominence as a flood of new software was introducing such wonders as sound, animation and interactive games to the Web. This software, which required access to the core functions of each user's computer, also gave hackers new opportunities to manipulate machines from afar.</p><p>Breaking into networked computers became so easy that the Internet, long the realm of idealistic scientists and hobbyists, gradually grew infested with the most pragmatic of professionals: crooks, scam artists, spies and cyberwarriors. They exploited computer bugs for profit or other gain while continually looking for new vulnerabilities.</p><p>Tech companies sometimes scrambled to fix problems \u2014 often after hackers or academic researchers revealed them publicly \u2014 but few companies were willing to undertake the costly overhauls necessary to make their systems significantly more secure against future attacks. Their profits depended on other factors, such as providing consumers new features, not warding off hackers.</p><p>\"In the real world, people only invest money to solve real problems, as opposed to hypothetical ones,\" said Dan Wallach, a Rice University computer science professor who has been studying online threats since the 1990s. \"The thing that you're selling is not security. The thing that you're selling is something else.\"</p><p>The result was a culture within the tech industry often derided as \"patch and pray.\" In other words, keep building, keep selling and send out fixes as necessary. If a system failed \u2014 causing lost data, stolen credit card numbers or time-consuming computer crashes \u2014 the burden fell not on giant, rich tech companies but on their customers.</p><p>The members of L0pht say they often experienced this cavalier attitude in their day jobs, where some toiled as humble programmers or salesmen at computer stores. When they reported bugs to software makers, company officials often asked: Does anybody else know about this?</p><p>The hackers met online, mostly on the bulletin boards that provided computer enthusiasts with freewheeling forums for trading tips, jokes and insights about how various systems worked \u2014 and in some cases could be made to do things their creators never intended. This is the essence of hacking. It is not inherently good or evil. It can be either, or in some cases a combination of both, depending on the motives of the hackers.</p><p>L0pht's members \u2014 the exact list shifted year to year but averaged seven or eight \u2014 shared a fascination with technology and a knack for testing its limits. They would decode the program running a piece of hardware or repeatedly flood a password field with too many characters, a hack known as a \"buffer overflow\" that often caused systems to fail, opening the door to further manipulation.</p><p>\"The difference between how it's supposed to work and how it really works is where the vulnerabilities happen,\" said Chris Wysopal, known as Weld Pond in his L0pht days.</p><p>The group's first clubhouse \u2014 and the inspiration for the name \u2014 was an actual loft above a carpentry shop in Boston's South End neighborhood, rented after the girlfriend of one of the hackers grew weary of all of the old computer gear littering their apartment (including several pieces resting semi-permanently in their bathroom).</p><p>Like the Internet itself, there seemed to be peril on the down-and-out streets all around L0pht's loft in this pre-gentrification era. But inside was geek heaven, with castoff computers, a television, a couch, cold beer, a 1980s-vintage \"Battlezone\" arcade game and a curious array of secondhand mannequins wearing unusual adornments, including a skirt, a gas mask and the charred remnants of police uniform that the hackers found. In a stroke of luck, the landlord paid the electrical bill each month, keeping an endless lifeline of electrons flowing to what amounted to a power-hungry computer lab.</p><p>\"It was totally scary to get there, but once you got there it was like, \u2018Ahhhhh,' \" recalled Joe Grand, a mischievous skateboarding enthusiast who was L0pht's youngest member. \"It really was a refuge in a lot of ways. It really shaped my life.\"</p><p>Much of the gear they used \u2014 and tried to bend to their wills \u2014 had been collected from dumpsters around the tech-heavy Boston area. L0pht's members refurbished some hardware to sell at flea markets to help pay the bills, but they kept the most useful pieces, including a giant VAX computer \u2014 a hunk of 1970s-vintage technology featuring two units, each the size of a washing machine \u2014 that they somehow hauled up steep stairs and into the loft.</p><p>They came to particularly disdain what they considered security-by-checklist, when companies declared a product safe merely because they had implemented a specified number of standard features, such as passwords and basic cryptography. \"We'd say, \u2018Give us one. We're going to try to break into it,' \" recalled Wysopal.</p><p>They almost always did, usually after toiling late into the night in a frenzy of discovery, flooding systems with inputs that programmers had not anticipated or in any way prepared for. Paul Nash, whose hacker name was Silicosis, once discovered that he could knock computers using Microsoft's Windows operating systems offline by sending a single command \u2014 a trick he happily showed off to visitors.</p><p>When members of L0pht weren't trying to find their own bugs, they were supporting others in doing so, including through regular gatherings at a Boston bar in which anyone who revealed a new computer vulnerability got a free beer. L0pht also spread the word about security discoveries though the Hacker News Network, a popular online newsletter run by Space Rogue, a born tinkerer who had rigged up makeshift flashlights so he could read in bed at night as a kid. (He still routinely uses his hacker name today).</p><p>Hacker News Network grew popular enough that it drew interest from advertisers. The group didn't want to sully its main website, L0pht.com, but was happy to collect revenue from Hacker News Network. One of the earliest ads touted the availability, for a fee, of Russian brides.</p><p>L0pht partially embraced the bad-boy image of hackers, calling themselves \"gray hats,\" a middle ground between the avowedly virtuous \"white hat\" hackers and the openly outlaw \"black hats.\" The group took particular relish in trying to shame big companies, such as Microsoft, for selling products with security flaws to unsuspecting customers.</p><p>When L0pht discovered a way to crack the cryptography protecting user passwords for the Windows operating system, Mudge publicly chastised Microsoft for what he called \"kindergarten crypto\" and, along with Wysopal, created an easy-to-use software tool to help anyone defeat it. L0pht member Dildog developed a program with another hacker group, called Cult of the Dead Cow, to remotely control office networks running Microsoft software. The name, a spoof on the company's popular \"BackOffice Server 2000\" program, was \"Back Orifice 2000\"; the promotional materials featured an equally crude logo.</p><p>But the reality of L0pht was more conventional than the public image. Wysopal was a programmer for Lotus. Space Rogue and two others worked at CompUSA, a chain store. Several had jobs at BBN Technologies, a venerable tech company that years earlier helped build the most important forerunner to the Internet, a Pentagon-funded project called the ARPANET.</p><p>The men used their hacker names mainly because they feared getting fired if their employers learned of their nocturnal activities. (The other reason, nearly as important, was that they wanted to make it harder for companies facing embarrassing disclosures to sue them or call the cops \u2014 real threats, then and now, for anyone doing freelance security research.)</p><p>The day jobs also provided an insider view of the burgeoning tech industry, helping the hackers find bugs in widely used business or consumer products. Companies that seemed unresponsive to complaints through formal channels often found themselves in L0pht's cross hairs. The group maintained open lines to legions of other hackers \u2014 including those working inside big tech firms \u2014 and developed disdain for a business culture they say put profit above security.</p><p>\"It's get it up, get it running as fast as we can. Let's make some money,\" Nash said. \"There's this tremendous push to get code out the door, and we'll fix it later.\"</p><p>L0pht also came to doubt the eagerness of companies to fix flaws even after they had been discovered. In the early years of the group, reports to official company email addresses \u2014 purportedly established to solicit security concerns \u2014 often seemed to just disappear into a black hole. A particular offender, L0pht members said, was <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:secure@microsoft.com\">secure@microsoft.com</email></p><p>They eventually discovered a reliable way to get companies' attention: Security alerts posted on L0pht.com drew notice from the world's technology journalists and eventually the companies themselves.</p><p>The downside was that plenty of \"black hat\" hackers also monitored L0pht's alerts, giving them time to take advantage of bugs before companies could possibly fix them. There's no way to know how many intrusions this aided, but the members of L0pht were unapologetic.</p><p>\"We always thought that if we knew about it, other people probably know about it and are exploiting it,\" said Grand, formerly known as Kingpin.</p><p>The 1993 arrival of the first widely popular Web browser, Mosaic, made the Internet an unstoppable cultural and commercial force. Suddenly it wasn't an exotic, far-off wonderland for the technically adept. Anybody could \"surf the Web.\"</p><p>Over the next several years, sophisticated new programming languages such as Flash and Java dramatically expanded browsers' capabilities. Websites began streaming video. Classic games such as \"Frogger,\" \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Tetris\" could be played, free, on any computer that could get online.</p><p>For most users, these new features seemed almost magical. They appeared automatically, perhaps requiring just a click or two of a mouse. Soon, most computers in the world had Flash and similar programming languages on their hard drives.</p><p>Surging consumer interest was not lost on Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who penned a confidential memo to his top executives in May 1995 titled \"The Internet Tidal Wave.\" The 5,500-word document demanded in sweeping, urgent terms that the company compete forcefully in the explosive new online marketplace.</p><p>\"The next few years are going to be very exciting as we tackle these challenges and opportunities,\" Gates wrote. \"The Internet is a tidal wave. It changes the rules. It is an incredible opportunity as well as incredible challenge. I am looking forward to your input on how we can improve our strategy to continue our track record of incredible success.\"</p><p>Gates did warn about the importance of security in the memo, saying \"Our plans for security need to be strengthened.\" But he also said, \"I want every product plan to try and go overboard on Internet features.\"</p><p>This priority, many critics would later say, was the most important one to Microsoft, planting the seeds of what security experts called \"featuritis\" \u2014 a common malady in which new features are added more quickly than they can be made secure.</p><p>This rush to innovate, to make every Microsoft product essentially an Internet product, was felt deeply throughout the company, said Billy Brackenridge, a Microsoft program manager during the 1990s. The ability to deliver new features for the company's marquee operating systems and software determined who got stock options \u2014 a key motivator for a company whose stock split seven times that decade amid a total gain of more than 9,000 percent.</p><p>\"There may have been one or two guys who really cared [about security]. For the most part, it was, \u2018Get it out the door,' \" Brackenridge recalled. \"If we missed a date, that was real money ... If your feature didn't get in, you didn't get stock.\"</p><p>Microsoft's competitive juices fueled a furious push to develop a browser to challenge the primacy of Netscape Navigator, which was produced largely by the same team of programmers who had created Mosaic. By the mid-1990s, Navigator had more than 70 percent market share, Gates warned in his memo.</p><p>The Microsoft answer was to create Internet Explorer and to integrate the browser extensively with its dominant Windows operating system. This effort was central to the Justice Department's antitrust charges against Microsoft, which were settled in 2001.</p><p>But it had other effects more immediately noticeable to L0pht and other hackers.</p><p>As Microsoft worked to infuse Internet-related features into its products, the company created portals for hackers to discover and exploit. A particularly notorious one was a programming language called ActiveX, which like Flash and Java reached deeply into the brains of a user's computer.</p><p>\"Once you go to a website and download some code and it executes itself ... you have a whole new type of problem,\" said Giovanni Vigna, a computer scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara and co-founder of Lastline, a security company. \"Now I have running code on your machine, and I can do all sorts of interesting things.\"</p><p>At a hacker conference in August 1997, Mudge \u2014 whose real name is Peiter Zatko and who infused a zeal for showmanship into L0pht \u2014 visibly delighted in tweaking Microsoft as he described cracking the password security on Windows, at the time the standard operating system for business and government computers worldwide.</p><p>\"I don't want to be working on Microsoft products right now,\" Mudge declared. \"The problem is: They're everywhere! You cannot get away from them!\"</p><p>He singled out a particularly egregious security flaw \u2014 splitting a strong 14-character password field into two much weaker seven-character passwords for storage. The longer a password, the more combinations a hacker must try to break it. But Microsoft, Mudge reported, had undermined that principle by creating, in essence, two shorter and easily cracked passwords instead of one strong one.</p><p>Worse still, if the user had picked a password that was seven characters or fewer, the system stored a telltale string of characters to represent the unused portion of the password field. When hackers found this string, they knew that they already had the password halfway cracked. Mudge happily recited the odd combination of letters and numbers at the conference, with dozens of hackers looking on.</p><p>\"I'm going to get that tattooed across my forehead and walk through the halls of Microsoft!\" he said to laughter from the crowd.</p><p>He also announced that L0pht had discovered that a single password \u2014 \"CHANGEME\" \u2014 was being used by 700 users of one network the group studied.</p><p>Such antics drew fans within the hacker world, a hint of wider celebrity and the first whiff of money. L0pht sold T-shirts bearing its logo at conferences and also began selling its tool for cracking Windows passwords \u2014 called L0pht Crack \u2014 for $50 to system administrators eager to test the strength of passwords on the networks they managed.</p><p>When the members of L0pht realized how much security consultants were charging for such services, they raised the price to $150, then $500. (One of the buyers was the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency that chronicled failings of federal IT systems.)</p><p>For all L0pht's drive to break systems online, members had long run their club with a certain formality. They had regular meetings, set collective priorities and handled financial matters carefully. Each hacker had his own desk and paid $100 a month toward rent; those who couldn't afford that would share desks and pay half as much.</p><p>But the money rushing into computer security got their attention. They got a first taste of it when the online ads along with sales of T-shirts and L0pht Crack meant that members no longer had to reach as deeply into their own pockets for rent or other costs. They also noticed how a rising generation of security consultants \u2014 including some doing \"stress testing\" using tactics much like L0pht's \u2014 were getting big paydays.</p><p>By the time L0pht appeared before the Senate in 1998, the idea of starting a real company \u2014 and earning enough profit to quit their day jobs \u2014 was starting to form within the group.</p><p>\"You know,\" Space Rogue remembered thinking, \"maybe we should get a piece of that.\"</p><p>This was the beginning of the end for L0pht.</p><p>They had an uproariously fun trip to Washington for the Senate testimony, renting a dark green, 15-passenger van and installing an array of antennas on the roof to see what signals they could pick up along the way.</p><p>This seemed like harmless hacker fun until they made a stop at the National Cryptologic Museum, on the grounds of the National Security Agency (NSA) in suburban Maryland. Zatko had visited the NSA several times before, he said, part of gradual move into federal government work. \"I wanted them to have sensitivities, to know that hackers aren't the bad guys,\" he explained later.</p><p>But on this trip, Zatko accidentally directed the L0pht van, its roof bristling with interception equipment, to the entrance of a secure area of the NSA campus. Driving the van was L0pht member Stefan von Neumann, who appeared confused when he pulled up to a checkpoint manned by an armed military guard. When the guard saluted von Neumann, whose real name is Stefan Wuensch, he asked his fellow hackers, \"What should I do?\"</p><p>In unison, they shouted, \"Salute back!\"</p><p>But once on the grounds of the famously secret spy agency, the members of L0pht quickly grew uneasy and urged von Neumann to exit the grounds as quickly as possible. He soon did, getting the van to the museum, then onward to Washington without further incident.</p><p>The hackers testified the following day before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, whose staffers told L0pht that only members of federal witness protection programs had previously been allowed to testify using aliases. The hackers then took a tour of the White House, guided by National Security Council counterterrorism official Richard Clarke.</p><p>A cover story in Internet Week magazine, featuring Wysopal and Zatko (a k a Weld Pond and Mudge), finally blew their cover at work, but they weren't fired as they had feared. The New York Times Magazine also featured L0pht in a story, as did PBS and MTV. The hackers' boasts about being able to take down the Internet in 30 minutes \u2014 by exploiting flaws in a key Internet routing protocol called BGP \u2014 prompted mentions from Conan O'Brien and Rush Limbaugh, who called them \"longhair nerd computer hackers.\"</p><p>Even the makers of Trivial Pursuit took notice. Question: What did a group of geeks called L0pht tell the U.S. Senate they could cripple in 30 minutes?</p><p>Answer: The Internet</p><p>By the time that edition of the game hit the stores in 2000, L0pht was no longer L0pht. The hackers had joined @Stake, a security company built largely on L0pht's fame and $10 million in venture-capital funding. They quit their day jobs to finally pursue their nocturnal hobby full time.</p><p>But they also acquired an unwelcome new set of rules and responsibilities \u2014 especially to clients who were happy to pay for their expertise but didn't fancy getting publicly roasted whenever the hackers discovered problems.</p><p>\"The community we came from thought we were selling out to the Man, which of course we were,\" Wysopal recalled.</p><p>Among the biggest companies to hire @Stake \u2014 and demand nondisclosure agreements about what they found \u2014 was L0pht's longtime nemesis: Microsoft.</p><p>As business realities set in, Space Rogue was the first casualty. He had run the operations side of L0pht and Hacker News Network. But the venture capitalists had their own operational guys, and they weren't keen on publicly affiliating themselves with the word \"hacker.\"</p><p>So the online newsletter became a sanitized corporate website called \"Security News Network,\" and Space Rogue got a job in @Stake's marketing department \u2014 far from the center of gravity where Mudge, Kingpin, Weld Pond and the others worked. Space Rogue was fired soon after.</p><p>The company confiscated his laptop computer and unceremoniously escorted him out the door for reasons he says he still doesn't understand. By the time Space Rogue got home, his L0pht.com accounts had been shut down. He had no idea \u2014 and still doesn't \u2014 whether any of his fellow hackers spoke up for him or fought the firing.</p><p>\"That was a bad part of my life ... I lost six of my best friends,\" Space Rogue recalled. \"It was really devastating to me. It took me a long time to recover from that.\"</p><p>The dot-com bubble, which had pushed tech companies' valuations into the stratosphere, burst about the same time, sweeping away weak companies like Pets.com and squeezing revenue throughout the industry. The chief executive of @Stake, who was brought in to provide something like parental supervision to L0pht, ordered Wysopal to single out a member of the group for a layoff in order to balance out cuts elsewhere in the company.</p><p>Wysopal said he reluctantly dropped the ax on Brian Oblivion, one of L0pht's charter members, whose real name is Brian Hassick. The firing came the day before Hassick's son was to be baptized; he and Wysopal did not speak again for months.</p><p>As the bonds at the heart of L0pht deteriorated, Zatko mysteriously disappeared. Though not a founding member of the group, he had been its most public face during the rise to fame.</p><p>If L0pht was something akin to the Beatles of the hacker world \u2014 combining serious chops with an instinct for self-promotion \u2014 Zatko was the mercurial, boundary-busting John Lennon to Wysopal's even-keeled Paul McCartney.</p><p>But as @Stake struggled, Zatko developed severe anxiety, made worse by a bad reaction to medicine that was supposed to ease his symptoms, he said. Zatko ended up in a psychiatric ward for several days. None of the members of L0pht came to visit, a source of enduring frustration to him. (They say they didn't know what was happening, only that he was missing from work.)</p><p>\"The L0pht was my only family,\" Zatko recalled. \"It killed me ... It was absolutely atrocious.\"</p><p>Though Zatko gradually recovered, the decline of @Stake continued. Space Rogue threatened a lawsuit to reclaim lost wages and his remaining share of the initial venture-capital funding. (He eventually settled with enough to buy a car, cover his lawyer's fees and put a down payment on a condominium, he says.)</p><p>Perhaps an even lower point for @Stake came in September 2003, when the company fired its chief technology officer, the respected security guru Dan Geer, after he co-authored a study on how Microsoft's dominance of the software industry undermined security. Geer learned of his dismissal through a news release issued by @Stake, according to news reports at the time.</p><p>When Symantec, a larger security firm, bought the remains of @Stake in 2004, it was a mercy killing.</p><p>\"Everything we stood for had been nibbled away little by little by little until we were left with nothing,\" Grand said. \"We needed to be able to speak the truth about everybody. That didn't last very long ... Eventually we just got on our knees for everybody.\"</p><p>As L0pht was collapsing, security on the Internet took a turn for the worse. The waning days of the 20th century featured huge investments toward fixing the Y2K bug \u2014 based on the alarming possibility that programs designed to recognize years by only two digits, such as \"99,\" would suddenly crash when they saw \"00.\"</p><p>But the problems that would soon bedevil computing were not accidental, like the Y2K bug. The black hats were on the rise.</p><p>Among the first security disasters of the next decade, the ILOVEYOU worm, arrived in May 2000 and apparently was the work of a pair of computer programmers from the Philippines.</p><p>The virus exploited a feature in Microsoft Outlook to send malicious code to each new victim's contact lists.</p><p>Soon, an estimated 10 percent of the world's computers were infected, snarling networks for the Pentagon, the British Parliament and many private companies. Estimates of damage and cleanup costs topped $20 billion. Many other worms \u2014 with names such as Pikachu, Anna Kournikova and Nimda \u2014 also exploited flaws in Microsoft products.</p><p>On Dec. 8, 2000, one day after the anniversary of the surprise Japanese attack on U.S. Navy forces in 1941, Clarke \u2014 the National Security Council official who had once given L0pht a tour of the White House \u2014 appeared at a conference organized by Microsoft. He warned that if the government didn't improve computer security, the nation might suffer a \"digital Pearl Harbor.\"</p><p>\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p><p>L0pht's legacy is a mixed one. The group was among the pioneers of a system called \"responsible disclosure,\" still widely used today, in which researchers who find bugs give companies a set amount of time to make fixes before security flaws are announced to the world. Some companies now go a step further, offering cash rewards called \"bug bounties\" to encourage hackers to search for problems \u2014 and ideally find them ahead of criminals and spies.</p><p>Microsoft eventually became more serious about security. It didn't have much choice: Major customers told Gates to either do better or lose their business. In a memo in January 2002 \u2014 something of a book end to the one from 1995 \u2014 Gates declared that a new security initiative was \"the highest priority for all the work we are doing.\"</p><p>The move initially drew some skepticism. \"When I told friends I was going to Microsoft to do security ... most of them laughed at me because I used \u2018Microsoft' and \u2018security' in the same sentence,\" said Scott Charney, a former Justice Department official hired in 2002. He is now corporate vice president for Trustworthy Computing at Microsoft.</p><p>Microsoft pulled thousands of engineers off product development to overhaul the company's systems for designing and building software. Gates sent one group of officials to a retreat at a historic wooden home more commonly used for weddings, in nearby Bellevue, Washington, about a 15-minute drive from Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond. Charney said, \"Basically some people were sent there and told, don't come back until you have an answer.\"</p><p>But the Internet did not suddenly become secure. The company's newfound focus on security took years to bear fruit, most notably with the arrival of Windows Vista in 2006 and Office 2010 a few years later. Because of a need for \"backward compatibility\" \u2014 meaning older and newer versions of Microsoft products work easily together \u2014 old flaws lingered in the online world for many years after they were fixed in newly released software.</p><p>The federal government in the past year finally has replaced hundreds of thousands of computers running Windows XP \u2014 an operating system first released in 2001, months before Gates' call to arms on product security \u2014 after the company withdrew free support after nearly 13 years.</p><p>But as Microsoft's products became more secure, hackers began feasting on alternative targets that did not get similar overhauls.</p><p>\"Hackers are like water,\" said Vigna, the computer scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \"They always go for the path of least resistance ... If you put a plug in place, they will find another crack.\"</p><p>At the root is an issue raised by L0pht in its Senate testimony: The business incentives within the tech industry favor growth over security. And once companies get big enough that security is a major concern \u2014 as eventually happened to Microsoft \u2014 it's extremely difficult to retrofit rigorous protections into systems built without them.</p><p>Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who chaired the Senate panel in 1998 and left Congress in 2003, said in a recent interview that Internet security is the kind of problem the government has trouble fixing. \"Number one, it's very difficult, and number two, there's no immediate political payoff for anyone.\"</p><p>\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p><p>Some industry critics favor strict government standards and legal liability for failures, as long have existed for many critical offline systems such as cars, elevators and airplanes. Others would create an independent group, a tech industry equivalent to Underwriters Laboratories, which certifies the safety of electronic devices worldwide. Or perhaps insurance companies, which ultimately foot the bill for many cybersecurity incidents, may some day demand better safety practices from their clients, as insurers long have done for homes and cars.</p><p>But others have argued that demands for greater security could damp innovation and make tech products harder to use. Given the industry's increasingly central role in the national economy \u2014 and the massive expansion in tech lobbying power in Washington in recent years \u2014 tough new laws or regulations remain difficult to imagine.</p><p>\"The only way to get in front of the security problem is to build better software,\" said Gary McGraw, chief technology official for Cigital, a Virginia-based firm that has worked on software security since the 1990s. \"Until we start building security in, we'll always play catch-up.\"</p><p>L0pht itself has rebounded a bit, releasing an updated version of L0pht Crack in 2009. The main website is still running, if a bit dated looking. The Hacker News Network regained its name and its edge,</p><p>Wysopal and fellow L0pht hacker Dildog founded a security company, Veracode, in 2006. Zatko, after recovering from severe anxiety, rejoined BBN Technologies. He later spent three years directing cybersecurity research at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon agency that created the forerunner to the Internet decades ago, before becoming deputy director for a research team at Google.</p><p>Most of the others still work on computer security issues. They had a reunion of sorts in the summer of 2014 at Space Rogue's wedding in Philadelphia. The emotional wounds from the @Stake debacle have scarred over if not disappeared.</p><p>As for the security issues they once highlighted for the U.S. government and the world, the news is far worse. Hackers \u2014 the black-hat kind \u2014 have consistently outrun efforts to impose security.</p><p>Wysopal offered this grim precedent: Cities were once vulnerable to disastrous fires, which raged through dense clusters of mostly wooden buildings. It took a giant fire in Chicago to spur government officials into serious reforms, including limits on new wooden structures, a more robust water supply for suppressing blazes and an overhaul to the city's fire department.</p><p>\"The market didn't solve the problem of cities burning down,\" Wysopal said, predicting that Internet security may require a historic disaster to force change. \"It seems to me that the market isn't really going to solve this one on its own.\"</p><p>But here's a frightening fact: The push to create tough new fire-safety standards did not start after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, which killed hundreds of people and left 100,000 homeless. It took a second fire, nearly three years later in 1874, to get officials in Chicago to finally make real changes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>photo for the washington post by Leah Nash Joe Grand, who formerly used the hacker name Kingpin, at his home in Portland, Ore., with an RFID card reader he designed.

No, Space Rogue, Kingpin, Mudge and the others were hackers who had come from the mysterious environs of cyberspace to deliver a terrifying warning to the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your computers, they told the panel of senators in May\u00a01998, are not safe - not the software, not the hardware, not the networks that link them together. The companies that build these things don't care, the hackers continued, and they have no reason to care because failure costs them nothing. And the federal government has neither the skill nor the will to do anything about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you're looking for computer security, then the Internet is not the place to be,\" said Mudge, then 27 and looking like a biblical prophet with long brown hair flowing past his shoulders. The Internet itself, he added, could be taken down \"by any of the seven individuals seated before you\" with 30\u00a0minutes of well-choreographed keystrokes.</p><p>The senators - a bipartisan group including John Glenn, Joseph I. Lieberman and Fred D. Thompson - nodded gravely, making clear that they understood the gravity of the situation. \"We're going to have to do something about it,\" Thompson said.</p><p>What happened instead was a tragedy of missed opportunity, and 17\u00a0years later the world is still paying the price in rampant insecurity.</p><p>The testimony from L0pht, as the hacker group called itself, was among the most audacious of a rising chorus of warnings delivered in the 1990s as the Internet was exploding in popularity, well on its way to becoming a potent global force for communication, commerce and criminality.</p><p>Hackers and other computer experts sounded alarms as the World Wide Web brought the transformative power of computer networking to the masses. This created a universe of risks for users and the critical real-world systems, such as power plants, rapidly going online as well.</p><p>Officials in Washington and throughout the world failed to forcefully address these problems as trouble spread across cyberspace, a vast new frontier of opportunity and lawlessness. Even today, many serious online intrusions exploit flaws in software first built in that era, such as Adobe Flash, Oracle's Java and Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p><p>\"We have the same security problems,\" said Space Rogue, whose  real name is Cris Thomas. \"There's a lot more money involved. There's a lot more awareness. But the same problems are still there.\"</p><p>L0pht, born of the bustling hacker scene in the Boston area, rose to prominence as a flood of new software was introducing such wonders as sound, animation and interactive games to the Web. This software, which required access to the core functions of each user's computer, also gave hackers new opportunities to manipulate machines from afar.</p><p>Breaking into networked computers became so easy that the Internet, long the realm of idealistic scientists and hobbyists, gradually grew infested with the most pragmatic of professionals: crooks, scam artists, spies and cyberwarriors. They exploited computer bugs for profit or other gain while continually looking for new vulnerabilities.</p><p>Tech companies sometimes scrambled to fix problems - often after hackers or academic researchers revealed them publicly - but few companies were willing to undertake the costly overhauls necessary to make their systems significantly more secure against future attacks. Their profits depended on other factors, such as providing consumers new features, not warding off hackers.</p><p>\"In the real world, people only invest money to solve real problems, as opposed to hypothetical ones,\" said Dan S. Wallach, a Rice University computer science professor who has been studying online threats since the 1990s. \"The thing that you're selling is not security. The thing that you're selling is something else.\"</p><p>The result was a culture within the tech industry often derided as \"patch and pray.\" In other words, keep building, keep selling and send out fixes as necessary. If a system failed - causing lost data, stolen credit card numbers or time-consuming computer crashes - the burden fell not on giant, rich tech companies but on their customers.</p><p>The members of L0pht say they often experienced this cavalier attitude in their day jobs, where some toiled as humble programmers or salesmen at computer stores. When they reported bugs to software makers, company officials often asked: Does anybody else know about this?</p><p>The hackers met online, mostly on the bulletin boards that provided computer enthusiasts with freewheeling forums for trading tips, jokes and insights about how various systems worked - and in some cases could be made to do things their creators never intended. This is the essence of hacking. It is not inherently good or evil. It can be either, or in some cases a combination of both, depending on the motives of the hackers.</p><p>L0pht's members - the exact list shifted year to year but averaged seven or eight - shared a fascination with technology and a knack for testing its limits. They would decode the program running a piece of hardware or repeatedly flood a password field with too many characters, a hack known as a \"buffer overflow\" that often caused systems to fail, opening the door to further manipulation.</p><p>\"The difference between how it's supposed to work and how it really works is where the vulnerabilities happen,\" said Chris Wysopal, known as Weld Pond in his L0pht days.</p><p>The group's first clubhouse - and the inspiration for the name - was an actual loft above a carpentry shop in Boston's South End neighborhood, rented after the girlfriend of one of the hackers grew weary of all of the old computer gear littering their apartment (including several pieces resting semi-permanently in their bathroom).</p><p>Like the Internet itself, there seemed to be peril on the down-and-out streets all around L0pht's loft in this pre-gentrification era. But inside was geek heaven, with cast-off computers, a television, a couch, cold beer, a 1980s-vintage \"Battlezone\" arcade game and a curious array of second-hand mannequins wearing unusual adornments, including a skirt, a gas mask and the charred remnants of police uniform that the hackers found. In a stroke of luck, the landlord paid the electrical bill each month, keeping an endless lifeline of electrons flowing to what amounted to a power-hungry computer lab.</p><p>\"It was totally scary to get there, but once you got there it was like, 'Ahhhhh,' \" recalled Joe Grand, a mischievous skateboarding enthusiast who was L0pht's youngest member. \"It really was a refuge in a lot of ways. It really shaped my life.\"</p><p>Much of the gear they used - and tried to bend to their wills - had been collected from dumpsters around the tech-heavy Boston area. L0pht's members refurbished some hardware to sell at flea markets to help pay the bills, but they kept the most useful pieces, including a giant VAX computer - a hunk of 1970s-vintage technology featuring two units, each the size of a washing machine - that they somehow hauled up steep stairs and into the loft.</p><p>They came to particularly \u00addisdain what they considered \u00adsecurity-by-checklist, when companies declared a product safe merely because they had implemented a specified number of standard features, such as passwords and basic cryptography. \"We'd say, 'Give us one. We're going to try to break into it,' \" recalled Wysopal.</p><p>They almost always did, usually after toiling late into the night in a frenzy of discovery, flooding systems with inputs that programmers had not anticipated or in any way prepared for. Paul Nash, whose hacker name was Silicosis, once discovered that he could knock computers using Microsoft's Windows operating systems offline by sending a single command - a trick he happily showed off to visitors.</p><p>When members of L0pht weren't trying to find their own bugs, they were supporting others in doing so, including through regular gatherings at a Boston bar in which anyone who revealed a new computer vulnerability got a free beer. L0pht also spread the word about security discoveries though the Hacker News Network, a popular online newsletter run by Space Rogue, a born tinkerer who had rigged up makeshift flashlights so he could read in bed at night as a kid. (He still routinely uses his hacker name today).</p><p>Hacker News Network grew popular enough that it drew interest from advertisers. The group didn't want to sully its main Web site, L0pht.com, but was happy to collect revenue from Hacker News Network. One of the earliest ads touted the availability, for a fee, of Russian brides.</p><p>L0pht partially embraced the bad-boy image of hackers, calling themselves \"gray hats,\" a middle ground between the avowedly virtuous \"white hat\" hackers and the openly outlaw \"black hats.\" The group took particular relish in trying to shame big companies, such as Microsoft, for selling products with security flaws to unsuspecting customers.</p><p>When L0pht discovered a way to crack the cryptography protecting user passwords for the Windows operating system, Mudge publicly chastised Microsoft for what he called \"kindergarten crypto\" and, along with Wysopal, created an easy-to-use software tool to help anyone defeat it. L0pht member Dildog developed a program with another hacker group, called Cult of the Dead Cow, to remotely control office networks running Microsoft software. The name, a spoof on the company's popular \"BackOffice Server 2000\" program, was \"Back Orifice 2000\"; the promotional materials featured an equally crude logo.</p><p>But the reality of L0pht was more conventional than the public image. Wysopal was a programmer for Lotus. Space Rogue and two others worked at CompUSA, a chain store. Several had jobs at BBN Technologies, a venerable tech company that years earlier helped build the most important forerunner to the Internet, a Pentagon-funded project called the ARPANET.</p><p>The men used their hacker names mainly because they feared getting fired if their employers learned of their nocturnal activities. (The other reason, nearly as important, was that they wanted to make it harder for companies facing embarrassing disclosures to sue them or call the cops - real threats, then and now, for anyone doing freelance security research.)</p><p>The day jobs also provided an insider view of the burgeoning tech industry, helping the hackers find bugs in widely used business or consumer products. Companies that seemed unresponsive to complaints through formal channels often found themselves in L0pht's cross hairs. The group maintained open lines to legions of other hackers - including those working inside big tech firms - and developed disdain for a business culture they say put profit above security.</p><p>\"It's get it up, get it running as fast as we can. Let's make some money,\" Nash said. \"There's this tremendous push to get code out the door, and we'll fix it later.\"</p><p>L0pht also came to doubt the eagerness of companies to fix flaws even after they had been discovered. In the early years of the group, reports to official company e-mail addresses - purportedly established to solicit security concerns - often seemed to just disappear into a black hole. A particular offender, L0pht members said, was <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:secure@microsoft.com\">secure@microsoft.com</email></p><p>They eventually discovered a reliable way to get companies' attention: Security alerts posted on L0pht.com drew notice from the world's technology journalists and eventually the companies themselves.</p><p>The downside was that plenty of \"black hat\" hackers also monitored L0pht's alerts, giving them time to take advantage of bugs before companies could possibly fix them. There's no way to know how many intrusions this aided, but the members of L0pht were unapologetic.</p><p>\"We always thought that if we knew about it, other people probably know about it and are exploiting it,\" said Grand, formerly known as Kingpin.</p><p>The 1993 arrival of the first widely popular Web browser, Mosaic, made the Internet an unstoppable cultural and commercial force. Suddenly it wasn't an exotic, far-off wonderland for the technically adept. Anybody could \"surf the Web.\"</p><p>Over the next several years, sophisticated new programming languages such as Flash and Java dramatically expanded browsers' capabilities. Web sites began streaming video. Classic games such as \"Frogger,\" \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Tetris\" could be played, free of charge, on any computer that could get online.</p><p>For most users, these new features seemed almost magical. They appeared automatically, perhaps requiring just a click or two of a mouse. Soon, most computers in the world had Flash and similar programming languages on their hard drives.</p><p>Surging consumer interest was not lost on Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who penned a confidential memo to his top executives in May 1995 titled \"The Internet Tidal Wave.\" The 5,500-word document demanded in sweeping, urgent terms that the company compete forcefully in the explosive new online marketplace.</p><p>\"The next few years are going to be very exciting as we tackle these challenges and opportunities,\" Gates wrote. \"The Internet is a tidal wave. It changes the rules. It is an incredible opportunity as well as incredible challenge. I am looking forward to your input on how we can improve our strategy to continue our track record of incredible success.\"</p><p>Gates did warn about the importance of security in the memo, saying \"Our plans for security need to be strengthened.\" But he also said, \"I want every product plan to try and go overboard on Internet features.\"</p><p>This priority, many critics would later say, was the most important one to Microsoft, planting the seeds of what security experts called \"featuritis\" - a common malady in which new features are added more quickly than they can be made secure.</p><p>This rush to innovate, to make every Microsoft product essentially an Internet product, was felt deeply throughout the company, said Billy Brackenridge, a Microsoft program manager during the 1990s. The ability to deliver new features for the company's marquee operating systems and software determined who got stock options - a key motivator for a company whose stock split seven times that decade amid a total gain of more than 9,000\u00a0percent.</p><p>\"There may have been one or two guys who really cared [about security]. For the most part, it was, 'Get it out the door,' \" Brackenridge recalled. \"If we missed a date, that was real money. . . . If your feature didn't get in, you didn't get stock.\"</p><p>Microsoft's competitive juices fueled a furious push to develop a browser to challenge the primacy of Netscape Navigator, which was produced largely by the same team of programmers who had created Mosaic. By the mid-1990s, Navigator had more than 70\u00a0percent market share, Gates warned in his memo.</p><p>The Microsoft answer was to create Internet Explorer and to integrate the browser extensively with its dominant Windows operating system. This effort was central to  the Justice Department's antitrust charges against Microsoft, which were settled in 2001.</p><p>But it had other effects more immediately noticeable to L0pht and other hackers.</p><p>As Microsoft worked to infuse Internet-related features into its products, the company created portals for hackers to discover and exploit. A particularly notorious one was a programming language called ActiveX, which like Flash and Java reached deeply into the brains of a user's computer.</p><p>\"Once you go to a Web site and download some code and it executes itself . . . you have a whole new type of problem,\" said Giovanni Vigna, a computer scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara and co-founder of Lastline, a security company. \"Now I have running code on your machine, and I can do all sorts of interesting things.\"</p><p>At a hacker conference in August 1997, Mudge - whose real name is Peiter Zatko and who infused a zeal for showmanship into L0pht - visibly delighted in tweaking Microsoft as he described cracking the password security on Windows, at the time the standard operating system for business and government computers worldwide. </p><p>\"I don't want to be working on Microsoft products right now,\" Mudge declared. \"The problem is: They're everywhere! You cannot get away from them!\"</p><p>He singled out a particularly egregious security flaw - splitting a strong 14-character password field into two much weaker seven-character passwords for storage. The longer a password, the more combinations a hacker must try to break it. But Microsoft, Mudge reported, had undermined that principle by creating, in essence, two shorter and easily cracked passwords instead of one strong one.</p><p>Worse still, if the user had picked a password that was seven characters or fewer, the system stored a telltale string of characters to represent the unused portion of the password field. When hackers found this string, they knew that they already had the password halfway cracked. Mudge happily recited the odd combination of letters and numbers at the conference, with dozens of hackers looking on.</p><p>\"I'm going to get that tattooed across my forehead and walk through the halls of Microsoft!\" he said to laughter from the crowd.</p><p>He also announced that L0pht had discovered that a single password - \"CHANGEME\" - was being used by 700 users of one network the group studied.</p><p>Such antics drew fans within the hacker world, a hint of wider celebrity and the first whiff of money. L0pht sold T-shirts bearing its logo at conferences and also began selling its tool for cracking Windows passwords - called L0pht Crack - for $50 to system administrators eager to test the strength of passwords on the networks they managed.</p><p>When the members of L0pht realized how much security consultants were charging for such services, they raised the price to $150, then $500. (One of the buyers was the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency that chronicled failings of federal IT systems).</p><p>For all L0pht's drive to break systems online, members had long run their club with a certain formality. They had regular meetings, set collective priorities and handled financial matters carefully. Each hacker had his own desk and paid $100 a month toward rent; those who couldn't afford that would share desks and pay half as much.</p><p>But the money rushing into computer security got their attention. They got a first taste of it when the online ads along with sales of T-shirts and L0pht Crack meant that members no longer had to reach as deeply into their own pockets for rent or other costs. They also noticed how a rising generation of security consultants - including some doing \"stress testing\" using tactics much like L0pht's - were getting big paydays.</p><p>By the time L0pht appeared before the Senate in 1998, the idea of starting a real company - and earning enough profit to quit their day jobs - was starting to form within the group.</p><p>\"You know,\" Space Rogue remembered thinking, \"maybe we should get a piece of that.\"</p><p>This was the beginning of the end for L0pht.</p><p>They had an uproariously fun trip to Washington for the Senate testimony, renting a dark green, 15-passenger van and installing an array of antennas on the roof to see what signals they could pick up along the way.</p><p>This seemed like harmless hacker fun until they made a stop at the National Cryptologic Museum, on the grounds of the National Security Agency in suburban Maryland. Zatko had visited the NSA several times before, he said, part of gradual move into federal government work. \"I wanted them to have sensitivities, to know that hackers aren't the bad guys,\" he explained later.</p><p>But on this trip, Zatko accidentally directed the L0pht van, its roof bristling with interception equipment, to the entrance of a secure area of the NSA campus. Driving the van was L0pht member Stefan von Neumann, who appeared confused when he pulled up to a checkpoint manned by an armed military guard. When the guard saluted von Neumann, whose real name is Stefan Wuensch, he asked his fellow hackers, \"What should I do?\"</p><p>In unison, they shouted, \"Salute back!\"</p><p>But once on the grounds of the famously secret spy agency, the members of L0pht quickly grew uneasy and urged von Neumann to exit the grounds as quickly as possible. He soon did, getting the van to the museum, then onward to Washington without further incident.</p><p>The hackers testified the following day before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, whose staffers told L0pht that only members of federal witness protection programs had previously been allowed to testify using aliases. The hackers then took a tour of the White House, guided by National Security Council counterterrorism official Richard A. Clarke.</p><p>A cover story in Internet Week magazine, featuring Wysopal and Zatko (a.k.a. Weld Pond and Mudge), finally blew their cover at work, but they weren't fired as they had feared. The New York Times Magazine also featured L0pht in a story, as did PBS and MTV. The hackers' boasts about being able to take down the Internet in 30\u00a0minutes - by exploiting flaws in a key Internet routing protocol called BGP - prompted mentions from Conan O'Brien and Rush Limbaugh, who called them \"long-haired nerd computer hackers.\"</p><p>Even the makers of Trivial Pursuit took notice. Question: What did a group of geeks called L0pht tell the U.S. Senate they could cripple in 30 minutes?</p><p>Answer: The Internet</p><p>By the time that edition of the game hit the stores in 2000, L0pht was no longer L0pht. The hackers had joined @Stake, a security company built largely on L0pht's fame and $10\u00a0million in venture-capital funding. They quit their day jobs to finally pursue their nocturnal hobby full time.</p><p>But they also acquired an unwelcome new set of rules and responsibilities - especially to clients who were happy to pay for their expertise but didn't fancy getting publicly roasted whenever the hackers discovered problems.</p><p>\"The community we came from thought we were selling out to the Man, which of course we were,\" Wysopal recalled.</p><p>Among the biggest companies to hire @Stake - and demand nondisclosure agreements about what they found - was L0pht's longtime nemesis: Microsoft.</p><p>As business realities set in, Space Rogue was the first casualty. He had run the operations side of L0pht and also Hacker News Network. But the venture capitalists had their own operational guys, and they weren't keen on publicly affiliating themselves with the word \"hacker.\"</p><p>So the online newsletter became a sanitized corporate Web site called \"Security News Network,\" and Space Rogue got a job in @Stake's marketing department - far from the center of gravity where Mudge, Kingpin, Weld Pond and the others worked. Space Rogue was fired soon after.</p><p>The company confiscated his laptop computer and unceremoniously escorted him out the door for reasons he says he still doesn't understand . By the time Space Rogue got home, his L0pht.com accounts had been shut down. He had no idea - and still doesn't - whether any of his fellow hackers spoke up for him or fought the firing.</p><p>\"That was a bad part of my life. . . . I lost six of my best friends,\" Space Rogue recalled. \"It was really devastating to me. It took me a long time to recover from that.\"</p><p>The dot-com bubble, which had pushed tech companies' valuations into the stratosphere, burst about the same time, sweeping away weak companies like Pets.com  and squeezing revenue throughout the industry. The chief executive of @Stake, who was brought in to provide something like parental supervision to L0pht, ordered Wysopal to single out a member of the group for a layoff in order to balance out cuts elsewhere in the company.</p><p>Wysopal said he reluctantly dropped the ax on Brian Oblivion, one of L0pht's charter members, whose real name is Brian Hassick. The firing came the day before Hassick's son was to be baptized; he and Wysopal did not speak again for months.</p><p>As the bonds at the heart of L0pht deteriorated, Zatko mysteriously disappeared. Though not a founding member of the group, he had been its most public face during the rise to fame. </p><p>If L0pht was something akin to the Beatles of the hacker world - combining serious chops with an instinct for self-promotion - Zatko was the mercurial, boundary-busting John Lennon to Wysopal's even-keeled Paul McCartney.</p><p>But as @Stake struggled, Zatko developed severe anxiety, made worse by a bad reaction to medicine that was supposed to ease his symptoms, he said. Zatko ended up in a psychiatric ward for several days. None of the members of L0pht came to visit, a source of enduring frustration to him. (They say they didn't know what was happening, only that he was missing from work.)</p><p>\"The L0pht was my only family,\" Zatko recalled. \"It killed me. . . . It was absolutely atrocious.\"</p><p>Though Zatko gradually recovered, the decline of @Stake continued. Space Rogue threatened  a lawsuit to reclaim lost wages and his remaining share of the initial venture-capital funding. (He eventually settled with enough to buy a car, cover his lawyer's fees and put a down payment on a condominium, he says.)</p><p>Perhaps an even lower point for @Stake came in September 2003, when the company fired its chief technology officer, the respected security guru Dan Geer, after he co-authored a study on how Microsoft's dominance of the software industry undermined security. Geer learned of his dismissal through a news release issued by @Stake, according to news reports at the time.</p><p>When Symantec, a larger security firm, bought the remains of @Stake in 2004, it was a mercy killing.</p><p>\"Everything we stood for had been nibbled away little by little by little until we were left with nothing,\" Grand said. \"We needed to be able to speak the truth about everybody. That didn't last very long. . . . Eventually we just got on our knees for everybody.\"</p><p>As L0pht was collapsing, security on the Internet took a turn for the worse. The waning days of the 20th century featured huge investments toward fixing the Y2K bug - based on the alarming possibility that programs designed to recognize years by only two digits, such as \"99,\" would suddenly crash when they saw \"00.\"</p><p>But the problems that would soon bedevil computing were not accidental, like the Y2K bug. The black hats were on the rise.</p><p>Among the first security disasters of the next decade, the ILOVEYOU worm, arrived in May 2000 and apparently was the work of a pair of computer programmers from the Philippines. </p><p>The virus exploited a feature in Microsoft Outlook to send malicious code to each new victim's contact lists.</p><p>Soon, an estimated 10\u00a0percent of the world's computers were infected, snarling networks for the Pentagon, the British Parliament and many private companies. Estimates of damage and cleanup costs topped $20\u00a0billion. Many other worms - with names such as Pikachu, Anna Kournikova and Nimda - also exploited flaws in Microsoft products.</p><p>On Dec.\u00a08, 2000, one day after the anniversary of the surprise Japanese attack on U.S. Navy forces in 1941, Clarke - the National Security Council official who had once given L0pht a tour of the White House - appeared at a conference organized by Microsoft. He warned that if the government didn't improve computer security, the nation might suffer a \"digital Pearl Harbor.\" </p><p>L0pht's legacy is a mixed one. The group was among the pioneers of a system called \"responsible disclosure,\" still widely used today, in which researchers who find bugs give companies a set amount of time to make fixes before security flaws are announced to the world. Some companies now go a step further, offering cash rewards called \"bug bounties\" to encourage hackers to search for problems - and ideally find them ahead of criminals and spies.</p><p>Microsoft eventually became more serious about security. It didn't have much choice: Major customers told Gates to either do better or lose their business. In a memo in January 2002 - something of a bookend to the one from 1995 - Gates declared that a new security initiative was \"the highest priority for all the work we are doing.\"</p><p>The move initially drew some skepticism. \"When I told friends I was going to Microsoft to do security . . . most of them laughed at me because I used 'Microsoft' and 'security' in the same sentence,\" said Scott Charney, a former Justice Department official hired in 2002. He is now corporate vice president for Trustworthy Computing at Microsoft.</p><p>Microsoft pulled thousands of engineers off of product development to overhaul the company's systems for designing and building software. Gates sent one group of officials to a retreat at a historic wooden home more commonly used for weddings, in nearby Bellevue, Wash., about a 15-minute drive from Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond. Charney said, \"Basically some people were sent there and told, don't come back until you have an answer.\"</p><p>But the Internet did not suddenly become secure. The company's newfound  focus on security took years to bear fruit, most notably with the arrival of Windows Vista in 2006 and Office 2010 a few years later. Because of a need for \"backward compatibility\" - meaning older and newer versions of Microsoft products work easily together - old flaws lingered in the online world for many years after they were fixed in newly released software.</p><p>The federal government in the past year finally has replaced hundreds of thousands of computers running Windows XP - an operating system first released in 2001, months before Gates's call to arms on product security - after the company withdrew free support after nearly 13 years.</p><p>But as Microsoft's products became more secure, hackers began feasting on alternative targets that did not get similar overhauls.</p><p>\"Hackers are like water,\" said Vigna, the computer scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \"They always go for the path of least resistance. . . . If you put a plug in place, they will find another crack.\"</p><p>At the root is an issue raised by L0pht in its Senate testimony: The business incentives within the tech industry favor growth over security. And once companies get big enough that security is a major concern - as eventually happened to Microsoft - it's extremely difficult to retrofit rigorous protections into systems built without them.</p><p>Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who  chaired the Senate panel in 1998 and left Congress  in 2003, said in a recent interview that Internet security is the kind of problem the government has trouble fixing. \"Number one, it's very difficult, and number two, there's no immediate political payoff for anyone.\"</p><p>Some industry critics favor strict government standards and legal liability for failures, as long have existed for many critical offline systems such as cars, elevators and airplanes. Others would create an independent group, a tech industry equivalent to Underwriters Laboratories, which certifies the safety of electronic devices worldwide. Or perhaps insurance companies, which ultimately foot the bill for many cybersecurity incidents, may some day demand better safety practices from their clients, as insurers long have done for homes and cars.</p><p>But others have argued that demands for greater security could damp innovation and make tech products harder to use. Given the industry's increasingly central role in the national economy - and the massive expansion in tech lobbying power in Washington in recent years - tough new laws or regulations remain difficult to imagine.</p><p>\"The only way to get in front of the security problem is to build better software,\" said Gary McGraw, chief technology official for Cigital, a Northern \u00adVirginia-based firm that has worked on software security since the 1990s. \"Until we start building security in, we'll always play catch-up.\"</p><p>L0pht itself has rebounded a bit, releasing an updated version of L0pht Crack in 2009. The main Web site is still running, if a bit dated looking. The Hacker News Network regained its name and its edge, </p><p>Wysopal and fellow L0pht hacker Dildog founded a security company, Veracode, in 2006. Zatko, after recovering from severe anxiety , rejoined BBN Technologies.

It took a giant fire in Chicago to spur government officials into serious reforms, including limits on new wooden structures, a more robust water supply for suppressing blazes and an overhaul to the city's fire department.</p><p>\"The market didn't solve the problem of cities burning down,\" Wysopal said, predicting that Internet security may require a historic disaster to force change. \"It seems to me that the market isn't really going to solve this one on its own.\"</p><p>But here's a frightening fact: The push to create tough new fire-safety standards did not start after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, which killed hundreds of people and left 100,000 homeless. It took a second fire, nearly three years later in 1874, to get officials in Chicago to finally make real changes.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-8a76e330191311e5ab92c75ae6ab94b5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G8M-M8B1-DXKP-J09H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5590\"/><timeReceived>7:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 22, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Among them was Rep. Paul Tonko, a Democrat from upstate New York who joined other legislators in scolding Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at a House hearing April 11.</p><p>\"Users trusted Facebook to prioritize user privacy and data security, and that trust has been shattered,\" Tonko told Zuckerberg.</p><p>Yet Tonko has been less than transparent with people visiting his re-election website.  The site offers no warning that it employs a tracking tool that gathers information on those who land there.</p><p>In dozens of cases during the recently concluded midterm elections, candidates used a tracking tool, two of them, or even three, on their campaign websites without informing users. Such embedded tools can collect granular data - such as age, gender, location and even specifics about the computer the visitor is using, and sites he or she has visited - that is increasingly useful for campaign advertising, identifying possible supporters and even shaping political platforms.</p><p>Tonko was not the only lawmaker offering tough questions to Zuckerberg in public while employing a different strategy in private. Democratic and Republican legislators alike pelted Zuckerberg with criticism, only to use campaign websites that failed to alert visitors that their sites contained tools that snoop.</p><p>Some experts say that tracking tools can gather such valuable data that politicians may find themselves squirming to write privacy regulations for big tech companies without harming their own future re-election bids, which increasingly rely on deep voter profiles compiled through tracking for pinpoint advertising on social media, particularly Facebook.</p><p>In many cases, when contacted by a reporter, lawmakers declined to respond to queries about their use of tracking tools. In two cases, legislators made changes - or pledged to do so - to their websites.</p><p>That was the case with Rep. Bill Flores, a Republican from a Texas district surrounding Waco, who was critical of Zuckerberg at the April 11 hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Flores told Zuckerberg that any data Facebook releases to third parties \"should be based on the absolute transparency as to what data will be used.\"</p><p>Facebook privacy: Three lessons on data, apps and taking precautionsLately, users are asking themselves about what data they share publicly on Facebook and who can access it. Here are some steps users can take to protect their data in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica breach. </p><p>On the Flores campaign website, billflores.com, Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel Code, powerful tools to gather data on visitors, are embedded in the site's source code, hidden from all but the most tech savvy users.</p><p>Flores's campaign said the basic website design was years old and that the campaign team \"was not aware of the inclusion\" of design features such as Google Analytics.</p><p>\"These tools were not used by the campaign to track or target advertising. Now that we are aware that the vendor included these tools in our website design, we will soon add a privacy statement,\" the campaign said in a statement.</p><p>Experts said politicians, some of whom displayed only cursory knowledge of tech issues during Zuckerberg's appearance on Capitol Hill, may genuinely ignore how their websites run.</p><p>\"Do we believe that politicians themselves are going in and embedding these analytic scripts in their websites? No. Is it someone on their staff? Yes,\" said Chandler Givens, chief executive of TrackOFF, a Baltimore company that offers tools to protect people's identities. \"It's a deliberate action on their part.</p><p>Givens' company decided to look into website tracking used by candidates in the run-up to the Nov. 6 midterm elections.</p><p>\"Watching the hearing with Zuckerberg, we started thinking, you know, it's probably the case that a lot of these folks are using the same type of technology that they are lambasting Mark Zuckerberg for,\" Givens said.</p><p>As part of a survey in September, the company picked 100 random campaigns, some of incumbent senators and members of Congress, others of challengers, from 35 states. They found that 95 of the campaigns used tracking technology on their websites. Of those, 49 websites did not state that they were collecting data or say for what purpose it would be used. Such perfunctory statements are usually contained in a \"privacy policy\" link on websites.</p><p>The vast majority (84 percent) of sites used Google Analytics, a free tool that tracks activities of users and can sort them by age, location, gender and interests. About half that number (42 percent) used Facebook's tracking technology.</p><p>A handful used less well-known but powerful tracking tools, including ones by AddThis and MediaMath (mathtag), that offer a detailed analysis of a website's visitors. TrackOFF found at least five politicians or incumbents who used a combination of three tracking tools.</p><p>Givens said the less widely known tools offer politicians deeper insights when the data is wedded with offline databases containing information on consumer purchases and other activities.</p><p>\"That is something that would be jarring to the average reader to know that if you're buying something at the local pharmacy there's high probability that that information is being packaged up, shared and sold to data brokers. That information is then connected up with your online browsing habits to form a profile of you which can be used to target you in political campaigns. ... That's actually happening now,\" Givens said.</p><p>As consumers grow warier of tracking, such tools have evolved, said Yinzhi Cao, a computer scientist and privacy expert at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</p><p>The early days of tracking saw widespread use of computer \"cookies,\" or packets of data that keep records of a user's visits to a website and allow them not to need to log in again repeatedly. As some users deleted cookies, developers ushered in a generation of \"super cookies,\" which cannot be deleted, and uniquely identify the device a user is on.</p><p>Perhaps more pernicious, the latest generation of tracking tools employ digital fingerprinting, which may include a lightning scan of factors like the fonts and plug-ins installed on a device and the way in which it renders an image, all brought together to identify the device, and even the user.</p><p>\"Some of the tracking companies ... have become sneakier. That's why they use advanced tools to track you even if you clear your browser cookies,\" Cao said.</p><p>One senator who maintains an active campaign website, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, immediately removed the Google and Facebook tracking tools from the site when a reporter contacted his office. Blumenthal doesn't face re-election until 2022.</p><p>\"Like millions of other consumers, we rely on Facebook and Google's services and products on a daily basis and have placed trust in how they handle consumer data - a trust that as we have learned over the past year, these companies have repeatedly betrayed,\" Blumenthal said. </p><p>Earns_Facebook_04951.jpgFILE - In this April 11, 2018, file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before a House Energy and Commerce hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington about the use of Facebook data to target American voters in the 2016 election and data privacy. Facebook Inc. reports earnings Tuesday, Oct. 30.Mark Zuckerberg</p><p>\"While I have taken steps to remove Google and Facebook from my website, such companies have deeply embedded themselves across the internet. Protecting privacy should not be so difficult, and Congress needs to set the standard.\"</p><p>Many other legislators and candidates did not respond to repeated phone and email messages for comment, including Rep. Tonko and Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, both of whom were highly critical of Zuckerberg at the April hearing yet use tracking tools.</p><p>Senator-elect Mike Braun of Indiana, a Republican, who uses three tracking tools on his campaign website, did not respond to repeated emails to his office. Nor did Rep. John Faso, a New York Republican, who also uses three tracking tools. A spokesman for Sean Casten, a biochemical engineer who won a House seat from Illinois 6th district, and uses three tracking tools on his site (although with a privacy warning), said he is \"focused on his transition\" and would not offer comment.</p><p>Some experts say data gathering by politicians will only increase.</p><p>\"Successful campaigns these days use technology to psychographically target their support base and by doing so, can cut to the psychological core of the voter,\" said James Scott, a consultant who until recently advised legislators on cybersecurity issues. \"The topic of privacy and weaponizing metadata against the user for psychological manipulation is one of the things that burned me out on the Hill.\"</p><p>Givens, the TrackOFF chief, said he worries that the harvesting of data from tracking tools will prove too tantalizing to politicians to try to curb.</p><p>\"You have to step back and start thinking about a republic in which the candidates who are elected maybe are the ones who have the most advanced tracking analytics tools at their disposal. Is that the type of government that is the optimal model for the United States?\" Givens asked.</p><p>Tim Johnson, 202 383-6028, @timjohnson4</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KRWB-c11b90b293f94308a3980d7e6b233eeb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KRWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRG-H2D1-DYJM-M0PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">293521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 McClatchy Washington Bureau All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>McClatchy Washington Bureau</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Of course, we know that the impetus for this drive for confidentiality comes primarily from the fallout surrounding the Cambridge Analytica[1] scandal and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation[2] (GDPR), which goes into effect May 25. Still, the general feel from notices companies have been sending out is that they have always been concerned with our data privacy, but they just want to be more transparent about it now. The big talking point on data collection is that they (Big Tech) only want to use our data to 'improve the user experience.' </p><p>This altruistic point of view sounds good, but we all know that the data is being used to make money. But what if there was an ulterior motive to Big Tech's data collection \u2014 something that did not involve improving our experience or making money? What if it was secretly looking to control the world? Well, at least one company was, or at least had put a lot of thought into it. According to a short film uncovered by The Verge[3] called 'The Selfish Ledger,' Google had been thinking about using 'total data collection' and social engineering to modify the behavior of entire populations. The nine-minute video examines the possibilities of using Big Data[4] to guide users into conforming to a predetermined agenda. While the video does take a 'for the common good' slant by using thought control techniques to solve problems like poverty and global warming, the mere fact that the video is seriously discussing behavior modification on a massive global scale is scary.The film was made in 2016 by Google X (now just X) head of design Nick Foster and fellow researcher David Murphy for internal use at Google. In it, Foster envisions a future where massive amounts of data are collected on users and stored in what he refers to as a 'ledger.' The ledger contains a user's 'actions, decisions, preferences, movements, and relationships.' \"We understand if this is disturbing \u2014 it is designed to be.\" Artificial intelligence will analyze this data. If the ledger finds a gap in the in the information that it needs to understand the user better, it will search for a device that the target might have that could contain the missing piece. If one is not found, the AI could use historical information on the user to design, propose, and deliver a custom product they might want via 3D printing. While the product will be for the use of the consumer, it will also be capable of supplying the ledger with the information it requires.It is an alarming prospect that one would expect from a dystopian novel, but not from real life. When asked about the film, an X spokesperson told The Verge, 'We understand if this is disturbing \u2014 it is designed to be. This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as 'speculative design' to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate. It's not related to any current or future products.' I find this explanation somewhat hard to swallow. I know of no company that spends time, resources, and money on research that it has no intention of acting upon. Firms big and small are always looking for a return on investment. If the company knows there is little or no ROI, it abandons the idea. Does X expect us to believe that the ROI for The Selfish Ledger was only an internal philosophical discussion amongst employees over coffee? Google has made considerable strides in the field of artificial intelligence[5]. Although I remain skeptical that it was real, its Duplex AI[6], demoed at I/O, seemed to pass the Turing test by fooling people into thinking they were talking with a human. Having a so-called 'ledger' of user data capable of self-analyzation with an agenda of behavior manipulation is not a big stretch. Concerns over privacy are at the forefront right now, but once the fervor dies down, I can see Google revisiting the possibilities of The Selfish Ledger in the near future trying to find that ROI.Related ReadsShare this article: [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/tag/cambridge+analytica/\">https://www.techspot.com/tag/cambridge+analytica/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/74426-firms-scramble-get-their-data-collection-policies-compliance.html\">https://www.techspot.com/news/74426-firms-scramble-get-their-data-collection-policies-compliance.html</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy\">https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/tag/big+data/\">https://www.techspot.com/tag/big+data/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/tag/ai/\">https://www.techspot.com/tag/ai/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/74582-google-responds-duplex-backlash-ai-voice-system-identify.html\">https://www.techspot.com/news/74582-google-responds-duplex-backlash-ai-voice-system-identify.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TSPT1338811526588454205251762100110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSPT-133881</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SBT-5N61-F03R-N1CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><timeReceived>8:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TechSpot</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 17, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If the ledger finds a gap in the in the information that it needs to understand the user better, it will search for a device that the target might have that could contain the missing piece. If one is not found, the AI could use historical information on the user to design, propose, and deliver a custom product they might want via 3D printing. While the product will be for the use of the consumer, it will also be capable of supplying the ledger with the information it requires.<br/> It is an alarming prospect that one would expect from a dystopian novel, but not from real life.<br/> When asked about the film, an X spokesperson told The Verge, \"We understand if this is disturbing - it is designed to be. This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as 'speculative design' to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate. It's not related to any current or future products.\"<br/> I find this explanation somewhat hard to swallow. I know of no company that spends time, resources, and money on research that it has no intention of acting upon. Firms big and small are always looking for a return on investment. If the company knows there is little or no ROI, it abandons the idea. Does X expect us to believe that the ROI for The Selfish Ledger was only an internal philosophical discussion amongst employees over coffee?<br/>Google has made considerable strides in the field of artificial intelligence. Although I remain skeptical that it was real, its Duplex AI, demoed at I/O, seemed to pass the Turing test by fooling people into thinking they were talking with a human. Having a so-called \"ledger\" of user data capable of self-analyzation with an agenda of behavior manipulation is not a big stretch.<br/> Concerns over privacy are at the forefront right now, but once the fervor dies down, I can see Google revisiting the possibilities of The Selfish Ledger in the near future trying to find that ROI.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TCHTRE-n10512416</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TCHTRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG4-5G91-DYDW-72MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410757</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TechTree.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 18, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Scott Applewhite Democrats are pushing a vote to restore net neutrality protections the FCC ended in December. Democrats say they now have 50 votes in favor of their bill. </p><p>One more \"yes\" vote will guarantee the bill passes. The House will also have to pass the bill, and President Trump will have to sign it. So there's still little chance this move will be successful in restoring net neutrality. Democrats need just one more vote in the Senate to guarantee passage of a bill to restore the net neutrality rules killed by the FCC in December[1]. In a statement, Senate Democrats said the bill has support of all 49 Democratic senators. Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine, also supports the bill, setting the stage for a 50-50 tie vote that would have to be broken by Vice President Mike Pence. One more \"yes\" vote will guarantee the bill passes the Senate. It only needs a simple majority to pass. But even if the Senate passes a bill to restore net neutrality, the House will have to pass it as well. And after that, President Trump will have to sign it. There's a slim chance that's going to happen. The net neutrality repeal was spearheaded by FCC chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee. Democrats are using a law called the Congressional Review Act that lets Congress vote on regulations implemented by government agencies like the FCC. Republicans have previously used the Congressional Review Act to repeal Obama-era regulations.NOW WATCH: How Area 51 became the center of alien conspiracy theories[2]See Also: 7 sneakers that will never go out of style \u2014 and they're all under $100[3]Amazon's Echo vs Google's Home: Here's how the two families stack up[4]The 50 best-selling albums of all time[5] SEE ALSO:\u00a0Net neutrality repeal will make Big Tech more powerful[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/fcc-votes-repeal-net-neutrality-2017-12?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/fcc-votes-repeal-net-neutrality-2017-12?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/area-51-american-conspiracy-theories-aliens-history-animation-video-2017-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/area-51-american-conspiracy-theories-aliens-history-animation-video-2017-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/timeless-sneakers-under-100-dollars-adidas-superstar-nike-air-force-1?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/timeless-sneakers-under-100-dollars-adidas-superstar-nike-air-force-1?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-vs-google-home-2017-10?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-vs-google-home-2017-10?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/50-best-selling-albums-all-time-2016-9?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/50-best-selling-albums-all-time-2016-9?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/fccs-net-neutrality-repeal-will-be-a-boon-to-the-large-tech-companies-2017-12?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">http://www.businessinsider.com/fccs-net-neutrality-repeal-will-be-a-boon-to-the-large-tech-companies-2017-12?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BZIN1056451516119364710251768500147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BZIN-5352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RDW-D6P1-F03R-N40F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><timeReceived>4:16 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Insider</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 16, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A few years back, you walked point on combat patrols through the gnarliest, darkest shadows of the war, always with a sleek, black rifle pressed tight against your shoulder. Thirty golden rounds of ammunition just a trigger squeeze away. Platoon mates at your back ready to carry out foreign policy through sheer force. Seventy-five or so pounds of equipment packed on your body, holding water and extra ammo and that medical kit you never wanted to use but did, because the moment came for you and you did what you'd been trained for.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That was then. Now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Go,\" you instruct the techies, in their plaid shirts and pastel Converses. It's a bright autumn day in California. The traffic light has changed; the cars have stopped. \"Cross the street.\"</p><p>They're not techies, you correct yourself. Most of them are software engineers. More than anything, they're clients. They're customers. You're glad to be here, not on crosswalk duty, exactly, but at the job in general. It's good, honest work, and it pays well. You have benefits and steady hours. You know how hard it is to find such a gig after the military. Turns out American employers tend not to value skills like walking point on combat patrols in the most dangerous parts of the world. You don't take this for granted. Even today.</p><p>\"Stop,\" you tell the next batch of engineers approaching from the parking lot, toward the headquarters of their employer, Big Tech Firm. The light has changed, and the cars are moving.</p><p>One company lost an employee several months back. Hit by a bus, was sent straight into the far beyond. That's why you're here. To protect the clients, even when it's from themselves. They're fine, you know. Just people. But . . . different. They carry themselves differently from what you're used to. They're more into what's going on in their heads than what's going on around them. Some are probably geniuses, though it's hard to believe that right now, when half seem to be studying the concrete and the other half are buried in their phone screens. \"Go,\" you say. The light has changed. The cars have stopped. \"Cross the street.\"</p><p>At times, it resembles your former life. No rifle now, of course. Equipment's mostly just a cell and a handheld radio. A medical kit with Band-Aids instead of burn dressing. But the feel of it. The structure. The camaraderie, especially. The team-they get you. You get them. That fucking matters. You didn't know how much you missed it until you had it again.</p><p>Still, there's no such thing as a half soldier.</p><p>Out of the corner of your eye, you see movement. A squat shape, an engineer with his face deep in a tablet. He steps off the curb. Five, six feet away, you estimate. It's too late to shout. There's only one choice. That choice is action.</p><p>\"Whoa!\" says a voice from behind. You spin around and see another engineer, mouth agape, staring at your hand, which is clutching the squat engineer's shirt collar. You grabbed him just in time. A large truck rolls by, a strident honk filling the space between. The squat engineer turns around and looks at you, eyes blinking. \"Thanks,\" he mumbles. Then he's gone, because the light has changed, and the cars have stopped, and the crosswalk once more belongs to the clients.</p><p>Adrenaline's juicing your veins. There it is, you think. The old rush. You take a deep breath and check your watch. Lunch is three hours away.</p><p>On April 3, 2018, in the quiet city of San Bruno, California, a thirty-\u00adeight-year-old woman named Nasim Najafi Aghdam entered the headquarters of YouTube and opened fire with a 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson, emptying a full magazine of rounds. Then she turned the weapon on herself, dying via a gunshot to the chest. As far as shootings go in twenty-first-century America, the one at YouTube scored low in terms of victim body count_ four injured-three by gunfire, one hurt fleeing the scene-and zero deaths. Some of the techno-utopians of Silicon Valley, who so often position themselves as humanity's best hope, used the moment to call attention to gun regulation or mental-health initiatives. But mostly the incident accelerated in the tech sector a process that's been taking hold of many American industries with deep pockets in this mass-shooting era, from pro sports to casinos to Wall Street: the professionalization-some would call it the militarization-of the security business. \"YouTube opened up their eyes,\" one security specialist told me. \"Showed them there's actual evil in the world.\"</p><p>Some eighteen months later, a piece of that acceleration walks the sun-splashed, tranquil campus of Big Tech Firm, waving, smiling, observing. Combat veteran Mike Rios, thirty-four, proud south Texas native and formerly of the United States Army infantry, is making the rounds, checking on his teams. He seems to know everyone-the software engineers, the sales managers, the vendors. Most smile and wave back in recognition. All part around Rios's stocky frame like shadows under a flashlight. \"What can I say?\" he says, grinning. \"Winning hearts and minds.\"</p><p>Rios works for Surefox Consulting, a physical-\u00adrisk-management firm-protection for hire-that's part of Big Tech Firm's multilayered security apparatus. There's in-house security and other private security firms, all tasked with different roles and responsibilities. This is standard fare in a world shaped by Darwinian hypercompetition and mass contracting. Surefox's niche is \"incident command,\" a nice way of saying it handles the emergencies. Its pitch is straightforward and convincing_ Of the 271 people in the company's full- or part-time employ, approximately 90 percent are military veterans. At a time when suicide and unemployment numbers among veterans remain stubbornly high, especially among those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Surefox holds particular appeal to a community that worships disruption. (Big Tech Firm did not want to be identified in this story. I was granted access to Surefox's operations in part because I served in the same infantry battalion as its director of operations in Iraq in 2008. Rios belonged to that battalion as well.)</p><p>Founded in 2016 in Texas, Surefox is an up-and-comer, a lean mako shark in a sea of whales. One of the industry's mainstays, Security Industry Specialists, has operated in Silicon Valley for years. So has another, AS Solution, which recently got caught up in an investigation by the Santa Clara County district attorney's office involving concealed-\u00adcarry permits that, allegedly, may have been given out by the county sheriff in exchange for campaign donations. (AS Solution, in a press statement, said it is cooperating fully with the investigation as well as launching an internal one.) The techno-\u00adutopians pride themselves on valuing new ideas and approaches. Enter Surefox.</p><p>While the older security firms and others hire veterans and run veteran-transition programs, going veteran heavy was, as they say, a white space-an unfilled niche, an opportunity. Contracted security can summon thoughts of overseas firms like Blackwater, accused of massacring Iraqi citizens in 2007, or the private contractors fighting in Yemen's brutal, ongoing civil war. That's not Surefox. Its CEO, Josh Szott, thirty-six, and its director of operations, Brian Sweigart, forty-two, served together sixteen years ago in the 10th Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division, which deployed to Iraq in 2003. Both men are decorated for valor-Szott with a Silver Star for actions taken during an ambush near Tikrit. Their firm caught a break in 2017, when it was brought in to help manage security at South by Southwest, the music festival in Austin. Tech contacts-and tech contracts-came after, and Surefox moved its headquarters to San Francisco the next year.</p><p>Unlike in his past life, Rios isn't armed at Big Tech Firm. Still, he and his teams stick out on campus because of their erect postures and small but noticeable earpieces. They tend to dress more crisply than their security competition, with shirts tucked and tattoos covered. You can take the soldier out of the mil, but you can't take the mil out of the soldier.</p><p>Rios's teams include both stationary posts and roaming patrols and occasionally encounter people who don't belong-demonstrators, angry ex-employees, vagrants. Mostly they spend their days checking IDs and giving visitors directions. When I ask one Surefox employee, an Army Reservist who deployed twice to Guant\u00e1namo Bay as a correctional-\u00adfacility guard, what it's like to keep watch at Big Tech Firm, he smiles. \"Compared to how the detainees at Guant\u00e1namo treated us,\" he says, \"this is fine.\"</p><p>Not everything translates. \"I had to tone down the alpha-male stuff when I got here,\" Rios says. Less yelling, less swearing. The golden rule_ Talk about anything-anything at all-except politics and religion. \"That's something we help our new hires with,\" he says with a knowing wink. \"How to find the balance between the mil and Disneyland.\"</p><p>Many of Big Tech Firm's employees look like college kids staggering to an early-\u00admorning class, with rumpled T-shirts and bed head that's never seen a comb. Each and every Surefox employee speaks well of these clients, but it's hard to ignore the class disparity on display. In general, the engineers and other employees, the latter of whom are identified in the tech ecosystem by the semi-\u00adderogatory title of \"non-eng,\" attended a very specific set of schools, studied a very specific set of subjects, and maintain a very specific worldview that blends liberal values and libertarian ideals. When it comes to issues of national security, they tend to focus on high-tech, macro questions such as the ethics of using armed drones and robot soldiers. They don't spend much time considering the professional hurdles of former infantry grunts.</p><p>As Rios and I walk the campus of Big Tech Firm, one of his guards reports a medical situation he tended to. \"Guy cut his finger cutting open a box. I stopped the bleeding easy enough.\" Rios looks at me. \"Sometimes people freak out about things you and I would consider normal,\" he says. \"A lot of smoke,\" forty-one-year-old Navy veteran Donnie Tengco says. \"Not a lot of fires.\"</p><p/><p>The first time I hear Rios say \"winning hearts and minds,\" I think it's a joke. Then I hear another Surefox employee use the phrase. Then a third. Then I notice the acronyms they toss around-BOLO and POI and SOP and TTP. It takes me a couple days, but eventually it dawns on me_ The emphasis on being one with their clients, on knowing the terrain, on knowing what right looks like so they can know what wrong looks like, too-Surefox is implementing counterinsurgency tactics in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(Re)introduced to the U. S. military a decade ago by General David Petraeus, COIN was heralded at the time as the magic solution to ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was built on the idea that protecting local populations from a common foe would flush out those enemy insurgents. It's like Newton's third law_ For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. De-\u00adescalation is a guiding principle. Don't lead with blunt force, but be prepared to finish with it. COIN failed outright in Afghanistan. In Iraq, the strategy succeeded for a time, thanks to a massive economic stimulus and earnest attempts at reconciliation with Sunni tribal leaders. The billion-dollar question was whether the stability COIN brought would remain when there weren't American soldiers posted at every corner.</p><p>It didn't. Among the many things required for COIN to succeed, the most important are near-endless supplies of soldiers and money. Turns out that wasn't feasible for the U. S. military. Silicon Valley is a different story. Shareholders don't ask the same questions as the general public. And with more billionaires per capita than anywhere else in the world, the Bay Area is primed to fund all sorts of pie-in-the-sky ventures, especially those that focus on protecting the well-\u00adbeing of said money. Here, the sense of exceptionalism is as thick as the San Francisco fog.</p><p>COIN is dead. Long live customer service.</p><p>Surefox's military mentality extends beyond operations. It's baked into its org chart. \"We intentionally mirrored the officer/NCO dynamic in the Army,\" Sweigart tells me, by which he means the distinction between big-picture planning and practical execution. \"[Szott's] great at what he does. I've been trained for some of these things I do.\" It's even baked into the company's name_ Szott was a 13-Fox in the Army, a fire-\u00adsupport artilleryman. They added the \"Sure\" because, as Szott says, \"we wanted to convey certainty, secur\u00adity. It clicked.\" Such considerations were as much about recruiting employees as they were about attracting potential clients. He says one of the company's primary goals is to establish a \"secondary military community\" for fellow vets. \"You hear from the employees sometimes, 'I feel useful again,' \" Szott says. \"That's no small thing.\"</p><p>One of Surefox's medics thinks the company benefits in Silicon Valley from modern veterans' work with foreign militaries. \"We all learned, at young ages, how to deal with different cultures and different people,\" he says. \"It's all about picking up those differences quickly and being adaptable to them.\"</p><p>A late-afternoon conversation with Big Tech Firm employees at a bar near campus also conjures some parallels to my experiences with COIN. The employees tell me they're grateful for security firms like Surefox. But_ Why do they get to determine where the line is in situations? The employees want them present but not conspicuous, active but not overbearing. Which was a complaint many an Iraqi citizen expressed to my scout platoon in 2008. And like many of those Iraqis-and like Big Tech Firm itself-these employees stress anonymity. (Even with that, our conversation stays innocuous, barely surface level.)</p><p>It's impressive, all this security. Professional. Elite. Nevertheless, I can't help but think_ The local elementary school remains a soft target. So does the retirement community. And that Catholic church off the highway with the yoga studio across from it. There are men and women in Silicon Valley who wield the power to change the national conversation about gun violence. Who better to disrupt the status quo? All this money, all this influence-how could they not? Yet the techno-utopians haven't worked to better protect their community; they've worked to better protect themselves.</p><p>That's their choice. Still, it's a choice most of us don't get to make.</p><p>This past spring, Eric Gonzalez, thirty-one, spent one month planted in front of Salesforce Tower, San Francisco's tallest building, to protect smartphones. Samsung was promoting its latest models, and to drum up excitement, it set up product displays on the sidewalk.</p><p>During the day, Gonzalez was charged with keeping the peace between the Samsung hawkers and the overeager passersby hoping to score extra swag or even another phone. At night, though-that's when Gonzalez was most reminded of Iraq.</p><p>Salesforce Tower is built over a former landfill in one of San Francisco's fastest-\u00adgentrifying neighborhoods. Remnants of the area's seedy past remain_ trash-strewn lots, human shit staining the sidewalks. When darkness came, the Samsung equipment was moved inside, and Gonzalez and his colleagues' mission changed to protecting the building and the products therein. Each night, they established a hard perimeter of posted guards and sent out rovers to patrol what lay beyond. During those long, dark hours, Gonzalez had too much time to think, too much time to consider the unknown. It was just like rooftop security at a combat outpost.</p><p>One night, while his mind drifted, Gonzalez heard a rumbling in the darkness. He called out, asking who was there. No reply came, but the sound came closer. He called out again. Still no reply. The sound came even closer. He braced his body and reached for his flashlight.A figure emerged from the shadows. It wasn't an IED emplacer or an insurgent strapped with a suicide vest. It was a homeless guy pushing a grocery cart. He went up to Gonzalez and asked for a cigarette. Gonzalez chuckled to himself and obliged.</p><p/><p>The greatest concentration of wealth in human history may well be in present-day Silicon Valley. Its per capita GDP outpaces most countries'. Even so, the benefits of trickle-\u00addown exceptionalism seem spotty. Housing costs in San Francisco continue to soar, forcing out families who've lived there for generations and keeping out all but the wealthiest newcomers. Most of Surefox's employees live not in the city but in the communities that ring Silicon Valley like a horseshoe_ Hayward, Foster City, Santa Cruz. Their long commutes mean that sometimes it's easier to work out at the campus gym than at the Crunch in their hometown.</p><p>Jessica Jasper, thirty-four, a brown belt in Brazilian jujitsu who's won a world title and a Pan Am title, goes to Big Tech Firm's gym all the time. She moved to the Bay Area after a stint doing security work for celebrities in Hollywood, where she discovered that the trouble often came from the client's entourage, not from the client. Thankfully, Silicon Valley does not see a lot of entourages.</p><p>Jasper appreciates that Big Tech Firm's gym doesn't have the same tired meat-\u00admarket vibe that plagues most gyms, though there are other challenges. She's learned not to max out on the bench press during busy times so as to avoid the gawks of Big Tech Firm's male employees. And she's trained herself not to laugh at the LARPers. (That is, live-action role-players-think Dungeons &amp; Dragons but in real life, with costumed participants sparring.)</p><p>Her colleagues aren't always so restrained. One recalls discovering an armory of foam swords and shields. He and his buddy gave up on lifting weights and instead reenacted Braveheart. Another Surefox colleague swears he once walked in on a Big Tech Firm employee casting a magic spell on a punching bag.</p><p>\"There's a lot of prosperity here,\" Jasper says diplomatically. \"But we worked hard to get here, too. They\"-the clients-\"thrive in the digital world. We thrive in the physical world.\"</p><p>Jasper works on one of Surefox's executive-protection teams, tasked with guarding, transporting, and guiding Silicon Valley bigwigs around the clock. The EPTs are smaller than the campus teams. The more senior the executive, the more qualified those protecting them. Men and women with backgrounds in special ops, SWAT, the CIA, and the U. S. Marshals Service find second careers doing similar work for C-suite tech execs.</p><p>EPTs travel as much as the executives they protect, which is to say often. Much of their work is done in advance of an executive's trip, when EPT members go on dry runs to scout possible pickup and drop-off points, check traffic patterns, and establish various emergency exits and safe havens.</p><p>One Surefox employee, an Army Reservist, tells me about a large gathering of technology chieftains in Silicon Valley, each of whom brought their own security team. Peacocking and chest-thumping ensued, a testosterone-\u00adfueled game of one-upmanship. Eventually, egos were soothed and roles established. But tensions flared once more in the parking lot afterward, when no one could figure out which blacked-out tactical Tahoe belonged to whom.</p><p>Josh Tempco, thirty, another EPT member, has been with the company since its early days; he was part of the team that worked security at South by Southwest. He met Surefox CEO Szott years ago overseas, where they both worked as defense contractors. A former scout sniper in the Marines, Tempco possesses a keen midwestern affability and a willingness to share some of his more benign tales-a trait that stands out among these secret keepers. There was the rapper who, it seemed, was on a mission to create as much chaos in the crowd as possible. There was the time at the packed market in India when Tempco handed out cash to kids as a distraction to get his client through to the other side.</p><p>Then there was the time, a couple months ago, when Tempco joined a prominent executive from Big Tech Firm on a trip to Washington, D. C. One morning, the two went running along the National Mall. Most execs prefer silence in such situations, but this guy was different. He wanted to know about Tempco's time in the military, particularly his tour in Afghanistan. So, on a quiet autumn day in America's capital, Tempco told this very rich, very successful tech exec what war looks like from the front lines, in all its raw ugliness. The exec asked how life in the rural parts of that country contrasted with life in Kabul. Tempco told him. The exec asked about the state of women's rights there. Tempco told him. The exec asked about Afghanistan's income disparity. Tempco told him about that, too-how there's not much of a middle class, how it's too often an all-or-nothing, zero-sum game.</p><p>Tempco was touched. The executive wasn't just making small talk; his curiosity was genuine. Which is a rarity in today's America. When's the last time you asked a veteran what their service really entailed?</p><p>The moment comes for us all at one point or another_ Do you act? Many don't-that's instinct. Some do, though, which is also instinctual. What's to make of that divergence?</p><p>In early fall, Raul De La Pena, thirty-\u00adthree, was eating lunch when he heard over his radio that one of the campus buildings had \"an unexpected guest.\" He rushed over to find guards from another security company gathered out front, talking in a rush about a man threatening to jump from a balcony. De La Pena is stoic and quiet by temperament, but when he arrived on the scene, he knew he needed to take charge, and not just because of Surefox's incident-command mandate.</p><p>De La Pena ran into the building and up several flights of stairs. For his efforts, he was greeted with the sight of the man hurling furniture over the rail. The man turned to De La Pena with a vacant stare, and he stared back, doing all he could to stay calm. Time melted. De La Pena struck up a conversation as he racked his brain, trying to recall the training he'd received at the police academy for handling a suicide threat.</p><p>They talked about inconsequential things, the things that make up so much of just being alive. It was a sunny day, and De La Pena offered the man some water. The man declined. Then he stepped over the rail that bordered the balcony's edge, carefully turned around so his back faced the drop, and held on to the rail. De La Pena suggested to the man that he come back over. Instead, the man leaned back. His feet, planted on the narrow space between the rail and the ledge, and his hands, clutching the rail, were all that prevented him from falling.</p><p>De La Pena, trying to ignore all the alarms sounding from within his chest, took a deep breath in through his mouth and out through his nose. Stick to the training. He asked the man if he was hungry. Instead of answering, the man let both hands go, and his whole body arced backward. Just as De La Pena was sure it was over, the man swung his hands back and seized the rail once more.</p><p>A trace of hope entered the swirl of polluted California air.</p><p>The man kept talking. They exchanged names. De La Pena stalled for a few minutes more, making small talk, until the police arrived and took over. They asked De La Pena to stick around and help. Shortly after, the man climbed back over the rail to safe ground.</p><p>The moment comes. Do you act?</p><p/><p>On my last day in Silicon Valley, I leave Big Tech Firm early to head north, toward San Francisco, to the shiny new Chase Center, home of the Golden State Warriors. They're playing LeBron James's Los Angeles Lakers, and Surefox has an extra ticket.</p><p>But Surefox doesn't just have tickets. This season, for the first time, the company purchased an \"ultra VIP\" club suite. It's a measure of accomplishment and a status symbol, a way to reward employees and a good place to entertain clients.</p><p>In Big Tech Firm's enormous parking lot, I search in vain for my rental-a chrome, eco-friendly car in a sea of chrome, eco-friendly cars. Then I spot it-not my rental but something else. Something bizarre and exceptionally rare in this land of granola and solar panels. I walk to it like it's an exotic animal.</p><p>It's a large black pickup truck. A Nissan Titan Pro-4X, to be exact, with Oklahoma plates and an extended bed with enough dents to prove it actually gets used to transport heavy equipment. The cab's rear window is plastered with decals. support your local gunmen, reads one. modern day gunslingers, reads another. A third, affixed to the other end of the window, reads, sua sponte. Latin for \"of their own accord.\" The motto of the 75th Ranger Regiment. Strange place to find a Ranger, I think. COIN really does take people all over the world.</p><p>Surefox's stadium suite lives up to the hype. There's catered food, beer and wine, and a silver-haired attendant dressed to the nines. At one point, I step back to take in the scene_ Surefox employees, combat veterans all, laughing and joking in the open bowl seats up front. A couple have brought their significant others, who laugh along at what are likely the old war stories they've heard countless times. At a table in the center, two members of an executive-protection team chat up a potential new client over drinks. And in the rear of the room, Sweigart leans against a pillar, his arms crossed, watching over it all. I imagine he's mulling over how far Surefox has come, and how far it might go-thoughts of revenue and scale, of the sort that consume the techno-utopians, too. The company has brought a touch of military culture to Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley may be returning the favor.</p><p>Down on the court, Steph Curry drills a long-range jumper. The crowd cheers, and the Surefox employees in the front seats exchange high fives with middle-aged white men one suite over.

Year to date, the index has gained 14 per cent.</p><p>Meanwhile, it's still early days in Canadian earnings season, with only a few members of the S&amp;P/TSX composite index having reported. On Tuesday after the close of trading, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. is scheduled to release its financial results.</p><p>Over all, companies in the S&amp;P/TSX composite index are forecast to post third-quarter earnings growth of 10.7 per cent, with energy, financials, and utilities sectors shaping up for double-digit growth from the prior year.</p><p>A key sector to watch in Canada Tuesday will be the marijuana industry. Late Monday, the Canadian Securities Administrators set out \"specific disclosure expectations\" for marijuana industry firms with investments in the U.S., offering much-anticipated clarity for companies that operate on both sides of the border.</p><p>The umbrella organization for Canada's provincial and territorial securities regulators said that cannabis companies must tell investors about certain risks when they invest south of the border - where growing and selling marijuana remains illegal under federal laws.</p><p>The cannabis industry has been operating under an unwritten rule that companies which trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange or the TSX Venture Exchange must not invest in the U.S. cannabis sector.</p><p>Also Tuesday, look for major volume in shares of Bombardier Inc.. News emerged late Monday that Bombardierhas struck an agreement to sell a majority stake in its marquee C Series airliner program to Europe's Airbus.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/inside-the-market/these-stocks-are-set-to-see-action-tuesday/article36609386/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/inside-the-market/these-stocks-are-set-to-see-action-tuesday/article36609386/</url> The viewing of this article is only available to Globe Unlimited subscribers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20171016escenic_36609386</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PR8-BMB1-JCS0-V168-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"540\"/><timeReceived>5:28 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

They often make arguments from a monopolistic standpoint, that Big Tech companies have grown so large as to constitute public forums and, therefore, users have a constitutional right to access platforms free from viewpoint discrimination.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To an extent, they are right. A few social media companies have captured the lion\u2019s share of the marketplace, and online influence is almost entirely dependent on access to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. Big Tech critics argue that platform access is a civil right to the extent a user doesn\u2019t engage in unlawful or unprotected speech. If denied access, they think a user ought to be able to obtain an injunction from a court and perhaps be awarded statutory damages.</p><p>The merits of this legal argument aside, I\u2019d like to offer another approach that doesn\u2019t require making a tenuous and debateable First Amendment claim. </p><p>But first, we have to acknowledge that the economic gains from the relationship between social media companies and users is pretty one-sided.</p><p>On the one hand, users have the benefit of free services which allow them to post photos, videos, and thoughts for their friends, family, and other followers. In rare cases, users can gain fame and wealth from large followings. Brands and companies also receive the benefit of free (in most cases) advertising on platforms.</p><p>Yet on the other hand, social media giants profit from users, both from advertising dollars as well as the acquisition and sale of personal information. This means social media companies profit off individual users at a rate severely disproportionate to any benefit users derive. It\u2019s clear, for instance, that aggregating data on millennials is more lucrative for companies than it is beneficial for millennials to be able to post online.</p><p>However, social media services are free, and individuals agree to companies\u2019 terms of use. So, theoretically, we know what we are agreeing to with this inequity.</p><p>But what about when a conservative\u2019s speech on social media is limited, censored, or entirely banned? Social media companies already possess all the data from the user, as well as the information from the engagement of other users with the banned or censored user\u2019s content. </p><p>It\u2019s unlikely social media companies would be unable to eliminate the information they gained from such a user after the fact. This means that long after the contractual relationship between said user and social media companies has ended, these giants still profit off a user who has been banned or otherwise censored.</p><p>There are numerous principles of law that could provide standing for an individual in such a situation to sue a social media company for platform access, or at least enjoin a social media company from profiting off a user after censorship. </p><p>First, states could allow standing for ill-gotten gains from a user\u2019s data after being banned. If a user\u2019s data was sold after being banned or if discussion of a banned user drove traffic that led to a social media giant profiting, that ought to be considered an illegal gain since the contractual benefit a user possessed by access has been terminated. </p><p>Second, from a privacy standpoint, states could enact legislation that requires social media companies to essentially buy a user out if censored or banned in order to forfeit privacy. There is no evidence to indicate social media companies purge all information on deplatformed users. </p><p>And, since they don\u2019t, a banned user should be compensated.</p><p>Social media access is necessary for social relevance. If social media companies choose to ban or censor posts that aren\u2019t unlawful, they ought to be forced to compensate users for gains received after the user no longer enjoys the benefit of such a service. Balancing the economic outcomes of users and social media companies will increase openness and encourage more speech while diminishing privacy abuses.</p><p>Tyler Grant is an attorney and freelance writer.

One shocking video showed a man punching and stamping on a screaming toddler. Moderators marked the video 'disturbing', meaning users must click to view it but it could remain online. It was then used in training as an example of acceptable content.</p><p>One moderator filmed said: 'If you start censoring too much then people stop using the platform. It's all about money at the end of the day.' The reporter also filmed moderators saying that disturbing videos showing a schoolgirl beating up another girl could be allowed on Facebook because they were posted with captions condemning the violence. The girls are clearly identified and it had been shared more than a thousand times.</p><p>According to the moderators and trainers this is to help 'raise awareness' about violence among teenagers. A moderator is heard saying: 'We always mark as \"disturbing\" child abuse. We never delete it.' Worryingly, the Dispatches programme last night also showed that while no child under the age of 13 is meant to have a Facebook account, CPL staff ignore underage children posting pictures or videos of themselves. 'We have to have an admission that the person is underage. If not, we just like pretend that we are blind and we don't know what underage looks like,' a moderator tells the undercover reporter.</p><p>Facebook has confirmed that its contractors 'do not proactively put a hold on accounts whom they suspect may be under 13', but will do so if it receives a report about it that it believes is accurate.</p><p>In one training session filmed by Channel 4, the group is shown a cartoon of a woman drowning a young white baby in a bathtub, accompanied by the caption: 'When your daughter's first crush is a little negro boy.' The trainer says such images should be allowed remain online.</p><p>Facebook later told Dispatches the cartoon would in fact violate its policies on hate speech and it would investigate the incident. The documentary also sees moderators telling the reporter that graphic images of self-harm can remain online as long as they don't actively encourage others to do it.</p><p>Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who has since become highly critical of its impact on society, described such videos as the 'crack cocaine' of the company's product.</p><p>He said: 'It's the really extreme, really dangerous form of content that attracts the most highly engaged people on the platform.</p><p>'Facebook understood that it was desirable to have people spend more time on site. If you're going to have an advertising-based business, you need them to see the ads so you want them to spend more time on the site.' When confronted with Channel 4 footage, vice-president of Facebook's global policy solutions, Richard Allan, said: 'We have failed and I'm here to apologise for those failings and make it clear we do recognise that there are weaknesses. We should not be in this position. We are committed, wherever failings are brought to our attention, to taking them seriously, to addressing them. We are trying to make sure we do better in future.' The company said it has now conducted a review of training practices across its contractor teams 'including CPL'. It said the company has also conducted 'a review of staffing at CPL to ensure anyone who behaves in ways that are inconsistent with Facebook's values no longer works to review content on our platform'.</p><p>In the programme, Channel 4 said: 'CPL told us: \"Ensuring our trainers and employees are always fully trained and up-to-date on Facebook policy changes is critically important to us. So we are investigating this matter as a priority and taking immediate steps with Facebook. This has included conducting extensive refresher training within the last week for all our trainers.' Last night, a spokesman for CPL told the Irish Daily Mail it has carefully reviewed its processes and has 'initiated the necessary changes where appropriate'.</p><p>The spokesman said: 'We are not in a position to comment further pending the broadcast.' Advertisements for staff to work as Facebook Community Operations Analysts with CPL were recently offered for (EURO)20,000 to (EURO)25,000 a year.</p><p>Among the responsibilities listed would be to 'enforce Facebook's Terms of Use by carefully monitoring reports of abuse or explicit content on the site'.</p><p>The successful candidate would also 'review the reported content within agreed turnaround times and standards of quality'.</p><p>They would also have to 'determine whether to keep or delete the reported content based on Terms of Use'. The Channel 4 undercover reporter, along with other trainee moderators, are sworn to secrecy before they start their training. They were told: 'You are not to disclose any information. That is not to happen. 'No matter how drunk you are, make sure you don't actually reveal the information about what you are actually doing here,' they are warned. In the documentary, the reporter asks do they not think various graphic videos of violence should just be removed instead of being Marked As Disturbing (MAD) - which is one of a small number of categorisations Facebook gives to be used during the moderation process. The moderator replied: 'No, because it is kind of too much censorship then.</p><p>'If you start censoring too much, then people lose interest in the platform. It is all about making money at the end of the day.' The Taoiseach has claimed social media giants 'can be very effective' regulating themselves but called for them to do more.</p><p>He said: 'I think in fairness to the big tech companies that are active online, any time I meet them they are very in tune to this issue.

You can go for a company that has had a recent shocker but whose fortunes are about to turn or you can pick a stock that has shot up like a rocket in recent months but has yet to reach its zenith. The trouble with these options is that they are essentially a judgment about market sentiment, which is notoriously difficult to time. The third option is to plump for one of those firms that consistently grind out good but unspectacular returns and grow by making small, well-chosen and well-executed acquisitions. There are surprisingly few UK companies to which this description applies - Bunzl, Compass, Experian, Sage and Relx for example. </p><p>Traditionally this last option would be the most low risk but 2017 proved that's not always the case. Bunzl's shares took a big dive when Amazon moved its tanks on to the distribution giant's lawn - proof that even the best run companies can get steamrollered by the power of tech titans. But might there be a way to capitalise on the fact that this power is under greater scrutiny than ever before? Relx is a very well run company with a tremendous track record. Its shares are also very expensive. But as the backlash against the tech companies and the amount of information they control gathers pace, the data and analytics company could benefit, not least because its legacy as a publisher means that it is far less cavalier with the information that it gathers than the big tech giants.</p><p>Ben Marlow Shell</p><p>The end of oil is nigh. After decades of seemingly limitless growth, global demand for crude is widely expected to peak in the coming years, triggering the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Energy producers are bitterly divided on the threat. Most oilmen either deny it exists or try to play it down, but one man - Shell's Ben van Beurden - has broken ranks and is tackling the challenge with increasing gusto. That's why the company is my tip for 2018. The Dutchman has radical plans to turn one of the world's largest producers of fossil fuels into the first global power company. Indeed, the plans are already gathering pace.</p><p>In October, Shell swooped on NewMotion, one of Europe's largest electric vehicle charging providers. Then, just days before Christmas, it waded into the household energy supply market with the takeover of First Utility, the biggest challenger to the Big Six suppliers.</p><p>At the moment, spending on its so-called \"new energies\" arm is still minor compared to the rest of the sprawling Shell empire but investment is expected to double amid demand from investors for even greater urgency. As Van Beurden's green revolution starts to take shape and the company's exposure to fossil fuels dwindles further, my bet is that its share price will surge. Currently trading at close to an all-time high of \u00a324.86, analysts have a consensus 12-month target price of \u00a326.63.</p><p>Julia Bradshaw Forterra Consider building up your portfolio with Forterra this year. The company manufactures a wide variety of bricks and blocks at factories across the country, selling primarily to housebuilders, builders' merchants, contractors and specialist retailers. It's also the only maker of the original Fletton brick, a reddish-pink clay bar that's nearly 150 years old and has been used for a quarter of England's existing housing stock.</p><p>Northampton-based Forterra listed on the London Stock Exchange in April 2016. Since then its shares have soared by 63pc, yet remain modestly priced, trading on a price-to-earnings ratio of just 11. The dividend yield is not far off 4pc - far better than you'll get from any bank.</p><p>There are many reasons to believe Forterra's shares will continue to hot up. A \u00a344bn housing fund announced in last November's Budget should result in 300,000 homes being built each year within the next decade. This could be a major catalyst for a company selling building materials.</p><p>Forterra is the second largest of four major players in the world of UK brick making, which together account for 95pc of the country's brick production capacity. Its strategy to take market share through bolt-on acquisitions, product innovation and investment in infrastructure has not come at the expense of its balance sheet, with net debt continuing to fall.</p><p>Jon Yeomans Petra Diamonds It has not been a sparkling year for Petra Diamonds. The group, which operates old De Beers mines in South Africa and Tanzania, has seen its shares sink 50pc after an ambitious expansion project overran. It had a parcel of diamonds seized in Tanzania and then warned that it may breach its lending covenants after its net debt climbed towards a higher-thanexpected $613.8m. There are also signs that prices in the diamond market - notoriously opaque - are beginning to soften, down 3pc in the last quarter.</p><p>All of which could make it an excellent time to buy Petra. Its plain-talking boss Johan Dippenaar insists it will finally begin paying down debt from January, as the company's enlarged mines start to dig up higher-calibre diamonds, and investors will hold him to his word. Petra's multiyear expansion plan should drive a boost in production and revenue by 2020.</p><p>Relations with Tanzania appear to have thawed a little and the election of a more business-friendly ANC leader in South Africa has raised hopes that the country's controversial new mining charter will be redrawn, boosting optimism across the industry. Moreover Petra's lenders seem to understand and support its long-term growth plans. The stars could be aligned for a resumption of dividends next year and a re-evaluation of the stock.</p><p>Ashley Armstrong B&amp;M Bargains After two successful share tips, including last year's bet on tonic water Fever Tree, which beat even the wildest optimists by delivering a 70pc return, the pressure is on for a hat-trick. So I'm playing it a bit safer this year by plucking discount retail chain B&amp;M Bargains.</p><p>The company, which is listed as B&amp;M European Value Retail, is one of the safest bets within the retail sector. I expect B&amp;M Bargains to continue its growth streak and hope that it can more than match this year's 50pc share gains.</p><p>Firstly, the business is playing in the sweet spot of discount retail, which will become even more dominant in 2018 as household budgets face further pressure from inflation and slowing wage growth. We're already seeing middle-class shoppers mix their baskets between B&amp;M and the traditional grocers.</p><p>Secondly, B&amp;M is playing the discount game better than its rivals such as Poundworld, Poundstretcher and other single-priced chains who don't have the flexibility to increase prices despite rising cost pressures from a weaker pound. B&amp;M will also be able to make the most of the misfortunes that have afflicted Poundland owner, South Africa's Steinhoff. It is widely expected that Poundland will either find itself being put on the block in a fire sale to raise cash for Steinhoff, or have its purse strings tightened on its own investment plans. Both scenarios will play into the hands of B&amp;M, which, in the meantime, is expected to plough on with its expansion in Germany and the south east of this country. It's also likely to grow sales by around 12pc through its surprise takeover of Northern cut-price convenience chain Heron Foods. Aside from online fashion players, I wager B&amp;M will be one of the few retailers to grow earnings in 2018.</p><p>Bradley Gerrard Wizz Airlines made the headlines for all the wrong reasons in 2017 with several failures and Ryanair's pilot rostering travails leading to a swathe of winter flight cancellations.</p><p>But an airline could still help lift your portfolio. Wizz Air's shares almost doubled in 2017 in spite of - and because of - the chaos around it, and there are signs upward momentum remains. The low-cost carrier rapidly expanded its presence at Luton airport to become the second biggest airline there, acquiring take-off and landing slots left vacant by the collapsed Monarch Airlines. It made the airport its first UK base and will move from just one plane there to seven by the summer.</p><p>Wizz is also more exposed to faster growing economies in Eastern and Central Europe, regions that don't have a large contingent of legacy airlines to stifle its growth ambitions. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say valuation metrics suggest the shares are close to the level Ryanair traded at in 2004/2005 when the Irish carrier was a similar size and was \"about to embark on four years of 20pc per year expansion\".</p><p>Wizz's management has also been proactive in regards to Brexit, applying for a UK operating licence that could provide some protection in the event of a disastrous EU divorce.</p><p>The company has also placed an order for 146 Airbus A320 Neos (taking it to a total of 282 outstanding orders) thanks to its (EURO)1bn free cash pile. Owning more planes should over time reduce lease costs. Wizz upped its full-year profit guidance in November and there is potential for the carrier to surprise on the upside again in future years.</p><p>Lucy Burton St James's Place While shares in FTSE 100 wealth manager St James's Place (SJP) tumbled after chief executive David Bellamy announced his exit earlier this year, there's plenty to suggest the advice giant's future will be bright.</p><p>The need for advice among the super-rich is increasing, for a start. People are living longer, getting richer, and the financial landscape is getting more complicated with savers turning to wealth managers for advice on pension reforms. There is also plenty of scope for SJP to tap into the rising number of millionaires in Asia, with data from the latest World Ultra Wealth report showing a significant rise in the number of people with a net worth of at least $30m coming from Asia and North America. With over 550,000 clients, analysts say the \u00a385bn firm is well-positioned to take advantage of these potential growth areas and diversify overseas.</p><p>\"Change of CEO in January is not a positive nor a negative as the management team has been stable for many, many years,\" said one City analyst, adding that the group is growing at a rapid rate and is expected to continue doing so. In the first half of this year, for example, it announced a dividend that was higher than analysts expected while its profits rose almost 40pc.</p><p>Tim Wallace Begbies Traynor can feel like a miserable company to back - squeamish investors might fear that buying shares in an insolvency specialist sounds a lot like betting against Britain. Cynics might even say its supporters are hoping for firms to fail. But it could make sense as a way to hedge your portfolio this year.</p><p>If the economy follows the forecasts and does indeed slow down in 2018 then there may be rich pickings for a corporate turnaround business.</p><p>Alternatively, if growth keeps picking up and the Bank of England raises interest rates then Britain's army of \"zombie firms\" - those which are only kept alive by ultra-low interest rates but have no viable long-term future - will find themselves in trouble, and need someone to wind them up.</p><p>Indeed, low rates have helped keep business insolvencies on a downward trend in recent years, but the cycle may now be moving in the opposite direction.</p><p>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the UK has as many as 100,000 such zombie firms, who could provide a valuable source of business for Begbies. That really is socially useful work, reallocating capital from unproductive companies and putting it to better use - so do not feel guilty about it.</p><p>Alan Tovey GKN It has not been the best of years for automotive and aerospace parts supplier GKN. Business has been solid but a car-crash of succession planning that saw the CEO-elect ditched after problems within the US business he ran led to write-offs, a revelation which dragged down the shares. It's time to take advantage of this weakness. Profits are likely to decline next year but the worries are largely priced in and demand for aircraft and cars - sectors in which GKN is either a market leader or top tier one player - continues to rise.</p><p>Aside from everyday business driving up the share price, there's growing talk a restructuring could deliver more value for investors, with activists taking an increasing interest in the company. Of course, GKN is regularly the subject of speculation that it will be split up along the lines of its two main businesses, a move would deliver returns for investors, but the possibility is growing more likely with its current weakened management.</p><p>Worries about what's going on in the boardroom and its lower share price also mean GKN could be a bid target. This is another frequent rumour but one that is gaining traction in some quarters, with big private equity groups who have a history in aerospace being spoken of as potential buyers.</p><p>Such vague bid hopes are rarely reason enough to buy a share. However, when a solid company such as GKN is trading at a relatively low price and the fundamentals are good, the prospect of a deal makes it worth a punt.</p><p>Iain Withers OneSavings Bank Next year could finally see major disruption in the UK banking scene. Britain's challenger banks have been snapping at the heels of the big five - RBS, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC and Santander - for some time, but their expansion could be boosted by so-called \"Open Banking\" rules coming into force next month that force large lenders to make it easier for customers to switch to rivals online in pursuit of a better deal.</p><p>However, in truth many of the listed challenger banks have inferior online services to the big five, which will likely help protect the larger players' market share. Nimble privatelyowned digital start-up banks like Monzo and Starling may stand to gain the most in the early months unless the more established challengers spruce up their services. However, underpinning the investment case for challengers is the potential for further takeovers after the acquisitions of Shawbrook and Aldermore. Virgin Money - arguably undervalued after investors took fright at its big exposure to consumer credit in 2016 - may be worth a look.</p><p>However, the pick of the bunch among the listed challengers is probably OneSavings Bank. While not big in the retail banking space - it has a savings subsidiary Kent Reliance - it has a big focus on lending to professional landlords. This looks a good bet as all the main political parties put a big emphasis on housebuilding and rolling out large scale build-to-rent projects in particular. OneSavings received a boost last month after a regulatory clampdown on so-called \"dinner party\" amateur landlords, rather than its professional end of the market. It too is tipped as a takeover target and could well be in a sweet spot as politicians' enthusiasm for bricks and mortar grows.</p><p>Rhiannon Bury Urban &amp; Civic A facet of the British economy that politicians from all sides can unite behind is the need for more affordable homes.</p><p>Developer Urban &amp; Civic could be a good bet for next year because it taps right into that need, focusing on assembling land for large-scale housing development in commuter areas where demand is high.</p><p>It has recently grown its portfolio rapidly to 29,169 plots, of which two thirds already have planning consent and the remaining are expected to receive consent by 2020.</p><p>But until now, the number of actual homes Urban &amp; Civic has produced has been limited. This is about to change. From finishing 52 homes in the 2016/17 financial year, it expects to complete 315 in the current year. In 2018/19, that number will rise to 720.</p><p>Its shares have been trading at a double-digit discount to its net asset value - the measure property companies tend to use to calculate performance - meaning another big planning decision could send confidence soaring.</p><p>Headed by Nigel Hugill, who has made a name for himself buying land for huge developments, including London's Westfield shopping centres, Urban &amp; Civic also benefits from an experienced management team. This year could be its best yet.</p><p>Tips of 2017 Fever-Tree gained 101.2pc and was our fizziest performer but BT fell short The standout performer among last year's share tips was premium drinks maker Fever-Tree, which has gained 101.2pc since the first trading day of 2017 as it continues to rack up profits. Meanwhile, mid-cap mining stock Hummingbird Resources proved to be a good bet, rising 71.3pc on the year despite a recent tumble in the gold price, and AstraZeneca was up 15.3pc on the back of a year of promising results for key clinical trials. It is perhaps mercenary to cheer a strong year for Begbies Traynor, which specialises in business recovery, but the company climbed 30.6pc as the number of insolvencies ramped up. Standard Chartered was another good bet, rising 15.1pc, even though investors have been disappointed with the pace of the business's turnaround. It was a less encouraging year for BT, which lost 26.9pc after a series of heavy blows to its finances. Merlin Entertainments, the company that runs Madame Tussauds and Alton Towers, should have benefited from an increase in UK tourism, but instead found itself facing tough trading as a series of terror attacks put visitors off. Its shares dropped 20.5pc.</p><p>Investors in Barclays have lost 12.4pc on the value of their stock since January on the back of lacklustre returns, particularly in investment banking, where revenues were down 18pc in the last quarter. Supermarket Morrisons dipped 4.7pc as it failed to maintain the momentum of 2016's turnaround. Shares in Bunzl finished 2.4pc lower after the FTSE-100 distributor of industrial packaging suffered a serious hit in November.

Instead, they often must take into account outside client data - like held-away assets.</p><p>To really switch from a product view to a client orientation, firms need to aggregate and collect more, Honikman told Financial Planning on the sidelines of the In|Vest West conference. Not just about specific products such as insurance, annuities or 401(k)s, but also non-financial factors such as family information, health and goals.</p><p>\"To undo all of those layers of industry that were built for an orthodoxy that will one day be obsolete is a huge challenge,\" he says. \"Massive organizations don't move at speed, but they're are going to increasingly need to.\"</p><p>Acquired by the financial services provider TIAA in 2016, MyVest has since launched a new technology suite to digitize advisor tasks and provide more data. For firms that create and utilize more sophisticated data, revenue can grow by 16.7%,according to researchby the consulting group Aite.</p><p>However, problems can arise from a fragmentation of client portals, reliance on vendors and the outsourcing of all digital operations, he says.</p><p>Read what Honikman has to say about the importance of client data and the potential that tech giants like Amazon or Google are eyeing a spot in wealth management.</p><p>Why is data so important?Data is part of the solution. Most of the data that's collected is around products rather than around clients. We have to start building data around clients that span all of these silos, including held-away assets and liabilities. Then you finally are in a position to start with the client. You can build reports and dynamic advice engines and start - for the first time - to operate in the best interest of the customer.</p><p>So what's the holdup?Digital technology is going to allow the industry to become more customer-centric. The orthodox legacy is very product-centric, and in part that is cemented in the fact that financial institutions have been built in very large silos around individual product lines or channels - but not the consumer's best interest. It's very important those silos get bridged if we are sincere as an industry about looking after the financial wellness of the consumer.</p><p>What are the challenges firms are facing?The biggest source of the problem is inertia. There are decades and decades of legacy. You have antiquated core processes and siloed organizational architecture being built around them - including business units, management teams and budgets.</p><p>What about competition from truly customer-centric companies?A lot of people say these big tech companies won't get into wealth management because of regulatory scrutiny - but you can borrow the regulatory infrastructure. I think Netflix and Amazon and Google are well situated. They certainly have the tech chops and have the customer relationships. They are already demonstrating the ability to form relationships to help with regulatory challenges.</p><p>What should firms watch out for?Firms can't look at the annual results when some of these results will take multiple years to play out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINPLN-00000167-860b-dfce-a377-d6dbfa2e0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINPLN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TX2-XK01-JCRW-50XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">170491</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"548\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Elsewhere, conservatives such as Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have called for greater federal regulation of online content providers such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has railed against big corporations buying back their own stock instead of investing in new plants and equipment (or wages). The Trump administration, for its part, continues to prosecute Obama-era \u201cmidnight lawsuit\u201d labor cases against Big Tech and, in general, has no problem using the regulatory state against its political enemies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is going on here? Why are conservatives suddenly so interested in using the power of the federal Leviathan to enforce our view of the common good?</p><p>In one word, the answer is \u201cfrustration.\u201d</p><p>Conservatives have spent a lifetime watching an ever-more aggressive Left march through the institutions of our civil society. Two generations ago, they took over the media, the universities, and the entertainment industry. More recently, they have taken over monopoly power in social media, human resources departments in the corporate world, and even professional sports. </p><p>As the Left has gotten control over these everyday aspects of life, they have gotten more extreme in their demands. It used to be that liberals wanted to enforce their worldview as normal or at least a version of normal. Now, the demand is that each of us must celebrate and get behind the Left\u2019s playbook. You can be fired and \u201ccanceled\u201d for not supporting a carbon tax or using the wrong pronoun in an email. </p><p>That brought us to the conservative fight earlier this year about transgender public library reading hours, which eventually transformed into calls for a federal government ban on internet pornography. </p><p>In the more mundane field of labor law, President Trump\u2019s Department of Labor continues to pursue an Obama-era series of lawsuits against tech companies such as Google and Oracle. The department's \u201cOffice of Federal Contract Compliance Programs\u201d is trying to get these companies to include more affirmative action quota hiring as a condition of getting federal contracts. There\u2019s no actual evidence that\u2019s been presented that these companies discriminate, but a leftover lawsuit from the Obama years has been utilized as a useful bludgeon against companies often hostile to conservative values.</p><p>Blatant ideological bias on the part of content companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter is what\u2019s fueling regulatory calls from Hawley and continued legal action against Google from Trump\u2019s Department of Labor.</p><p>This frustration is understandable. This frustration is merited. But this frustration is a fundamental strategic error on the part of conservatives.</p><p>Big Tech is vicious in its platform bias against us. The Left, in general, wants to shut down our churches, fire us from our jobs, close our businesses, and silence our speech. I get it. </p><p>But if there\u2019s one thing that should unite conservatives, libertarians, and other flavors of rightward persuasion, it\u2019s that the government is bad. If the government is bad in general, the federal government is really bad in particular. It\u2019s our job as conservatives to reduce the size and scope of government (especially at the top) and to build up the civil society pillars that naturally should govern: the family, the church, fraternal and charitable organizations, and the like.</p><p>The government comes in and usurps these good things. When conservatives make the government bigger and more powerful because we temporarily have some of the levers of power, we have to be aware that we have permanently enlarged the long-term reach of the state. Trump will not always control the Department of Labor, but his choice to pursue an Obama-holdover lawsuit against Big Tech will give bipartisan imprimatur to that agency role forevermore. Next time, it may be the hiring practices of Catholic Charities or the United Way. </p><p>Followers of debates on pornography, or library reading hours, or suing Big Tech content firms might notice a pattern, and it isn\u2019t the \u201cconservatives vs. libertarians\u201d dichotomy that the bigger government crowd would have you believe. In fact, online supporters of using government power to these conservative ends tend to be politically inexperienced (and frankly, naive) academic types. Those of us opposed to government action (though in no way supportive of pornography or left-wing thought policing) tend to be political professionals who have spent a lifetime actually working in this field, and who realize the live fire these writers and academics are playing with.</p><p>Conservatives should get back to the business of making the government smaller and everything else bigger.</p><p>Ryan Ellis (@RyanLEllis) is president of the Center for a Free Economy.</p><p>Photo Caption:Drag Queen</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2325249025</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR8-WSG1-DY0W-421H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

It's a statement many politicians have made over the years, and it's the back end of a type of bribe. The politician knows that those jobs can go away if he or she doesn't perform meritorious service on behalf of the corporation. </p><p>That's the implied threat, and it usually works to turn members of Congress into full-on lobbyists.Big Tech is taking a run at this. The House Judiciary Committee has been investigating Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google for the last 7 months. The chair of the House Judiciary Committee is Jerry Nadler. His district includes a large portion of the West Side of Manhattan. So, and you're not going to believe this, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google have been placing large offices in the West Side of Manhattan. It's expected that there will be 20,000 employees of the Big Four tech firms on the West Side by 2022.My story about this is here[1]. Nadler isn't particularly corruptible, and there's no reason to believe he's about to call off the investigation. But what's important here is that Big Tech is pulling out this trick. They're scared that they can't control the investigation through their normal means - lobbying, defining the issue through academics on the payroll, etc. So they're moving to the 'jobs in the district' gambit. Pretty sneaky, sis. (Read the story here[2]) AND ANOTHER THING News out of Iran intimates that someone shot down[3] the Boeing jet bound for Ukraine, meaning there wasn't mechanical failure on the 737. Boeing already has enough to deal with. Text messages released Thursday show employees' disregard for pretty much everyone involved with making the 737 Max, which was 'designed by clowns and supervised by monkeys,' per the quote. More troubling for Boeing are the chats describing how to deceive regulators and conceal problems with the Max from the FAA. During the financial crisis, the perfidy of the banks was almost not real to the media until they had internal chats of Wall Street bros mocking their clients and regulators. Boeing has now hit that threshold. It was already bad for the firm, and now it's worse.

Local 19 rally outside Intel in Santa Clara in support of cafeteria workers. (Tri Nguyen / Working Partnerships USA) Tech firms have flooded Silicon Valley with speculative capital, but labor is pouring sweat equity into the Bay. </p><p>Recent labor victories in Big Tech's heartland show that front-line workers of the 'innovation' sector's lunch lines and bus lines still hold leverage in keeping the corporations humming. Ad Policy[1] Cafeteria workers are relishing a win at Intel's Santa Clara headquarters\u00a0with a\u00a031-12 vote[2] to join UNITE HERE Local 19. During the months-long organizing drive, the union\u00a0filed a federal complaint alleging that Intel's dining contractor, Eurest, suppressed campaign activities, including cracking down on workers wearing pro-union buttons. Eurest was also accused of violating state regulations by restricting workers' bathroom breaks, though it has agreed to recognize the union. Toxic labor relations at Intel's cafeteria predated Eurest's management; in 2014, a previous contractor had scrapped a workforce\u2014a move that prompted the union to launch a fresh organizing campaign with the new workers, who earn[3] about a quarter of the typical hourly wage of a local software developer. According to organizer Joyce Chen, in the lead-up to the vote, 'Eurest offered many workers a 20 percent raise and workers won free individual health insurance. We hope to negotiate an initial contract with Eurest in the coming months to build from there.' (Intel claimed[4] in May it was looking to resolve the dispute with the parent company, Compass, and holds its vendors to the voluntary standards established in the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition Code of Conduct, which includes guaranteed freedom of association[5]). The Teamsters got a boost with a card-check vote[6] at Bauer's Intelligent Transportation, which operates commuter shuttles for mega-brands like Cisco, Zynga, and Intuit. Though the Teamsters have organized[7] other tech contract drivers, the Bauer's battle was especially rough, culminating in a mandate for 'labor harmony' issued by San Francisco's Municipal Transportation Authority. The unique labor peace requirement, backed[8] by the City Council, was partially spurred by demonstrations against Bauer's at (where else?) muni-bus stops.Drivers accused[9] Bauer's of aggressive union busting, including establishing a 'company union' to preempt the formation of a real union. One driver told Mother Jones that workers had been coerced to join the management-controlled organization\u00a0by a supervisor who 'pretty much just pushed me a blank sheet of paper and said, 'Here, sign this and I will see if I can get you better benefits.'' But drivers resisted the pressure tactics, eventually leading the city to punish Bauer's, which boasts ultra-efficient 'green' fleets with luxurious WiFi-equipped interiors, by threatening to deny[10] an operating permit because of both poor performance and failure to resolve the labor dispute. The sanction, apparently an unprecedented local regulation on tech bus operators, ostensibly aimed to avoid 'disruption of the orderly operation' of bus services, but with a clear pro-worker bent. To the Teamsters, the measure made sense[11] logistically and ethically, given the perils of angry labor protests combined with road rage on crowded streets. 'We were disrupting Bauer's buses, and it doesn't take very long during rush-hour traffic in San Francisco to back up traffic,' says Doug Bloch of Teamsters Joint Council 7. 'The MTA's interest was not really to wade into our labor relations, but to make sure that if there are labor disputes with these private shuttle bus companiesthat doesn't interfere with the regular buses that hundreds of thousands of people ride every day.' But beyond the Loop, can labor-community alliances really counterbalance the power of Big Tech? With 34,000 commuters daily, Silicon shuttles amount to one of the region's largest private transit systems. Many community advocates resent what they see as the tech sector's privatization of local transit, which is fundamentally neither[12] fair nor environmentally sustainable. Bloch acknowledges that while private buses help by reducing reliance on individual cars, mass transit solutions are lacking: 'we don't have public buses, we don't have trains, we don't have light rail, we don't have other alternatives for people, and every rider we put in a Google bus is somebody who's not putting money into a fare box.' GET A DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR JUST $9.50! Subscribe[13]Still, while the Teamsters generally advocate expanded public investment in mass transit, Bloch argues[14] labor can drive socially responsible transportation infrastructure development, by serving as 'the fallback for when work get privatized.' For example, thanks to the unionization of relatively high-paid tech shuttle drivers, who can earn[15] about $30 an hour, local paratransit drivers, whom the union also represents, have been offered raises\u00a0of over 40 percent in the forthcoming contract. 'My bad joke has been rising road lifts all buses,' Bloch says. As unionization spreads across public and private transit, 'it has changed the market for bus drivers in the Bay Area, and raised the standard of living, which is what we're supposed to do as a union.'LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSISDerecka Behrens, executive director of the community-labor coalition Silicon Valley Rising[16], says that in segregated cities like San Francisco, 'The Google bus phenomenon became an important and powerful symbol of inequality.' Amid rising gentrification and economic segregation[17], resentment boils among struggling Black and Latino workers as they watch corporate caravans 'pulling up to public transit stops, and mostly white, well-educated workers were getting on them, while other folks were waiting for the other bus.' As shuttle drivers started to organize, however, 'we started to put the face of those shuttle bus drivers , who were living in their cars and not earning enough to survive, and by the way, commuting hours themselves into San Francisco to get to their jobbecause they can't afford to live in San Francisco.' The challenge is orchestrating a broad-based response[18] to what Mehrens calls San Francisco's 'mixed consciousness' toward the tech industry's coveted yet resented wealth. In an effort to\u00a0leverage the local community's power to get Big Tech's wealth to trickle down,\u00a0activists\u00a0frame bus-stop class wars and cafeteria labor fights as critical interfaces between divided workforces. But as workers and unions seek to build power in Silicon Valley, Behrens adds, 'in order to solve these big problems with inequalitywe can't do it without this sector and employers at the table, unionizing, and workers rising up\u2014coming together collectively.' Unions, communities, and technology may not be uniting in a seamless mesh yet, but cross-sector organizing can link workers under a democratic agenda to diffuse Big Tech's power across the urban grid.

This is a fact. But the unintended consequences are daunting.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dimitar Lilkov is a Research Officer at the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ranting about the pitfalls of Big Tech is nothing new, but it is staggering how little has actually been implemented on the policy front. Sadly, the general public is either severely divided between extreme opinions or does not care at all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, what makes us locked in such a polarized debate and what can be done?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy is dead</emphasis></p><p>Eight years ago Mark Zuckerberg announced that privacy is no longer a 'social norm'.\u00a0 However, the Social (Media) Contract everyone virtually signs never envisaged appropriate safeguard of personal data by default. Privacy was never alive in the first place.</p><p>Remember that Facebook pioneered an online referendum in 2011 where it asked its users to vote whether the company can demand more personal data? Above 90% of the ones who voted were against the new data policy but their numbers were far from the set threshold. Since then the company has been the final arbiter when it comes to making data policy changes. Vox Facebook, Vox Dei.</p><p>Consent should not be a dead concept. Policymakers should pressure Big Tech to stop using coercive or manipulative tactics when requiring user consent to hoard personal data. Forcing my agreement to provide Facebook with my physical features for its facial recognition software by cheap manipulation should be considered a direct offence.</p><p>Privacy is not dead. It is under construction. Even with all of its bruises regulation such as the EU's updated effort on data protection firmly puts its foot in the door. Unsurprisingly, the first lodged claims under GDPR were for coercively extracting user consent by misleading practices and breaking the new rules.</p><p>These rules should serve as a bedrock.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Politicians do not understand technology</emphasis></p><p>Sure, many politicians don't understand 3rd party APIs or blockchain. But it is very convenient to pass this message to a wider public in order to discredit the call for tighter regulation.</p><p>What politicians do understand is that undecided voters can be swayed by manipulated search engine results or that psychological targeting can cause digital mass persuasion. The digital domain still evades the electoral laws of almost every Western country and online platforms manage to dodge official oversight which every print, radio or TV media has to abide by.</p><p>Let's not forget that it is relatively easy to set up fake grassroots campaigns from abroad which feed dirty dollars and rubles for promotion and visibility.</p><p>National electoral legislation should be amended to allow for utmost scrutiny of online ads during election campaigns. Politicians may not fully understand tech but they should understand if the state has to assert its authority when democratic processes are under threat and national security is tampered from abroad.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Break-up Google and Nationalise Facebook!</emphasis></p><p>Recently, there have been demands for breaking up of Big Tech companies, the nationalisation of their data by the state or stripping away some of their shares.\u00a0 I for one, feel uneasy about the thought of the state managing such an extensive amount of personal data.</p><p>Nor would I like to see the forceful break-up of a technological leader which drives innovation and addresses societal challenges worldwide.</p><p>Again we are caught up by extremes - the public policy choice should not be between Yanis Varoufakis and Wall Street. These companies have to be prevented from evading or paying minuscule taxes, regardless of the transboundary nature of their services. Apple brings high-end products and jobs for Europeans but does this justify less than 1% corporate tax on its profit in Europe?</p><p>The FTC in the US and the European Commission's Competition Directorate should enjoy boosted budgets and political independence to prevent anti-competitive behaviour or market-distorting practices.</p><p>The EU might even explore options for pooling resources and research potential in order to pioneer a European body which has secure access to Big Tech algorithm design to ensure independent oversight and democratic accountability. The fact that such measures might be technically difficult does not mean that they should be off the table.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Way Forward</emphasis></p><p>The polarisation of the pivotal debate on Big Tech goes against society's interest. We all lose from the status quo. Ultimately, the EU and US should adopt a similar model of Big Tech Legislation 2.0. that clearly sets a benchmark. This upgraded model may have to directly compete with Russian or Chinese domestic policies when it comes to cooperation with national tech champions, data policy and individual privacy.</p><p>Western institutions must adapt and develop immunity in a rapidly changing global environment. An ambitious effort spearheaded by the European Union should be followed by the US even if this can be seen as difficult in the current Trump administration.</p><p>The current calls for adopting GDPR-type legislation across the Atlantic should be welcomed and followed through. Washington must break away from its decade-long regulatory stance of effectively sitting on its hands.</p><p>A Transatlantic Digital Pact is much needed for the upcoming unpredictable decade.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1292846</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVF-HR21-DYXB-V2XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 29, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It was not long ago that Mark Zuckerberg and his peers were feted as wizards of innovation. Today, they are pummelled from all sides. Personal fortunes worth billions of dollars help, but do they make up for daily accusations of tainting democracy and ruining a generation of minds they have faced in the last year?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech companies were criticised before then, but they would be bolder about challenging it. Facebook's introduction of the news feed in 2006 was met with a user backlash but the company proceeded anyway. Google's psychological tests, which analysed how minute alterations to the colour of text affected users' propensity to click links, were seen as innovative uses of data, not manipulations. Acquisitions of Instagram, YouTube and Periscope generated little competition scrutiny, and often excitement.</p><p>Bold, ambitious mission statements were common. Tech companies talked about making themselves as vital as utilities: becoming the portal to the world's information, or the new town square. There seemed to be bold opportunities for them to conquer finance, transport and media. Start-ups happily professed to be the Uber of their particular field.</p><p>It is impossible to miss that things have changed. While these companies may still be growing rapidly, and remain, on balance, popular among the majority of people, excitement and awe has been replaced by allegations of monopoly power, Facebook poisoning minds and YouTube aiding terrorism.</p><p>It is clear that Silicon Valley failed to spot this swell early enough, which allowed it to build. Zuckerberg's dismissal of fake news as a problem, and Google's defence that YouTube was merely a \"platform\" did not cut the mustard.</p><p>Now they have reversed course. Last week, after a year in which advertisers have fled YouTube, for fear of appearing in front of unsavoury or illegal videos, the site pressed the nuclear button. YouTube announced that it would not longer allow advertising on channels that fail to amass 4,000 hours of viewing in a year, a bar that cuts off thousands of smaller users. Higherearning channels in the company's \"preferred\" programme, which lets them generate better advertising rates, will be manually reviewed, making a mockery of the company's claims that artificial intelligence algorithms are the best way to police the site.</p><p>Facebook is doing its best to cut ties with the news industry that it once courted. It announced earlier this month that it would relegate publishers in the Facebook news feed in favour of friends and family. Over the weekend Zuckerberg unveiled a new policy of giving publishers \"trust ratings\" to determine their prominence. Paranoid about appearing to look like the arbiter of truth, it says trust rankings will be determined by surveying users.</p><p>Leaving aside the clear problems with this approach - that the same partisan audiences that allowed fake news to spread will take the opportunity to punish outlets they disagree with - Facebook's move demonstrates a broader trend. Faced with unprecedented criticism, threats of regulation and wider concern over their impact on society, the internet giants are retreating from their once lofty ambitions.</p><p>Zuckerberg once wanted Facebook to be the world's \"personalised newspaper\". YouTube was built on the idea that indie filmmakers could supplement their income with adverts. The steps they have taken this month mean neither can be true today. Rather than tackling their problems, as most critics of internet giants have called for, in some cases these companies are eliminating them entirely. Facebook and Google are realising there are areas they do not want to dominate.</p><p>One internet company executive I spoke to last week said the investment his company was making in monitoring and removing offensive content meant inevitable cuts in other areas. The result, he said, would not only be fewer sales staff, but fewer of the innovative new features and projects his company had planned.</p><p>This is not to say that these companies continue to grow rapidly. The shift towards digital advertising, emerging markets coming online and their increasing expertise in targeting will take care of that.</p><p>But perhaps their all-conquering attitudes are fading. They know, for instance, that acquisitions will become more difficult as fears about their monopoly statuses mount. Facebook in particular has a long history of buying start-ups that pose a potential threat. Past deals such as the company's $19bn (\u00a314bn) takeover of WhatsApp four years ago would be a much trickier affair these days. Google antitrust cases in Europe may curb its influence. Other grand projects, such as plans to offer free internet to the world, seem to have gone quiet recently.</p><p>This has knock-on effects for much of the tech world. Twitter's shares hit a two year high after Facebook unveiled its news feed changes this month. Start-ups who were once told they have no chance of competing in social networking or digital media may spy an opening. Just as likely is that other tech giants seek to capitalise - Amazon being the most plausible candidate. For years the belief about big tech has been that its titans will continue to expand, extending tentacles into more of society and the economy. Recent events suggest Silicon Valley is learning there are limits to its capacity to reshape the world in its image.</p><p>Facebook is doing its best to cut ties with the news industry it once courted</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-133801623</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RG2-RTC1-JBVM-Y38V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 22, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

News and information would no longer be mediated by newspaper editors, television producers and other gatekeepers. Instead, social media would allow direct access to individual voices in a feed custom-built by the user. It was a new frontier for both unregulated free expression and individual control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In practice, the actual experience of social media, for many users, is not one of control but of virtual bombardment, in which a flood of ideas and opinions that are irritating, dull and often outright offensive often seem impossible to avoid. Yes, you can block, mute, unfollow, log off and even delete your account. But the prevalence of social media \u2014 the way in which it has become the mortar of everyday life, filling in the cracks of our time \u2014 has a way of enforcing a sense that there is no way to truly escape from its reach. The world of social media increasingly feels as if it is simply the world.</p><p>That world is one in which speech is often perceived not as an individual right, but as a public act, in which words and ideas are not your own, but a contribution to the collective. Social media has, in effect, socialized speech.</p><p>So it\u2019s no surprise that the rise of social media has coincided with calls for restrictions on speech, both online and off, from narrow campaigns to strip Steve Bannon of speaking gigs or get sites to evict alt-right trolls and provocateurs like Alex Jones \u2014 who was <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/06/technology/twitter-suspends-alex-jones-infowars/index.html\">banned permanently</url> last week by Twitter \u2014\u00a0and Steve Bannon to more broad-based pushes to regulate big tech platforms at the federal level. The omnipresence of social media has increased demand for limitations on speech.</p><p>The feeling of inescapability is amplified by both our politics and our traditional media. Walk into any modern newsroom and you\u2019ll see screen after screen open to Twitter and Facebook. Log onto Twitter on any given weeknight and you can see exactly what journalists are doing with their spare time. Twitter has become an always-on, all-encompassing chat room for political reporters and commentators and the people who follow the news most obsessively.</p><p>The sense that social media and the rest of reality have converged is further intensified by President Trump, who spends a lot of time tweeting, which then, of course, causes a feedback loop with the media, which reports on and discusses his tweets, which sometimes lead to additional mini-controversies of their own, and so on and so forth, meaning that a significant fraction of mainstream political journalism consists of reporting and commentary about what people are saying online. Turn on cable news at any given hour of the day, and the odds are reasonably high that you\u2019ll encounter a summary of or argument about what\u2019s happening on social media. It\u2019s Twitter all the way down.</p><p>Even for those who aren\u2019t news junkies, the connective power of social media, combined with its habit-forming drips of information and positive reinforcement \u2014 all those likes and favorites \u2014 can be difficult to avoid entirely, unless you want to become a digital hermit. Yet as anyone who has spent time on social media knows, even feeds built to serve up nothing but pictures of puppies and babies can easily devolve into ugly political arguments.</p><p>Social media companies appear to be aware of their growing hold on America\u2019s social and political consciousness, and the likely consequences. \u201cPeople do see us as a digital public square,\u201d Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/technology/lawmakers-facebook-twitter-foreign-influence-hearing.html\">told</url> members of Congress, \u201cand that comes with certain expectations.\u201d Speaking to senators on the same day, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, seemed to accept that some form of federal oversight was inevitable, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of whether regulation, we think it\u2019s a question of the right regulation.\u201d</p><p>The embrace of regulation is no doubt strategic \u2014 an effort to ensure that Facebook can weather any new rules better than potential competitors. Yet even these social media behemoths now appear to view themselves as something like public utilities. The Trump administration, in turn, seems to share that view: Last week, the Justice Department proposed talks with state attorneys general about the practices of large tech platforms.</p><p>Given the unanticipated reach and influence of these companies, this view is perhaps understandable. But it is mistaken and even dangerous, because at its core it is a view that speech \u2014 the primary use for these platforms \u2014 is not an individual right, but a collective good that should be subject to political control.</p><p>Combating this perception will entail a return to the original, unmet promise of social media \u2014 of a tailored experience that serves up what you want, rather than what you don\u2019t. Blocking, muting, unfollowing and even unplugging should be celebrated. Social media should work for you, not against you. More generally, it will require reinforcing, whenever possible, the notion that it\u2019s not only speech that is an individual right and responsibility \u2014 so is listening.</p><p>I recognize just how difficult this can be. I\u2019ve spent the better part of my adult professional life online, half-distracted by newsfeeds and endless scrolling updates. In the last year, I\u2019ve dropped off Facebook, taken time away from Twitter, and repeatedly removed (and restored) various social apps from my phone. Even still, I regularly spend entire evenings online, occasionally when I have no reason to do so, and I often fight the urge to cycle through a suite of social media apps on my phone when I\u2019m in between \u2014 or in the middle of \u2014 tasks. I sometimes worry that Twitter has become a substitute for thought.</p><p>Yet social media has also connected me with friends and followers, provided a platform for my work, and provided me access to a wealth of ideas and perspectives that I would never have encountered otherwise. (Sometimes the jokes are pretty good too.) It\u2019s a tool, and like all tools, it must be used with thought and care. </p><p>Yes, social media can be abused. Harassment is never acceptable, and if foreign governments are attempting to influence our politics, we should be aware. Social media corporations, as private entities, have the right to ban anyone, for any or no reason.</p><p>But all of us, as citizens and individuals and residents of the online world, have a responsibility to manage our own social media consumption, to resist letting it take over their our thoughts, our lives, our culture, and our politics. Social media is only the real world if we let it be.</p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Mrs/Moment, via Getty Images FOR THE NEW YORK

Not this time. The 2010s can be comprehensively understood through a single artefact \u2014 the smartphone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In August 2008, Apple launched the iPhone 3G in India, the Android smartphone debuted later that year, and within a few years, more affordable models of touchscreen phones and tablets flooded India.Till then the cellphone was just to make calls and send texts. It is only after we started tapping and swiping on these glowing slabs of glass and metal that the internet finally went mobile. The smartphone outpaced the TV as the consumer technology with the fastest adoption rate, says MIT's Technology Review.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The phone became a digital Swiss army knife, loaded with apps. It cannibalised other physical things like cameras and diaries and music players, and nestled in our palms. We filled our phones with photos, music, books and entertainment. We browse and buy our stuff through them. We swipe our phones for romantic connections, we summon and see our loved ones when we want, wherever they are. They guide us on the roads, robot voices telling us where to turn. We spend all our time with our phones, checking them incessantly, holding them close. They mediate our relationships, they are an extension of our minds.</p><p>Now, the entire planet is a dense mesh with billions of connected devices. When you eat a meal and post it on Instagram, it exists in the here-and-now, but also as an image in the minds of others. As Laurence Scott said, this gives a wonderful, weird fourth dimension to our world, one of constant connection and ambient awareness. In this country, where most people couldn't afford cameras and video players the mobile has brought other kinds of mobility \u2014 a teen can now message her boyfriend, a migrant worker can stay in touch with her family, a non-literate person can learn from a video, a Hindi-speaking kid hums an American pop song.</p><p>But while social media has connected us, it has also fomented conspiracy theories, fake news, misinformation campaigns and bots, as well as phenomenally boosted the capacity to protest. Governments, including our own, now use internet blackouts to repress discontent. It has shaped the behaviour of governments and political parties, who have to constantly focus on spin and messaging.</p><p>As citizens, there is no border between private and public life \u2014 we are caught up in news and arguments through WhatsApp and news feeds. And because anger and fear drive more 'viral' content, ideological extremes resonate more than moderation or deliberation. Reality itself has cracked, as we are sealed in our bubbles of selective information rather than sharing a consensus narrative.</p><p>Meanwhile, the economic disruption brought by the mobile internet is in our faces, and also hard to quantify. Like electricity, railroads and cars, technology has brought creative destruction and new arrangements in business. Traditional intermediary models are withering, from publishers to record companies, but hugely successful companies have emerged, and the platform economy has also hooked people to work opportunities.</p><p>There are some downsides to this model, as technology displaces human labour. Kodak, the photo company which also invented the digital camera, and shut down in 2012, once employed 140,000 people. Instagram, when it was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars, employed 13 people. In the platform economy, we, the users, supply content and make a few tech companies immensely valuable, but they only require a few people to be employed. Unlike the technological breakthroughs of the past, digital innovations are not creating mass prosperity, but they enormously profit a few. The old contracts between work, value and income will have to be rewritten in the near future.</p><p>Everything our smartphones have touched, they have changed. It is not just the external and social world, but also our cognition, our interiority, for better and for worse. We can maintain a shallow connection with more people now. Social media also makes us feel like we are on stage, thinking of the impression we make. When we check our phones every few minutes, or skitter through disjointed feeds online, we struggle with concentration and deep thought. But we also think on the fly, learn collaboratively. We are making content, rather than passively taking it in. Our gifs and memes call up a free-form creativity. Our language has shifted to a casual, oral style.</p><p>Of course, the free stuff we got used to online imposes costs that we are only catching up with. It involves a surrender of our own data and control. Third parties and state agencies harvest our information. Big data and opaque algorithms combine to shape our experience in surreptitious ways, and machine intelligence is set to intensify these problems, as human bias is often baked into code. Regulating both Big Tech and state surveillance is a clear challenge the world now faces \u2014 to merely have a mobile phone is to constantly shed traces, revealing more to prying others than we know.</p><p>\u201cDekh raftar-e-inquilab, Firaq, kitni ahista aur kitni tez\u201d \u2014 the smartphone has brought breakneck transformation, but has also subtly crept up on us. New marvels have been rapidly absorbed, new anxieties are being grappled with. To look back at the decade is to realise how much it has shaped our societies and our psyches. It is no longer about euphoria or backlash \u2014 it is time to accept that we have incorporated this technology into our lives, and we have to make it work for us rather than being led headfirst by it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVT-HD01-JB3N-T4RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

As\u00ed las cosas, se han identificado potenciales preocupaciones en materia de defensa de la competencia o antimonopolio, en materia de privacidad de datos, en materia de protecci\u00f3n al consumidor, propiedad intelectual, e incluso en temas de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico como la pluralidad en el \u201cmercado de las ideas\u201d.<br/>Resulta \u00fatil considerar y comprender que existen diversos modelos de negocio de plataformas digitales, dis\u00edmiles entre s\u00ed, por lo que probablemente conclusiones particulares utilizadas para asomar soluciones generales podr\u00edan resultar contraproducentes (este constituye justamente uno de los argumentos que representantes y defensores de las empresas plataformas asoman para justificar la aplicaci\u00f3n del derecho antimonopolio, en materia estrictamente econ\u00f3mica, como la forma suficiente y eficiente de acci\u00f3n regulatoria, en la medida que la naturaleza de su procedimiento hacia conductas, caso por caso, coadyuvar\u00eda a evitar riesgos de falsos positivos que lesionan la eficiencia din\u00e1mica y la innovaci\u00f3n en estos mercados).<br/>El \u00e9xito y la aceptaci\u00f3n de numerosas plataformas en la econom\u00eda digital dependen de su modelo de negocio y de los beneficios que ofrecen a los miembros de las mismas. En espec\u00edfico, la reducci\u00f3n de costos transaccionales y de b\u00fasqueda, as\u00ed como los efectos de red propios de las plataformas implican valor para la sociedad y para los miembros de las plataformas -en todos y cada uno de sus lados, independientemente de qui\u00e9n financia a qui\u00e9n para subsidiar y/o sostener su participaci\u00f3n en el ecosistema-. La gran variedad de funcionalidades diferenciadas que cada plataforma ofrece, puede implicar ofertas de valor propias de cada plataforma y su naturaleza (m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los efectos de red), que buscan satisfacer las distintas necesidades de sus usuarios que pueden abarcar desde el desplazamiento de un punto a otro -transporte o servicios de gesti\u00f3n de transporte-, pasando por encontrar alojamiento -servicios de b\u00fasqueda y/o transacci\u00f3n de alojamiento-, una simple necesidad de b\u00fasqueda de bienes o servicios, o incluso concretar una necesidad transaccional y/o de pago, etc.<br/>Valga destacar que las plataformas como modelo de negocio no resultan nada nuevas. Vistas como empresas que operan en varios lados son tan antiguas como las tarjetas de cr\u00e9dito o incluso los centros comerciales, por no mencionar la prensa tradicional o la televisi\u00f3n de se\u00f1al abierta.<br/>Sin embargo, algo verdaderamente \u201crevolucionario\u201d de los modelos de negocio de las plataformas digitales lo constituye la gran cantidad de datos que recaban y el uso que hacen de los mismos, as\u00ed como una \u201cinteracci\u00f3n bidireccional\u201d que sucede en tiempo real. Dependiendo de su modelo de negocio, dichas plataformas pueden monetizar los datos de forma muy diferente. Unas podr\u00edan comercializar los datos a los anunciantes/productores; otras plataformas procesarlos para producir y ofrecer contenido; y otras podr\u00edan utilizar los datos para producir bienes y comercializarlos a trav\u00e9s de la propia plataforma (otras plataformas por su modelo de negocio generan ingresos directamente producto del cobro de membres\u00eda o suscripci\u00f3n, a\u00fan cuando lo verdaderamente diferenciador de las plataformas digitales lo constituye la concepci\u00f3n de los datos como \u201cforma de pago\u201d e insumos por parte de sus usuarios). En este sentido algunas empresas plataformas podr\u00edan encontrarse \u201cverticalmente\u201d integradas. Esta es una caracterizaci\u00f3n que puede crear preocupaciones en materia de competencia, si se considera que las formas de levantar datos por parte de las empresas dominantes bloquean la replicabilidad y/o portabilidad de los datos de los usuarios. Sin embargo, asimismo debe considerarse las eficiencias derivadas de econom\u00edas de alcance y sinerg\u00edas por parte de dichas plataformas integradas \u201cverticalmente\u201d. La misma l\u00f3gica aplicar\u00eda a los conglomerados que puedan significar incluir nuevos lados al mercado o simplemente nuevas plataformas que incrementan la posibilidad de levantar y acumular datos.<br/>De lo anterior se intuye la posibilidad de que las empresas maximizadoras de beneficio, primero, se acerquen a un ideal te\u00f3rico de discriminaci\u00f3n de precios de primer grado -evit\u00e1ndose la canibalizaci\u00f3n entre los distintos segmentos-; segundo, atinar en el dise\u00f1o de los productos y servicios (recortando tiempos de estudio de mercado, dise\u00f1o y pruebas, as\u00ed como riesgos de fracaso); y tercero, incluso desarrollar publicidad disuasiva.<br/>En el primer caso, las empresas podr\u00edan extraer mayor porci\u00f3n del excedente de los consumidores -lo que desde una perspectiva de equidad podr\u00eda levantar preocupaciones-. Sin embargo, las discriminaciones de precios que permiten expandir la demanda atendida -porque con mayor informaci\u00f3n disponible puede pasar de un modelo de mercado tipo pool, a uno bilateral con cada tipo de consumidor- coadyuvan a expandir el bienestar social. A\u00fan as\u00ed, dicha discriminaci\u00f3n de precios podr\u00eda encontrarse restringida por la posibilidad de arbitraje y de la competencia en el mercado.<br/>En el segundo caso, se podr\u00edan expandir los mercados y en consecuencia el bienestar social a trav\u00e9s de nuevos y mejores productos, direccionados por los gustos y preferencias reveladas a trav\u00e9s de los datos.<br/>Por su parte, en el tercer caso de la publicidad disuasiva, direccionada de una forma m\u00e1s efectiva producto de los datos recabados, la teor\u00eda econ\u00f3mica asoma potenciales efectos contrapuestos o ambiguos. Por un lado, crear fidelidad sobre ciertas marcas a trav\u00e9s de la diferenciaci\u00f3n percibida de los productos, reduce la intensidad de la competencia basada en precios; y por el otro lado, en la medida que pueda lograrse expandir el valor percibido por los consumidores y/o desplazarse hacia arriba y a la derecha la curva de demanda, se podr\u00eda estar coadyuvando a la generaci\u00f3n de mayor bienestar social.<br/>El objetivo y las estrategias corporativas tendientes de capturar el mayor porcentaje de valor de los bienes y servicios no son nuevas, pero por medio del uso de datos personales, las empresas plataformas digitales podr\u00edan ser mucho m\u00e1s eficientes en materializarlo.<br/>Otro elemento que se suele asumir en el mercado digital es que existe mucho poder de mercado por parte de las empresas plataformas, producto de una tendencia \u201cnatural\u201d de dichos mercados a concentrarse en pocos o un \u00fanico agente econ\u00f3mico, explicado por importantes efectos de red y elevados Switching Costs a los que se enfrentar\u00edan los usuarios. En este sentido, por una parte la teor\u00eda econ\u00f3mica sobre las plataformas, as\u00ed como la evidencia en los mercados muestran que muchos de \u00e9stos son Tipping Markets o mercados del tipo The-Winner-Take-All. Sin embargo, por otra parte la teor\u00eda econ\u00f3mica no sugiere un\u00edvocamente dicha posibilidad de Tipping Markets, en contraste, en la medida que el valor de las funcionalidades diferenciadas de ciertas plataformas puedan superar a los efectos de red, es posible que ciertos mercados de plataformas digitales muestren m\u00e1s de una coexistiendo simult\u00e1neamente (probablemente un l\u00edder basado en los efectos de red y alguna otra plataforma ofreciendo una funcionalidad diferenciada y especializada de alto valor).<br/>Entre otras pr\u00e1cticas o estrategias desplegadas por las plataformas con potenciales efectos exclusorios que en la actualidad han sido objeto de atenci\u00f3n para las autoridades de defensa de la competencia se encuentran: las conductas denominadas Self-preference o resultados de b\u00fasquedas que deliberadamente benefician a sus propios productos, comercializadores online o tiendas virtuales integradas; pr\u00e1cticas de Gatekeeper, consistente, por ejemplo en un escenario de una plataforma tipo sistema operativo con su Apps Store que puede decidir qui\u00e9n puede desarrollar aplicaciones y comercializarlas sobre su sistema operativo y en su tienda virtual; pr\u00e1cticas denominadas como Killer Acquisitions que implicar\u00edan comprar nascent competitors que podr\u00edan representar amenazas competitivas futuras y c\u00f3mo crear no s\u00f3lo thresholds para incluirlas en el an\u00e1lisis tradicional de las operaciones de concentraci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica sino qu\u00e9 tipo de est\u00e1ndar de prueba construir en ese sentido; las Envelopment Strategies relacionadas con el t\u00e9rmino del \u201cimperialismo de las plataformas\u201d consistente en la tendencia de incluir, eventualmente, nuevos lados a las plataformas, reduciendo el espacio y la posibilidad de entrada y permanencia de la competencia; etc.<br/>En este mismo sentido, recientemente la autoridad de competencia alemana habr\u00eda se\u00f1alado a una de las gigantes tecnol\u00f3gicas de desplegar conductas abusivas y potencialmente exclusorias por medio de sus mecanismos de acumulaci\u00f3n de datos, ampliando, eventualmente, el paradigma y la aplicaci\u00f3n del derecho de defensa de la competencia m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de conductas exclusorias, profundizando la interpretaci\u00f3n de la protecci\u00f3n al consumidor, de su voluntad y su soberan\u00eda de potenciales conductas abusivas o explotativas directas m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los \u201cprecios excesivos\u201d que no hab\u00edan contado con mayor desarrollo jurisprudencial.<br/>En otro orden de ideas, en la medida que -como se\u00f1ala el documental- exista un \u201cmercado de la atenci\u00f3n\u201d (atenci\u00f3n que no s\u00f3lo revaloriza potenciales pautas publicitarias como en el pasado, sino que incrementa el acceso y la acumulaci\u00f3n de datos complementarios entre s\u00ed), la \u201cprovisi\u00f3n\u201d de contenido e informaci\u00f3n direccionada por los datos recabados sobre gustos y preferencias podr\u00eda, por un lado mantener la atenci\u00f3n del usuario -salvo que la demanda resulte multi-homing y dif\u00edcil de sufrir un efecto Lock-in (tema susceptible a ser constatado emp\u00edricamente)-, y por el otro lado, dificultar\u00eda la pluralidad de contenido. Este es un tema que el \u201cdocumental\u201d se\u00f1ala como una falla de las plataformas y de las redes sociales basadas en algoritmos que refuerzan juicios, prejuicios y creencias; dificultando acceder a informaci\u00f3n o prueba en contrario.<br/>Efectivamente ac\u00e1 nos tropezamos con un dilema: c\u00f3mo, por un lado, los algoritmos que mejoran el contenido y/o los resultados de nuestras b\u00fasquedas m\u00e1s apegadas a nuestros gustos y preferencias (as\u00ed como a nuestros juicios o prejuicios), nos permitir\u00edan reducir costos transaccionales; mientras por el otro lado, refuerzan el sostenimiento del estatus quo, el aislamiento y una eventual polarizaci\u00f3n de grupos de individuos en detrimento de la pluralidad de ideas (adicionalmente se encuentran los temas de fakenews y la eventual manipulaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y de las ideas).<br/>Por otra parte, los especialistas en econom\u00eda del comportamiento, asoman que las personas pueden adolecer de un sesgo cognitivo referido a la cantidad de informaci\u00f3n y privacidad que sacrifican como forma de \u201cpago\u201d para ingresar a ciertas plataformas y redes sociales, sin estar consciente de su uso posterior ni leer los disclaimer referidos a sus pol\u00edticas de privacidad.<br/>Lo anterior generar\u00eda eventuales preocupaciones referidas a la leg\u00edtima voluntad de los consumidores, sus derechos, su privacidad y la apropiabilidad de los datos (estos temas pasan por responder qui\u00e9n es propietario de los datos, y que derechos pueden derivarse de ello y en consecuencia que regla de responsabilidad podr\u00eda erigirse respecto al uso de dichos datos, as\u00ed como eventuales regulaciones ex ante al respecto).<br/>Concluyendo, siendo que la econom\u00eda digital y las plataformas en particular ofrecen no s\u00f3lo nuevos y extraordinarios beneficios a la sociedad, sino que podr\u00edan adolecer por la naturaleza del sector y de los distintos modelos de negocio, de potenciales fallas de mercado y potenciales lesiones al consumidor -m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de las conductuales abarcadas por la defensa de la competencia actual-, muchos asoman la necesidad de crear nuevos instrumentos legales y/o regulatorios basados en principios de debido cuidado, resguardo de la buena fe y protecci\u00f3n del consumidor y/o usuario. El derecho antimonopolio ha sido sometido al desaf\u00edo y a la exigencia de un desarrollo doctrinario para encarar muchas sospechas sobre conductas por parte de las Big Tech. Sin embargo, este instituto jur\u00eddico podr\u00eda adolecer de procedimientos extremadamente largos, con decisiones en muchos de los casos inciertas sin car\u00e1cter sist\u00e9mico, y probablemente por su naturaleza regulatoria y procedimental se requiera alguna acci\u00f3n regulatoria complementaria (esto es lo que argumentan aquellos que est\u00e1n a favor de nuevas regulaciones espec\u00edficas para el sector, sin menoscabo del riesgo de actuar sobre la naturaleza de los modelos de negocio m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de conductas puntuales con efectos restrictivos a la competencia).<br/>En este orden de ideas, uno de los temas que ha desatado la discusi\u00f3n sobre la eventual necesidad de un marco regulatorio ex ante nuevo y propio para la econom\u00eda digital parte de responder si un sistema ex post de derecho de la competencia, as\u00ed como de responsabilidad contractual y extracontractual, casos por casos, resulta suficiente y eficiente para llegar a un balance que proteja el inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico a la par de evitar falsos positivos y lesi\u00f3n sobre la eficiencia din\u00e1mica y la innovaci\u00f3n (este constituye otro dilema: el hecho que acciones p\u00fablicas microfundamentadas y basadas en la evidencia, resultan un verdadero desaf\u00edo en mercados nuevos y extremadamente din\u00e1micos).<br/>Por ejemplo, desde la perspectiva regulatoria, acad\u00e9micos y practitioners asoman si no ser\u00e1 necesario pensar en un principio que se aplicara en su momento en el sector telecomunicaciones -que igualmente ha sido incorporado en temas antimonopolio referido al c\u00f3digo fuente para poder desarrollar software y funcionalidades complementarias y compatibles al software con posici\u00f3n de dominio dado los elevados Switching cost para los usuarios por los efectos de red- como ser\u00eda la interoperabilidad. Institutos jur\u00eddicos y regulatorios de esta naturaleza -eventualmente extensibles a los datos- que persiguen un supuesto \u201clevel of playing-field\u201d implican un trade-off entre la eficiencia est\u00e1tica y la eficiencia din\u00e1mica.<br/>Los retos en materia de pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas y regulatorias son importantes porque los incentivos a la innovaci\u00f3n no deber\u00edan lesionarse y dada la eventual tendencia a la indisputabilidad de ciertos Tipped Markets podr\u00eda exigir pensarse en competencia por el mercado, lo que plantea un dilema de no lesionar posicionamientos de mercado basados en m\u00e9ritos (especialmente si la acci\u00f3n p\u00fablica se plantea, oportun\u00edsticamente, ex post al \u00e9xito de alguna plataforma en el mercado).<br/>Sin menoscabo de lo expuesto anteriormente, un hecho que asoman algunos expertos es que la industria digital a diferencia de la industrial tradicional no basa sus barreras de entrada necesariamente en ingentes inversiones en costos fijos al extremo de hacerlas industrias con estructuras de costos subaditivas, sino que por el contrario podr\u00edan implicar bajos costos fijos -caso de ciertas Apps con eventuales costos fijos inferiores a las inversiones que tendr\u00eda que realizar, por ejemplo, en infraestructura de red los operadores de telecomunicaciones- y barreras de entrada basadas en los efectos de red y los costos de cambio para los usuarios.<br/>Finalmente, no es la primera vez que los agentes econ\u00f3micos crean productos extraordinarios con potenciales riesgos al inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico, por ejemplo los veh\u00edculos potenciales objetos o productos peligrosos,\u00a0 exigieron en su momento pensar en la mejor forma para lidiar con los efectos perniciosos o fallas de mercado sobre el inter\u00e9s general. Por ello, que no cunda el p\u00e1nico, a riesgo de tomarse un tiempo, los Estados, las autoridades y los expertos se encuentran trabajando en las alternativas.<br/>________________________________________________<br/>Fuente: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cedice.org.ve\">www.cedice.org.ve</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWSP-114709</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWSP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XW-5SJ1-JBJN-M39F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>Derechos reservados</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>Derechos reservados</copyright><publicationName>Vision Republica/ Movimiento Civico Nacional, Guatemala</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>26 septiembre 2020 s\u00e1bado</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Peri\u00f3dico</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Art\u00edculos</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0008ZHS</classCode><className>Information Management + Technology</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>Internet Social Networking</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>Environment + Natural Resources</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>Biodiversity</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>Climatology</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>Ecosystems + Habitats</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>Forests + Woodlands</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000A2NF</classCode><className>Aquifers + Watersheds</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000D0TN</classCode><className>Water Crises + Shortages</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST0008WSB</classCode><className>Water Resources Management</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001819</classCode><className>Water Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REQ5NzhGQjlGRUY3NEU0M0FCQTQwMDMyOTAxMTlENzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk</classCode><className>Water Rights</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>Internet + WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>N221300CC</classCode><className>Water + Wastewater Management</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

From keeping a live track of our location, to reading into what we click and how much we shop online, Big Tech has been playing Big Brother\u2019s role with an amicable smile and the promise of democratising social communication \u2013 and so far, for the most part, we\u2019ve all accepted its perks happily. Over the past couple of years, however, numerous privacy and policy advocates, coupled with activist bodies and genuinely concerned Silicon Valley engineers, have at least succeeded in raising the voice about why you need to start being concerned about your privacy , and how nothing is really private for you online. That, however, hasn\u2019t really bothered people across generations from saying \u201ceh, it\u2019s okay. My data isn\u2019t sensitive anyway.\u201d The Social Dilemma shows all of that, and we\u2019ve known these things for a while. Why, then, is it suddenly a big deal?   Jeff Orlowski\u2019s documentary-drama about the ill effects of technology today speaks through Silicon Valley engineers such as Tristan Harris, Bailey Richardson, Joe Toscano, Jeff Seibert, Tim Kendall, Jaron Lanier and many others \u2013 people who have all played key roles in making the technologies that have formed the addiction trap we are in today, and who have all, at some point, realised the dark sides of this technology moon. What they say is, for the most part, what anyone invested in the global technology ecosystem already know very well. However, what makes it a significant show to watch, and not just for those who are interested in technology, is the personification of reach, engagement, notifications, trends and all those things that we keep tracking each day on social media . It is this personification that makes it relevant, and makes privacy a palatable pill to swallow.   Some of the most significant stories told through The Social Dilemma is how it is the random decisions of a few random individuals that have potentially changed our social fabric forever. Decisions such as how notifications work and how you stay connected with your friends, which at one point seemed like frivolous things that only boys in hoodies cared about, have impacted billions of people \u2013 affecting their psyche, eating into insecurities and curiosities. It speaks about how issues regarding the ethical impact of these random engineering decisions may have been raised, but got lost just like you\u2019d lose a needle in a haystack. In ways, it also shows why the very serious issue about privacy has somehow been sidelined as one that only \u2018geeks\u2019 or policymakers think about.   It also raises very important questions \u2013 if Facebook sends notifications urging you to celebrate a \u2018friendversary\u2019, is there really scope to say that there needs to be government-imposed regulations to control such an innocent piece of transaction between the social platform and your smartphone? If the companies refined their product designs in a way that you get to see things that you would really like to, can they really be penalised for it? The counter question that The Social Dilemma also raises is also about whether it really is about penalising the technology behemoths, or instead, actually about holding them accountable and urging them to be ethical and acting in accordance to our society\u2019s moral fabric \u2013 a precariously balanced construct that needs to be retained for the sake of humanity.   It is all of these things that The Social Dilemma highlights, and brings to the centerstage. Those of us who have been closely watching the technology space have every right to say that The Social Dilemma could really have been much, much more than just this. One key element that it touches upon, but largely breaks away into the systemic privacy breaches later on, is how the narratives of these tech companies have changed over time. Google , for instance, migrated away from its original \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019 motto in 2015, as it restructured into Alphabet and assumed the role to \u2018do the right thing\u2019. When Facebook started, its entire strength lay in bringing societies together. Today, the socio-political manipulation on its profile has contributed to disrupted elections and rising levels of fake news and misinformation. This is further compounded by a vast lack of understanding of technologies among policymakers and lawmakers, and tech companies being allowed to get away with \u201cwe take your wellbeing and privacy very seriously\u201d.  Story continues  In the most recent landmark antitrust hearing that brought Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos \u2013 arguably four of the most powerful men on Earth right now \u2013 together, one key thing to note was how each company had grounds to justify their actions, by highlighting that while the privacy and addiction concerns may not be wrong, they have also done a lot of good by decentralising unorganised sectors, giving voices to the marginalised, making global connections super easy to afford, and so on. These are facts, but in turn, what was largely overlooked were aspects like how Big Tech\u2019s deep learning algorithms have essentially created echo chambers for you \u2013 a factor that can actually stifle your acceptance of opposing opinions, thereby pushing you to become more extreme in thoughts. This can, in turn, have a big impact on how you vote, how you interact with your closest people, and other such key societal factors.   At the end of the day, this is The Social Dilemma\u2019s biggest takeaway. It has taken these issues, and attempted to show to the world that it is something that really should concern you. It shows you why you should not believe that you have nothing to lose by posting your selfies in a Twitter 10-year face challenge, how Instagram measures the exact amount of time that you spend looking at a person\u2019s photograph, and at the end of the day, how each of these metrics turn you into a commodity that is sold to businesses to own. It is your data that is letting the technology giants run away without needing to account for ethics, and as long as you continue to believe that you do not have much to lose, you will continue to be sold. It also highlights that while you financially do not pay anything to these companies directly, you do pay an eventual price, where you end up at a psychiatrist\u2019s consultation due to social anxiety or deep insecurities, or end up force-purchasing expensive apparel against your good judgement, because of virtual social influence.   The Social Dilemma is not a pathbreaking show, but it is an important one nonetheless. Particularly for those outside the technology ecosystem, The Social Dilemma is a show that you really should watch.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43159535820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XD-FGR1-JCSC-J190-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1169\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

Orkut, which had grown too big and too divided, was seeing a mass exodus with users migrating to Facebook, which appeared to many of us as a promised land that was simple in its goal and easy to use. Not long after, Twitter and Reddit happened, and for a time, many of us explored our creative sides freely and engaged with people the world over.  It all changed, however, when big data was born. Slowly but surely, a silent wall was built on those platforms. As they grew bigger, so did their need to get more users, more ads and most importantly, more data. What we see today on social media sites is chiefly a vast earth of data to be mined and monetised at will.  That is the dilemma of Netflix's The Social Dilemma, a hour-and-a-half-long documentary (with a bit of drama) that tries to piece together just how social media have gone out of control.  Featuring interviews from former engineers at Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Google, along with the father of virtual reality, The Social Dilemma delves deep into what made social media and Big Tech tick during their early days, where many of the things they made were driven by the hopes of spreading positivity, and how they have changed into behemoths that are becoming like small governments unto themselves, complete with conflicts of interest, near-total power over their users and no real accountability.  Beyond the interviews, however, lie the news clips, the Senate dramas and a small dramatisation of the impact of social media that focuses on a small family. Through the eyes of this average, suburban family, we see the true horror of the current form of social media brought to light, in that the son, who is addicted to social media, finds himself in the wrong place, with consequences that would otherwise be unfathomable while one of the daughters is held to unrealistic standards of beauty because she literally cannot stop posting photos of herself.  Many of the speakers talk about radicalisation, compartmentalisation and a deranged version of the tunnel vision effect, wherein people only get to see information related to what they are already seeing; an effect that only serves to deepen their own biases, be it anti-vax, flat-earth, or most recently, any given number of hoaxes on Covid-19. To those who are in deep into these, what the sites show is fact, and any information to the contrary is either hidden away by the machines that determine what people see, or rejected outright when presented. To better explain this, the speakers present the problem of AI in science fiction, where in many cases, the machine grows too powerful and wipes out the human race. This, they say, is rather an exaggerated account, for AI already controls many, many things that we see and do online, most of which is beyond the understanding of not only the users, but also those who wrote the AI and taught it to learn and get better at its job.  Many of us think that the threats from big data and reported incidents of intrusion are anomalies in our lives and carry on with doing our thing on Facebook or Twitter. It is not so simple so as to be easily dismissed as such. Social media has become a bitter reflection of the world we live in, where people have been divided over things that range from food preferences to who they support politically. People who consume right-wing conspiracies exclusively are always driven only to those, and so is the case for everyone else - all at the expense of the people themselves, who have become commodities to be monetised and sold to whoever is willing to pay a little more than the price of a packet of peanuts per person. The result of this is a near-total erosion of empathy and a willingness to listen to another point of view or debate in a way that leads to mutual growth and understanding.  And while the documentary presents social media as the cause of the divide, which is simple enough to deduce, the root cause may be a combination of various failures on many fronts. The people themselves may be to be blame though the documentary makes a strong argument for the lack of regulation. Unlike entities like cellphone companies, social media remains, to this day, a beast without chains. This has allowed the behemoth to grow unchecked and untethered to the bounds of ethics, into something that resembles a deep mine or perhaps a rabbit hole, with the company heads holding the proverbial dials that decide when connection platforms morph into tunnels that simply tap into user information and siphon off money from them.  If you've read Alice in Wonderland, you will know that little Alice fell into a rabbit hole while chasing a rabbit. Down she went till she found herself in a strange land of wonder. Unfortunately, in the real world, this rabbit hole does not lead to a weird or amazing place. It goes as deep as we allow them to take us and this is what The Social Dilemma calls for: To put an end to a descent into anarchy and hopefully save ourselves from what comes next before it's too late.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43133857391</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WT-WDB1-JCSC-J40Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Deccan Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 22, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
