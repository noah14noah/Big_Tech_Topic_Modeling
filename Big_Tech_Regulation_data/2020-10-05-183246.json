They say a complex set of laws that are designed to give users more control over their personal information will curb the power of Big Tech to track users across the web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But others warn that the rules, whose effects will extend far beyond the 28 EU member states, instead risk helping social-media giants Facebook and Google consolidate their digital power even further.</p><p>The GDPR makes it harder for companies to collect a broad array of personal data, from names and e-mail addresses, to browser cookies, IP addresses and location information. The rules also give Europeans the right to demand that firms delete their information. Companies must also notify authorities of a data breach within 72 hours.</p><p>The most important aspect for many privacy critics is the GDPR's requirement that companies get consent from users to harvest their data and explain in plain language what they plan to do with that information.</p><p>The new law comes with new powers for national regulators, who can fine companies up to 4 per cent of global revenues, or 20-million ($30-million), for the most serious privacy breaches.</p><p>\"There is no doubt for us that the GDPR is a game-changer, and that it will require companies to change their mindset and put the privacy of their users first,\" said David Martin Ruiz, senior legal officer for the European Consumer Organisation, an umbrella group of consumer watchdogs.</p><p>While the GDPR only applies in the 28 EU member states, the laws have implications for any company that collects data on European residents, even if they are headquartered abroad. Foreign companies that offer services or collect data on users in the EU who don't comply with the new laws could potentially face the same steep financial penalties as businesses based in Europe.</p><p>In the past month, Kirsten Thompson, a lawyer with McCarthy T\u00e9trault who specializes in data issues, has been inundated with calls from Canadians clients scrambling to understand what the rules mean for them.</p><p>Much of the public attention has focused on tech companies, but the law applies to a wide array of firms that operate in Europe. \"I have everything from regulated professional colleges, right through to construction companies,\" Ms. Thompson said. Some Canadian firms that assumed they were outside the reach of the European laws may be in for a surprise, she warned.</p><p>Although Canada's existing federal privacy laws are already in line with some aspects of the GDPR, the federal government may eventually have to look at overhauling its legislation or risk seeing Canadian firms blocked from accessing customers in Europe. \"One of the criticisms of GDPR is it imposes another state's laws outside its own borders,\" Ms. Thompson said. \"I expect there will be litigation around that.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, investors are closely watching what the rules will mean for digital advertising powerhouses Google and Facebook. Both companies have unveiled changes aimed at complying with the new law and have promised to offer many of them, such as privacy features, to users outside of Europe as well.</p><p>Last month, Facebook chief financial officer Dave Wehner said he expected Facebook's European user base to flatline or even decline after the GDPR comes into effect. Financial analysts estimate both firms could risk losing billions in advertising income if enough users deny permission to access their data. But the biggest risk may come from regulators and activists who are keen to make big tech companies a test case for the new rules. Google and Facebook, which last year captured more than 80 per cent of the growth in digital advertising, \"are surely going to be on everyone's list,\" Mr. Martin said.</p><p>U.S. privacy activists are planning to work with their European counterparts to focus attention on U.S. companies operating across the EU, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a Washington-based non-profit.</p><p>Tech companies \"think they can get away with their business model without changing their practices,\" he said. \"This is going to be a serious war that will soon ensue.\"</p><p>Others worry that rather than cripple the power of Big Tech, GDPR will allow social-media giants to extend their dominance over the digital-advertising market by favouring its own datagathering capabilities. \"Facebook has just become the biggest data broker in the history of humanity,\" John Battelle, a digital advertising executive and co-founder of Wired Magazine, wrote on his blog. \"It just doesn't want you to know that.\"</p><p>Google rolled out new restrictions on the ability of advertisers to export some user data needed to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns across multiple platforms - while still allowing marketers to use that same data in Google's own in-house ad measurement tools.</p><p>Analysts with Credit Suisse predicted the new law would make advertisers \"more reliant on the larger internet services operators.\"</p><p>A separate battle is brewing between tech companies and media companies. Google told publishers it was changing its policies around user consent for Google's advertising services. The company will now require publishers to get consent on Google's behalf, but reserves the right to use that data for other purposes.</p><p>Several groups representing major media brands complained the changes seemed designed to shift legal liability onto publishers while handing too much control to Google. Yet publishers have little choice but to try to work with Google, since the company controls so much of the online-advertising business.</p><p>\"They literally have dominance over the entire supply chain in a way that you don't see in other unregulated markets,\" said Jason Kint, CEO of one of the trade organizations, Digital Content Next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20180525rbnwwoeuropedataprivacy</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SD9-M621-F06S-320X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Finance ministers will meet in Brussels this week, but little progress is expected after a war of words broke out last week - meaning nobody knows where the EU's funding is going to come from, or when.</p><p>With Britain leaving, the burden of funding the European project will fall ever more heavily on Germany. Berlin sources last week leaked an internal German government calculation that its net contribution to the EU budget will double to ???33 billion ($53 billion) a year by 2027 - and the frugal Germans weren't having a bar of that.</p><p>The European Commission's budget commissioner, G??nther Oettinger, hit back, saying the figure would be more like ???23.5 billion. It's hard to work out, as the big contributors also claw back money through EU payments to members such as farm subsidies, regional development slush funds and research grants.</p><p>\"I think there's going to be progress up to December, but no agreement,\" Mr Oettinger said. Somehow, the EU has to function with no agreed budget. It's going to be messy.</p><p>By then, Mr Oettinger will have passed the baton to his successor - or will he?</p><p>After much horse-trading, the role of President of the European Commission passed to Germany's Ursula von der Leyen. She was due to take over last Friday but she can't do so until the European Parliament has vetted and approved all 27 commissioners she is bringing in with her.</p><p>Each member state nominates one - usually a recently retired politician - and Ms von der Leyen gets to allocate portfolios among them.</p><p>The European Parliament has knocked back the candidates from France, Romania and Hungary, on the grounds that there was a whiff of a corruption scandal around each of them.</p><p>France and Hungary have put forward replacements, but Romania is having an election and the nomination process has got caught up in party politics. Until Romania nominates a candidate and it's approved, Ms von der Leyen can't take office, and her predecessor Jean-Claude Juncker stays on in caretaker mode.</p><p>The result is policy stagnation, even though the EU is champing at the bit to throw its weight around on issues such as regulating big tech companies, fighting back against President Donald Trump's trade threats, pushing the green agenda, and chasing down multinational tax avoidance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bloc is still simmering over French President Emmanuel Macron's veto over starting talks to admit Albania and North Macedonia. The rest of the EU - possibly excepting Denmark and the Netherlands - is livid, given that they'd already dusted off the red carpet for the new entrants.</p><p>\"They were ready, we were not,\" said a clearly angry European Council President Donald Tusk. \"It's not a failure, it's a mistake. I feel really embarrassed.\"</p><p>Historical mistake</p><p>North Macedonia Prime Minister Zoran Zaev immediately called an election, describing his country as a \"victim of the EU's historical mistake.\" He described himself as \"disappointed and angry\", particularly after going through a gruelling political process to change the country's name as a condition for starting talks.</p><p>There are fears he may now pivot towards the more accommodating Russia, which has already wooed nearby Serbia into its rival customs zone.</p><p>There's also a growing sense of grievance and cleavage elsewhere in eastern Europe. Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic have taken a populist turn, and there's a prolonged tension.</p><p>It came to a head last week when the European Court of Justice's Advocate General said she'd advised the judges to rule against the three countries in a case over accepting refugees and other irregular migrants.</p><p>The EU tried to cope with an influx of more than 1 million migrants from the Middle East in 2015 by apportioning migrant quotas to each country, to spread the burden from the Mediterranean countries where the migrants first landed.</p><p>Hungary and its allies pushed back, putting the policy pretty much on ice. But the Advocate General, whose advice the judges usually follow, said the bloc's principle of solidarity \"necessarily sometimes implies accepting burden-sharing\". The judgment is due next year.</p><p>Economy languishing</p><p>The cluster of political crises comes as the eurozone is barely keeping its economic head above water.</p><p>There was relief in the past week when it was revealed third-quarter GDP growth in the eurozone was 0.2 per cent on the previous quarter - the same rate as in the June quarter, and higher than the forecasts from both economists and the European Central Bank.</p><p>France and Spain are ticking along more robustly than expected, while Germany and Italy skirted recession. The outlook isn't great though: the Economic Sentiment Indicator, measuring business and consumer confidence, is at its lowest level in five years.</p><p>The ECB has unleashed its full arsenal at the sluggish economy and undershooting inflation rate, but nobody is expecting it to have much effect. The main impact has been to cause unprecedented ructions on the ECB's policy board.</p><p>The new ECB boss Christine Lagarde, who starts on Monday, hasn't even put her feet under the desk before picking her own first fight.</p><p>With monetary policy exhausted, she last week called on governments with \"room for manoeuvre\" to add fiscal firepower by boosting spending and cutting taxes.

Finance ministers will meet in Brussels this week, but little progress is expected after a war of words broke out last week - meaning nobody knows where the EU's funding is going to come from, or when.</p><p>With Britain leaving, the burden of funding the European project will fall ever more heavily on Germany. Berlin sources last week leaked an internal German government calculation that its net contribution to the EU budget will double to (EURO)33 billion ($53 billion) a year by 2027 - and the frugal Germans weren't having a bar of that.</p><p>The European Commission's budget commissioner, G&amp;#xFC;nther Oettinger, hit back, saying the figure would be more like (EURO)23.5 billion. It's hard to work out, as the big contributors also claw back money through EU payments to members such as farm subsidies, regional development slush funds and research grants.</p><p>\"I think there's going to be progress up to December, but no agreement,\" Oettinger said. Somehow, the EU has to function with no agreed budget. It's going to be messy.</p><p>By then, Oettinger will have passed the baton to his successor - or will he?</p><p>After much horse trading, the role of President of the European Commission passed to Germany's Ursula von der Leyen. She was due to take over last Friday but she can't do so until the European Parliament has vetted and approved all 27 commissioners she is bringing in with her.</p><p>Each member state nominates one - usually a recently retired politician - and von der Leyen gets to allocate portfolios among them.</p><p>The European Parliament has knocked back the candidates from France, Romania and Hungary, on the grounds that there was a whiff of a corruption scandal around them.</p><p>France and Hungary have put forward replacements, but Romania is having an election and the nomination process has got caught up in party politics. Until Romania nominates a candidate and it's approved, von der Leyen can't take office, and her predecessor Jean-Claude Juncker stays on in caretaker mode.</p><p>The result is policy stagnation, even though the EU is champing at the bit to throw its weight around on issues such as regulating big tech companies, fighting back against President Donald Trump's trade threats, pushing the green agenda, and chasing down multinational tax avoidance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bloc is still simmering over French President Emmanuel Macron's veto of talks to admit Albania and North Macedonia. The rest of the EU - possibly except Denmark and the Netherlands - is livid, given that they'd already dusted off the red carpet for the new entrants.</p><p>North Macedonia Prime Minister Zoran Zaev immediately called an election, describing his country as a \"victim of the EU's historical mistake.\"</p><p>There are fears he may now pivot towards the more accommodating Russia, which has already wooed nearby Serbia into its customs zone.</p><p>There's also a growing sense of grievance and cleavage elsewhere in eastern Europe. Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic have taken a populist turn, and there's a prolonged tension.</p><p>It came to a head last week when the European Court of Justice's Advocate General said she'd advised the judges to rule against the three countries in a case over accepting refugees and other irregular migrants.</p><p>The EU tried to cope with an influx of more than 1 million migrants from the Middle East in 2015 by apportioning migrant quotas to each country, to spread the burden from the Mediterranean countries where the migrants first landed.</p><p>Hungary and its allies pushed back, putting the policy pretty much on ice. But the Advocate General, whose advice the judges usually follow, said the bloc's principle of solidarity \"necessarily sometimes implies accepting burden-sharing\". The judgment is due next year.</p><p>The cluster of political crises comes as the eurozone is barely keeping its economic head above water.</p><p>There was relief in the past week when it was revealed third-quarter GDP growth in the eurozone was 0.2 per cent on the previous quarter - the same rate as in the June quarter, and higher than the forecasts from both economists and the ECB.</p><p>France and Spain are ticking along more robustly than expected, while Germany and Italy skirted recession. The outlook isn't great though: the Economic Sentiment Indicator, measuring business and consumer confidence, is at its lowest level in five years.</p><p>The ECB has unleashed its full arsenal at the sluggish economy and undershooting inflation rate, but nobody is expecting it to have much effect. The new ECB boss, Christine Lagarde, who starts today, hasn't even put her feet under the desk before picking her own first fight.</p><p>With monetary policy exhausted, she last week called on governments with \"room for manoeuvre\" to add fiscal firepower by boosting spending and cutting taxes. She even broke with protocol by singling out Germany and the Netherlands. They were unimpressed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc77ta7hv9zol19ug8r5mn</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDR-0VY1-F0J6-J03H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

What many scornfully dismiss as utopian wishful thinking or even as primitive propaganda of the reality of rapt elites, is - as paradoxical as it may seem - exactly the expectation that also corresponds to the common sense of the masses. In Germany in particular, many frustrated savers, from association presidents to average consumers, are complaining about the European Central Bank (ECB) and its zero and negative interest rate policy. Nevertheless, Germans hold by far the largest share of their savings and investments in euros and in the euro area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, there is hardly any positive real interest income left - if at all - and although it would be easy and cheap nowadays to invest the capital in other countries and currencies with much higher (nominal) yields. But German savers obviously do not trust the roast in other regions of the world. Despite all protest and criticism of the ECB, they are betting on the euro and the eurozone as the best investment option for the 2020s. And they should be right on target. After all, Europe's prospects for economic success in the new decade are far better than the many Euro-pessimists would like to believe.</p><p>Anyone who only takes the unresolved problems of the European Economic and Monetary Union as the measure of all things fails to realise how far ahead of all other regions of the world Europe is. With a few exceptions, the World Bank data speak for themselves: nowhere else do the masses of the population live so long, so well, so healthily, so peacefully and so prosperously, and - despite all (often far too great) discrepancies - are their incomes and wealth so widely dispersed as in Europe.</p><p>How immensely higher than elsewhere the quality of life in Europe is quite obvious can be seen simply and easily from migration statistics. Whereas in earlier times Europeans exchanged their homeland for a life overseas, and whereas the classic immigration countries in North America and Oceania attracted people and refugees from all over the world, no other region of the world is currently the preferred destination of mass migration movements in a similar way to Europe.</p><p>But not only foreigners, but even more so the locals themselves evaluate the quality of life in their European home country enormously positively. In the ranking of the World Happiness Report 2019 (which measures, evaluates and compares the quality of life for 156 countries on the basis of a large number of objective indicators and subjective well-being factors), European countries occupy the top seven positions. In the top ten, there are just two non-European countries: New Zealand in eighth place and Canada in ninth place. In view of these overwhelming facts, is there any need for further data to prove that Europe is better than anywhere else to live in, rather than worse?</p><p>It can rightly be argued that the successes of the past are no guarantee for their continuation in the future. But this is precisely where Europe need not be afraid. If it is true that avoiding and preventing climate change will be the dominant challenge of the 2020s, no other region of the world is as sensitive, aware and willing to change as Europe.</p><p>Of course, CO2-neutrality or 4-R technologies (Refuse, Reduce, Recycle, Repair) are still in their infancy and stakeholders are still arguing about who has to finance which CO2 taxes or certificates and by when. Measured by the level of consensus already reached, however, the level of consensus already achieved in Europe is considerable. This is especially true in comparison to world regions where quite different problems of mass poverty, mass unemployment and the consequences of climate change are at the top of the list of priorities and prevention of climate change at the bottom.</p><p>And even with the second megatrend of the future, the opportunities and risks of data economies, algorithms and artificial intelligence, Europe is currently lagging far behind, but is far from being left behind for all time. Neither the American way of big business of giant data corporations that spy on people and degrade transparent customers into victims of private profit maximisation strategies, nor the Chinese way of the state-run Big Brother, which unscrupulously disregards privacy everywhere and at all times, must be a model for European societies.</p><p>The strategy of EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, to prevent monopolies from abusing their market power with all possible severity, raises justified hopes for a third way that does justice to European values, standards and cultural characteristics. However, the fight against Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Chinese big-tech giants requires far more than regulatory defences. There is an urgent need to establish an independent digital network infrastructure within Europe and to enable companies and customers alike to use data-driven business models in almost all areas of everyday life in a cost-effective and smooth manner. If eco-logical technologies become the hallmark of the 2020s, then Europe will be well prepared.</p><p>According to the findings of economic historians (such as David S. Landes or Eric Jones), innovations and their rapid implementation in everyday life by companies and customers flourish particularly successfully when companies create a legal framework that secures individual property rights, relies on decentralized organization from below and trusts the knowledge and ability of individuals to solve everyday problems independently and responsibly.</p><p>Despite all the justified criticism that not everything is good in today's Europe and that much should be done much better, it is precisely the enormous cultural diversity, the small-scale, medium-sized economic structure and the generally well to very well educated population that fulfil precisely these preconditions - although by no means to everyone's complete satisfaction, but at least as well as in all other regions of the world. In addition, over the past 75 years, Europe has, step by step, found binding laws and rules throughout the EU, which are not perfect but are a better compromise than anything that has been found before or so far elsewhere for the coexistence of different cultures.</p><p>This is no reason to rest easy. But it is also no reason to badmouth what has been achieved over generations. On the contrary, the good conditions should not only lead savers to stick to euro investments. They should also be an incentive for politics, business and society as a whole to make the 2020s the European decade.</p><p>The strategy of EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to prevent monopolies from abusing their market power with all possible severity raises justified hopes</p><p>Note: This article has been translated automatically.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Document original</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVWE20200102DWBEHPWIRTSCHAFTNU63TM0K1TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DIEWEN-168736914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIEWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWG-1771-JBK9-2044-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465485</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1133\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Axel Springer SE All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Die Welt (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12658\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>No. 1</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000656</classCode><className>EURO</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EVJ</classCode><className>EURO ZONE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X0T</classCode><className>MONETARY UNIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000436</classCode><className>CURRENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

While you were busy with impeachment and then coronavirus, the EU has been moving forward with a 'Green Deal'. But what to make of it? By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website[1] The unstoppable global health emergency has ripped away the fabric of normality. </p><p>Every day brings news of developments which, only a few weeks ago, would have felt utterly impossible. Who would have believed, in mid-February, that schools and universities would be closed by mid-March, public gatherings cancelled, cities and whole nations and billions of people would be put under lock-down, and hundreds of millions of people around the world would be out of work? Who would have predicted that many governments would work tirelessly to put together some of the largest economic stimulus packages in history, to support (big, and sometimes also small) firms and give income protection to workers and households, that central banks would (again) provide emergency liquidity, commercial banks would be waiving mortgage payments, and landlords would refrain from collecting rents? Who could have imagined that the majority of people, forced to remain at home, are glued to their computers and/or smart phones, more dependent than ever on the Big Tech companies, feeding them - willingly or unwillingly - with ever more private information, thereby putting the already fast growth of surveillance capitalism on steroids? Or that governments would be using drones to impose social distancing on their populations and/or using mobile phone tracking to do the same? While the world will not be the same once this is over, we must recognize that novel disasters and emergencies do not remove or resolve older, existing problems\u2014the biggest one of which is, without doubt, accelerating climate change. Despite clear differences, the Covid-19 calamity and global warming share important similarities: both problems present catastrophic risks to humanity which were long identified by scientists and both have been willfully neglected by governments and most political parties unable to see beyond the next election; both problems require unprecedented levels of global co-operation to be sorted and both demand transformative change today in order to prevent catastrophic outcomes in future; and redressing the risks of pandemics and global warming will require new innovative effective forms of coordinated, government-led action worldwide, rather than reliance on the 'logic of the marketplace' and private-sector initiative. This brings me back to the future: if we manage to get to a post-covid-19 world, humanity still will have to confront the problem and risks of global warming. The one credible strategy to bring about 'climate neutrality' is the European Union's Green Deal, which is almost forgotten in the corona-tragedy and the coming global recession. It is deserving of a closer look. The European Union's 'Man-on-the-Moon' Moment .. The European Union (EU) has done it, or so it appears. Its 'Green Deal', an ambitious rethinking of the European economy, transport, building and energy sectors, unveiled by the European Commission in December 2019, has been hailed as the first comprehensive plan to achieve 'climate-neutrality' at a continental scale. It involves a \u20ac1 trillion, 10-year investment plan to fund a drastic reduction of the EU's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2030 by 55% compared with 1990 \u2014 and to realize zero (net) emissions or 'climate neutrality' by 2050. The investment programme of \u20ac1 trillion is to be financed from leveraged public and private funds and to be channelled into greening the economy. Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission calls the Green Deal 'Europe's man-on-the-moon moment' and has outlined a detailed roadmap of more than 50 actions the EU will have to take over the next decade to reach its emissions goal. The Green Deal has received a mostly warm welcome. Most commentators see it as a courageous, bold and even visionary step in the right direction of a prosperous, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economy. Jeffrey Sachs[2] hails it 'a demonstration of European social democracy at work. A mixed economy, combining markets, government regulation, the public sector, and civil society, will pursue a mixed strategy, combining public goals, public and private investments, and public support'. Predictably, business interests and centre-right economists fear the Green Deal will cripple European industries, as the new rules will raise cost of production, the proposed carbon border tax will hurt international trade, and the EU's moral grandstanding on a go-it-alone transition to a carbon-neutral economy will do nothing to stop global warming from accelerating. Perhaps surprisingly, strong critiques have been voiced by climate scientists, environmental activists and critical economists, to whom Europe's Green Deal is not ambitious and transformative enough, offering too little, too late. The latter critics are, in turn, accused of not offering constructive engagement with the Green Deal and, by burning down what is in essence a far-reaching reform of the EU policy orientation, they are accused of promoting fatalism and cynicism. Indeed, this is the dilemma: if Otto von Bismarck was right that 'politics is the art of the possible, the attainable \u2014 the art of the next best', then the Green Deal does constitute a major advance and all efforts should be concentrated on expanding what is 'attainable'. I am not so sure. First, all the evidence is telling us that 'business-as-usual' is over, as the climate emergency is building fast: on present trends, humanity will have exhausted the remaining global carbon budget in a decade. Either we act decisively, or we don't \u2014 in which case we have to brace ourselves for the damage coming from runaway warming, and adaptation to climate change becomes a must. Half-hearted tinkering will not bring us anywhere. Second, the Green Deal is the new signature mission of the Union, its new raison d'tre, and a failure to bring about a green and economically inclusive and just transformation of the EU economy cannot but give the project of European unification a fatal blow. The stakes are high, therefore, and a dispassionate, constructive look at the Green Deal is needed in light of the climate reality. This is what the Working Paper[3] does. Ambition and speed To achieve the Green Deal emission reduction target of 55% by 2030, GHG emissions by the EU-27 have to decline by as much as 5.2% per year during the next decade \u2014 which is three times faster than during 1990-2020. The ambition level is certainly commendable, yet it still falls short of what is, according to climate science, needed to prevent the global mean temperature from rising above the safe threshold of 1.5 Celsius (with a probability of 66%). The EU-27 have an obligation and ability to do more, in order to protect enough the 'carbon development space' for the more than six billion people in the developing countries. Bigger reductions in GHG emissions will require even faster decarbonisation and a shift toward 100% renewable energy of the EU as soon as possible \u2014 the 'binding' target of achieving a renewable energy share of final energy use of at least 32% in 2030 falls short of what is necessary. Scale of the Green Deal The European Commission estimates that the EU27 need \u20ac 260 billion of green investments per year over the next decade to bring down GHG emissions by 40% in 2030. \u20ac260 billion amounts to around 2% of GDP of the EU27. These numbers do not take into account the new stricter target to reduce GHG emissions in 2030 by 55% (and not 40%). The higher reduction target will require higher capital expenditures; the investment requirement for a 55% emission reduction target would roughly be around 3% of GDP (or \u20ac400 billion) each year, and for a more ambitious goal to cut emissions by 65% in 2030 investment would amount to around 4.5% of GDP per annum. The current Green Deal is under-funded. Furthermore, almost all of the public Green Deal funding is money reshuffled from existing EU funds or based on national co-financing or founded on promises to leverage private-sector capital by taking away the risk for these investors, whose investments will be guaranteed by the EU budget. National co-financing is unlikely to involve additional spending, because member states have to stick to the deflationary straightjacket of the Stability and Growth Pact. All in all, the Green Deal will generate only \u20ac 1.1 billion per year in newexpenditures by the European Commission under the Just Transition Mechanism (JTM). This reprogramming of already projected expenditures makes it a bit of a stretch to call the Green Deal a 'growth strategy'. The extent to which it will spur private investment is highly uncertain. The transition to a carbon-neutral economy will lead to massive disinvestment and 'stranded assets' (in fossil-fuel based industries) and the destruction of large numbers of jobs in extractive industries (coal mining), fossil-fuel energy-producing and manufacturing industries (such as automobiles). True, the Green Deal will be creating new jobs in renewable energy generation, housing renovation, building and maintaining low-carbon energy infrastructures and in services. But the transformation will be upsetting, massive and risky, and the slower the radical restructuring and the reallocation of labour across industries, and the larger the distributional impacts, the higher will be the overall transition costs and the more economic growth will be hurt. The European Commission takes too narrow a view of the distributional consequences of the Green Deal, which makes it look rather badly prepared to guide the process of structural transformation \u2014 and this is careless in view of the rather low level of popular support for the climate transition. Substance of the Deal On paper the Green Deal looks impressive: it includes a 'farm-to-fork' sustainable agriculture strategy and plans for a carbon-neutral 'circular economy'; it proposes to start a 'renovation wave' to improve energy efficiency of the building stock; it favours the rapid development of renewable energy generation; it proposes a carbon border tax on carbon-polluting foreign firms in an effort to provide space to EU firms to decarbonize; and it wants to reform the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) and raise carbon prices to make it more effective. All this makes sense, but the capacity to bring about a structural transformation of the EU27 economy and society is compromised by the under-funding of the investment plan, an unwillingness to envision how the green transition can be made to generate significant co-benefits (in terms of job growth, improved health outcomes and a more fair income distribution) and an under-estimation of restructuring costs, distributional impacts and uncertainties. Consider the Green Deal's 'Just Transition Mechanism' (JTM), which was put forward as a 'pledge of solidarity and fairness'. The JTM will mobilize \u20ac100 billion over 10 years, mostly to support the economic restructuring of the regional coal-producing economies of the EU. However, the proposed JTM budget likely falls short of what will be needed to shoulder the social restructuring cost of the 'coal exit' and destruction of mining jobs in the EU27. But the EU climate transition is not just affecting the more than 400,000 miners, but is estimated to lead to the destruction of around 4.7 million jobs in so-called 'brown' industries (including in automobile manufacturing). What, if anything, does the Green Deal promise these workers in terms of 'solidarity and fairness'? To be clear, the job destruction is only one side of the transition. The shift to EVs will create jobs in building the (fast) charging infrastructure and in producing EV components and batteries (which are now mainly imported from China). There is enormous potential for the growth of green jobs in energy-saving renovation of the building stock and in smart public transport (zero-emission electric buses, trams and light-rail). Hence, when managed properly, the Green Deal will create new jobs in renewable energy generation, housing renovation, and transport. According to ILO (2018), green job growth in the EU during 2020-2030 could exceed 'brown' job destruction by around 2 million jobs. But to achieve the green job growth, the EU would need to considerably broaden its current focus \u2014 on building charging and refuelling infrastructures for the 13 million zero- and low-emission (mostly private and very expensive) vehicles expected to be on Europe's roads by 2050 \u2014 to smart (and cheap) public transport systems, and from imposing the cost of energy-efficiency renovation on households to socialize the investment cost of housing stock renovation. Rapidly phasing out fossil fuels in power plants (burning coal), industrial facilities, buildings and vehicles will improve air quality by reducing ambient air pollution and this could reduce premature deaths in the EU27 by 300,000 persons[4] each and every year and also drastically lower morbidity, lost working days, and healthcare care (Boyce 2020). The relatively high additional mortality in Europe caused by air pollution has much to do with burning coal. Thirty-three of the 50 most polluted towns in Europe are in Poland[5], where burning coal is deemed 'patriotic' by the government. In a back-of-the-envelope calculation, using the official EU default value of \u20ac 3.387 million for the value of a statistical life (VSL), an in itself dubious concept to put a euro-value on human mortality, I estimate that the 'co-pollutant cost of carbon' in the EU27 would amount to \u20ac1 trillion per year. Strategic Reliance on 'Green Finance' The European Commission puts its faith in private finance to fund the climate transition by promoting green capital formation through a favourable regulatory treatment of green finance, de-risking and credit subsidies. Having lost the battles for tougher regulation and higher taxation and spending, the Commission's hope is that private finance will do the job of greening the economy. Hence, the idea is to do 'whatever it takes' to persuade institutional investors to redirect the trillions of money they are managing to specific activities that are officially labelled as being 'green' or 'sustainable' according to an official EU Taxonomy. Global finance will only do this of its own accord if it serves its interest. What makes these 'green investments' attractive for private finance is the fact that such green assets will be de-risked through EU subsidies and ECB guarantees to support the liquidity of these assets (Gabor 2020[6]a). The EU provides a first-loss guarantee, enabling the EIB to fund riskier (climate-related) investment under the heading of the InvestEU programme. The problem with this periphrastic strategy is that it relies heavily on private global financiers \u2014 such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs \u2014 who are all waist-deep in fossil-fuel investments and, as large shareholders, have been routinely voting against shareholder motions directing corporate boards to take climate action and to integrate environmental concerns in their activities (Gabor 2020a). The Green Deal will be subsidizing carbon financiers, allowing them to make a profit from the climate transition, rather than holding them liable for the GHG emissions (see Richard Heede 2017[7]). The Green Deal offers long-time fossil-fuel financiers a rather easy way out, by providing a cushioned, subsidized exit from fossil-fuel investments toward de-risked 'green assets'. The new class of highly liquid 'de-risked' assets, which will be as safe as German Bunds because they are guaranteed by EU (German) taxpayers and the ECB, will be in high demand. After all, the global shadow banking system is permanently short of safe securities, which it can use to collateralize global institutional cash pools (Storm 2018). That is, the 'de-risked' assets will further enable the already excessive liquidity preference of global financial investors, who have parked at least $ 5 trillion in collateralized spaces within the global shadow banking system, ready for immediate use in privately very profitable, but socially unproductive financial speculation in short-term exotic derivative instruments. The Green Deal thus 'rewards' an already malfunctioning global financial system, rather than 'punishes' and regulates it in ways which make 'brown assets' more expensive and liable for the (environmental, social and economic) damage it is causing. Incentivizing private finance will not be enough to bring about the fast and just transition to climate neutrality promised by the European Commission \u2014 which requires green industrial policies to catalyze and support private-sector investment and leaning in zero-carbon activities, and proper management of aggregate demand. Industrial policy will be indispensable if the Green Deal is to exploit the considerable potential for energy savings and job growth of large-scale energy-efficiency renovation in buildings. Further, smart public transport requires building up the (charging) infrastructure, using public procurement (of electric buses, trams and trains) to promote the new mobility model, and investing in the development and demonstration of early-phase (battery) technologies and electro-fuels. However, large multinational corporations could, after benefiting from public money, offshore their clean-tech innovations to low-wage countries; indeed, battery production for EVs is currently concentrated in Asia (in China, Japan and South Korea). Green Deal spending should therefore include social clauses, requiring companies to base their production in countries with certain wage levels and labour and environmental legal standards (Gaddi and Garbellini 2019). Another issue is that the Green Deal spending will require European planning in order to promote the construction of integrated European value chains (to make the most of economies of scale) and to actively reduce the existing regional imbalances in employment and industrial capabilities between Member States (Gaddi and Garbellini 2019). These tasks cannot be delegated to green financial markets, but require an actual industrial plan\u2014which, so far, is missing. Finally, the industrial plan must include tougher (national) regulation and standards. Regulation should not be regarded as a cost, a hindrance or an obstruction. This is a very static view, and a view which neglects the potential 'technology-forcing' impacts of norms, rules, standards which may well force firms to become more innovative; the EU should use this potential in support of the climate transition. Greening the Economy Will Not Lower Living Standards .. The EU's Bismarckian approach to the Green Deal is best illustrated by the following comment by European Commissioner Josep Borrell[8], a leading Spanish social democrat: 'I would like to know if young people demonstrating in Berlin calling for measures against climate change are aware of what such measures will cost them' [.] 'and if they are willing to lower their living standards to offer compensation to Polish miners, because if we fight against climate change for real, they will lose their jobs and will have to be subsidized.' Mr. Borrell's comment brings out the Commission's view that the massive investments needed for the climate transition can only be financed by raising taxes on and lowering living standards of ordinary citizens. This argument is not just bereft of any political vision or plan, but it is also disingenuous, because it is supposes (and wrongly so) that there are no other sources than higher income taxes for the 99% to finance the climate investment. If Mr. Borrell's statement reflects the mood in Brussels, it is indistinguishable from sentiments in Eastern-European Member States, where conservative parties are framing the debate on the climate transition as a hard choice between 'investments in infrastructure and growth' versus 'greening the economy while lowering living standards'. Quite like centre-right politicians in Poland, Hungary and Romania, Mr. Borrell is ignoring the considerable potential for job growth, health co-benefits as well as income growth for ordinary citizens. But let me help Mr. Borrell and highlight a couple of realistic sources of funding the Green Deal, which do not put the burden on ordinary people nor give preferential treatment to global private finance:  Abolishing existing fossil-fuel subsidies of \u20ac250 billion per year. This will raise Member States' government revenue by an estimated \u20ac100 billion per year.  Introducing a tax on carbon of \u20ac75 per tonne of CO2eq. This will generate some \u20ac270 billion as annual tax revenue \u2014 of which \u20ac200 billion can be used to compensate the one-third poorest households, most affected by higher energy prices.  Raising the rate of corporate profit taxation back to the level of the late 1990s (and being tough on corporate tax evasion). This will raise annual tax revenues by \u20ac55 billion. Doing this makes sense: corporations will, without doubt, be major beneficiaries of the Green Deal investment programme and industrial policy.  Introduce a modest wealth tax to channel some of the mostly unearned capital and wealth gains into the public coffers to fund the Green Deal. This could generate around \u20ac175 billion per year for the EU27 as a whole. Note that tax revenues can be increased by a similar amount, even without higher or new taxation, by reducing or eliminating exemptions, loopholes and shelters and reducing (corporate) tax avoidance. Hence, contrary to Mr. Borrell's claim, the Green Deal could be financed without lowering the living standards of 99% of European citizens. On top of all this, the European Commission can leverage more funding without begging private financiers for money. Pension funds in the EU27 hold assets worth more than \u20ac4 trillion. The European Commission could oblige European pension funds to channel (say) one-fourth of their assets (i.e. \u20ac1 trillion or \u20ac100 billion per year during 2020-30) into officially approved Green Deal activities with the risk-free guarantee of a net return of (say) 4%. Concluding Observations Investing these resources (some \u20ac500 billion per year) in renewable energy, housing renovation and public transport will create millions of extra jobs, reduce emissions and save hundreds of thousands of lives \u2014 each year. Compared to the \u20ac250 billion of annual fossil-fuel subsidies paid by the EU and to the (fossil-fuel caused) negative public health externality of \u20ac1 trillion per annum, this package looks like a bargain. This is not the mind set in Brussels, unfortunately, where Mr. Borrell and some of his colleagues in the European Commission worry about the need to choose between 'paying for climate action' versus 'maintaining or raising living standards'. The inconvenient truth is that a transition to climate neutrality is a condition for sustainable economic prosperity. A failure to decarbonize and transit to a zero-carbon economy will inflict considerable economic damage, drastically reduce living standards and increase inequality within the EU, as is clearly shown by the scenarios developed in the European Commission's PESETA III study (2018)[9]. In addition, when properly managed, this Green Deal would generate massive co-benefits in the form of millions of well-paid jobs, an improved quality of life (because of lower air pollution and lower mortality), and reduced inequalities in mobility, life expectancy, and incomes and wealth. The failure to recognize an existential threat (global warming in this case) for what it is and the incapacity to envision an inclusive strategic response to achieve climate neutrality while improving living standards are, to say the least, not very Bismarckian. We cannot leave it to social democrats such as Mr. Borrell or to conservative governments in Central and Eastern Europe to define 'what is politically possible'. Despite of all good intentions, the Commission's Green Deal (as it is) will not work, because the Commission decided to work with and through (financial) markets, taking what Gabor 2020[10]b has called a 'politics as usual, third-way approach that seeks to nudge the market towards decarbonisation.' By choosing to make the Green Deal dependent on global finance, the European Commission itself is closing down all avenues for systemic change through tougher regulation, higher taxation and higher spending, as well as for an ambitious green macroeconomics and green industrial policies, which would enable achieving climate neutrality in a socially and economically inclusive manner. Jeffrey Sachs' assessment is wrong, in other words: what ails the EU Green Deal is exactly what troubles the Union in general \u2014 an absence of social democracy at work. Public finances should be made to work for the common good and be protected from carbon financiers. Post-script The way the European Union is responding to the covid-19 pandemic, or failing to respond, does not augur well for its Green Deal. The coronavirus crisis response so far was a complete car crash[11]: the request for the one-off issuance of 'corona bonds' as a means of European solidarity by the most crisis-struck countries Italy and Spain was rudely rejected by the 'frugal four' - Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland - who argued that the issuance of a common debt instrument would punish the 'frugal' countries, which (arguably) had 'saved' to create sufficient fiscal policy space to respond to the pandemic, but would encourage further fiscal mismanagement by those 'spend-thrift' countries which did not. Solidarity creates just moral hazard, is what my compatriot Wopke Hoekstra, the Dutch minister of finance, incorrectly claims. As a Dutch citizen, I apologise for the disturbing lack of international solidarity as well as the alarming absence of basic political, historical and economic understanding of the process of European economic unification shown by the Dutch government. Italy's prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has it right, when saying: 'If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d'tre to the people. We are at a critical point in European history.' If the Union cannot solve the covid-19 catastrophe in a rational, and therefore solidaristic, manner, the Green Deal will be doomed.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/04/the-eus-green-deal-bismarcks-what-is-possible-versus-thunbergs-what-is-imperative-in-the-age-of-covid-19.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/04/the-eus-green-deal-bismarcks-what-is-possible-versus-thunbergs-what-is-imperative-in-the-age-of-covid-19.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Doomsday scenarios[12], Economic fundamentals[13], Environment[14], Europe[15], Global warming[16], Guest Post[17], Infrastructure[18], Macroeconomic policy[19], Politics[20], Social policy[21] on April 2, 2020[22] by Yves Smith[23].

View original post here[2]. Authored by Kai Weiss via The Mises Institute,[3] It's finally over: the flood of e-mails that every single human being who possesses an inbox has received in the last few weeks thanks to the new data protection rules by the EU. These rules, called GDPR, have caused havoc even before becoming effective on May 25, and have probably caused the greatest spam wave of all time - all in the name of fighting against spam of course.  The GDPR rules were designed to protect European consumers from data violations by big tech companies (Brussels thinks that Facebook, Google and Co. are abusing the rights of its people), and include -just as a best of[4]- a 'right to be forgotten' (meaning that Europeans can ask companies to delete all their data), 'consent' (meaning that the data being processed by a company has to be consented to by the individual - though what 'consent' means is still disputed), an obligation to hire a data protection officer if you are a bigger company, and above all else, hefty fines for infringements. </p><p>Those infringements shall 'be subject to administrative fines up to \u20ac20,000,000, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 percent of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.' What has been the result of these data protection rules after a little over a month? Summing it up in one word would probably be: chaos. As the trillions of e-mails that were sent around the globe showed, no one really understands what the rules are all about - or what to do about it. On the day the rules came into effect, several US pages panickingly switched off their platforms in EU countries,among them[5]the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, and Orlando Sentinel. But not only newspapers have blocked Europeans ever since: the list also includesShoes.com[6],Instapaper[7], and theHistory Channel[8]. Meanwhile, ad companies, being hit the most by the new rules, have pulled out of the EU altogether, includingDrawbridge[9]andVerve[10], citing the GDPR as the reason that they can't continue their business on the Continent anymore. Those staying have had to incur gigantic costs: British companies have reportedly[11]sunk 1.1 billion dollars, and Americans 7.8 billion in preparation for GDPR. Realizing something? In all of the chaos, we haven't mentioned Google and Facebook a single time. Now, it is true that the two corporations werehit[12]with lawsuits of 8.8 billion euros on the first day. Those were filed by Austrian activist Max Schrems, and one single quote of his will be enough to see his understanding of voluntary cooperation in a market system: Facebook has even blocked accounts of users who have not given consent. In the end users only had the choice to delete the account or hit the agree button - that's not a free choice, it more reminds of a North Korean election process.  To translate: Facebook blocking users who do not agree to the conditions to use Facebook is the same as the election process of the world's most evil dictatorship. Other than that, however, experts have warned for a long time that it's likely that big tech companies, which are first and foremost the intended victims of GDPR,could actually profit[13]from the new rules. 'Google and Facebook were already dominant in this market before Europe's new rules came online. Now, they are even more so,'write[14]Laurens Cerulus and Mark Scott. This is the case because 'big tech' had much more resources to adjust to the new rules in time. Google for instance hadprepared[15]for over a year and updated over 12 million contracts, also informing its users about changes. Thus, while normal ad companies might have to leave the European market or incur massive costs to adjust, Google and Facebook will struggle less. Perhaps those ad companies, trying to not go out of business, willeven shift their ads[16]to Google and Facebook, making the tech giants even bigger. This was to be expected: after all, regulations are easier for large companies to get used to, while smaller ones will struggle. The GDPR only seems to be another example of that. The EU's reaction to all of this has been one-of-a-kind: the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, V?ra Jourov, when asked about the difficulties small companies have with the GDPR, replied saying that even she of all people is able to understand what the law means.An interview[17]with the GermanDie ZEITwent like this: ZEIT Online:Big corporations can simply call a lawyer to implement the GDPR. But smaller firms, especially bloggers and clubs, often don't have the money for that and don't know how to implement all criteria.  Jourov:They should send me an e-mail.  It's needless to say that this 'proposal' has been a little overoptimistic. In the meantime, itturned out[18]that the new rules are not even valid for EU institutions. After the European Commission had a leak of personal details of hundreds of European citizens - which would have constituted a breach of the GDPR, the Commission announced that the rules will not affect the EU itself, citing 'legal reasons.' Indeed, the EU will get its own laws somehow 'similar to the GDPR' in fall of this year. All of this would be quite amusing, if not for all the unintended consequences. The GDPR hurts European consumers, companies, its competitiveness and the European economy at-large, all in the name of hurting evil corporations (which it doesn't do). It is true that in the age of big data we may need arethinking of data ownership[19]. But the GDPR will not help one bit - just one month with it has made this clear already.

He was among the first outsiders to hear about the European Union's ambitious plans to keep the technology industry in check, outlined in a series of documents made public a few days later, on February 19th. His visit is an admission that political paralysis in Washington, DC, has handed the EU the opportunity to become the world's most important source of tech regulation. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Europe is both gnome and giant in the tech world. The continent has lots of cutting-edge technology but hardly any significant digital platforms. It accounts for less than 4% of the market capitalisation of the world's 70 largest platforms (America boasts 73% and China 18%). At the same time, the EU is a huge market, with a population of more than 500m, which no tech titan can ignore. It contributes about a quarter of the revenues of Facebook and Google.</p><p>This combination has given rise to what Anu Bradford of Columbia Law School calls, in a new book of the same name, the \"Brussels effect\". Digital services are, in her words, often \"indivisible\". It would be too expensive for big tech firms to offer substantially different services outside the EU. As a result, most have adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, Europe's strict privacy law, as a global standard. Governments, too, have taken more than a page from the EU's data-protection book. About 120 countries have now passed privacy laws, most of which resemble the GDPR and its predecessors.</p><p>The European Commission wants to repeat the trick in other areas. The main document presented this week, a white paper on artificial intelligence, is a grab bag of measures to foster the use of AI in Europe and to limit its perceived dangers. The commission also released a \"strategy\" to promote the use of data, the most important input for AI applications. The idea is to create a \"single European data space\" in which digital information flows freely and securely. To make that happen, the commission wants, among other things, to eliminate legal barriers that keep firms from sharing data, as well as investment in cloud services that facilitate sharing. </p><p>Both papers are part of the EU's overall \"digital strategy\", which was also presented. Later this year the commission will put forward a draft of a \"Digital Services Act\". Dominant tech firms should expect stricter rules not only about how they police the content that users generate, but the extent to which they can discriminate against rivals that use their services. All this is rounded up by a review of competition policy. Details are scarce, but proposed legislation in Germany indicates the direction of travel: data will become far more important for determining whether a company is dominant and whether it has abused its market power.</p><p>There are signs that the Brussels effect will work its magic again. Facebook is not the only tech giant to accept Europe as the world's main source of tech regulation for some time to come. Sundar Pichai, the boss of Alphabet, Google's parent, recently paid a visit to the Belgian capital. He called for \"sensible regulation\" of AI. Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, is a regular guest. America's tech titans also increasingly use the EU to influence the debate at home. It saves some lobbying there, if they can help shape widely adopted regulations that emanate from Europe.</p><p>But the Brussels effect may be less effective than in the past. The ground on which the debate over privacy legislation was conducted had been long established before the GDPR, but regulation in AI is nascent. Experts still quarrel over such basic questions as what AI actually is. And the EU, where politicians tend to favour stricter regulation, may overdo it. This could push the tech giants to differentiate their regional offerings after all (and stymie Europe's startups). Worse, the data strategy could easily turn protectionist.</p><p>If the EU's digital plans became restrictive policy driven by protectionism, that would limit Europe's ability to set global rules which could help to give its firms a much-needed leg up. It would also make it much harder for the EU to establish what the digital world will badly need, should regulation of tech remain stalled in America even after the presidential election. At risk is Europe's role as a third \"techno-sphere\"\u2014one that is not controlled by a handful of tech titans, as it is in America, or by the Chinese state.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-IL8E6LT</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y81-4F71-DY2R-21BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Though one could argue that Google is already one of those.Google has been offering regulators promises, to close this dealGoogle has promised the EU that it would not use Fitbit[2] health data to target ads.

His comments, in typical fashion, covered disparate subjects-from job creation to the \"squad\" of congresswomen he attacks regularly to sanctions against Turkey. Then a reporter asked him about an obscure Pentagon contract called JEDI, and whether he planned to intervene in it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Which one is that?\" Trump asked. \"The Amazon?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reporter was referring to a lucrative and soon-to-be-awarded contract to provide cloud computing services to the Department of Defense. It is worth as much as $10 billion, and Amazon has long been considered the front-runner. But the deal was under intense scrutiny from rivals who said the bid process was biased toward the e-commerce giant.</p><p>\"It's a very big contract,\" said Trump. \"One of the biggest ever given having to do with the cloud and having to do with a lot of other things. And we're getting tremendous, really, complaints from other companies, and from great companies. Some of the greatest companies in the world are complaining about it.\"</p><p>Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM, he continued, were all bristling.</p><p>\"So we're going to take a look at it. We'll take a very strong look at it.\"</p><p>Shortly afterwards, the Pentagon put out an announcement: the contract was on hold until the bid process had been through a thorough review.</p><p>Many saw it as yet another jab by Trump at his nemesis Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Since arriving in the White House, Trump has regularly lashed out at Bezos over Twitter-blaming him for negative press coverage, criticizing Amazon's tax affairs, and even griping about the company's impact on the US Postal Service.</p><p>After all, until just a few months ago most Americans had never heard of JEDI, much less cared about it. Compared with efforts to build large fighter aircraft or hypersonic missiles-the kinds of headline military projects we're used to hearing about-the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure program seemed downright boring. Its most exciting provisions include off-site data centers, IT systems, and web-based applications.</p><p>Perhaps it's equally mundane that Amazon would be in the running for such a contract. It is, after all, the world's leading provider of cloud computing; its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division generated more than $25 billion in revenue in 2018.</p><p>But Trump's diatribe wasn't just about a contract war between a handful of technology companies. It was a spotlight on the changing nature of Amazon and its role in national security and politics. The company has spent the past decade carefully working its way toward the heart of Washington, and today-not content with being the world's biggest online retailer-it is on the brink of becoming one of America's largest defense contractors.</p><p>RETURN OF THE JEDI</p><p>The Sheraton Hotel in Pentagon City, a neighborhood adjacent to the Department of Defense, feels a world away from the ethos of Silicon Valley and its fast-moving startup culture. In March 2018, the 1,000seat ballroom of the 1970s-era brutalist hotel was packed with vendors interested in bidding on JEDI. As the attendees sat in tired King Louis-style ballroom chairs, a parade of uniformed Pentagon officials talked about procurement strategy.</p><p>For the Beltway's usual bidders, this was a familiar sight-until Chris Lynch took the stage. Lynch, described by one defense publication as the \"Pentagon's original hoodie-wearing digital guru,\" was sporting red-framed sunglasses pushed up above his forehead and a Star Wars T-shirt emblazoned with \"Cloud City.\"</p><p>He had arrived at the Pentagon three years earlier to freshen the moribund military bureaucracy. A serial entrepreneur who worked in engineering and marketing in Seattle, he quickly earned the enmity of federal contractors who were suspicious of what the Pentagon planned to do. Some took his casual dress as a deliberate sneer at the buttoned-up Beltway community.</p><p>\"There's a place for that and it's not in the Pentagon,\" says John Weiler, the executive director of the IT Acquisition Advisory Council, an industry association whose members include companies hoping to bid on JEDI. \"I'm sorry, wearing a hoodie and all that stupid stuff? [He's] wearing a uniform to kind of pronounce that he's a geek, but really, he's not.\"</p><p>Even those who weren't offended thought Lynch made it clear where his preferences lay-and it wasn't with traditional federal contractors.</p><p>\"What if we were to take advantage of all these incredible solutions that have been developed and driven by people who have nothing to do with the federal government?\" he asked during his speech to the packed ballroom. \"What if we were to unlock those capabilities to do the mission of national defense? What if we were to take advantage of the long-tail marketplaces that have developed in the commercial cloud industries? That's what JEDI is.\"</p><p>The Pentagon had certainly decided to make some unconventional moves with this contract. It was all going to a single contractor, on an accelerated schedule that would see the contract awarded within months. Many in the audience inferred that the deal was hardwired for Amazon.</p><p>Weiler says the contract has \"big flaws\" and that the Pentagon's approach will end up losing potential cost efficiencies. Instead of having multiple companies competing to keep costs down, there will only be a single cloud from a single provider.</p><p>That one-size-fits-all approach hasn't worked for the CIA-which announced plans to bring in multiple providers earlier this year-and it won't work for the Department of Defense, he says. And he says the deal means all existing apps will be required to migrate to the cloud, whether that's appropriate or not. \"Some things don't belong there,\" he says. \"Some things weren't designed to take advantage of it.\"</p><p>In August 2018, Oracle filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office arguing that the contract was \"designed around a particular cloud service.\" (IBM followed suit shortly afterwards.) The same month, the publication Defense One revealed that RosettiStarr, a Washington investigative firm, had been shopping a dossier to reporters alleging an effort by Sally Donnelly, a top Pentagon official and former outside consultant to Amazon, to favor the e-commerce company. RosettiStarr has refused to identify the client who paid for its work.</p><p>The drama continued. In December 2018, Oracle, which didn't make the cut for the final stage of bidding, filed new documents alleging a conflict of interest. Deap Ubhi, who worked with Lynch in the Pentagon's Defense Digital Services office, had been negotiating employment with Amazon while involved with JEDI, Oracle claimed.</p><p>Questions were also raised about a 2017 visit to the West Coast by James Mattis, then the secretary of defense, which included a visit to Silicon Valley and a drop-in at Amazon's headquarters in Seattle. On his way there, Mattis declared himself a \"big admirer of what they do out there,\" and he was later photographed walking side by side with Bezos.</p><p>(Mattis's admiration for innovation wasn't always matched by his discernment; until 2017, he served on the board of Theranos, the blood diagnostics firm that was exposed as a fraud.)</p><p>Amazon and the Pentagon have denied claims of improper behavior, and in July they received the backing of a federal judge, who ruled that the company had not unduly influenced the contract. That, however, was before President Trump stepped in.</p><p>\"From day one, we've competed for JEDI on the breadth and depth of our services and their corresponding security and operational performance,\" an AWS spokesperson told MIT Technology Review.</p><p>Whatever the outcome of the JEDI review, it's clear that the Pentagon's dependence on Silicon Valley is growing.</p><p>One reason may have to do with the priorities of the Department of Defense itself. Once, it led the way in computer science- many of the technologies that made cloud computing possible, including the internet itself, originated from military-sponsored research. Today, however, the money big tech firms bring to information technology dwarfs what the Pentagon spends on computing research. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which funded the creation of the Arpanet (the precursor to the internet) starting in the 1960s, is still involved in computer science, but when it comes to cloud computing, it is not building its own version.</p><p>Jonathan Smith, a DARPA program manager, says the agency's cloud work today is focused on developing secure, open-source prototypes that could be adopted by anyone, whether in government, academia, or commercial companies, like Amazon.</p><p>\"I mean, pragmatically, when you look at technology, I think in days gone by the DOD was like Godzilla,\" he said. \"But now we're just a big mean machine.\"</p><p>A FORCE AWAKENS</p><p>All this is a rapid turnaround from a little more than a decade ago, when Amazon successfully fought a government subpoena for customer records relating to some 24,000 books as part of a fraud case. \"Well-founded or not, rumors of an Orwellian federal criminal investigation into the reading habits of Amazon's customers could frighten countless potential customers into canceling planned online book purchases,\" the judge wrote in the 2007 ruling in favor of Amazon. Those familiar with the corporate culture at the time say it was generally antagonistic toward working with the government. Unlike Larry Ellison, who has openly bragged about the CIA being the launch customer for Oracle, Bezos was part of a second wave of tech moguls who were wary of ties to the feds.</p><p>Yet the company was already making its first forays into the cloud computing services that would eventually make it an obvious government partner. In 2003 two employees, Benjamin Black and Chris Pinkham, wrote a paper describing a standardized virtual server system to provide computing power, data storage, and infrastructure on demand. If Amazon found this system useful, they suggested, so would other businesses. One day soon, those who didn't want to operate their own servers wouldn't have to: they could just rent them.</p><p>The duo presented the idea to Bezos, who told them to run with it. Launched publicly in March 2006, well before rival services like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, AWS now dominates the market. Cloud services provided Amazon with 13% of its overall business in 2018, and a disproportionate share of its profit. AWS boasts millions of customers, including Netflix, Airbnb, and GE.</p><p>Providing infrastructure to other companies opened the door to serving government agencies. In 2013 AWS scored a surprise victory to become the CIA's cloud computing supplier. The deal, worth $600 million, made Amazon a major national security contractor overnight.</p><p>Since then, things have accelerated. Amazon has been investing heavily in new data centers in Northern Virginia, and in February 2019, after a heavily publicized contest, the company announced it had selected Crystal City, Virginia-a suburb of Washington, DC, less than a mile from the Pentagon- as the site for its second headquarters. (New York was also chosen as a joint winner, but Amazon subsequently dropped its plans following public opposition to the tax breaks the city had given the company.)</p><p>All of this has happened without much friction, whereas other technology giants have had bumpy relationships with the national security apparatus. In 2015 Apple publicly defied the FBI when it was asked to break into a phone owned by one of the perpetrators of a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California (the FBI withdrew its request after paying hackers almost $1 million to gain access). And Google pulled out of the bidding for JEDI last year after an employee revolt over its work on a Pentagon artificial-intelligence contract, Project Maven.</p><p>Amazon has not seen the same kind of staff backlash-perhaps because it is notorious for a hardball approach to labor negotiations. And even when its workers did get restless, it wasn't because of Amazon's CIA or Pentagon links, but because it sold web services to Palantir, the data analytics company that works with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Amazon employees wrote an open letter to Bezos protesting \"immoral U.S. policy,\" but it has had little, if any, effect.</p><p>And it would be a surprise if it did. It's hard to imagine that after more than five years of providing the computer backbone for the CIA as it conducts drone strikes around the world, Amazon would suddenly balk at working on immigration enforcement.</p><p>EMPIRE STRIKES BACK</p><p>So why has Amazon moved into national security? Many think it comes down to cold hard cash. Stephen E. Arnold, a specialist in intelligence and law enforcement software, has used a series of online videos to trace the evolution of Amazon from 2007, when it had \"effectively zero\" presence in government IT, to today, when it appears set to dominate. \"Amazon wants to neutralize and then displace the traditional Department of Defense vendors and become the 21st-century IBM for the US government,\" he says.</p><p>Trey Hodgkins agrees. \"The winner of [the JEDI] contract is going to control a substantial portion of the clouds across the federal government,\" says Hodgkins, until recently a senior vice president at the Information Technology Alliance for Public Sector, an association of IT contractors. The alliance disbanded in 2018 after it raised concerns about JEDI, after which Amazon, one of its members, left and formed its own association. Civilian agencies, he says, look to the Pentagon and say, \"You know what? If it's good enough and substantial enough for them-scalable-then it's probably going to be okay for us.\"</p><p>But Arnold believes Amazon is making a wider move into the global business of law enforcement and security. The company's cloud-based facial-recognition software, Rekognition, which can detect age, gender, and certain emotions as well as identifying faces, is already being used by some police departments, and in 2018 Amazon bought Ring, which makes smart doorbells that capture video.</p><p>Ring might seem like a good consumer investment, but the company, Arnold believes, is creating technology that can mine its treasure trove of consumer, financial, and law enforcement data. \"Amazon wants to become the preferred vendor for federal, state, county, and local government when police and intelligence solutions are required,\" he says. This summer, Vice News revealed that Ring was helping provide video to local police departments.</p><p>But that's only the start. Arnold predicts Amazon will move beyond the US law enforcement and intelligence markets and look globally. That, he predicts, is worth tens of billions of dollars.</p><p>The bottom line isn't the only concern, however: there's also influence. One former intelligence official I spoke with says the government contracts and the Washington Post purchase aren't two distinct moves for Bezos, but part of a broader push into the capital. Far from a conspiracy, he says, it's what captains of industry have always done. \"There's nothing crooked in it,\" the former official said. \"Bezos is just defending his interests.\"</p><p>And perhaps the ultimate goal is not just more government contracts, but influence over regulations that could affect Amazon. Today, some of its biggest threats aren't competitors, but lawmakers and politicians arguing for antitrust moves against tech giants. (Or, perhaps, a president arguing it should pay more taxes.) And Bezos clearly understands that operating in Washington requires access to, and influence on, whoever is in the White House; in 2015 he hired Obama's former press secretary, Jay Carney, as a senior executive, and earlier this year AWS enlisted Jeff Miller, a Trump fund-raiser, to lobby on its behalf.</p><p>Amazon told MIT Technology Review that the national security focus is part of a larger move into the public sector.</p><p>\"We feel strongly that the defense, intelligence, and national security communities deserve access to the best technology in the world,\" said a spokesperson. \"And we are committed to supporting their critical missions of protecting our citizens and defending our country.\"</p><p>Not everyone agrees. Steve Aftergood, who runs the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, has tracked intelligence spending and privacy issues for decades. I asked him if he has any concerns about Amazon's rapid expansion into national security. \"We seem to be racing toward a new configuration of government and industry without having fully thought through all of the implications.

One of her last missteps was in the revelation of her <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">public policy director, Katie Horbath,</emphasis>that the social network would not delete campaign videos with false information.</p><p><br/>U.S. Democratic Party primary nominees Elizabeth Warren responded to this refusal by posting a fake facebook story herself: \"Last minute: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook have just supported Donald Trump in his campaign for re-election,\" the publication began, clarifying below: \"... you must be thinking, 'How can it be true?... The truth is, it's not (I'm sorry.) But what Zuckerberg has done is give Donald Trump the free rein to lie on his platform - and thus pay Facebook piles of money to lie to American voters.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mistrust</emphasis><br/>Since the Cambridge Analytica episode revealed that Facebook allowed personal data to be <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">stolen for the benefit of Donald Trump and Brexit's campaigns,</emphasis>criticism of the social network has been steadily increasing.<br/>This episode already cost Facebook a $5 billion fine imposed by the Us <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</emphasis> Now, the same body has launched another investigation into the owner of WhatsApp and Instagram for alleged monopolistic practices, also linked to their use of data.<br/>This does not stop the tech giant's ambition, however, as the launch of its first cryptocurrency in 2020, Libra, approaches.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The progressive pigtail</emphasis><br/>This is where Break Up Big Tech comes in: a call to separate companies like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google, Facebook and Amazon into smaller companies, with less power in the market.</emphasis><br/>This is not the first time this action has been called in the history of the American country. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Department of Justice sued Microsoft in the 1990s for monopoly practices,</emphasis> accusing Bill Gates's company of using its control over the computer market to force the exit of competing operating systems. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In the end, Microsoft lost the case and was forced to separate.</emphasis> This mandate was annulled and replaced by a more limited agreement in which the company would erect some barriers for external software on Windows.<br/>The most media voices that have joined this slogan are those of the progressive candidates for the next Democratic Party primary election slashes in the US: Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Taking second place in the polls, just behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren appears to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">be a plausible threat to the owners of the big tech companies.</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zuckerberg has not stood idly by in front of this slogan, much less in front of Warren.</emphasis> In a leaked audio in which she discussed various topics with collaborators, the 35-year-old CEO referred to it as an existential threat and commented that \"if she comes elected president, I'm sure we'll have a legal challenge and I'm sure we'll win that legal challenge.\"<br/>src.\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://s1.latercera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/zuckerberg.jpg\">https://s1.latercera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/zuckerberg.jpg</url>\" alt-\"Zuckerberg Facebook\" width-\"900\" height-\"600\" srcset\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://s2.latercera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/zuckerberg.jpg\">https://s2.latercera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/zuckerberg.jpg</url> 900w,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://s2.latercera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/zuckerberg-768x512.jpg\">https://s2.latercera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/zuckerberg-768x512.jpg</url> 768w\" sizes\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /&gt;<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is Warren's plan to separate companies like Facebook?</emphasis><br/>The plan would prohibit companies with global profits of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">$25 billion or more from owning online platforms where third parties (social networks, digital markets, etc.)</emphasis>connect. They would also be banned from participating in these platforms.<br/>Currently, Facebook's market value is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">$530 billion, Amazon's $869 billion, and Google-owning Alphabet is $863 billion.</emphasis><br/>\"Amazon destroys small businesses by copying the goods they sell to the Amazon Marketplace, selling them under their own brand (Amazon Basic),\" Warren explains in his plan. If this runs, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeff Bezos'</emphasis> company would no longer be able to offer this brand of products on its Marketplace platform. Apple, for example, also wouldn't be able to compete against other apps in its own App Store. In addition, Google's visa business would have to be separated from its business as a search engine.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Companies with revenues below $25 billion are allowed to have both platforms and be participants in this.</emphasis> These services, however, must meet standards of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory behavior with users.<br/>The plan also envisages the designation of regulators who would work to undo anti-competitive mergers such as Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and Zappos; Waste, Nest and DoubleClick by Google; and WhatsApp and Instagram on Facebook.

(OTCQX: WEYL) are benefiting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read the full article on Investorideas.com<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorideas.com/News/2019/technology/10230FinTech-Indonesia.asp\">https://www.investorideas.com/News/2019/technology/10230FinTech-Indonesia.asp</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to one recent report, \"Indonesia's fintech industry is in the midst of a period of significant growth. P2P lending recorded a triple-digit increase in 2018, while e-payment services have grown more than six-fold since 2012, prompting a surge of new foreign investment into a vibrant and increasingly diverse start-up community.\"</p><p>A recent article from FinTechNews reported on the growth of the Fintech industry in Indonesia, with specific focus on one of the major players in the industry, the private company Gojek.</p><p>\"Jakarta, Indonesia, is home to Gojek, one of Southeast Asia's leading on-demand multi-service platform and digital payment technology group. Gojek is the first Indonesian unicorn company, and also the first \"decacorn\" company in Indonesia that's worth more than US$10 billion. Gojek operates Indonesia's fourth biggest e-wallet service Go-Pay, and from its headquarters in Jakarta, has expanded across the region to markets including Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.\"</p><p>Weyland Tech, Inc. (OTCQX: WEYL) is also aiming to seize a part of this giant opportunity. Weyland is a growing global provider of m-Commerce and fintech business enablement solutions with its CreateApp\u2122 Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia. They recently reported selected preliminary unaudited financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019.</p><p>The company's subsidiary, Weyland Indonesia Perkasa (WIP), operates AtozPay and AtozGo. The AtozPay mobile payments platform serves the burgeoning m-Commerce and e-Payment markets in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country. AtozGo is a fast-growing short-distance food delivery service in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p><p>For the third quarter 2019, the company expects record revenue of approximately $9.0 million, which would represent an increase of 6.6% compared to the third quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, the company expects record revenue of approximately $24.6 million, which would represent an increase of 42.6% versus the same year-ago period. The company also expects to turn adjusted EBITDA positive in the third quarter.</p><p>\"These anticipated record results reflect the accelerating growth in our recurring revenue from CreateApp subscription fees,\" said Brent Suen, CEO of Weyland Tech. \"While we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, we plan to continue to reinvest in efforts designed to gain customers and market share.\"</p><p>\"The growth in recurring revenue was largely due to greater adoption of CreateApp by SMBs in our existing markets as driven by our highly-productive channel partners,\" continued Suen. \"The increased adoption included new customers as well as existing customers subscribing to additional features and modules. This momentum has continued into the fourth quarter, keeping us on track for another year of record growth.\"</p><p>Offered in 14 languages with more than 70 integrated modules, Weyland enables SMBs to create and deploy native mobile applications for Apple iOS and Google Android without technical knowledge or background. The technology empowers SMBs to increase sales, reach more customers, manage logistics, and promote their products and services in an easy, affordable and highly efficient way.</p><p>Gojek was most recently in the news as Gojek CEO and co-Founder, Nadiem Makarim announced on Monday that he had resigned to join Indonesia's new cabinet. The ride-hailing and payments company said two senior executives would jointly take over running operations of the $10 billion firm.</p><p>As we continue to see this trend of big tech companies willing to invest such large sums into this expanding market, Indonesia looks to remain a hub for the Fintech industry moving forward, for both large scale investors and startups looking to expand the revenue models and get in early on this rapidly growing market.</p><p>About Investorideas.com - News that Inspires Big Investing Ideas Investorideas.com is a recognized news source publishing third party news, research and original financial content.

(OTCQX: WEYL) are benefiting.Read the full article on Investorideas.com       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorideas.com/News/2019/technology/10230FinTech-Indonesia.asp\">https://www.investorideas.com/News/2019/technology/10230FinTech-Indonesia.asp</url>[2]According to one recent report[3], \"Indonesia's fintech industry is in the midst of a period of significant growth. </p><p>P2P lending recorded a triple-digit increase in 2018, while e-payment services have grown more than six-fold since 2012, prompting a surge of new foreign investment into a vibrant and increasingly diverse start-up community.\"A recent article from FinTechNews[4] reported on the growth of the Fintech industry in Indonesia, with specific focus on one of the major players in the industry, the private company Gojek. \"Jakarta, Indonesia, is home to Gojek, one of Southeast Asia's leading on-demand multi-service platform and digital payment technology group. Gojek is the first Indonesian unicorn company, and also the first \"decacorn\" company[5] in Indonesia that's worth more than US$10 billion. Gojek operates Indonesia's fourth biggest e-wallet service Go-Pay, and from its headquarters in Jakarta, has expanded across the region to markets including Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.\"Weyland Tech, Inc. (OTCQX: WEYL) is also aiming to seize a part of this giant opportunity. Weyland is a growing global provider of m-Commerce and fintech business enablement solutions with its CreateApp\u2122 Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia. They recently reported[6] selected preliminary unaudited financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019.The company's subsidiary, Weyland Indonesia Perkasa (WIP), operates AtozPay and AtozGo. The AtozPay mobile payments platform serves the burgeoning m-Commerce and e-Payment markets in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country. AtozGo is a fast-growing short-distance food delivery service in Jakarta, Indonesia.For the third quarter 2019, the company expects record revenue of approximately $9.0 million, which would represent an increase of 6.6% compared to the third quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, the company expects record revenue of approximately $24.6 million, which would represent an increase of 42.6% versus the same year-ago period. The company also expects to turn adjusted EBITDA positive in the third quarter.\"These anticipated record results reflect the accelerating growth in our recurring revenue from CreateApp subscription fees,\" said Brent Suen, CEO of Weyland Tech. \"While we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, we plan to continue to reinvest in efforts designed to gain customers and market share.\"\"The growth in recurring revenue was largely due to greater adoption of CreateApp by SMBs in our existing markets as driven by our highly-productive channel partners,\" continued Suen. \"The increased adoption included new customers as well as existing customers subscribing to additional features and modules. This momentum has continued into the fourth quarter, keeping us on track for another year of record growth.\"Offered in 14 languages with more than 70 integrated modules, Weyland enables SMBs to create and deploy native mobile applications for Apple iOS and Google Android without technical knowledge or background. The technology empowers SMBs to increase sales, reach more customers, manage logistics, and promote their products and services in an easy, affordable and highly efficient way.Gojek was most recently in the news[7] as Gojek CEO and co-Founder, Nadiem Makarim announced on Monday that he had resigned to join Indonesia's new cabinet. The ride-hailing and payments company said two senior executives would jointly take over running operations of the $10 billion firm. As we continue to see this trend of big tech companies willing to invest such large sums into this expanding market, Indonesia looks to remain a hub for the Fintech industry moving forward, for both large scale investors and startups looking to expand the revenue models and get in early on this rapidly growing market.

(OTCQX: WEYL) are benefiting. Read the full article on Investorideas.comhttps://www.investorideas.com/News/2019/technology/10230FinTech-Indonesia.asp According to onerecent report , \"Indonesia's fintech industry is in the midst of a period of significant growth. P2P lending recorded a triple-digit increase in 2018, while e-payment services have grown more than six-fold since 2012, prompting a surge of new foreign investment into a vibrant and increasingly diverse start-up community.\"A recent article fromFinTechNewsreported on the growth of the Fintech industry in Indonesia, with specific focus on one of the major players in the industry, the private company Gojek. </p><p>\"Jakarta, Indonesia, is home to Gojek, one of Southeast Asia's leading on-demand multi-service platform and digital payment technology group. Gojek is the first Indonesian unicorn company, and also thefirst \"decacorn\" companyin Indonesia that's worth more than US$10 billion. Gojek operates Indonesia's fourth biggest e-wallet service Go-Pay, and from its headquarters in Jakarta, has expanded across the region to markets including Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.\" Weyland Tech, Inc. (OTCQX: WEYL) is also aiming to seize a part of this giant opportunity. Weyland is a growing global provider of m-Commerce and fintech business enablement solutions with its CreateApp\u2122 Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia. They recently reportedselected preliminary unaudited financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019.The company's subsidiary, Weyland Indonesia Perkasa (WIP), operates AtozPay and AtozGo. The AtozPay mobile payments platform serves the burgeoning m-Commerce and e-Payment markets in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country. AtozGo is a fast-growing short-distance food delivery service in Jakarta, Indonesia.For the third quarter 2019, the company expects record revenue of approximately $9.0 million, which would represent an increase of 6.6% compared to the third quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, the company expects record revenue of approximately $24.6 million, which would represent an increase of 42.6% versus the same year-ago period. The company also expects to turn adjusted EBITDA positive in the third quarter.\"These anticipated record results reflect the accelerating growth in our recurring revenue from CreateApp subscription fees,\" said Brent Suen, CEO of Weyland Tech. \"While we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, we plan to continue to reinvest in efforts designed to gain customers and market share.\"\"The growth in recurring revenue was largely due to greater adoption of CreateApp by SMBs in our existing markets as driven by our highly-productive channel partners,\" continued Suen. \"The increased adoption included new customers as well as existing customers subscribing to additional features and modules. This momentum has continued into the fourth quarter, keeping us on track for another year of record growth.\"Offered in 14 languages with more than 70 integrated modules, Weyland enables SMBs to create and deploy native mobile applications for Apple iOS and Google Android without technical knowledge or background. The technology empowers SMBs to increase sales, reach more customers, manage logistics, and promote their products and services in an easy, affordable and highly efficient way.Gojek was mostrecently in the newsas Gojek CEO and co-Founder, Nadiem Makarim announced on Monday that he had resigned to join Indonesia's new cabinet. The ride-hailing and payments company said two senior executives would jointly take over running operations of the $10 billion firm. As we continue to see this trend of big tech companies willing to invest such large sums into this expanding market, Indonesia looks to remain a hub for the Fintech industry moving forward, for both large scale investors and startups looking to expand the revenue models and get in early on this rapidly growing market.

Data makes us more malleable, easier to predict, and extremely prone to influence. For retailers and marketers, being able to understand their customers' behaviours, preferences and aversions - so they can predict their needs and provide more targeted sales pitches - is the Holy Grail.</p><p>The Internet is now saturated with bots, artificial intelligence, and links to all 'things' in society. And, a large part of it is managed by a small handful of global conglomerates - Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. These are the four most influential companies on the planet; and, they're worth an astounding $2.3 trillion USD (Galloway, 2017, p. 1). Together, they're responsible for an array of products and services that are woven into the daily lives of billions of people around the globe. What does their unprecedented scale and influence mean for the future of the Internet economy? How does the concentration of companies at the top effect our experience and access to the Internet?</p><p>When it comes to social networking sites like Facebook (which makes money from helping companies market products and services to particular demographics), the individual is caught within a web of inter-locking social and commercial relationships over which he or she has very little autonomy and control (Rifkin, 2003, p. 103). The norm is widely-distributed electronic openness; and, you have to deliberately carve out limited zones of privacy (Mitchell, 2004, p. 29). Indeed, we've already been going down a path toward a future in which people are monitored around-the-clock and there's scarcely any personal privacy left.</p><p>When combined with facial recognition technologies and a web of other data, like one's Facebook or Tinder profile, government identification, workplace, medical history, and more, a single snapshot can create a detailed picture of a person that traces their entire lifespan. With credit card data you can also get picture of a person's spending habits and track their movements 24/7. China is currently leading the way when it comes to this type of omnipresent surveillance; but, it's possible for Western countries to follow in China's footsteps, especially since the underlying technology keeps improving.</p><p>While promising to be helpful and even thoughtful, the pervasive power and persistence of advertising platforms embraced by tech giants like Facebook has become downright creepy. Some ads now seem more like stalkers than helpful friends - if, say, you've been online searching for a new pair of jeans, now those same pants begin to follow you around the Web, prodding you to take another look and luring you with progressively better deals and rewards (Wu, 2016, p. 323). Thanks to AI, we can now track behavior at a level and scale previously unconceivable (Galloway, 2017, p. 196).</p><p>Rhetorically, the big tech companies peddle individuality and empowerment of the user; but they really want to see their algorithms automating our way of life in exchange for vast catalogues of our intentions, motivations and aversions (Foer, 2017, p. 323). At the same time, there's rarely a clear picture about how they operate. In fact, they cultivate monopolies, covertly influence our behavior, give some types of information preference over others, and secretly disclose our personal information to other entities. They do this with virtually no oversight, transparency, or informed consent, irrespective of what they choose to disclose to the public.</p><p>This article consists of four parts. Following the introduction, Part I considers the evolution of Big Tech from the hippie counterculture movement of the 1960s through to today. Part II examines our current online world of mass surveillance, data harvesting and targeted marketing. As global tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook expanded their reach across the Internet to mine, repurpose and monetize data, they have created giant networks of surveillance and tracking, which feed into localized centres of control. Part III looks at the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal that prompted investigations into Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and widespread calls for the regulation of Big Tech. Part IV examines the lack of trust and accountability that Facebook now faces from its users and regulators. Currently, the FTC is investigating Facebook for privacy violations which relate to how the company shared data with outside developers in the past. Lastly, conclusion briefly looks at the way forward.</p><p>I.How it All Began</p><p>Ironically, Silicon Valley's penchant for monopoly dates back to the hippie counterculture of the 1960s where it emerged from the spirit of idealism, transformation and cooperation (Foer, 2017, p. 12). Once the Internet was released to the masses, it was no longer just a technology - it was a movement. There was an expectation of a great transformation; and, a belief in something truly extraordinary. The Internet would serve as 'a new global commons,' liberating us from the enslavement of television and the isolating, anti-social act of reading books that tech theorists like Marshall McLuhan disdained. It would counteract the destructive forces of individualism and usher in an era of creativity and collaboration. How this might work in practice remained prophetically vague - it would take decades to see how it would unfold (Wu, 2016, p. 253).</p><p>Stewart Brand (1989) was a hippie for the ages. As the founder of the Whole Earth Catalogue, Brand was at the center of some of the most intriguing events of the 1960s: he hung out with the writer Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters; he featured in Tom Wolfe's travelogue The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test; and, he was one of the organizers of the infamous Trips Festival in San Francisco, which featured six thousand hippies, plenty of LSD, and the Grateful Dead (Rheingold, 2000, p. 26). Brand (1989) also inspired a revolution in computing which profoundly shaped the future of technology (Foer, 2017, p. 13).</p><p>The early network culture of the Internet had an egalitarian spirit and a left-leaning socialist mission, whereby the system - and the information it provided - was open, public and free. In his 1987 book The Media Lab, Brand quoted Howard Rheingold's (2000) reflection on the existence of computer-linked communities as relaxed, friendly, welcoming 'places':</p><p>There's always another mind there. It's like having the corner bar, complete with old buddies and delightful newcomers and tools waiting to take home and fresh graffiti and letters, except instead of putting on my coat, shutting down the computer, and walking to the corner, I just invoke my telecom program and there they are. It's a place (Brand, 1989, p. 24).</p><p>Everything the hippie culture despised - the mindless submission of the worker, the tyranny of bureaucracy and the oppressiveness of centralised control - could be overcome in a virtual network where the individual had the freedom to find his inspiration, shape his environment, and share his passions and interests with likeminded people (Foer, 2017, p. 19). The existence of these computer-linked communities was, in fact, predicted in 1968 by J.C.R. Linklater, one of the research directors for the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) - the precursor to the Internet. Linklater wrote that, \"life will be happier for the on-line individual because the people with whom one interacts most strongly will be selected more by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity (Rheingold, 2000, p. 19).\" As such, these digital communities could become the agorae of modern life and empower individuals to be more open, expressive and free.</p><p>Spiritual prophesies about the revolutionary potential of technologies, and the underlying manifesto they preached - which saw technology as a tool of liberation and collaboration - have been echoed by leading technology firms ever since. The spirit of egalitarianism and openness imbued within hippie culture are still apparent in the fact that big tech leaders typically eschew corner offices, preferring to sit amongst their staff in open spaces wearing the same T-shirts and jeans as those who are far beneath them on the pay grid (Foer, 2017, p. 20). And, by and large, they continue to view themselves as powerful agents of change - liberating the masses and creating new places where communities can flourish in a new era of openness and cooperation.</p><p>Another powerful metaphor that was popular in the early days of online communities depicted the first inhabitants of cyberspace as venturing into a new electronic frontier. For instance, in the early to mid-1990s, John Perry Barlow wrote a number of columns in Wired magazine in which he maintained that cyberspace is an independent \"frontier\" with its own rules and norms and that it would be impossible for any government to regulate it.</p><p>Like Brand (1989), Barlow was not your stereotypical computer geek. He worked as a cattle rancher in Wyoming and also wrote lyrics for the Grateful Dead. He was the first person to use William Gibson's science fiction term cyberspace - first coined in the 1984 novel Neuromancer - to describe this innovative domain. And, also like Brand (1989), he channelled the spiritual yearnings of his generation into musings about cyberspace.</p><p>The hacker credo 'information wants to be free' was a battle cry for the liberation of the Internet. These sentiments undoubtedly inspired many who designed significant social projects - without any expectation of profit - such as Linux, Wikipedia and the Creative Commons (Foer, 2017, p. 26). Paradoxically, they've also been trumpeted by powerful tech giants like Facebook. For example, if you walk through Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, you'll find a two-story mural - it looks like a massive totem pole filled with abstract shapes, and in the middle, there's a single word: hack (McMillan, 2015).</p><p>Yet, if we assume that information is 'disembodied' - that it floats freely through digital networks, unaffected by social, legal, political and cultural contexts - much is overlooked (Lyon, 2008b, p. 506). The general decline of face-to-face relationships that networked technologies promote has actually led to a demand for more 'tokens of trust' - in the form of social insurance numbers, PINs, barcodes, photo IDs and, increasingly, biometrics (Lyon, 2008a, p. 36). Thus, in the modern state, networked communications are increasingly dependent upon data that are said to be 'about me (Lyon, 2008b, 507).'</p><p>The comparison of data from different sources is now routinized, as we leave traces of our data behind whenever we engage in the routine transactions of modern society (Bennett, 2008, p. 52). David Lyon has thus suggested that surveillance systems 'bring back' disappearing bodies, by making them visible to organizations, agencies and authorities: \"[t]he existence of contemporary surveillance systems in a sense reconnects bodily persons with data about them, by constituting them as high-value consumers, terror suspects, loan defaulters, free-flight eligibles or whatever (Lyon, 2008b, p. 507).\"</p><p>Another, more practical, reason for the perceived lack of control in cyberspace owes itself to the free-market optimism that animated so much thinking about the Internet, information law and policy. From the beginning, there was intense worry about the risks of state intervention and coercion, combined with astonishing inattentiveness to the ramifications of what might happen if the Internet pioneers were left alone to accumulate enormous amounts of power and wealth (Cohen, 1930). Much of the credit for economic boom during the mid-to-late 1990s was attributed to e-commerce and new opportunities for selling and delivering goods and services online (Regan, 2003, p. 14). The idea was to let the market be free and unencumbered by government regulation that might have the effect of stifling innovation and creativity (Regan, 2003, p. 14).</p><p>Various calls for intervention and regulation sparked intense criticism; and, the primary idea for a policy solution was simply that of \"self-regulation.\" The theory was that if privacy is important to consumers, online organisations would respond and provide protection. In essence, the market would police itself and outside regulation would not be necessary. Yet, the online world does not represent a perfect market; and, vast power and information asymmetries need to be corrected. Nevertheless, concerns about stifling market and technological innovation surpassed concerns about the commodification and misuse of personal information.</p><p>Yet, the idea of the Internet as a true marketplace of ideas, or even a confessional corner, was actually quite vulnerable. The institutional forces that ultimately overcame this utopian dream came from the Internet itself - thus, there was nothing about its code that would keep it free, open and non-commercial forever (Wu, 2016, p. 275). And, rather than creating a practical manifestation of the counterculture's ideals, massive amounts of effort and resources have been directed toward replicating the world as it is and perpetuating its social, political and economic ills, rather than remedying it for the better.</p><p>Over time, this business model proved to be enormously successful. Before long, one company - Google - became the source of all knowledge; another - Facebook - became the portal to all social connections; and, a third - Amazon - became Earth's biggest store (Foer, 2017, p. 28). Make no mistake about it, we're not the customers of these big tech giants; we're the product they sell to their real customers - fortune 500 companies. This hidden marketing agenda was bluntly revealed in an open letter to customers by Apple's CEO Tim Cook in 2014: \"...when an online service is free, you're not the customer. You're the product (Selk, 2018).\" Indeed, we are little more than \"tenant farmers\" for the big tech companies, \"working their land by producing data that they in turn sell for a profit (Schneier, 2015b).\"</p><p>Facebook has invested a lot of money in developing metrics to convince its advertisers that their ads are valuable because even when users aren't clicking on them, they're seeing the product content (Wu, 2016, p. 300). It also allows advertisers to create their own pages, and to buy space in users' news feeds; and, with the 'like' button feature, users can freely promote and endorse products to their friends (Wu, 2016, p. 300). More sneakily, Facebook's heavy investment in tracking technologies enables it to follow users around the Web and report back to their advertisers - \"she's looking at airline tickets!\" - which allows, for example, US Airways to bombard the user with targeted ads on Facebook advertising airfares and, perhaps, even a free upgrade on her news feed (Wu, 2016, p. 300).</p><p>Largely unbeknownst to the general public, Facebook has become extremely rich from this business model, by which it cleverly mines and exploits the enormous trove of demographic data its users have given it free access to. To illustrate: in its 2017 annual financial report, Facebook revealed, \"We generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers (Borchers, 2018).\" In fact, $39.94 billion of Facebook's $40.65 billion in total revenue - 98 percent - came from ads.</p><p>The profit-making power now held by tech giants like Facebook and Google is what keeps fierce corporate rivalry at bay - start-ups, for example, no longer aspire to displace these companies, but launch with the hope of getting bought up by the few goliaths in the marketplace (Foer, 2017, p. 31). Indeed, Facebook bought the five-year old, fifty employee instant messaging firm WhatsApp for a whopping $20 billion USD (Galloway, 2017, p. 7). It also owns Instagram which, along with WhatsApp and Facebook, are three of the five platforms that accumulated 100 million users the fastest (Galloway, 2017, p. 96). Aside from family, work and sleep, billions of people now spend more time on these platforms than any other activity (Galloway, 2017, p. 96).</p><p>The importance of free and open networks, which appealed to many in the early days of the digital revolution, has clearly been flaunted by companies like Google and Facebook, which are subject to little regulation or market competition (Schneier, 2015a, 60). Hidden within this agenda - of making information freely accessible to everyone - was always a price: the collection of our personal data in increasingly aggressive yet covert ways (West, 2017, p. 17). These companies have made billions of dollars promoting the idea that transparency is an inherent good, and, conversely, that secrets are intrinsically bad; yet, this only extends to their user-base, not to themselves. As Cory Doctorow observed: \"...if it's a bargain, it's a curious, one-sided arrangement (Doctorow, 2012, p. 1).\"</p><p>Cyberspace has become one of the most centralized mediums on the planet. The big tech companies that power most of the online content - Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple - are the most powerful gatekeepers the world has ever known (Foer, 2017, p. 5). Indeed, sixty-two percent of Americans get their news from social media - primarily from Facebook; and, a third of all traffic to media sites flows through Google (Foer, 2017, p. 6). Of course, we highly reward entrepreneurship in Big Tech culture. We elevate the executives running these companies to hero or even God-like status. Yet, it's far more than just 'entrepreneurship' at work here. We have long celebrated extremely powerful and wealthy companies, like Facebook and Google, and allowed them to become larger, richer, and more powerful, without any competition or alternative for consumers.</p><p>How did this happen? The collection of user data didn't begin with Google or Facebook; in fact, it pre-dates the development of both platforms entirely. First introduced in Netscape Navigator 1.1 in 1995, cookies made it possible for servers to keep track of users' activities in ways that enabled e-commerce and soon led to targeted advertising (West, 2017, p. 8). Banner ads d\u00e9buted the same month as the cookie; and, although they were touted as helping to \"tailor advertising more closely to what consumers want,\" there were no features allowing users to modify their preferences, much less block them altogether (West, 2017, p. 8). Nevertheless, unlike the blogs and other open and creative spaces that were popular in the early days of the Internet, users channeled their energy into upgrading the value of these commercially-driven platforms (Wu, 2016, p. 301).</p><p>By 2010, The Wall Street Journal reported that the 50 most-visited sites on the Internet placed more than 3,000 tracking files on users' computers, making it possible for them to track users on pages belong to other sites and, more generally, as they flitted their way across the Web (West, 2017, p. 9). This was only the beginning of the advertising business model that has become essential to the growth and shape of the Internet, and the origins of the commercial surveillance infrastructure as we now know it. Over time, through the covert technique of \"attention arbitrage\" the monopolists consolidated their power and influence, while rewarding us enough to keep us hooked (Wu, 2016, p. 301).</p><p>Of course, marketers have long been interested in siphoning data about consumers and using it to make predictions about their choices and behaviour - with the hope of eventually influencing them. The growth in the use of customer surveys and polls in the 1950s and '60s was used to render the post-war consumer understandable to researchers, political pollsters and marketers. By the 1980s, the means used to collect data about consumers shifted to the recording of credit card purchases and telephone calls (West, 2017, p. 6).</p><p>In the commercial world of the 1990s, an important change took place in the collection and use of consumer data. No longer content with survey-style data on existing customers, the goal was to find mathematical models that could identify the unknown individual - the as-yet-unencountered consumer who could be targeted (Amoore, 25). Thus, the modes of identification deployed within contemporary marketing schemes and proposals - particularly when it comes to data mining and social network analysis - have a great deal in common with those used to identify, locate and influence newer - and more narrowly-targeted - audiences based on knowledge of their online transactions and associated patterns of behavior.</p><p>II.Mass Surveillance, Data Harvesting and Targeted Marketing</p><p>As technologies progressed, those involved in the collection and aggregation of data gained increasing leverage in their ability to track users, generate profiles about them, cross-reference data with other information about them, and sell it to others. Now, most of our electronic clicks, taps and swipes are captured and recorded by someone. Indeed, nearly every mundane aspect of our lives today produces a digital trace - communicating with friends and family, ordering books, buying groceries, going to work, and so on (West, 2017, p. 2). This data is then easily combined with other information from the digital or physical world.</p><p>Thus, it is now commonplace for information deemed not to be \"sensitive\" to be freely compiled, transmitted, and exchanged. Even data about the seemingly trivial aspects of our lives (e.g. pizza orders) has become a valuable commodity and can easily be fed into algorithms and used to predict our behaviour in lucrative ways. These practices provide the means for advertisers to reach, target, and manipulate their audience (Nissenbaum, 1998, p. 590). For many, this comes as a major source of privacy invasion; yet, because the data is eagerly shared, people are, in many cases, complicit in the violation of their own confidentiality (Nissenbaum, 1998, p. 565).</p><p>Two factors underlie this trend: the rapid development of information technology coupled with an insatiable desire to know - \"whatever may be useful to someone, somewhere, or what may become so in the future (Nissenbaum, 1998, p. 592).\" This practice has come to be known as 'data capitalism' - a system in which \"the commoditization of our data enables an asymmetric redistribution of power that is weighted toward the actors who have access and the capability to make sense of information (West, 2017, p. 4).\" As global tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook expanded their reach across the Internet to mine, repurpose and monetize data, they have created giant networks of surveillance and tracking, which feed into localized centres of control (West, 2017, p. 13).</p><p>The real genius behind this system is that they have convinced their customers that they are engaging in social rather than purely economic activity - or, in the very least, the two have become so tightly blurred that it's nearly impossible to distinguish one from the other. Indeed, the targeting for commercial ends is done person-by-person, so it's quite easy for polarizing messages to be widely distributed and masked at the same time. New algorithms let the data infer things about us we've never disclosed. So, I may have never talked about my politics or religious beliefs online, but the things I like or the pages I visit can be used to infer my politics or my religious beliefs. The number of inferences that can be made from the data we reveal is very powerful and can be used to profile us in all sorts of ways.</p><p>The news feed provides a reverse chronological index of all the status updates, articles, and photos that your friends have posted on Facebook. It's meant to solve the problem of our growing inability to sift through masses of information; thus, it has been turned into a \"personalized newspaper\" for users (Foer, 2017, p. 72). In fact, Facebook's algorithms interpret \"more than one hundred thousand signals\" and sort the information, deciding what we might like to read (Foer, 2017, p. 73). Many users - as many as 60 percent - are apparently completely unaware of this practice (Foer, 2017, p. 73).</p><p>Yet, the harvesters of information are keenly aware of the qualitative shift that can occur when bits of data revealed in one context are shifted to another and compiled into profiles. At times, the shift may cross not only contextual lines but temporal lines as information collected in the past is introduced into a current setting (Nissenbaum, 585). So, the data may be willingly disclosed in 2015, but predicting what the implications of that might be down the track - say, in 2020 - can be very difficult for the individual.</p><p>In reality, data brokers often act in ways that mask the source of their data, including buying and combining information from other brokers, thereby making it extremely difficult for consumers to retrace the paths through which their data were collected (West, 2017, p. 12). Thus, once the data is freely handed over, its potential use is virtually limitless and consent is un-revocable. Given the uncertainty around technological developments going forward, this should make us extremely nervous. People generally resent the rampant and unauthorized distribution of information about themselves, not only when this violates the integrity of an intimate and highly personal sphere, but also when it breaches contextual and temporal integrity (Nissenbaum, 1998, 586).</p><p>Yet, for many consumers, the ease of convenience and the disguise of benevolence provided by these systems keeps us lulled into complacency. Facebook is popular because it helps billions of people fill a void and connect with others in the otherwise vacuous online space. These seemingly benevolent technologies have become tightly integrated into the fabric of our societies - just as Orwell and Huxley predicted. Facebook, for its part, has become our online living room: it's the place where we chat with friends, hold forth about the news, organize events, grieve over things we've lost, celebrate babies, pets, engagements, new jobs, new shoes, and vacations.</p><p>Meanwhile, news-feed algorithms reinforce certain kinds of behavior and keep us in a feedback loop of positive and negative rewards. Positive feedback comes from friends who 'like' your posts; negative reinforcement comes when you only get a few responses to a personal disclosure, prompting you to question your self-worth and aim harder to please. Behavioral scientists call this 'intermittent reinforcement;' and, it's one of the most powerful performance-modifying techniques known to man (Doctorow, 2012, p. 66). For Facebook, there's nothing particularly clever or inventive about this business model - it's merely exploiting the dynamics of acceptance and rejection, buttressing deep-rooted insecurities and the sophomoric desire to be in the 'cool crowd (Wu, 2016, p. 291).'</p><p>III.A Wakeup Call</p><p>Facebook was recently plagued with controversy around the spreading of fake news, foreign agents acting as trolls, and a lot of other problems that emanate, in large part, from a scandal that originated in 2014. That year, Cambridge Analytica, a Londonbased firm that specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages, put out a request on Amazon's \"Mechanical Turk\" platform, a global Internet marketplace enabling individuals and businesses to meet and coordinate the performance of various tasks (Tufekci, 2018). Cambridge Analytica was seeking people who were Facebook users in the United States. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz on Facebook called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" (Tufekci, 2018).\"</p><p>About 270,000 Facebook users responded and downloaded the app (Tufekci, 2018). At the time, Facebook allowed app developers to access not only user data but the data of their friends. Thus, the app acquired information from these users' Facebook profiles, as well as detailed information from their friends' profiles, resulting in about 50 million Facebook profiles accessed (Tufekci, 2018). Most of those people had no inkling that their data was harvested - they hadn't installed the app themselves (Tufekci, 2018). Meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016 and it promised that its \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States (Dwoskin, 2018). It also used micro-targeting to serve up pro-Trump messages that resonated with specific voters (Galloway, 2017, p. 106).</p><p>In mid-March, 2018, this scandal was exposed by The New York Times and the London Observer. Facebook made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and fervently denied that this was a \"data breach.\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that, \"the claim that this is a data breach is completely false (Tufekci, 2018).\" He insisted that Facebook users, \"knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked (Tufekci, 2018).\" He also said that, \"everyone involved gave their consent (Tufekci, 2018).\"</p><p>In her New York Times opinion piece on this situation, Zeynep Tufekci, an Associate Professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, stated the following:</p><p>This wasn't a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an alltoo-natural consequence of Facebook's business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook's users. Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook's true customers, whom it works hard to please (Tufekci, 2018).</p><p>In 2015, Facebook removed the app and demanded guarantees from Cambridge Analytica that the information had been destroyed. The company certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports in March of 2018 that the data was not deleted (Tufekci, 2018).</p><p>In fact, Russian agents abused the company's networks to target millions of American voters with 'fake news' during 2016 presidential campaign. On May 10, 2018, House Intelligence Committee Democrats published downloadable files with more than 3,500 ads to their website (Wagner, 2018b). These are Facebook ads that were purchased by the Internet Research Agency (the \"IRA\"), a Kremlin-backed \"online troll farm,\" both before and after the election. The Trump campaign also made significant use of Facebook and the social network has been criticized for having its employees connect with Trump campaign staffers.</p><p>In February 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian individuals linked to the IRA (Kafka, 2018). The indictment blames Russia for starting a social media campaign aimed at disrupting \"the lawful governmental functions of the United States (Kafka, 2018).\" It claims the IRA \"engaged in operations to interfere in elections and political processes,\" adding that the group, \"posted derogatory information about a number of candidates (Wagner, 2018b).\" In other words, the Russians set up bogus accounts and masqueraded as regular users who promoted Donald Trump or vilified Hillary Clinton (Kafka, 2018). What's more, the IRA bought thousands of ads and posted tens of thousands of other posts, promoting both sides of contentious political issues like gun control and race relations (Wagner, 2018b).</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg has openly acknowledged that his company has a strong view about what's best for you and how to get you there: \"[t]o get people to this point where there's more openness - that's a big challenge. But I think we'll do it,\" Zuckerberg has said (Garber, 2012). With its power, size and influence over people worldwide, Facebook clearly has this power within its sites. And, indeed, Zuckerberg has stated that, \"[i]n a lot of ways, Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company (Farrell, et. al., 2018).\" With its vast influence and wealth, it's hard not to see that Facebook does, in fact, have much in common with a sovereign nation-state. It has long operated with absolute impunity, while abusing the immense trust vested in it, and it has the power to completely change the way businesses and individuals behave and relate to each other, on a universal scale.</p><p>Earlier this year, Facebook launched a 'petitions feature' called Community Actions. It will allow users to which will allow users to create, support and share petitions and notify their local officials of actions that they'd like to see happen (Liptak, 2019). Petition advocates will be able to discuss the topic with fellow supporters on the page, and will also be able to create events and fundraisers. Interestingly, this isn't the first time that the company has developed tools to get users more politically-involved.</p><p>Facebook already initiated a number of features designed to get people more involved in their communities, such as the Town Hall feature, which helps users access their local officials; as well as the Candidate feature, which allows political candidates to target their constituents with videos (Liptak, 2019). Facebook states that its Community Actions feature is a means by which \"people [can] advocate for changes in their communities and partner with elected officials and government agencies on solutions (Liptak, 2019)\" all within the safety and comfort of the Facebook site. Thus, the company has clearly decided to branch out into local markets and enable local communities to organize around sensitive topics and directly engage in the political process. This will no doubt provide vocal interest groups a podium from which to self-promote their ideas and pressure politicians with their agendas.</p><p>Why would Facebook want to do that, particularly when they've recently been the subject of so much condemnation for their involvement in the political process? First, controversy drives engagement, which benefits the platform. All Facebook needs to do is ensure that the Community Actions go viral and then sit back and wait for people to hit the \"Support\" button. The more debate there is around a topic, the more people get involved and share their views. This generates more data for Facebook, through the creation of micro-communities which both produce and attract new content, which translates to more power and influence for Facebook - in terms of its ability to understand us and shape our preferences and purchases - as well as more potential revenue for its privately owned-platform. Facebook can target those users with ads and glean new information about them. Thus, the motives behind Facebook's ever-expanding foray into local politics are not as altruistic as supporters might think.</p><p>As the Cambridge Analytica scandal demonstrated, bad actors can really misuse Facebook's features - in ways that may not have been intended by the developers from the outset, and which are largely hidden from the general public. Every tool that Facebook offers its users for cooperation, free expression and connectivity can be undermined for division, opposition and misinformation (Constine, 2019). Facebook's membership around the globe has also become an extremely valuable target for exploitation by trolls, extremist groups, and others. The question is whether Facebook puts in the appropriate safeguards to support its new tools, or whether they will continue to be used as mechanisms for disrupting democratic processes around the world. Thus, it is far more complex and far-reaching than Mr. Zuckerberg lets on.</p><p>We don't know what use Facebook will make of this information, or with whom it may be shared, and there's no reason to think that all this data about people's political beliefs and motivations won't be sold to third parties for nefarious uses. Clearly, it would be extremely valuable to political opponents to know the views of those who are rallying behind a particular candidate or platform. This could potentially undermine the very reason for those people to engage in the platform in the first place.</p><p>Private third-parties would also find this information extremely valuable, particularly those who back a particular candidate or cause; or, those who may be impacted by the changes that users think they can bring about (e.g. if a group is advocating for a moratorium on oil and gas drilling by a large company, certainly that company and others invested in the project would want to have access to the petitioner's profiles and news feeds). Marketers would also find it useful to target the news feeds of petition supporters with tailor-made advertisements based on the profile of these individuals (e.g. a twentysomething college graduate advocating for city bike lanes might be interested in purchasing bike gear, whole foods, and so on). The potential for misinformation and misuse by all sorts of agents and actors is virtually limitless.</p><p>IV.The Lack of Transparency and Accountability</p><p>It's apparent that we invested far too much trust in high-tech giants like Facebook. In reality, the whole idea that we can have a large profit-seeking entity solely in search of philanthropy and social justice is ludicrous and it's astonishing that we allowed ourselves to buy in to this myth for so long. However, while these companies have clearly been pushing the boundaries of the law - and there is a need to render their practices more transparent - it's not obvious that they've engaged in the kind of wholesale corruption that would put our society at risk, or is it?</p><p>Since the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the public and governments are finally waking up and talking about the fact that the consolidation of power in a few giant tech companies has gotten worse. Indeed, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi avowed that it's a 'new era' for tech regulation: \"...the era of self-regulation of these companies is over (Johnson, 2019).\" And, in early April 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared in front of almost half of the United States senate. He answered questions about Facebook's data protection and privacy practices from nearly 100 different politicians in nearly 10 hours of public testimony - the first real public debate about the rampant data sharing that has been allowed to continue unabated for more than a decade.</p><p>The idea that Facebook is a monopoly was raised multiple times that week. When asked who Facebook's biggest competition is, Zuckerberg didn't have much of an answer. Clearly, Google competes with Facebook for advertisement dollars, and there are other social services out there -primarily Twitter - but nobody comes anywhere close to matching the size and services that Facebook (which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) provides. On that note, some people think Facebook has grown so big that the government should break the company up. For example Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has put forward a proposal to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook (Warren, 2019).</p><p>Zuckerberg argued that breaking up Facebook would be bad for America because it would pave the way for Chinese tech companies - which don't have traditional American values - to step in and dominate: \"there are plenty of other companies out there that are willing and able to take the place of the work that we're doing,\" he said, pointing to Chinese tech companies, \"[a]nd they do not share the values that we have (Wagner, 2018a).\" It's an outrageous assertion in response to allegations that Facebook permitted Russia to sway the 2016 US presidential election. Furthermore, Facebook doesn't even operate in China: the social network is banned there, and has been for years, which has enabled competitors - like WeChat - to thrive (Wagner, 2018a).</p><p>The FTC began investigating Facebook in March 2018 following reports that Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of 87 million Facebook users. However, a central issue was whether Facebook's data-sharing practices violated an agreement it made with the FTC in 2011 to \"better protect people's privacy (Wagner, 2019).\" That agreement, which is known as a 'consent decree,' requires that Facebook receive \"affirmative express consent\" from users before making any changes to its privacy policies. Facebook further agreed that it wouldn't make any \"misrepresentations about the privacy or security of consumers' personal information (Wagner, 2019).\" Yet, allowing third-party developers to access a user's personal information without their knowledge could certainly be perceived as a \"misrepresentation\" on Facebook's part (Wagner, 2019).</p><p>In 2011, in a case before the FTC by the name of Facebook, Inc., Facebook agreed to settle charges that it \"deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\" among other things. The complaint specifically referred to the fact that users' data could be obtained by third-party app developers in ways that could have caught those users unaware, which is clearly suggestive of Facebook's current debacle.</p><p>The final settlement in 2011 barred Facebook from making further deceptive privacy claims, required it obtain a user's explicit approval before changing the way it handles their data, and compelled it to receive periodic assessments of its privacy practices by third-party auditors for the next 20 years. It also demanded that users be notified explicitly if their data is shared beyond the privacy settings they have configured.</p><p>Facebook's 2011 consent decree says that the company could be fined as much as $16,000 per day for \"each violation.\" In July 2019, the FTC approved a roughly $5 billion settlement with Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica scandal (Rodriguez, 2019). The fine represents the largest the agency has ever imposed on a technology company (Romm, 2019). Previously, the largest fine the FTC imposed on a tech giant for breaking an agreement with the government to safeguard consumers' data was a $22.5 million penalty that Google paid to settle a probe over in 2012 (Romm, 2019).</p><p>Facebook's revenue in 2018 is estimated at more than $50 billion USD; accordingly, the fine represents only about 9% of its profits for that year (Rodriguez, 2019). The settlement drew criticism from a number of senators and Congress members, who argued that this was little more than a 'slap on the wrist' (Rodriguez, 2019). Given the company's repeated privacy violations, it may be that significant structural reforms are needed (Rodriguez, 2019).</p><p>Other than the FTC's involvement in the matter, though, there is little else that can be done at the moment to hold Facebook accountable for its misdeeds. Unlike in the EU and Canada, the United States has no general data protection laws. In fact, the US has long been the great exception when it comes to the global predilection for this sort of omnibus legislation. The 1974 Privacy Act only addresses the personal information practices of federal entities, not state and local governments or private entities (Donohue, 468). What's more, Silicon Valley has long been immune to the Communications Decency Act (47 U.S.C.) by virtue of section 230 which says that Internet companies are not responsible for what is posted on their platforms.</p><p>Section 230 says that \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. \" Thus, online intermediaries that host or republish speech are protected against laws that could otherwise be used to hold them accountable for what others say and do. The protected intermediaries include not only Internet Service Providers (ISPs), but also a range of \"interactive computer service providers,\" or any online service that publishes third-party content, including Facebook and Twitter. In theory, this makes good sense: it would be nearly impossible for online intermediaries to stop offensive content from making its way onto their site; and, rather than face potential liability for their users' actions, most would prefer to not host any user content at all or would be actively engaged in an online cat-and-mouse game of censoring what we see, do and say online.</p><p>Yet, in Europe, policy-makers have recently adopted an entirely different approach. Of course, it's much easier to impose weak laws, or no laws altogether, and then try to strengthen them, rather than the other way around. This is particularly significant given that time was needed for the Internet to flourish as a generative medium and an instrument of free speech. Now, with the benefit of hindsight and experience, we can subject it to far more rigorous scrutiny than if we had come in heavy-handed right from the start.</p><p>As of May 25, 2018, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") - a series of laws that were approved by the European Union Parliament and the Council of the European Union in 2016 - replaced the EU Data Protection Directive of1995. It is a comprehensive legal framework aimed at the protection of persons from the processing of personal data and their right to informational privacy. The GDPR affects all companies, individuals, corporations, public authorities or other entities that offer goods or services to individuals in the EU or that monitor their behaviour there (Harris, 2018).</p><p>The new GDPR regulations will give users greater control over their data, including the ability to export it, withdraw consent, and request access to it. The new regulations are far stricter than their predecessors in Europe, as well as the rules in many other countries. Indeed, the law will set a new global benchmark around the importance of personal information ownership and consumer protection (Harris, 2018). Any advertising agencies doing business with clients in the EU, or companies targeting ads to potential customers there, will have to comply with the new rules. Penalties for non-compliance could be up to \u20ac20-million or four percent of a company's total global revenue, whichever is greater.</p><p>In the US senate hearings discussed above, Mark Zuckerberg said he thought the GDPR was a good idea: \"I think the GDPR, in general, is going to be a very positive step for the Internet (Wagner, 2018d).\" However, Zuckerberg made swift changes to ensure that the number of Facebook users protected by it will be considerably less. Facebook members outside the United States and Canada were historically governed by terms of service agreed with the company's international headquarters in Ireland. Yet, before the GDPR came into force, Facebook deliberately moved 1.5 billion of its users out of reach of the new European privacy law by \"shifting the responsibility.. .from its international HQ in Ireland to its main offices in California (Hern, 2018).\" This means that users in North America, Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America will now be on a site governed by much weaker US privacy laws. That removes a massive potential liability for Facebook, which could have meant billions of dollars.</p><p>In April 2018, Zuckerberg told Reuters in an interview that his company would apply the EU law globally \"in spirit,\" but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world (Reuters, 2018). In practice, the change means that 1.5 billion affected users will not be able to avail themselves of the robust protections provided by the GDPR. They also won't be able to file complaints with Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner or in Irish courts.</p><p>The challenge of effective regulatory enforcement in cyberspace has been a persistent problem for decades. Traditionally, crime tends to be perpetrated on a local level; and, it would be very difficult for a real-world criminal to simply pack-up and relocate to another country where the laws happen to be more lenient and hospitable. Yet, the lack of an international consensus around cybercrime, in particular, led to inconsistent standards and practices around the world, creating a large number of \"safe havens\" for criminals to exploit.</p><p>Another problem is that the Internet's reach is so vast that law enforcement agents in only a handful of countries cannot possibly investigate and prosecute offenders on their own, particularly if they are faced with conflicting regulations in multiple jurisdictions worldwide. This provided great impetus globally for the creation of international treaties - like the Budapest Convention - to facilitate international cooperation and investigation in this area. Fortunately, these and other international efforts toward increased interjurisdictional harmonization and cooperation have made it easier to combat cybercrime in recent years.</p><p>Yet, we are also seeing that the large, private corporations that dominate the Internet are equally eager to evade the law by simply relocating their headquarters elsewhere. It's noteworthy that the most prominent online services are based in the United States. This is in part because the lax privacy and data protection laws have made the US a safe haven for those who want to provide a platform for controversial or political speech and a legal environment favorable to free expression. They have also nourished a culture of rampant Internet entrepreneurship that many now believe has grown beyond our public interest. If targeting these entities directly is ineffective, due to the ease with which they can relocate to a jurisdiction outside the regulatory influence of the state, policymakers must decide between allowing the harm to continue and looking for other regulatory solutions (Mann &amp; Belzley, 256).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>It seems impractical, if not impossible, that Facebook and Google would completely overhaul their businesses, tossing aside their winning advertising engines to start afresh. But, it's increasingly clear that something is going to have to change. We've seen that from the beginning, there has been an astonishing inattentiveness about what could happen if global tech giants were left alone to accumulate enormous amounts of power. The world is finally waking up to the fact that they have been given too much power over our economy, our way of life and our democracy. They've bulldozed their competition, used our private information for their own profit, annihilated small businesses and flaunted their political power.</p><p>Recognition of this has prompted calls to reform existing policies and practices to ensure stronger protection of privacy. The suggestion of changing Facebook's default privacy settings from opt-out to opt-in, meaning the company would need to ask for permission to collect data right away instead of collecting it by default, seems like it would be the most dangerous to Facebook. It would severely limit the amount of data they can collect about people, thus hurting their business model.</p><p>Lawmakers in the United States are increasingly calling for the FTC to crack down on Facebook. They have also recommended that the FTC lay out what Facebook can do with private information, such as demanding that tracking data be deleted, as well as placing limits on the collection of private information and advertising practices. It may be nearly impossible for Facebook to transform its own practices, given its longstanding business model. However, it is certain to face some significant challenges in re-building trust and credibility with regulators.</p><p>1 Associate Professor; Coordinator of Masters of Cyber-Security Program (Law), La Trobe Law School, College of Arts, Social Sciences and Commerce, La Trobe University, Bundoora Victoria 3086, Australia.

That right is largely underpinned by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><p>Of course GDPR does not apply in non-EU countries (so called 'third countries\u2019) but in order to send certain information outside of the bloc, companies must agree to act as if it did.</p><p>At the same time US law obliges certain technology companies - like Facebook, Google, Apple and Twitter - to give its surveillance service access to the data they hold on grounds of national security.</p><p>Max Schrems and his organisation NOYB (None of your Business) believe that there is a fundamental clash here.</p><p>In 2015 he made a complaint to Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) arguing that, as his Facebook data could be accessed by US authorities with no proper legal redress available to him, it was not compliant with EU laws.</p><p>That complaint eventually ended up in the Irish court system, which ultimately referred a number of questions to the European Union\u2019s Court of Justice.</p><p>Who\u2019s Max Schrems?</p><p>Max Schrems is an Austrian privacy campaigner who has been raising issues around Facebook - and by proxy every company that collects user data - for almost a decade.</p><p>The case currently before the ECJ is known as Schrems II - because it\u2019s the second time a complaint of his has ended up at their door.</p><p>The first one has its origins in a 2013 complaint to the Irish DPC, which ultimately led to the end of the Safe Harbour agreement.</p><p>That was the structure many companies used to send data between the EU and US until it was deemed invalid by the court in late 2015.</p><p>The decision prompted firms to switch to Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to ensure they could continue to send data across the Atlantic, while the EU and US later established the Privacy Shield framework as a replacement for Safe Harbour.</p><p>The workings of the SCCs and Privacy Shield are what the court is currently considering.</p><p>But what has this got to do with Ireland?</p><p>Under EU law any complaint about personal data must be lodged with the regulator in the country that the company in question is registered.</p><p>Facebook - like a lot of big tech firms - has its international headquarters registered in Ireland, which means that the Irish Data Protection Commissioner is its supervisory authority.</p><p>So even though this case relates to an Austrian citizen and US firm, it has to go via Dublin.</p><p>Do we have any indication of what the court will do?</p><p>No - but we do have the opinion of the court\u2019s advocate general, which the ECJ usually (though not always) agrees with.</p><p>In his opinion, the advocate general deemed the SCCs to be valid - however he also said specific attention had to be given to the national security protections of the third country to ensure it complied with EU law. In other words, each contract had to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>His opinion largely skirted around the validity, or otherwise, of Privacy Shield. The advocate general did raise doubts about it, but suggested it would be better examined in a case that gave its entire focus to the framework.</p><p>So what might the court decide tomorrow?</p><p>There are a number of potential outcomes, all of which have different knock-on effects. And while Facebook is the company at the centre of this case, its outcome will impact on many other firms - and potentially users.</p><p>Here are four potential outcomes:</p><p>1) Everything is fine The ECJ could decide that SCCs and Privacy Shield are valid and provide enough protection to EU citizens, even when their data goes to the US. In that case, nothing changes and tech companies breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>2) The court sides with the advocate general If the court\u2019s ruling mirrors the opinion of the advocate general, companies like Facebook will be obliged to ensure that the countries they\u2019re sending data to offers adequate protections. It would then be up to their regulator - in this case the Irish DPC - to step in to ensure that is the case.</p><p>One potential issue with this is that it could lead to an inconsistent approach across the EU. For example the Irish regulator could decide that European data is adequately protected when sent to the US, but the Spanish regulator could decide it is not.</p><p>3) One or the other is deemed invalid The court could decide that SCCs or Privacy Shield is invalid.</p><p>The former is seen as unlikely, but if it were to happen it would impact data transfers to every non-EU country - not just the US.</p><p>And while the advocate general essentially side-stepped the issue of the US-specific Privacy Shield, there is a chance that the court could make a decision on it regardless.</p><p>If it was invalidated it would create a headache for the many firms that rely on it to transfer data - though assuming SCCs remain an option it would not be a complete disaster.</p><p>4) SCCs *and* Privacy Shield are deemed invalid The nuclear option is that both methods of transferring data to the US are struck down.</p><p>This is seen as unlikely, but it is also the outcome that has the greatest degree of uncertainty as it would leave no obvious method for companies to send data to other countries.</p><p>Within industry there is a hope that, even if that were to happen, there would be a grace period offered to allow firms to find new arrangements. However on the legal side, it would be seen as unlikely for a court to deem something invalid and then allow it to remain in place for a set period of time.</p><p>It should also be remembered that Safe Harbour was invalidated immediately - forcing firms to scramble to find alternatives right after the ECJ announced its decision.</p><p>Could I get cut off from Facebook or other sites tomorrow?</p><p>No, almost certainly not.</p><p>If the court invalidates either SCCs or Privacy Shield, companies like Facebook and Google would have something of a fall-back position to continue transferring data.</p><p>Meanwhile, if both are kept valid but an onus put on the laws of the other country, the decision ends up back in the hands of companies and regulators. That gives time to identify any issue and address it, which means normal service remains for the time-being at least.</p><p>Issues may arise if both frameworks are deemed invalid, however even then the impact would be limited.</p><p>That\u2019s because this case does not relate to so-called \u2018necessary\u2019 data transfers - that would be the likes of your emails, or a hotel or airline booking you might make involving a US firm.</p><p>US surveillance laws also only relates to specific types of companies - so your dealings with \"normal\" firms like banks or online retailers are not covered.</p><p>And even then it\u2019s only personal data that\u2019s contentious - and not the likes of a YouTube video or music stream you might want to access.</p><p>But for what remains, companies would be limited in their options to maintain data flows.</p><p>They could use another legal framework known as Binding Corporate Rules, which also allow for the transfer of data. However they can only apply to data flowing from one part of a corporation to another and they need the sign-off of regulators - which could take more than a year to secure.</p><p>Alternatively companies could try to argue that their data is \u2018necessary\u2019, and entitled to an exemption under the rules. However what qualifies for this classification has until now been policed quite strictly, so it may be difficult to justify in many cases.</p><p>Meanwhile it is believed that the European Commission has been quietly working on an alternative to the SCCs in case they were deemed invalid. It is not clear, however, whether that would be immediately available if the court comes to that conclusion.</p><p>So what could change?</p><p>Bar the court deciding that everything is fine as-is, many companies are likely to have a lot more work to do following tomorrow\u2019s ruling.</p><p>They could come under a heavier obligation to ensure the places they are sending their data to are offering adequate protections - with regulators given more clarity on their role in checking that that is the case.</p><p>That could also mean that regulators like the DPC could be faced with big decisions in the near future, if they are asked to stand over a company\u2019s decision to continue sending data to the US.</p><p>And if it is ultimately decided that EU data is not given enough protections in the US, that could create a significant headache for many tech firms.</p><p>For a start they would have to unpick what data is deemed personal and what can be claimed as \u2018necessary\u2019 (and, as a result, still free to transfer). That would be extremely difficult to do given the myriad of services most major tech companies offer.</p><p>For example many firms use Facebook as an online shop, while others opt to use its private messaging services as a replacement for old-fashioned email. Would they be deemed necessary communications, or does the personal information gleaned as part of that put it under the remit of GDPR?</p><p>Some argue that the companies in question could overcome this kind of challenge by opting not to send data to the US at all - instead using EU-based data centres for EU citizens\u2019 data.</p><p>Facebook runs a data centre in Clonee, CoMeath, as well as facilities in Sweden and Denmark</p><p>However that too may be easier said than done.</p><p>Rather than sending it to one location, many firms replicate user data across multiple servers around the world. Opting to limit specific users\u2019 data to one set of servers may be difficult to do, and could even interrupt the service being offered in the first place.</p><p>It is in companies\u2019 interest to ensure users are unaffected by any rule changes - but depending on the court\u2019s decision tomorrow, doing so may become a significant challenge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RTENEW-1153460</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RTENEW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C3-G2H1-JDRT-20GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352662</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1682\"/><timeReceived>1:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 RTE Commercial Enterprises Ltd / Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>RTE News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62422\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 15, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It doesn\"t involve being tied to a chair or having your eyes pried open while a group of political operatives observe your progress. Instead, it encroaches insidiously, often with our consent, subtly nudging us one way or the other, becoming an everyday part of our lives</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, there is perhaps no better example of this than social media - and particularly Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Viewed in the moment, the individual nudges - the friend recommendation here, the push notification there - seems largely innocuous. But nudge after nudge over the past 14 years has congealed into a festering sore that has individuals, countries and even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg deeply concerned.</p><p>Academic and author of the book Anti-Social Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy, Siva Vaidhyanathan doesn\"t laugh when asked whether we\"re guinea pigs in an elaborate behavioural science experiment on the impact of social media on societies.</p><p>\"That\"s exactly right,\" he tells the Weekend Herald from Virginia in the United States.</p><p>\"We\"ve never had anything like Facebook. It covers 2.2 billion people, which means it has the potential to influence 2.2 billion people. And short of the ocean or the atmosphere, I can\"t think of anything that influences that many people.\"</p><p>This scale stretches into New Zealand, with the social media giant boasting over 3.2 million monthly active users on Facebook and 1.5 million on Instagram. Facebook only trails Google when it comes to the most popular websites in New Zealand.</p><p>Early in his book, Vaidhyanathan notes that Facebook\"s entire world is addictive by design, premised on pulling users through the door and keeping them there for as long as possible.</p><p>\"Facebook, like snack foods, cigarettes, and gambling machines, is designed for stickiness,\" he writes.</p><p>\"Every acquisition Facebook has made has been in the interest of keeping more people interacting with Facebook services in different ways, to generate more data.\"</p><p>Expressed as a bottomless social feed, Facebook\"s social environment couples a conveyor belt of algorithmically curated interests with the red-headed ping of push notifications to create a continuous reward loop. And with figures from research agency Nielsen showing Kiwis have increased their time spent per month on the platform from six and half hours in 2013 to almost 11 hours in 2017, there\"s little doubt Facebook achieves what it sets out to do.</p><p>Facebook this week announced the global rollout of a new dashboard tool that will enable users to see how much time they\"ve spent on the app and set up alerts to notify them when they\"ve exceeded a customisable limit of what the user deems an appropriate amount of time on the platform.</p><p>Steps such as these are being taken in response to growing concerns and research regarding the impact of social media on mental wellbeing. However, though a positive step in terms of being an effort to mitigate the harm caused, the initiative requires buy-in from the user - and addicts aren\"t often great at saying no.</p><p>But Facebook is dying, isn\"t it?</p><p>Last month, Facebook\"s stock suffered the biggest plunge in Wall Street history, shedding US$120 billion (NZ$176b) from the company\"s overall value and dropping Zuckerberg\"s personal wealth by a staggering US$12b.</p><p>Looking beyond the ominous headlines such as \"The fall of Facebook\" and \"The ghost of Myspace haunting Facebook\", Vaidhyanathan argues that reports of the demise of Facebook have been somewhat exaggerated.</p><p>\"It\"s not going to go away soon because of a few scandals,\" he says, pointing to the company\"s quarterly revenue figure of US$13.2b and profit of US$5.1b.</p><p>The fact that a company with those revenue figures can be punished so harshly by investors tells us more about the nature of financial markets than it does about Facebook, he argues.</p><p>Predictions of an apocalypse for Facebook have also been attributed to the exodus of younger users from the platform. There is some truth to this, but it\"s also worth noting that many of the users have simply shifted their social media activities to Instagram, which was snapped up by Zuckerberg in 2012 for a billion-dollar figure that looks quite reasonable in hindsight.</p><p>Vaidhyanathan says when you look at the global strength of Facebook and Instagram alongside the fact that its other big platform, the messaging and chat app WhatsApp, hasn\"t even been monetised yet, there\"s little chance of this juggernaut sinking any time soon.</p><p>A sour taste</p><p>New Zealander Elly Strang, 24, is social media\"s dream. She\"s the youngest-ever editor of the well-respected Idealog magazine, an influencer and avid Instagrammer.</p><p>But she rethought her relationship with Facebook in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw a data firm collect personal data of 87 million people, including 64,000 Kiwis.</p><p>\"The Cambridge Analytica scandal left a sour taste in my mouth, and I\"ve definitely toyed with the idea of leaving Facebook as I don\"t see much value in it as a social media channel any more,\" she says.</p><p>&amp;</p><p>\"I feel like Facebook definitely still holds a lot of power when it comes to the attention of the older generation, like baby boomers, who are now the most prolific users on the platform.</p><p>\"My parents, their friends and other older relatives are constantly on it and share their personal thoughts and beliefs on their profiles and on public forums without much contemplation on what a company like Facebook can do with this information.</p><p>\"They\"re less savvy, whereas I think Facebook has lost touch with people aged 30 and under, who share far less on there these days.</p><p>\"However, I feel as though my generation has transferred this sharing of personal information over to Instagram, so maybe it\"s a tactical move and Facebook is one step ahead of us, seeing as though it owns Instagram and can monitor the younger ones over on there anyway.\"</p><p>And, Strang adds, she\"s kept Facebook for its Messenger application \"to stay in touch with friends and family\".</p><p>Strang\"s last point here touches the core of why, despite the constant threats of leaving the platform, most people decide to stay. As long as there\"s sufficient value offered to the individual, most users are willing to accept the collective risks that come with the channel.</p><p>Asked about this tendency and what it would take to actually take to make people leave Facebook, Vaidhyanathan uses the analogy of the automobile industry as a parallel, saying though we know that cars on the whole are bad for the environment, the benefits to the individual of being able to get where you want quickly and effectively makes people reluctant to opt for an alternative mode of transport.</p><p>Which is to say that getting people off Facebook is about as easy as getting Aucklanders out of their cars.</p><p>Come into my echo chamber</p><p>The influence of social media on society was laid bare during 2016\"s US Election and Brexit Referendum, with new media platforms playing an integral role in giving form to the debates and ultimately playing an integral role in determining the winner.</p><p>What was notable about these results was that they stunned those on the losing side, but seemed completely expected to the winners. This disconnect was engineered by the users themselves. Every like, share and post was fed into the algorithm and the Facebook newsfeed served up only what the user wanted to see. Users have essentially built themselves echo chambers, where their biases are confirmed to them over and over again.</p><p>Massey University\"s James Liu, a psychology professor who studies the impact of digital media on society, says social media makes it very easy for people to find others who share their exact views, making critical thought quite challenging.</p><p>\"The internet age is like all these wormholes, where you can dive down this rabbit hole and suddenly you\"re in this world where everyone seems to agree with you,\" he says.</p><p>\"This is a world where you just connect with whatever it is that turns you on, be it gaming, hating on immigrants or whatever you like. And those worlds can be more brittle than the real world because people can be harsh, they can bully, they can tell you false news and they can do all sorts of things that aren\"t constrained by reality.\"</p><p>Politicians such as Donald Trump have been masterful at identifying these enclaves of their supporters, then feeding information into these spaces, reinforcing the views.</p><p>Liu notes that the extremely partisan echo chambers seen in the US aren\"t quite as pronounced in New Zealand, largely due to the MMP political system, which forces parties to talk to each other and form alliances despite their differences.</p><p>\"You\"ve got someone like Winston Peters who could swing either way. And although this used to be a negative, in this environment it\"s actually a positive when you look at the US or the UK,\" he says.</p><p>But local politicians have also been known to push the boundaries when it comes to the use of social media to push their worldview.</p><p>Earlier this year, a National Party Facebook advertisement appeared among the list of decisions arising from complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority.</p><p>The ad in question was a standard political ad, referencing a quote from an article published in the Forbes business magazine.</p><p>The post read: \"\"It seems likely that New Zealand will experience a recession during (PM Jacinda) Ardern\"s term ... [and] will probably lose its status as one of the most open, free economies in the world.\" - Forbes business magazine.\"</p><p>The complainant in the case took issue with the fact that there was no disclosure of the fact that the quote was, in fact, taken from an opinion piece, which may well have come from someone with a clear political leaning. The complainant argued that it created the impression that a reputable publisher endorsed the opinion, when it was clearly stipulated on the Forbes website that the opinions of the author did not represent the views of the magazine.</p><p>The National Party responded to the complaint, saying it was a direct quote from an article and it was clearly presented as an advocacy advertisement from the National Party Facebook page.</p><p>In siding with the National Party, the ASA set a complicated precedent in that highly partisan opinion could potentially be dressed in advertising as an endorsement for a politician from a reputable publication.</p><p>The beast roams free</p><p>There are no easy answers to moderating or regulating the content published on the sprawling online environments created by the tech giants in Silicon Valley. And they quite often play by different rules, allowing the publication of content that would not be allowed to stand in mainstream media.</p><p>It\"s something that became apparent when rumours began swirling about Ardern\"s partner Clarke Gayford. Mainstream publishers did not report the rumours but the information could still be found posted anonymously across social media.</p><p>Attempting to have these posts removed can quickly turn into an elaborate digital game of whack-a-mole, with new posts appearing as soon as others have been flagged and deleted. It\"s a scenario that can escalate when troll armies mobilise behind a cause.</p><p>Digital media minister Clare Curran says New Zealand is now overhauling the content classification regime in order to ensure consistency across broadcasting, online and print environments.</p><p>\"I\"ve had discussions with entities like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix around their compliance with New Zealand classification standards and content regulation,\" Curran tells the Weekend Herald.</p><p>\"If we were to push those discussions further you could end up with a consistent set of classification codes across content on those platforms; the ability for people to make complaints; and for there to be some way of having those complaints heard.\"</p><p>In its early years, Facebook took a somewhat laissez-faire approach to content moderation, claiming it wasn\"t a media company and that individual posters were responsible for what they were posting. But, as the platform is increasingly used to spread misinformation and incite hate, Facebook is taking a more active role in protecting users.</p><p>Mia Garlick, the director of policy for Australia and New Zealand, tells the Weekend Herald the company is ramping up its efforts to combat harmful content.</p><p>\"The safety of our community is a top priority,\" she says, pointing out that the company invests heavily in AI technology, processes and people to ensure quick action on violating content and accounts.</p><p>\"We\"re also doubling our teams working on safety and security to 20,000, and will continue working with local partners, such as Netsafe and Sticks n Stones, to develop resources and education campaigns that are local, relevant and useful.\"</p><p>Define hate</p><p>As part of its increased push to improve the user environment, Facebook has also made a pledge to improve its removal of hate speech from the platform through its growing global team of 7500 content reviewers, spanning 50 languages.</p><p>According to Vaidhyanathan, it doesn\"t even come close to being enough to solve this massive global problem.</p><p>\"To effectively limit the damage, Facebook would have to hire thousands of people in more than 120 languages and train them to make very difficult decisions about constantly changing subjects and terms,\" he says.</p><p>These decisions are difficult enough in a developed democracy such as New Zealand; Vaidhyanathan says it\"s nothing compared to a nation such as Myanmar where extremists have been using Facebook to incite hate against the Rohingya people.</p><p>This is an extreme example, but there is a more subtle debate to be had about the impact that content removal might have on free speech in the digital environment.</p><p>Vaidhyanathan warns that identifying hate speech is no longer as easy as screening for a list of racial epithets and ensuring these are removed.</p><p>\"Racists have become much more sophisticated in the age of the internet,\" he says.</p><p>\"Many of the world\"s leading racists have developed a veneer of sophistication and adopted a pseudoscientific tone that has allowed them to either avoid the accusation of vulgar racism by saying, \"I\"m merely starting a debate, why are you afraid of ideas or research?\"\"</p><p>A good example in the local context would be controversial Canadian YouTube star Stefan Molyneux, who was due to speak last night in Auckland alongside the equally provocative Lauren Southern before the event was cancelled.</p><p>One of the issues for which Molyneux has attracted controversy is for his argument that black people are genetically predisposed to having lower IQs than other races. If Molyneux came out and simply said he believed his race was smarter than other races, he would quickly be denounced as a white supremacist. But he layers his argument with references to widely disputed psychological studies, saying it\"s simply what the facts say and that he\"s just trying to tell truths everyone else is afraid to share.</p><p>It\"s an approach used in Holocaust denial and tirades on the impact of immigrants moving into nations.</p><p>\"There\"s a rhetorical flourish to many racists that makes it extremely difficult to use blunt instruments against their content,\" Vaidhyanathan argues. \"It also undermines the idea that Facebook can develop an artificial intelligence instrument that can screen for it.\"</p><p>The German lead</p><p>Looking at international examples, Vaidhyanathan says there\"s growing evidence that regulation will play an essential role in protecting democracies from the potential harm of social media.</p><p>\"Only when they are restricted by law in other places in the world do they institute controls,\" Vaidhyanathan says.</p><p>\"Facebook has been very effective at filtering out anti-Semitic and Holocaust denial propaganda from its German-language services.\"</p><p>This is partly because Germany passed strict hate speech laws, giving the government power to impose a fine of up to 50 million euros against an individual or a company if the offensive content is not removed.</p><p>The French Government is working toward the introduction of a fake news law by the end of 2018 and the Czech Republic is establishing an anti-fake-news task force.</p><p>Locally, there are moves toward legislative changes, with Justice Minister Andrew Little working on a revamp of our privacy laws. But there are already concerns that the proposed penalties won\"t be enough to dissuade big tech companies from doing as they please.</p><p>Asked for his opinion on what New Zealand could do to rein in the social media beast, Vaidhyanathan points to our history in fighting nuclear proliferation, saying that you don\"t have to be big to make a difference.</p><p>\"Perhaps a country like New Zealand could lead the way in experimenting with responses to Facebook in a way a large, diffuse country, like the United States, cannot.\"</p><p>The only question is whether our lawmakers have the stomach to take on the challenge and introduce meaningful change the rest of the world is likely to follow.</p><p>Facebook\"s biggest scandals of the year... so far</p><p>Cambridge Analytica</p><p>It\"s the scandal that made everyone care about their data and led to a range of legal changes on the use and storage of data in the digital world. What\"s worrying is that Cambridge Analytica is only one of many data firms toying with our data.</p><p>Myanmar</p><p>Earlier this year, it was revealed Facebook was being used by extremists to incite violence against the Rohingya people in Myanmar. This was particularly troubling because it provided a clear link between Facebook and physical harm.</p><p>Russia meddling and fake news</p><p>Just last week, Facebook\"s team discovered and deleted 32 political pages and accounts linked to Russia, aiming to interfere in the US mid-term election. This adds yet another layer of evidence to the case of Russia using social media to influence US politics.</p><p>WhatsApp linked to violence</p><p>In early July, five people were killed by a mob in India after rumours were spread on WhatsApp that they were child traffickers. Facebook responded to this by limiting the number of times messages could be forwarded to other phones via the service.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-12099844</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SY9-V8V1-DYTJ-646G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3043\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 4, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Social Networking Sites</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJEOEE3NERCMEE5NDAyRTgzQ0QzNTc3MkM3NzI0MUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U2OEYyMDlBMThBNDQxRjg4NkFGM0I4REVDODE1QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FXT</classCode><className>BEHAVIOR &amp; COGNITION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000C5PB</classCode><className>MARK ZUCKERBERG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Global Free Expression 2496 CONCLUSION 2499</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>On May 23, 2019, a video of Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, suddenly began circulating online. Supposedly footage from a speech given the night before at a Center for American Progress event, the video seemed to show Pelosi \"garbled and warped,\" and as the clip quickly spread, commenters described her as \"drunk\" and a \"babbling mess.\" (1) Former New York City mayor and Republican operative Rudy Giuliani tweeted a link to the video stating, \"What is wrong with Nancy Pelosi? Her speech pattern is bizarre\" (2) as the clip went viral, particularly through conservative websites. (3) Though concern was momentarily raised about a \"deep fake,\" within a few hours it was established that in fact the video had simply been slowed down to seventy-five percent speed, causing a deepening of Pelosi's voice, seemingly exaggerated pauses, and slurring, (4) all resulting in Pelosi appearing mentally unwell or intoxicated. The quick spread of this inauthentic depiction of Pelosi resulted in calls on social-media platforms to remove the video. YouTube was the first platform to comply, stating that \"the Pelosi videos violated company policies and have been removed.\" (5) But the video had not gone viral on YouTube in nearly the same way as it had on Facebook, and Facebook refused to remove it. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Monika Bickert--Facebook's Vice President of Global Policy Management--explained that \"if there were misinformation that was, let's say, tied to an ongoing riot or the threat of some physical violence somewhere in the world, we would work with safety organizations on the ground to confirm falsity and the link to violence and then we actually would remove that misinformation.\" (6)</p><p>Bickert's description of the considerations of authenticity, safety, and importance to political discourse in Facebook's decision not to remove the video relates to the so-called Values of the site, which the platform balances when determining whether to remove content posted by users. (7) But the Values are just the principles supporting an extensive system to review all user-generated content, not only viral videos of political figures. Specifically, Facebook's Values--\"[v]oice,\" offset by authenticity, safety, privacy, and dignity--inform a much more detailed and specific set of rules to regulate content called \"Community Standards.\" (8) The implementation of these Standards has resulted in the build-out of a massive system of governance for the screening, reporting, reviewing, and removal of content that violates the rules of the site--a process known as content moderation. (9) As a private platform, Facebook can and does maintain exclusive control over the rules and enforcement used to moderate speech on the site. Legal protections for online platforms, as well as American free-speech norms, influenced the early development of Facebook's content policies. (10)</p><p>For many Americans, Facebook's response to the Pelosi video was perhaps their first moment of understanding the power of private platforms to review speech, though in the last five years these issues have received greater and greater attention. As Facebook has become a ubiquitous and necessary presence in public discourse, public awareness of its censorial control has steadily increased, as have demands for greater accountability and transparency to users about how such decisions are made. Part I of this Feature describes the history and trajectory of Facebook's content moderation, discussing the primitive years of content moderation on the platform, its evolution to a more systematic set of internal rules, and the eventual development of those rules into its outward-facing Community Standards.</p><p>The integration of the details of those once-secret internal content-moderation rules into the external Community Standards was an essential, if long overdue, moment for Facebook following years of calls from academics, civil society, media, and users demanding more transparency from the platform. But while these new public Community Standards introduced some level of transparency into the black box of Facebook's speech governance system, they also underscored Facebook's overall lack of user participation in creating, updating, and enforcing the rules dictating their speech online. As advocates aligned anew on content-moderation principles, (11) experts published books documenting the system and pushing for reform, (12) and the press reflected users' outcry, (13) the topic of accountability in online speech rose into the public consciousness. In April 2018, Facebook began to indicate openly that it was taking the new public reaction seriously. (14) CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg stated in an interview that one could \"imagine some sort of structure, almost like a Supreme Court, that is made up of independent folks who don't work for Facebook, who ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world.\" (15)</p><p>This brings us to the primary focus of this Feature. Following his spring 2018 statement about a \"Supreme Court\"-like structure, and in response to longstanding and increasingly vocal criticism demanding user accountability, Zuckerberg announced in November 2018 that Facebook would create an \"Independent Governance and Oversight\" committee by the close of 2019 to advise on content policy and listen to user appeals on content decisions. (16) Part II documents the creation of this novel institution, relying on exclusive embedded access to the internal Facebook team charged with creating the Oversight Board, interviews with the Board's architects, and primary-source documents. (17) It seeks to lend transparency to Facebook's internal deliberations in deciding how to design and implement the Board.</p><p>Underscoring this descriptive analysis, however, is a core question: what motivates and incentivizes Facebook to create such an oversight body? The potential answers to this question reflect a mix of idealism, skepticism, and cynicism. From the most dewy-eyed perspective, Facebook's decision to create the Board is a noble moment of goodwill. Skeptically seen, the creation of the Board is a giant public-relations move: an effort to give the appearance of caring about users and their input on Facebook's speech policies in order to bolster trust in the company. More cynically, once the Board is up and running, it might also be a convenient scapegoat for controversial content-moderation decisions--like the Pelosi video decision--that Facebook currently is forced to absorb alone. The availability of an independent board that can take on review of such decisions provides an easy escape from scrutiny: \"Don't blame Facebook for this decision--it was the Board's!\" Beyond these considerations, it is also imperative to remember the current regulatory pressures bearing down on Facebook and other major platforms. The European Union has led the charge in pushing back on private platforms through privacy measures like the General Data Protection Regulation and litigation through the European Court of Justice. (18) Even the United States, hamstrung in directly regulating content and privacy by First Amendment concerns, has turned to discussions of antitrust regulation to break up the \"monopolies\" of big tech as well as an empowered Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to levy fines for user-privacy violations.</p><p>All of these factors might boil down to a central issue: economics. Fines from Europe and the FCC and threats of splitting Facebook's products risk diminishing Facebook's bottom line. Though the Board does not directly resolve these concerns, its creation might show a good-faith effort by Facebook not to hoard its power and instead involve its users in critical decision-making--which might prove useful in the looming legal battles. The Board also speaks more broadly to the core of Facebook's economic model: its ability to draw and keep users on its site in order to view advertising. Users' decisions to use Facebook depend on their trust of the platform. Facebook's creation of the Oversight Board is an investment in building user trust, which is a long-term strategy for continued economic growth.</p><p>Facebook thus has myriad incentives to make the Board a meaningful adjudicatory body--or, more cynically, to make the Board appear to be a meaningful adjudicatory body. To do this, the Board must involve users in content moderation and have jurisdictional, intellectual, and financial independence from Facebook. Whether the Board achieves this through its founding documents is the subject of the final Part of this Feature. That Part explores four remaining questions: what the Board is vis-a-vis existing legal models; the power of the procedural right it grants to users and the structures that make it independent from Facebook; what the Board might mean for users; and finally, what the Board might mean for industry and government.</p><p>Ultimately, however, the success or failure of the Board does not change its impact on history. The mere experiment, and the lessons taken from it, will have an indelible influence on the future of global online speech and user participation in transnational internet governance.</p><p>I. BEFORE THE BOARD: FACEBOOK'S HISTORY WITH CONTENT MODERATION</p><p>It is impossible to talk about the Oversight Board without first discussing the history of content moderation at Facebook. Content moderation is the industry term for a platform's review of user-generated content posted on its site and the corresponding decision to keep it up or take it down. (19) Content moderation--though for years hidden from public view within private platforms and not always conceived in those terms--has existed as long as the internet and presented a seemingly impossible problem: how to impose a global set of rules on speech without a global set of norms on speech and how to do that at scale. (20) Understanding the history of industry struggle with content moderation is essential to understanding the Oversight Board, which--while perhaps the most elaborate mechanism designed to respond to the seemingly intractable quandary of governing online speech on a global scale--is only the latest in a long series of attempts.</p><p>This Part unfolds the history of content moderation at Facebook and external calls for transparency and accountability. It then discusses the various industrywide attempts to create mechanisms for user accountability in online speech platforms, concluding with the series of events culminating in Facebook's decision to create the Oversight Board.</p><p>A. How Facebook Moderates Online Speech</p><p>Before diving into the private governance system that Facebook created to moderate users' speech, it is necessary to take a moment to understand the laws that underlie that development. (21) Though Facebook is now a global platform with over two billion users, at its inception in 2004 it was a website of static pages open only to students with harvard.edu email addresses. (22) Facebook, like other speech platforms, was and is a private company that may police its users' speech without constraint by the First Amendment. (23) But early in the history of the internet, it was unclear if platforms' policing of speech on their sites would also make them civilly liable as publishers. (24) This was resolved when Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, passed in 1996, immunized platforms from civil liability for speech posted by users. (25) This allowed platforms to moderate content on their sites and paved the way for Facebook to develop its own set of semipublic rules called \"Community Standards\" alongside a robust system for updating and enforcing them. (26)</p><p>With over 2.5 billion active users per month, (27) Facebook cannot and does not proactively police all violations of its rules. (28) When a user uploads a piece of content like a photo or prerecorded video, \"ex ante\" automated detection screens it. (29) Though there have recently been steps forward in using artificial intelligence to screen for things like extremism and hate speech, (30) the vast majority of this system works by matching the uploaded content against a database of already-known illegal or impermissible content using what is known as \"hash technology.\" (31) Other forms of ex ante moderation employ users' locations to moderate the content they see. Known as \"geo-blocking,\" these types of moderation employ users' internet protocol (IP) addresses, which can be roughly linked to geographical boundaries and thus allow platforms to distinguish content that might be legal to post in one country but illegal to post or view in another. (32)</p><p>These automatic takedown mechanisms work hand in glove with manual identification of content from the site. (33) For example, in reaction to public outcry around terrorist and extremist content hosted on the site, Facebook created a proactive (34) team of moderators to look for and delete such content, pages, and groups. (33) Once identified by Facebook's moderators, the content can be hashed and compared against future uploaded content, not just on Facebook but also on other sites using the same technology. (36) Besides using Facebook employees, this cooperation between human moderation and automatic ex ante moderation can also involve Facebook users. For example, in identifying and controlling spam, Facebook can often algorithmically identify new spam postings based on the behavior of the poster, the proliferation on the site, and the targeting of the content. But Facebook also informs its algorithms and automatic takedowns with information gathered from users reactively (37) and manually (38) reporting spam. Thus, the manual and automatic systems work together to iteratively develop a database of content to be automatically removed from the site. (39)</p><p>Human decision-making is an essential part of speech moderation, especially as Facebook increasingly uses automated methods to both initially identify and adjudicate content. (40) Historically, Facebook's proactive moderation was largely confined to certain kinds of extreme content and limited by the nascent state of video- and photo-recognition technology. (41) The platform predominantly depended on users to flag violating speech. (42) This is quickly changing. (43) In the third quarter of 2019, nearly 100% of spam and fake accounts, 98.4% of adult nudity and sexual violations, and 98.6% of graphic and violent content on Facebook were found and flagged by the site before users notified the platform. (44) In other categories of banned material, proactive moderation is less effective. Facebook found and removed hate speech before users reported it only 80.2% of the time and only 16.1% of the time in cases of bullying and harassment. (45)</p><p>Whether already identified by Facebook or not, Facebook users flag millions of pieces of content worldwide every week. (46) Users have many reasons for flagging content, and much of what they flag does not violate the Community Standards. Rather, a vast majority of flagged content reflects personal opinion, conflict between groups or users, or even abuse of the flagging system to harass other users. (47) Facebook's reporting process attempts not only to guide users toward categorizing which aspect of the Community Standards is being violated to expedite review but also to urge users toward self-resolution of disputes that likely fall outside the Standards' purview. (48)</p><p>Once flagged by a user, the individual piece of content is stripped of user-identifying elements and placed into an internal tool that \"queues\" flagged content to be reviewed by a human content moderator. (49) These moderators are hired directly as Facebook employees or indirectly as contractors. (50) Working in front of computers in call centers all over the world, moderators are trained to determine if content violates the Community Standards. (51) If a moderator determines that reported content is in violation, it is removed from the site; all content not found in violation remains published on the platform. (52) In contrast to notice-and-takedown regimes, in the interim between flagging and the moderator's decision, the flagged piece of content stays up. If the content is not removed, the user to whom it belongs will never know it was even flagged. If it is removed, however, users will receive a notification that content they posted violated the Community Standards of Facebook and was removed.</p><p>Errors--both in allowing speech that should be removed to remain up, and removing speech that should be allowed--occur. Some of these errors--for instance, the removal of the Terror of War photo (53)--were high-profile. Initially, users could not appeal a decision on a piece of content. (54) Facebook's appeals systems only existed for suspended accounts and removed pages. (55) Those who had their content mistakenly removed had little recourse unless they knew someone at Facebook or Instagram, were able to leverage a connected civil-society organization to their cause, or could rally media attention. In this way, the democratizing forces of internet speech in many ways simply recapitulated real-world power. This changed in 2018 when Facebook began offering expanded appeals for some types of removed content. (56)</p><p>Since instituting expanded appeals, Facebook has also started issuing quarterly transparency reports that provide insight into how content is being removed, appealed, and restored. In the second and third quarters of 2019, (57) for example, 4.28 billion pieces of content were removed from the site. (58) Of these, users appealed 40.9 million takedowns--less than 1% of the total removals (59)--and Facebook restored 10.1 million pieces of content, or approximately 24.7% of removals. (60)</p><p>This is the process of content moderation on Facebook: the how. While still a mystery to many users, this knowledge is now publicly available and relatively well known. But for over a decade, it was largely an unquantified phenomenon, and purposefully so. (61) Besides the public-facing Community Standards, which were broad and vague, the specific rules and mechanisms by which Facebook removed or kept content on the site were deliberately opaque and carefully guarded. As will be discussed in the following two Sections, it took years of public agitation to generate inquiry not only into the how of content moderation, but also into who was creating the content-moderation rules and policies. Mechanics aside, the realization that Facebook--for the most part alone, and for the most part through a few people headquartered in Silicon Valley--was the sole creator and decider of the rules governing online speech struck many as deeply problematic. Small groups of civil-society members, academics, and members of the press had long been aware of how content moderation functioned. But as Facebook became an increasingly vital part of public discourse, demands for transparency and accountability on these issues became inescapable. The next two Sections discuss first the internal players at Facebook involved in creating the content rules and then the outside influencers who came to play a vital role.</p><p>B. Who Controlled the Policies Behind Moderating User Content at Facebook</p><p>The individual moderators who review the flagged content described above are just the final stage of enforcement. Much like a policewoman who arrives to investigate a complaint and must assess whether illegal activity has occurred, content moderators are presented with reported user content and tasked with determining if it violates the site's terms. (62) Those terms, however, are set by individuals much higher up in the company.</p><p>From 2004 to early 2010, Facebook not only lacked a robust team for removing problematic content but had no real content-moderation policy to speak of. (63) Rather, platform-wide moderation was conducted by a team of a few dozen people, who were themselves guided by a one-page document of things to delete--like \"Hitler and naked people\"--and a general platform ethos of \"if it makes you feel bad in your gut, then go ahead and take it down.\" (64) It was not until late 2008, when Dave Willner joined the Trust and Safety team, that the external content-moderation policies and the underlying rules for use by content moderators began to take shape. (65) Willner, supervised by Jud Hoffman (who led the Trust and Safety team), eventually wrote a public-facing policy for the platform--the \"Community Standards\"--and an intricate 15,000-word Wiki-styled document--the \"Abuse Standards\"--that was internal to the site and spelled out the enforcement of the Community Standards. (66)</p><p>The era of Facebook content moderation under Willner and Hoffman coincided with the platform's transition from a monolithic culture and region with similar norms to a global platform--a transition with which Facebook struggled. Until 2008, the \"if it makes you feel bad, take it down\" standard could be easily understood and enforced by Facebook's small community of content moderators and was largely consistent with the values of the relatively small and homogenous \"community\" of then-existing Facebook users. (67) But as the site's users diversified and became more global, and as the increased scale of user content demanded a more global and diverse army of content moderators, standards were no longer a feasible approach. Instead, Willner and Hoffman attempted to create granular, precise \"rules\" based on things \"you could see in the content\" rather than nonobservable values, feelings, or subjective reactions. (68)</p><p>Despite careful construction for \"objective\" enforcement, the Community Standards were by no means neutral, reflective of the norms of global society, or even reflective of the norms of Facebook users. (69) Rather, the early rules reflected the norms of the drafters: Americans \"trained and acculturated in American free speech norms and First Amendment law\" like Hoffman and Willner. (70) These cultural conflicts were an ever-present reality in enforcing the Community Standards worldwide. (71) In trying to resolve clashes between the Western values that informed Facebook's rules and the values of local communities in which Facebook operated, Hoffman tried to turn to Facebook's mission to \"[g]ive people the power to build community and bring the world closer together\" (72) and avoid adopting \"wholesale... a kind of U.S. jurisprudence free expression approach.\" (73) But even the company's fundamental mission was not culturally neutral--nor could it have been. As Willner described, \"The idea that the world should be more open and connected is not something that, for example, North Korea agrees with.\" (74)</p><p>Despite this predisposition towards freedom of expression, Facebook's Community Standards--which banned pornography, (75) hate speech, (76) graphic violence, (77) and torture of animals (78)--were significantly less permissive than First Amendment doctrine. Indeed, as public pressure increased over the last ten years and as European nations, like Germany, forced Facebook to comply with their national speech laws, (79) Facebook's Community Standards became more restrictive and more similar to European standards. Largely absent from these Euro-American Facebook rules, however, is evidence of input from the Global South, a diverse set of nations and peoples that now comprises the majority of Facebook users. (80)</p><p>In April 2018, after over a decade of hiding the internal rules behind the public-facing Community Standards, Facebook released one entirely public version. (81) The rules' public release was significant because of what this moment of transparency seemed to promise. During the fourteen years that Facebook's content moderation operated in secret, changes-good or bad, controversial or not--occurred without public knowledge or reaction. The move to transparency operated as a tacit acknowledgment that Facebook users had a right to know the rules governing them and voice their reactions. But Facebook's reveal was not only insufficient to stem outrage; it in fact fueled further critique. The public's discovery that a small cadre of people headquartered in Silicon Valley were the sole creators and deciders on rules governing this vital global platform for online speech (82) and that, although rules existed, their operation lacked core ideas of procedure and process added fuel to long-standing comparisons between Facebook and a feudal state, kingdom, or dictatorship. (83)</p><p>The rise of public awareness and demands for legality around platform content-moderation governance empowered civil society, academics, and journalists who had long been working on these issues. The more the platform emerged as a vital element of public discourse, (84) the louder and more frequent the demands from \"outside\" groups for transparency and accountability became. (85) The next Section turns to how outside actors reacted to and influenced Facebook's governance regime.</p><p>C. Outside Influence on Facebook</p><p>Although details about Facebook's content-moderation rules and how they were enforced may have been hidden from those outside the platform for years, that does not mean they were not free from external influence. To the contrary, many of the policy and enforcement decisions made by architects inside Facebook came about in reaction to external pressures from civil society, governments, the media, or users. (86) Of these, negative media coverage had arguably the most powerful impact. (87)</p><p>Perhaps the internally most significant moment of journalistic impact was the scandal accompanying Facebook's removal of a photograph called \"The Terror of War.\" (88) In September 2016, a prominent Norwegian writer, Tom Egeland, posted a graphic but award-winning historical picture to Facebook. (89) Taken by photographer Nick Ut in the midst of the Vietnam War, the black-and-white photo depicts a naked nine-year-old girl running and screaming down a dirt street in Trang Bang, Vietnam, following a napalm attack on the city. (90) Though often colloquially referred to as \"Napalm Girl,\" the title of the photograph is \"The Terror of War,\" an era-defining piece of photojournalism for its depiction of the horror and violence of the Vietnam War. (91) Despite its political and cultural significance, the photo was removed for violating Facebook's Community Standards. (92) In addition to removing the picture and accompanying post by Egeland, Facebook suspended Egeland's account. He immediately posted separately complaining of censorship. (93) Egeland's profile as a well-known author caused the removal of the historic photo to receive its own news coverage, epitomized by the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten's publication of a \"letter\" to Mark Zuckerberg on its front page calling for Facebook to take a stand against censorship. (94) The controversy was significant and, for perhaps the first time, crystallized in the public eye the platform's broad power to censor not just things like hate speech or harassment but content of great cultural and historical import. Mere hours after the controversy ignited, Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg issued a statement saying that the platform \" [doesn't] always get it right\" and promising to take a close look at the policies that had resulted in the takedown of the photo. (95)</p><p>Facebook acknowledges that the public reaction to the \"Terror of War\" takedown set off an internal reckoning with its content-moderation policies. (96) \"After the 'Terror of War' controversy, we realized that we had to create new rules for imagery that we'd normally want to disallow, but for context reasons that policy doesn't work,\" explained Peter Stern, who is now head of Product Policy Stakeholder Engagement at Facebook. (97) But the \"Terror of War\" moment also illuminated something else that had perhaps been lost in the institutional transitions within the content policy team: Facebook could not simply solve the problems presented by content moderation through vigorous content removal; rather, a more nuanced approach was required in order to satisfy users and escape media controversy. Leaders at the company began to fully understand that content-moderation policy and enforcement were not just a \"customer service\" or \"trust and safety issue\"--as a communication platform, content moderation was the product of Facebook. (98)</p><p>In addition to individual high-profile moments of censorship or failure to remove unsafe content, a number of more general controversies generated negative press for the company and eroded user trust. The first grew out of Facebook's perceived harms to democracy and elections following the 2016 U.S. presidential election and \"Brexit,\" the British referendum to leave the European Union. (99) Allegations that foreign interference through fake news and disinformation campaigns affected the outcome of those democratic processes dominated the news cycle and public opinion for months. (100) The second major moment came with the \"leak\" of user data through the third-party consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. (101) In a press release on March 16,2018, Facebook acknowledged that the company, run from the United Kingdom, had improperly gained access and used eighty-seven million Facebook users' data, with potential effects on the American election. (102) Third and most recently, Facebook was accused of augmenting civil unrest and perhaps even causing the death of thousands of Rohingya Muslims, a persecuted ethnic group in Myanmar, when majority groups used Facebook's \"Free Basics\" program and messaging applications (including WhatsApp) to mobilize ethnic cleansing mobs. (103)</p><p>The scale of these issues and resultant public outcry triggered new pressure from Western democratic governments. From 2017 to 2019, the U.S. Senate held five hearings on the use of technology and its impact on speech, elections, terrorism, and privacy. (104) These included Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before the Senate following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, (105) as well as COO Sheryl Sandberg's testimony following the 2016 U.S. presidential election regarding foreign election interference on social media. (106) During the same period, the House of Representatives held four hearings, centrally focused on platform filtering practices (107) and the exploration of bias against American conservatives through content moderation. (108) The United Kingdom also held four lengthy inquiries into the influence of technology. (109)</p><p>Intergovernmental organizations applied a similar level of scrutiny. Six weeks after his congressional testimony, Mark Zuckerberg testified before the European Parliament--the body's first of a three-part hearing series on the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (110) The European Parliament, (111) the European Parliament's center-left political group, (112) and the European Commission (113) also paid attention to the dissemination of fake news on social media. Meanwhile, the UN has investigated the interface between social media and human rights, (114) counter-terrorism, (115) and speech, (116) with a special focus on Facebook as a platform for hate speech directed at Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority. (117)</p><p>Though the volume of government attention to the public outcry over Facebook's various scandals evinces notions of democratic accountability and process, their regulatory power to change these platforms is limited. The transnational operation of technology platforms has moved such entities beyond traditional notions of regulatory accountability--particularly where speech and content moderation are concerned. As Jack Balkin has described, public rights like free expression are now no longer \"dyadic\"--the classic struggle between government censorship and citizens--but \"pluralist\" in that private platforms now allow users to circumvent government intervention, and platforms can largely continue to operate successfully despite any one government's regulation. (118) In addition, the ability to regulate platforms has been hampered in the United States by First Amendment limitations on government restrictions of speech. This is notably not true of the European Union, which has recently passed comprehensive privacy regulation and whose courts have issued sweeping rulings to rein in the power of private platforms. (119)</p><p>Before this heightened government interest in platform regulation, civil-society groups were actively involved in discussions to construct better platform governance through policy advocacy, litigation, or independent research. (120) One of the earliest influencers in this area was the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which established itself as an early advocate for thoughtful content policy that balanced hate speech against freedom of expression. (121) In comparison, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has historically taken a more watchdog-like role than a collaborative one with platforms. (122) Between 2014 and 2019, a number of other civil-society groups have started initiatives to address platform regulation of online speech. (123) This influence has now coalesced into Facebook's \"Trusted Partner\" program which puts nongovernmental organizations into dialogue with the platform around important issues of speech. (124)</p><p>The sum of this outside pressure--from media, government, and civil society--eventually led to change at Facebook. In addition to more transparency in the rules, Facebook started to dedicate more staff to their enforcement. In the wake of Facebook's much criticized failure to quickly remove a murderer's video in April 2017, (125) Zuckerberg announced the company would hire 3,000 additional content moderators, (126) a number that later grew to 7,50c (127) The fevered media and government response to Facebook's harm to elections led to the creation of Social Science One, a research organization dedicated to looking at the effects of social media on democracy. (128) Finally, the tragedy in Myanmar resulted directly in code changes to the product to prevent future use of the Messenger services to create and encourage violent mob behavior, as well as the hiring of over 100 Burmese-fluent content moderators to recognize flagged hate speech. (129)</p><p>As will be discussed more extensively in Part III, Facebook's vulnerability to collective public action from media, government, and civil society is an important statement on the platform's accountability. (130) But it is a participatory and market-based model of accountability, not one based on guarantees of procedural rights or democratic votes. So far, users' power to influence Facebook comes from haphazard methods of collective complaint and expectations for response. Because disappointment of these expectations hurts Facebook's bottom line and long-term viability, Facebook faces a formidable challenge: it needs to preserve private power over its policy and product, while ensuring long-term engagement by meeting user expectations of accountability. The following Part details Facebook's efforts to meet this challenge through a new public-private governance regime: the Oversight Board.</p><p>II. INSTITUTION BUILDING: CREATING THE OVERSIGHT BOARD</p><p>In the wake of revelations about Facebook's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Mark Zuckerberg hosted a number of dinners for different groups of academics and advocates at his home to discuss what Facebook could do better. (131) These salons seem to have been the beginning of acculturing the CEO to the broader conversation around private governance in content moderation and privacy.</p><p>The Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation were born in this new moment of leverage. Drafted by a diverse group of content-moderation academics--Irina Raicu, Sarah T. Roberts, Nic Suzor, and Sarah Myers West--and joined by EFF, ACLU Foundation of Northern California, CDT, and New America's Open Technology Institute, the Principles declared three \"initial steps\" the companies must take in order to provide \"meaningful due process\" on platforms. (132) The first steps addressed issues of transparency relating to content-moderation statistics and notice to users whose content is removed, but the core of the initiative lay in the final principle. The Third Santa Clara Principle urged online speech platforms to create \"meaningful opportunity for timely appeal\" for their users and in the long term consider \"independent external review processes.\" (133)</p><p>The focus on the idea of an independent external appeals process or an independent multistakeholder body in order to create accountability for online speech platforms was important but not new. (134) In January 2018, Noah Feldman, a constitutional-law professor, wrote a brief memo spelling out the details for a \"Facebook Supreme Court,\" the virtues such a tribunal would have to embody, and how it might solve both Facebook's and Facebook's users' problems. (135) In getting buy-in for his idea, Feldman had something many others did not: a close friendship with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. Feldman passed the memo to Sandberg, who passed it to Zuckerberg. (136)</p><p>As it turns out, as both the Santa Clara Principles and Feldman were lobbying for the idea of an external independent appellate body, the concept was also in the works at the company. (137) In April 2018, these ideas began to surface in public talking points from Facebook's leadership. Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of Global Policy Management, stated that the platform was \"going to build out the ability for people to appeal our decisions\" because \"[w]e believe giving people a voice in the process is another essential component of building a fair system.\" (138) That month in an interview with Vox's Ezra Klein, Zuckerberg stated:</p><p>You can imagine some sort of structure, almost like a Supreme Court, that is made up of independent folks who don't work for Facebook, who ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world. (139)</p><p>Seven months later, Zuckerberg made the announcement official. In \"A Blueprint for Content Governance and Enforcement,\" the CEO acknowledged that he \"increasingly [has] come to believe that Facebook should not make so many important decisions about free expression and safety on [its] own.\" (140) Though he did not call it a Supreme Court, Zuckerberg described the creation of an independent oversight committee that would help govern content. (141) In creating such a committee, Zuckerberg promised to listen to outside advice on a host of difficult questions:</p><p>This is an incredibly important undertaking--and we're still in the early stages of defining how this will work in practice. Starting today, we're beginning a consultation period to address the hardest questions, such as: how are members of the body selected? How do we ensure their independence from Facebook, but also their commitment to the principles they must uphold? How do people petition this body? How does the body pick which cases to hear from potentially millions of requests? (142)</p><p>The statement closed with an aggressive goal: that such an independent body would be researched and created by the end of 2019. (143)</p><p>The thorny questions Zuckerberg posed in his statement were just a small sample of the many difficult problems to be addressed in creating the Oversight Board. Over the course of the next sixteen months, a small but steadily growing team of people inside Facebook worked on finding answers to them. This Part describes the institution-building process of creating the Oversight Board. Section II.A discusses the Board's conceptual development: the global consultation process, its mechanics, and the resultant report on its findings published by Facebook in June 2019. Given the input from this consultancy, Section II.B describes how the team then made decisions and tradeoffs in designing the Board and writing its founding documents, culminating in the publication of the Board's Charter in the fall of 2019. Finally, Section LLC discusses the implementation of the Trust and Limited Liability Corporation (LLC) to insulate the Board and the publication of the Bylaws, which detail the procedural mechanisms of the Board. This descriptive account lays the groundwork for Part Ill's normative assessment of the Board's impact on users, industry, governments, and global free expression.</p><p>A. Phase I: Global Consultation and Recruiting</p><p>In January 2019, Facebook's Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications, Nick Clegg, followed up on Zuckerberg's November 2018 announcement with specifics about how the Board would operate, what its potential scope might be, and a draft of its Charter. (144) Clegg's post also detailed the timeline and mechanisms by which Facebook would run the first phase of its process of creating the Board. This \"Global Consultation\" process would reach out to stakeholders and users worldwide to survey what people thought the Oversight Board should look like, accomplish, and address. It would take place over the first two quarters of 2019 and include a series of workshops hosted by Facebook to \"convene experts and organizations who work on a range of issues such as free expression, technology and democracy, procedural fairness and human rights.\" (145) These workshops were to be held in Singapore, Delhi, Nairobi, Berlin, New York, and Mexico City, but in an effort to not \"hand-pick[]\" a small group of global experts, Clegg detailed that additional outreach efforts would take place in other ways, such as by small group consultation, individual meetings, and a public portal for submitting proposals about the Board. (146)</p><p>Reaction to Zuckerberg's and Clegg's announcements was mixed. Some worried that an Oversight Board would not only create more of the same types of censorship of user speech--particularly \"borderline\" content--but also provide a show of self-governance that would block governments from regulating Facebook. (147) Others were less concerned with borderline speech decisions and instead saw the Oversight Board as a public-relations gambit that might never become a reality or, if it did, would be more soundbite than substance. (148) Cynically, there was also the realization that, should such an independent body come to fruition, the Board would reflect not the noble aim of creating accountability and responsible governance that so many had called for, but Facebook's best interests. (149) Specifically, some worried that having an independent body set some of Facebook's most contentious and high-impact policies might end up serving as a scapegoat, allowing the platform to divert responsibility in the face of negative public reactions. (150)</p><p>Before discussing the external consultation phase, it is useful to have an idea of what was happening internally at Facebook during those first six months. Before Zuckerberg publicly announced the creation of the Board in November 2018, Facebook had already begun to hire a team to make the idea a reality. (151) This team came to be called the Governance and Strategic Initiatives Team, or Governance Team. (152) Its director was a young consultant, Brent Harris, who was hired from outside Facebook in January 2018. (153) The Governance team led by Harris has around ten direct employees as well as dozens of \"cross-functional\" employees, who work on the Governance Team and in other areas of Facebook. (154) Harris and the Governance Team report to Clegg, who in turn reports directly to Zuckerberg. (155) At Facebook, a company that thickly layers its management, having only one reporting level between the Governance Team and Zuckerberg implied a major commitment to the project.</p><p>Within the Governance Team, work on building the Board was initially split into four \"tracks\"--or \"subject focuses.\" (156) Track 1 focused on the selection of the Board members. While information about what users wanted an Oversight Board to look like was gathered from the consultancy process, those involved with Track 1 prepped the back end of the selection process. Working with outside consultants, they developed a list of qualities desired in Board members, a vetting procedure for candidates, and a process by which users could \"nominate\" members. (157) Track 2's role was to decide on the powers, scope, and structure of the Board, which would be laid out in the founding documents. (158) One of the most difficult aspects was how to build a sufficiently independent adjudicatory body to provide oversight for Facebook, if Facebook was the creator of that Board. This problem arose in even basic questions of procedure, such as how the Board should review content decision cases. As one Team member described:</p><p>Let's start with... how Facebook will present those cases to the Board, so what kind of information is in the cases, how much information we give[] them, what is their basis of the review of the decision, are we asking them to do a de novo review or is it in deference to Facebook's earlier decision,... how are the panels selected that finally hear the cases, are we going for regional diversity, are we going for more of a global panel... [t]hen the deliberation process, what are the timelines--how long does the case move from the time it is sourced, selected, to hearing and deliberation and how does that work. (159)</p><p>Track 3 dealt with the administrative side of the Board, setting up the secretariat to staff the Board, creating a framework to research and give local context on an appeal to the Board through outside experts, designing the \"tooling that the Board is going to need, functionally, to be able to sift through the volume of cases,\" which included how the Board would be able to interact with Facebook while retaining independence. (160) Perhaps most saliently, the major task of Track 3 was to tackle the issue of governance:</p><p>[H]ow will the Board govern itself? What is the Board set up functionally to do as [it relates to] the Charter? How does the Board govern itself from a governance perspective in its Bylaws? And... how does that all work together to create the institution that is the Board and its staff? (161)</p><p>The fourth and final Track was the \"go to market\" team, tasked with implementing everything decided in Tracks 1, 2, and 3. (162) This team focused on the launch of the Oversight Board, from creating a curriculum for training its members to having a flagship event that could both orient and welcome the Board. (163)</p><p>While these Tracks worked internally at Facebook, a separate outreach team prepared to launch the global consulting process and interface between Facebook and the public. (164) This meant designing and planning the six global workshops. Crucially for user participation, it also involved inviting participants and collecting feedback. User participation was not limited to these workshops, however. The outreach team also met one-on-one with experts who could not attend the workshops, created one-day workshops for small groups of stakeholders, and constructed an online portal to solicit feedback from all global users. (165)</p><p>The first Global Workshop took place in Singapore on February 20 and 21, 2019. (166) The decision to start in the Global South was a purposeful one, said one member of the team, since \"the rules for Facebook had always come from an American and Western tradition, which was part of the problem. We wanted to do our best to anchor ourselves to the concerns of people that were outside that culture.\" (167) But at the first workshop, both sides had no idea what to plan for or expect. Facebook had invited around forty people and had not organized a presentation or structure for the discussion. \"I figured they would just tell us what they thought of the Board,\" said one organizer, \"but it turns out they showed up expecting to be told what the Board was, or might be, and they had no idea how to give feedback without that.\" (168) The result was a retooling of the format for the following day's meetings that included an introduction for workshop participants about the Board's purpose and a set of group exercises.</p><p>The format developed in Singapore became the standard programming for all global workshops going forward. (169) At each event, forty to fifty invited stakeholders, experts, and journalists convened over the course of two days. Participants were assigned seats around a nine-person table. At each seat was an iPad that was pre-loaded with case-study documents and the Facebook Community Standards. After a morning introduction to content moderation and the Oversight Board, the remainder of the two days was spent addressing two hypothetical cases that the Board might see. In these simulations, each workshop table was a notional Oversight Board \"panel.\" Participants were asked to read the \"case for review,\" and then, using the Community Standards as a guide, discuss with their group whether the content should stay up or come down. Tables voted individually and then a full-group poll was taken, followed by discussion. As the workshops moved around the globe--Delhi later in February, Nairobi in March, Mexico City and New York City in May, and Berlin in June--the outreach team for Facebook gathered careful notes from the conversations, polls, and group breakout sessions. (170)</p><p>In addition to these larger forums, the outreach team also organized a series of smaller roundtables to reach communities and groups of experts that could not attend the Global Workshops. The first of these occurred before the announcement of the Board and was held at Facebook. It included legal scholars, human-rights experts, and technical specialists at Facebook headquarters in October 2018. (171) Similar one-day stakeholder events were held all over the world, ranging from Taipei to Washington, D.C. to Istanbul, and even one town hall in Norman, Oklahoma. (172) In total, 650 people from eighty-eight countries attended the workshops, roundtables, and town halls. (173) Moreover, 1,206 people participated in the online questionnaire about the Board that was open to the public for responses between April 1 and May 27, 2019. (174)</p><p>User participation in determining what the Board should be was not the only goal of the Global Consultancy process. The events also served as potential sources of recruitment of members for the Board. (175) A Facebook employee, often from the Governance Team, oversaw the simulations at each table. As participants deliberated, Facebook employees looked for various qualities and attributes that early research in member selection had deemed relevant: was a participant open to changing their mind through conversation; (176) did a participant listen to others; did a participant express good insight into a particular issue; how did a participant deal with opinions hostile to their own? (177) While nominations of people to serve on the Board came through a variety of means, including an online public portal, the workshops provided critical feedback as the Governance Team moved into the membership selection phase. By the conclusion of the process, the Governance Team ran outreach on and sought feedback from well over two thousand individuals around the world, making it perhaps one of the largest global recruitment and stakeholder participation processes in history.</p><p>The results of the Global Consultancy were published in a forty-four-page executive report with a 180-page appendix on June 27, 2019. (178) As one might expect from such an extensive global survey, there was no clear consensus on what users wanted from an Oversight Board, but a few trends emerged. (179) For instance, the majority of those who gave feedback agreed that a set of substantive values should underpin the Charter and purpose of the Board, though there was significant disagreement about what those values should be. (180) Respondents also strongly favored the Board having the ability to influence policy, with ninety-five percent of respondents favoring the idea that the Board could make policy recommendations to Facebook. (181) Finally, while many felt that diversity should be a major priority for the Board and the people working for it, there was little unanimity about how to implement that idea on a global scale. (182)</p><p>These results, while scattered, provided a number of signals about what values and principles to aim for as the Governance Team turned to the next phase: drafting the Charter of the Oversight Board.</p><p>B. Phase II: Structure and Design</p><p>In early January 2019, a draft Charter was announced, listing some of the big questions that would have to be addressed by the final document. (183) The Oversight Board Charter was imagined as, and ultimately became, a constitution-like document that laid out the structural relationship between Facebook, the Oversight Board, and the Trust that would sit between them. On September 17, 2019, the Governance Team released the final Charter. (184) The nine-page foundational document was split into seven articles: Members, Authority to Review, Procedures for Review, Implementation, Governance, Amendments and Bylaws, and Compliance with Law. (185) This Section examines those provisions while adding context from interviews and observations at Facebook while the decisions were being made. It discusses four broad areas that involve the interplay of all provisions : Board Composition, Selection, and Removal of Members; Board Authority and Power; Appellate Procedure; and Structural Independence.</p><p>1. Board Composition, Selection, and Removal of Members</p><p>From the beginning of the Oversight Board project, once certain structural decisions were made, the final core question would be who Board members were and how they were selected. (186) This included substantive questions about what qualifications members should possess and whom they should represent, as well as procedural problems about how members would be chosen and removed. (187)</p><p>Feedback from the consulting period established that people overwhelmingly favored a diverse Board that represented \"as many segments of society as possible\" and incorporated a \"multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder approach.\" (188) The discussion of what diversity meant was lengthy and included discussions about gender, race, sexual orientation, geographic location, education, age, disability, wealth, and political views. (189) Additionally, much time was spent on members' necessary experience and qualifications. Many felt that Board members should be drawn from elite sectors of the global population, while others \"stress[ed] that the Board 'doesn't need people with public profiles.'\" (190) Feedback on subject-matter expertise of Board members generally fell into two camps: those who felt Board members should be versed in a specific subject matter like human rights, freedom of expression, law, or technology, and those who favored requiring more general decision-making expertise. (191)</p><p>The final decision in the Charter of how to balance professional qualifications and diversity pointed toward an adjudicatory rather than a representative model:</p><p>[M] embers must possess and exhibit a broad range of knowledge, competencies, diversity, and expertise... [and] must have demonstrated experience at deliberating thoughtfully and as an open-minded contributor on a team; be skilled at making and explaining decisions... ; and have familiarity with matters relating to digital content and governance, including free expression, civic discourse, safety, privacy and technology. (192)</p><p>The Charter also instructs the Board to split into subsections, termed panels, when reviewing cases. (193) Conversations about the panels have operated on the assumption that each will be comprised of five Board members, but the Charter does not specify a number. (194) The Charter does specify, however, that each panel will contain \"at least one member from the region\" where the case arose. (195)</p><p>This decision to mandate a \"local representative\" was heavily debated. In early June 2019, a cross-function meeting of over twenty people discussed the feasibility of including a mandatory local member on each panel. (196) \"What do we mean by local? One person from the [United States] can't represent all of the [United States]. So what do we mean? Does it have to be someone simply versed in the cultural issues at stake?\" asked one participant. (197) Others worried about the impracticality of looping in a regional representative given the speed at which decisions would have to be made. Finally, others emphasized that such concerns were no different for geography than for any other cultural factors. (198) By the end of that June meeting, the idea of a local panel member seemed to be put aside, but in early August it reemerged as a central element of the Charter. (199) In follow-up questions, a Governance Team member explained that the idea returned because it \"was something we heard over and over again in talking to stakeholders. It was really important to people.\" (200) The drafters imagined a \"scale up\" solution to the problem of finding a regional panel member--defining the \"region\" broadly--rather than a \"scale down\" solution that would attempt to find the perfect local representative for each case. (201)</p><p>The Charter also outlines the selection process for members. Initial selection presented a chicken-and-egg problem. Though the Board could eventually self-select, the question of how to select initial Board members was difficult. If Facebook selected the initial Board, it undermined its goal of having the Board be fully independent. A selection committee to choose the initial Board members was also no solution, merely perpetuating the same problem of Facebook \"selecting the selectors.\" (202) Direct voting was not only practically infeasible across languages and cultures, but also unlikely to lead to a productive outcome. (203) Ultimately, the Governance Team decided that Facebook's initial selection of members was inevitable but endeavored to reduce its impact by selecting an initial cadre, who would then select additional members. In an August workshop about the Charter, a few experts expressed deep skepticism about this approach, arguing that without more direction the Board would become \"chaos\" and that research in this area showed that people are drawn to selecting \"people most like them,\" thus threatening the Board's diversity. (204)</p><p>Despite these concerns, the Charter announced that the initial Board would be comprised of at least eleven members, with the potential to grow to \"likely\" forty, (205) and that Facebook would select the first Board members (\"Co-Chairs\"), who would then work with Facebook to select the remaining members. (206) Internally, the Governance Team referred to this as Phase 1, a period in which Facebook had the most direct involvement in helping to vet and decide on Board members. (207) Phase 2 of member selection would begin after the official launch of the Board and the selection of this initial group. Originally, it was imagined that this process would be largely independent from Facebook, with the Board Hiring Committee selecting \"candidates to serve as board members based on a review of the candidates' qualifications,\" and with recommendations for Board members coming from Facebook and the public. (208) Difficulty in selecting Board members and delays have changed this dynamic. (209) Phase 2 selection of Board members actively involves Facebook and the partners hired to assist with vetting, even though this is not mentioned in the Charter. (210) Presumably, after the Board reaches forty members, or Phase 3, Facebook's role is planned to return to the minimal one set out in the Charter. (211)</p><p>One of the final questions regarding Board composition was how a Board member's term would end. The Charter specifies that members will serve for three-year terms, for a maximum of three terms. (212) Outside this limitation, the Charter states only that \"trustees may remove a member before the expiration of their term for violations of the code of conduct, but they may not remove a member due to content decisions they have made.\" (213) The Charter does not specify a process for removal. (214) Generally, a detailed procedure on removal of government members is a vital part of ensuring accountability in governance. (215) Though many in the Governance Team argued for a more detailed removal process in the Charter, the ultimate decision was to place this process in the Bylaws.</p><p>2. Board Authority and Power</p><p>From the outset, the creation of an external independent Oversight Board raised questions of authority and power. Which content would fall under the Board's purview and what power it might wield over Facebook were ever present in the minds of the Governance Team and also of outside observers. (216) When it was released, the Charter was intentionally vague on many of these issues. Internally, the Governance Team and those in higher positions were actively debating exactly what should fall under the Board's jurisdiction, how cases would rise to their attention, what principles would guide decision-making, and what Facebook's responsibilities would be following a Board decision. The Charter's final language left many of these questions open, to be resolved by the Bylaws. (217)</p><p>The Charter set out a broad potential subject-matter jurisdiction for the Board, mentioning little about what content would be eligible or ineligible for review and primarily focusing on who could submit cases. (218) Excluding content that was removed in compliance with local laws (219) and following an exhaustion of appeals through Facebook, \"a request for review can be submitted to the board by either the original poster of the content or a person who previously submitted the content to Facebook for review.\" (220) This statement is significant, as it implies that the Board has the authority to review not only content that is removed (\"original poster of the content\") but content that is kept up (\"person who previously submitted\" content for review). As will be discussed later, this promise of reviewing removal and nonremoval of content is one that Facebook circumscribed in later documents, but this commitment in the Charter should be a meaningful point of leverage as the Board seeks to expand its powers in the future.</p><p>It is not only users who can seek redress with the Board. The Charter also sets forth a mechanism by which Facebook itself can ask the Board to review certain cases, \"including additional questions related to the treatment of content beyond whether the content should be allowed or removed completely.\" (221) The Board will have the ability to refuse Facebook's requests for review, just as it has the \"discretion to choose which requests it will review and decide upon.\" (222) But the Charter also imagines a specialized process in which Facebook can get an \"automatic and expedited review\" in the case of \"exceptional circumstances, including when content could result in urgent real world consequences.\" (223)</p><p>Once the Board selects a case for review, the question becomes which documents and principles will guide the decision. The Charter determines that Board members should \"review content decisions and determine whether they were consistent with Facebook's content policies and values.\" Facebook's Values, updated in August 2019, balance \"voice\" with four secondary concerns: safety, privacy, authenticity, and dignity. (224) Content policies refer mainly to Facebook's Community Standards. The Charter also specifies that any prior decisions by the Board on a piece of content will have \"highly persuasive\" precedential value. (225) Substantial debate took place within the Governance Team around how binding the Board's decisions should be on the Board itself. Many were concerned that creating a binding precedential structure would limit the Board, while others worried that not establishing a strong preference for precedential decisions could damage consistency and fairness. (226)</p><p>A final question related to the authority of the Board concerns Facebook's obligations in reacting to Board decisions. As to a decision on any single piece of content, the Charter states that the Board's decision is \"binding\" and \"Facebook will implement it promptly, unless implementation of a resolution could violate the law.\" (227) This obligation is strictly limited to the precise piece of content decided upon and the decision is not binding on any identical or similar content. Additionally, the Charter indicates that policy recommendations by the Board are \"advisory\" on Facebook, and that Facebook must \"transparently communicat[e] about actions taken as a result.\" (228) This latter obligation to respond to the Board's policy recommendations creates a weak-form review over Facebook that could potentially become powerful by creating a public system of accountability. (229)</p><p>3. Appellate Procedure</p><p>The section of the Charter that highlights the procedural process for Board review sheds little light on what it will ultimately look like from the user perspective, something better accomplished by the Bylaws that were published a few months later. Rather than lay out any specific procedures, the Charter instead introduces broad guarantees. These include various commitments not only to transparency (230) but also to privacy and confidentiality. (231) The Charter, furthermore, gives direction on the number of members needed to reach a decision (a majority, though consensus is encouraged) and what a panel should include in its written decision. (232) It also introduces the administrative operation of the Board, which will encompass full-time staff to \"support\" the Board, including \"reviewing case submissions and coordinating outside research and statements for selected cases.\" (233)</p><p>4. Independence Through Structure and a Binding Charter</p><p>One of the most frequent recommendations from the Global Consultancy period was to ensure the Board's independence from Facebook. The extent to which this recommendation was implemented will be evaluated in Part III. This Section aims only to describe the commitments in the Charter related to that goal. These commitments include the discretion given to the Board in case and member selection, the governance relationship between the Oversight Board, the Trust, and Facebook, and the structure around Charter amendments.</p><p>The ability of the Board to set its own docket is an essential part of its intellectual independence as an oversight body. Just as it would be problematic for, say, the U.S. Department of Justice to determine the Supreme Court's case selection, Facebook's ability to direct which cases the Board hears would create an obvious conflict, given that Facebook is the defendant in all actions before the Board. (234) To avoid such conflict, the Charter states that the Board will select its cases from those appealed by users. (235) However, the Charter also envisions \"Special Procedures\" in \"exceptional circumstances\" wherein the Board would \"automatic [ally]\" review a case at Facebook's request. (236)</p><p>A second fundamental part of the Board's intellectual independence is its ability to select its membership. The Charter states that after the announcement of initial members, the remaining members will be selected internally by the Board. (237) But as previously discussed, (238) the selection process of the initial cohort of members has increasingly been handled by Facebook. It is unclear if this precedent of Facebook's initial involvement will forever taint the process and put in place long-term mechanisms that compromise members' ability to fairly adjudicate.</p><p>Regarding the governance relationship between the Oversight Board, Trust, and Facebook, the Charter states that the \"board, the trust and Facebook will work together to fulfill the charter and the board's purpose.\" (239) The Board is to \"review content and issue reasoned, public decisions within the bounds of this charter... [and] provide advisory opinions on Facebook's content policies.\" (240) The Trust is to fund the Board's budget and appoint and remove members. (241) And Facebook is to \"commit to the board's independent oversight on content decisions and the implementation of those decisions,\" funding the Trust, and appointing trustees. (242) Moreover, it is to \"contract for services\" with the Board. (243) The Charter thus assigns Facebook a broad but vague role.</p><p>Finally, the Charter promotes independence by giving the Board a role in the process of amending the Charter. Amendment, according to the Charter, requires the approval of a majority of the individual trustees, a majority of the Board, and the agreement of Facebook. (244) The decision to include Facebook in the amendment process is problematic. On the one hand, it addresses practical concerns: the Board and the Trust might otherwise decide to amend aspects of the Charter in ways that are practically or legally infeasible for Facebook. On the other hand, the necessity to procure Facebook's agreement could prevent any meaningful amendment from taking place. Moreover, Facebook's amendment power is magnified by the fact that two influential documents lie outside the Board's control: the Community Standards and the substantive Values that underlie them. The Charter binds the Board to interpret these documents, and it is unclear what would happen if Facebook were to unilaterally alter them. Presumably, the Board would be beholden to Facebook's changing guidelines.</p><p>C. Phase III: Implementation</p><p>In the final stages of drafting the Charter, as details were removed and the document became increasingly high-level, members of the Governance Team started describing the role of the document as \"putting a stake in the ground.\" (245) The phase implied a metaphor that once \"land\" was claimed, details of use, ownership, or possession could be filled in later. Similarly, the role of the Charter was to stake out the core principles, with the rest to come later. (246) Accordingly, following the release of the Charter in mid-September 2019, the Governance Team began crafting the final founding documents and implementations that would support the Board and provide greater detail on processes and relationships between the three parties. This Section looks at the documents creating the Trust and the irrevocable grant to the Trust; the Bylaws and Code of Conduct; and the start of the administrative side of the Oversight Board.</p><p>1. The Trust</p><p>To be meaningfully independent, the Oversight Board must, at a minimum, have financial independence from Facebook. This point was frequently mentioned during the Global Consultancy period. (247) According to the Global Consultancy Report, \"the most common suggestion in this regard was the establishment of a separate trust, endowment or foundation.\" (248) The Governance Team adopted this suggestion and publicly announced in mid-September 2019 that it would create \"an independent trust.\" (249) Work on the Trust had begun months earlier, as members of the Team worked with outside consultants and Facebook's legal division to develop a Trust agreement and create a beneficiary for the Trust--the Oversight Board and an LLC, both independent entities. On October 16, 2019, Team members traveled to Delaware to meet with the Corporate Trustee, Brown Brothers Harriman, to sign the final documents and make the Trust and Oversight Board LLC official. (250) These documents were released to the public on December 12, 2019, alongside an announcement that Facebook had made an \"initial commitment of $130 million\" to support the Board's operational costs and allow it to \"operate for at least its first two full terms, approximately 6 years.\" (251)</p><p>According to the Trust Agreement, the Trust's stated purpose \"is to facilitate the creation, funding, management, and oversight of a structure that will permit and protect the operation of an Oversight Board.\" (252) To fulfill this purpose, the Trust funds the Oversight Board LLC, which will \"establish, administer and attend to the ongoing operation\" of the Board. (253) In addition to the Corporate Trustees, there will be between three and eleven Individual Trustees, all appointed by Facebook. (254) Trustees are slated to serve five-year terms (255) with annual compensation of $200,000. (256) Over two pages are devoted to tenure, review, removal, and resignation of Individual Trustees or Corporate Trustees, but none of these procedures empower any such actions by the Oversight Board itself. (257)</p><p>As a corporate legal document, the Oversight Board Trust Agreement is anything but boilerplate. It rests the core powers of Trustee appointment with Facebook, which might compromise the Trust's independence. But specific provisions do seem to empower Trustees. Section 2.2, for instance, states that a \"vital role of the Trust by its Individual Trustees is to protect the independent judgment of the Board Members and their ability to fulfill their stated purpose.\" (258) It further declares that Facebook \"has relinquished its authority over the Trust except with respect to key provisions... and under exceptional circumstances as a way to protect the Purpose and avoid frustrating the independent judgment of the Board.\" (259) The Agreement also gives the Trust the power to form companies. (260) This provision might allow the Trust and the Board to create new independent bodies as long as those entities serve the Board's goals. Finally, the Agreement makes an irrevocable grant to the Trust through the Trust Estate. (261) The Governance Team had long debated the exact structure of how to fund the Trust, weighing two clear but extremely different options. (262) The Trust could be funded annually by Facebook, which would force Trustees to come back on a yearly basis for funding. This would allow annual assessment of the Board and its efficacy, but it might also harm the Board's financial independence. At the other extreme, the Governance Team discussed creating an investible endowment at the outset, allowing the Trust and the Board to be self-funding so they could run in perpetuity. (263) This second proposal would have eliminated the Trust's financial dependence on Facebook but could have created the problem of creating an indelible source of funding for potentially nothing, if the Board were not to succeed. The final decision was somewhere in the middle: the Trust would be funded with an irrevocable grant of $130 million, enough to fund operations for two terms or approximately six years. (264)</p><p>Released alongside the Trust Agreement was the Oversight Board Limited Liability Agreement, which formally incorporated the Board as an LLC. (265) Much of the LLC Agreement rehashed the Charter's provisions about Board members' powers, but it also detailed the administrative side of the Board, creating, for instance, a Director of the Oversight Board. The Director is empowered to enter into service agreements and contracts on behalf of the Board; employ staff; provide for office, company, and Board member expenses; direct members' compensation; and dictate the provisions of members' contracts. (266) The provision of a Director of Administration added a new intermediary in the relationship between the Trustees and Board.</p><p>2. The Bylaws</p><p>The Bylaws, announced on January 28, 2020, were the Board's final founding document. (267) The Bylaws are split into four articles detailing the relationship between Facebook, the Trust, the Oversight Board, and the People who will be able to appeal through the Board. (268) The addition of \"People\" was significant. Though users were ostensibly the impetus for the Board and were the concern of most Governance Team deliberations, almost all of the founding documents focused on defining the powers and relationship of only the Board, the Trust, and Facebook. The Bylaws, for the first time, introduced and clearly defined the rights of users under the Board. This Section focuses on what the Bylaws mean for users seeking appeal through the Board. Moreover, it highlights the input that Facebook can seek from the Board. It concludes by discussing the levels of transparency in both procedure and reporting, and by reviewing the avenues of amending the founding documents.</p><p>a. User Appeal</p><p>According to the Charter, the Board can review a broad swath of content, but while the Bylaws reiterate the Charter's language, (269) they also create many exceptions to the Board's scope of review. At the Board's launch, only single-object (270) removals (271) of organic content (272) posted on Facebook and Instagram are eligible for review. (273) Within that, content decisions \"pursuant to legal obligations,\" including those having to do with intellectual property, Facebook marketplace, fundraisers, Facebook dating, messages, and spam, are out of the scope. (274) The Bylaws do, however, envision a broadening of this scope, stating that \"[i]n the future, people will have the opportunity to request the board's review of other enforcement actions,\" (275) but these too are limited to specific areas that will become appealable, including pages, profiles, groups, events, advertising, and content that Facebook reviews and \"ultimately allow[s] to remain on the platform.\" (276)</p><p>The Bylaws also set out the following appeals process for content that falls within the Board's limited subject-matter jurisdiction. First, a user has to exhaust Facebook's internal appeals process. Once exhausted--and if the content stays removed--a user can request an appeal to the Oversight Board. Doing so will generate an \"individualized identification number,\" (277) which must be copied from Facebook and taken to the Oversight Board's website. (278) Entering that number will generate a case submission to the Board. In addition to automatically transferring the file about the removed content to the Board, users will be able to submit additional information, such as an explanation of why they believe Facebook's decision was incorrect, \"why they believe the board should hear their case,\" and why the decision could impact other Facebook users. (279) From the moment Facebook makes its final decision, the user and Board have ninety days to submit and process a review. (280)</p><p>The next stage of Board appeal primarily involves the administrative staff and Case Selection Committee members. Staff members will prepare case submissions, prioritizing cases according to the directions of the Case Selection Committee. (281) The Case Selection Committee, which is comprised of five Board members, will then review those cases. (282) A majority vote is necessary to move a case to panel review. (283) If a case is moved to panel review, both the user and Facebook are notified. (284) Then, a five-member panel is convened to hear the case. (285) Four members are randomly selected, and one will be a random Board member from the region \"which the content primarily affects.\" (286) Though all members' names will be public, panels will remain anonymous. (287) In conducting its review, the panel can seek input from outside sources or a \"pool of outside subject-matter experts\" to be populated by the Board. (288) Before deliberation, case files will ultimately contain the statement of the user who submitted the case, a case history from Facebook, a policy rationale from Facebook, clarifying information from Facebook if requested by the Board, and any additional information gathered by the panel. (289) All stages of case-file preparation and advocacy are done in writing, and never in person.</p><p>Once the case file is complete and the panel is ready to deliberate, the panel will convene \"privately.\" (290) All panelists must attend and vote. (291) Though consensus is encouraged, it is not required, and all that is needed for a decision is a majority. (292) Once a decision is reached, it must be written up and must include a specific \"determination on the content\" as well as the reasoning and explanation for that decision. (293) Critically, it can also provide a policy-advisory statement for Facebook to consider. (294) Additionally, dissents and concurring opinions are allowed. (295) The panel then sends the written decision to the entire Oversight Board for review, where it must receive a majority vote in order to be formally adopted and published. (296) In this time, members outside the panel are welcome to ask questions, and if the decision does not receive majority approval, a new panel will be convened to rehear the case. (297) If a decision is approved, the Board administration will notify the persons involved and the decision will be published on the Board's website. (298)</p><p>Once a decision has been written, approved, and made public, the shuttlecock returns to Facebook for implementation. Under the Bylaws, Facebook must implement the Board's decision on the specific piece of content reviewed within seven days of the \"release of the board's decision.\" (299) At its own discretion, Facebook can decide if there is \"identical content with parallel context\" implied by the Board's decision that it can or should also take action on. (300) As specified by the Charter, the Board's policy recommendations are merely advisory. (301) Under the Bylaws, Facebook is required to return a \"public response regarding any policy recommendations and follow-on actions\" within thirty days of the Board's decision being received. (302)</p><p>b. Facebook Case Submissions</p><p>The Bylaws also spell out Facebook's separate avenue of appeal. Whereas the Charter only gestured to this separate avenue, (303) the Bylaws specify the ways in which Facebook can ask the Board for review and the extent to which the Board must listen. (304)</p><p>According to the Bylaws, Facebook can refer cases to the Board for review in three ways. The first is similar to users' right to appeal. Facebook can select a particular case or piece of content and request review. Here, the Board has the same discretion as with any user-presented case in determining whether to hear the case. (305) The second way leaves the Board with no discretion. In \"exceptional\" circumstances that might \"result in urgent real-world consequences,\" the Board must hear Facebook's request automatically and in an expedited fashion, which is deemed to be no more than thirty days. (306) Facebook is then bound by the Board's decision. (307) Finally, separate from any specific case, Facebook can simply request policy guidance from the Board, which the Board has discretion to accept or reject. (308) If the Board does issue a policy recommendation, it is only advisory. (309)</p><p>c. Transparency and Amendment</p><p>Finally, the Bylaws also speak to transparency and amendment. These provisions are significant because transparency allows the Board to leverage the weight of public opinion against Facebook and because amendment procedures speak to who truly controls the documents that convey power to the Board.</p><p>The Bylaws lay out a number of ways in which the Board, the Trust, and Facebook seek to be transparent. For instance, the Bylaws commit the Board to making all case decisions publicly available and archiving them in a database. (310) The Board must also publish an Annual Report with metrics on the number and type of cases reviewed, case submissions by region, and a report on the timeliness of decisions. (311) However, the Bylaws do not specify if the Board's transparency reports must include Facebook's specific case requests or requests for expedited review. (312)</p><p>When it comes to amending the Bylaws, Facebook retains significant power and the Board has little ability to control change to the rules outside its own administration. In matters regarding Oversight Board members, administration, and transparency reports, only a two-thirds majority of the Board is needed to amend the Bylaws. (313) For every other provision, Facebook must approve all changes. (314) This means, for instance, that the Bylaws' promise to expand the Board's scope of review in the future can only be fulfilled through an amendment to which Facebook agrees. (315)</p><p>III. A NEW PRIVATE-PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP TO GOVERN ONLINE SPEECH</p><p>In early interviews discussing the body that would become the Oversight Board, Zuckerberg stated that it should \"make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world!' (316) This vision is not just lofty; it is impossible. Norms and values develop in and come to define particular communities. (317) Facebook may wish to have one set of Community Standards that would satisfy all of its users. But a universal community with a universal set of norms underlying those standards does not exist at the global level. And if such a global community of users were to come into existence, it would not be through Facebook reflecting \"the social norms and values of people all around the world\" in its rules but rather by Facebook projecting its own set of rules and values onto users.</p><p>Facebook's projected rules and values are not neutral. For example, Facebook has a very vocal predisposition to and commitment to freedom of expression. (318) This is also reflected in its Values, which prioritize voice over concerns of safety, privacy, dignity, and authenticity. (319) Facebook's removal of hate speech, harassment, and bullying, all of which would be permissive in a First Amendment framework, mark concessions to limiting unfettered expression. (320) Moreover, Facebook's categorization of content cannot draw on universal categories because no such consensus exists. Hate speech to a Spaniard might be political free expression to a New Yorker. Obscenity to a Canadian might be art to a Korean. Fake news to an Australian might be satire to a Brazilian.</p><p>The rules that Facebook imposes on its users are thus frequently in conflict with the norms and expectations of its users. The Board might mitigate such conflict to some extent. Through policy recommendations, it can surface disagreements and suggest changes to the Community Standards. However, the Board's idealized primary role is to simply apply rather than change Facebook's Values and Community Standards.</p><p>This Part explores how the Board can best serve the interests of Facebook's global users. Section III.A focuses on denning what exactly the Board is by comparing it to existing structures that are similar in process, kind, and purpose. Section III.B assesses the Board's significance to global users and suggests ways in which the Board can grow and improve to best meet users' needs. Finally, Section III.C looks at the Board's long-term impact on industry standards, government, and global online speech. The language of the Charter was left intentionally vague in order to allow other platforms to adopt this structure and language for their own use. Whether this ushers in a new era of private-public governance and industry collaboration or a standardization that stifles diversity among platforms and threatens to censor speech remains unclear.</p><p>A. What Is the Board? Adjudication and Due Process</p><p>Currently, Facebook's governance of users' speech is an unchecked system. It is the kind of arbitrary power that, unrestrained, can trample individual rights. (321) This Section focuses on the analogy between the Board and a court to contextualize and understand the Board and to identify ways in which Facebook's governance might be effectively restrained by an external adjudicator. (322) Specifically, it focuses on courts bound by a constitution to protect individual rights. (323)</p><p>The analogy to courts is valuable, but also imperfect. Compared to U.S. federal courts, the Board's ability to select cases and its jurisdictional power of final authority are similar to that of the U.S. Supreme Court. The use of five-person panels that decide by majority is akin to a circuit court, though the Board's en banc approval of a decision is not required by a circuit court. Like a trial court, the Board--primarily through its administrative staff--also researches and builds cases around facts. And as with courts, parties--the appealing user and Facebook itself--submit written arguments. The Board's limited jurisdictional scope renders it similar to a court of special or exclusive jurisdiction. Specifically, it (combined with the Board's limited transparency) suggests a comparison to administrative courts like the Social Security Administrative Court or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.</p><p>Compared to other adjudication models, the Board has a similar vision for global internet adjudication as ICANN's Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy, which sets forth a procedure for resolving domain-name disputes between registrars and customers. (324) And while borrowing rhetoric and procedure from public courts, the Board is at its core a private, independent arbitration system built by Facebook. (325)</p><p>Using the analogy of courts bound by a constitution to protect individual rights, this Section evaluates the substantive and procedural protections that the founding documents provide for users, and the extent to which the documents give the Board independence.</p><p>1. Fundamental Rights</p><p>The analogy to a constitution that guarantees substantive and procedural rights through review by an independent judiciary is crucial for understanding the founding documents that create the Board. The Charter invokes this analogy most explicitly; it was envisioned, drafted, and described as a constitutional document. But all of the founding documents inform the rights of users, the Board, and Facebook.</p><p>When it comes to the substantive guarantees for users, the Charter's Introduction states that \"[f]reedom of expression is a fundamental human right.\" (326) But it does not expressly guarantee that right for users. Instead, it contemplates balancing the right of expression with \"authenticity, safety, privacy, and dignity.\" (327) This formulation invokes Facebook's Values (328) and also the preamble to Facebook's Community Standards, which states: \"The goal of our Community Standards has always been to create a place for expression and give people a voice. This has not and will not change.\" (329) Though this is a strong statement of company commitment to the principle of free expression, it too is not a. promise of rights to users. Nor does the preamble guarantee authenticity, safety, privacy, or dignity to users as substantive rights. Its language remains vague and noncommittal: \"We want to make sure the content people are seeing is authentic\"; \"We are committed to making Facebook a safe place\"; \"We are committed to protecting personal privacy and information\"; and \"We believe that all people are equal in dignity and rights.\" (330) Other founding documents, too, nowhere provide for users' substantive rights as a constitution would.</p><p>The absence of such guarantees is important to understanding what the Board is and can be for users. First, it makes clear that the limitation on Facebook's \"arbitrary will\" through the Board will not come from reviewing violations of individual users' rights but from reviewing Facebook's promise to uphold general principles. (331) Second, Facebook's commitments are in large part still located in documents--like Facebook's Values and Community Standards--that are amendable solely at Facebook's discretion. Finally, though the Charter and Bylaws do not create substantive rights for users, they do articulate (albeit vaguely) Facebook's promises to users on five critical concerns around online speech and instruct the Board to also \"pay particular attention to the impact of removing content in light of human rights norms protecting free expression.\" (332) Though far from a broad or robust adoption of human rights, this is better than nothing, especially if the Board creates a meaningful method for users to enforce such rights.</p><p>Creating a means for users to seek redress when they find that their \"voice\" has been silenced should be the Board's core purpose. The Charter states that \"[t]he purpose of the board is to protect free expression by making principled, independent decisions about important pieces of content and by issuing policy advisory opinions on Facebook's content policies.\" (333) While the scope of reviewable content is relatively narrow, especially at inception, its authority over Facebook is direct and clear. The Charter states \"Facebook will commit to the board's independent oversight on content decisions and the implementation of those decisions.\" (334) This grant of judicial deference is crucial. But equally crucial for ensuring users' effective redress is the Board's ability to provide meaningful due process through transparency and independence. (335)</p><p>2. Transparency</p><p>Transparency is a prerequisite of due process because if a legal system's rules and processes are opaque, citizens can neither avail themselves of the process, nor reliably know if they have violated a rule. (336) To allow for due process, citizens need (1) notice of what the rule is, (2) notice that they have allegedly violated the rule, (3) notice that a procedural system exists for review of the alleged violation, (4) notice of what that procedural system entails, and (5) notice of the ultimate decision reached. In most of these respects, Facebook and the Board provide a robust level of transparency. Since spring of 2018, Facebook has made its Community Standards and content policy public. (337) This allows users to see how the rules are enforced against them, even if there is currently no way to independently verify if the public-facing Community Standards are in fact the ones enforced on users. (338) Moreover, significant deliberation went into creating the Board and its rules during the Global Consultancy. Regarding the second notice requirement, Facebook provides users with both notice of rule violation and appeal. Moreover, the founding documents transparently communicate the structure and procedures of the Board and the Trust. Once the user has appealed to the Board, the Bylaws provide for notice when the appeal is accepted for review and when a decision has been reached on the case. (339) Perhaps most crucially, the Charter instructs panel determinations to include the final directive on the content along with \"a corresponding plain language explanation of the board's rationale.\" (340) These decisions will be publicly posted on the Board's website, which will operate in eighteen languages. (341) Finally, the Bylaws also instruct the Board to publish annual reports on the number and type of cases and the timeliness of Facebook's implementation and response on policy advisory statements. (342) This amounts to significantly more transparency around procedure than Facebook had provided before.</p><p>Despite these advances, however, some areas of the Board's process remain opaque. While the members will be public, the individual members on a given panel will serve anonymously. Furthermore, while the Case Selection committee \"will document its selection criteria, as well as the volume and types of cases... the board has selected for review\" and publish them in annual reports, the actual process will remain cloaked. (343)</p><p>3. Independence</p><p>In addition to transparency, due process also requires \"the participation of an independent adjudicator.\" (344) This Section will assess the extent to which the founding documents establish the independence of the Board by using a three-part framework: (1) jurisdictional independence, (2) intellectual independence, and (3) financial independence.</p><p>a. Jurisdictional Independence</p><p>Jurisdictional independence describes the Board's powers and obligations to others and its authority to govern itself. The Board's authority is predicated on its creation by the Oversight Board LLC, which in turn derives authority from the Oversight Board Trust. The Trust Agreement and the Oversight Board LLC Agreement, together with the Charter and the Bylaws, define the authority, limitations, and relationships of each entity as well as basic procedures for their interaction.</p><p>Until the Board's creation, Facebook had exclusive control over the jurisdiction of its platform--like a territorial sovereign. (345) But the very concept of the Board, which contemplates an independent entity with binding control within the jurisdiction of Facebook, requires Facebook to convey a portion of its authority to another entity with limited jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Trust Agreement \"relinquishes [Facebook's] authority over the Trust,\" with the \"goal to ensure the proper administration and structure\" to allow the Board to \"render its independent judgment.\" (346) In order to ensure the establishment of the Board within this new jurisdiction, the Trust agreement tethers the purpose of the Trust to \"the creation, funding, management, and oversight of a structure that will permit and protect the operation of an Oversight Board,\" and also mandates the creation of the Oversight Board LLC. (347) Facebook's delegation of authority to the Trust is far from absolute. Facebook \"has relinquished its authority over the Trust except with respect to key provisions stated herein and under exceptional circumstances\" (348) Importantly, this clause does not specifically define which key provisions are limiting the Trust's authority.</p><p>In regard to the \"business and affairs\" of the Oversight Board LLC, the Trust has \"sole and absolute discretion.\" (349) This includes specific administrative powers, such as the ability to enter into Board member contracts and service agreements, remove and appoint members and staff, issue payment and compensation, and provide office and research expenses. (350) The Trust and the LLC each have administrative representatives who facilitate requests from the Board and disbursements from the Trust, respectively. For the Trust, this is the Director of the LLC Administration, who is appointed by the Corporate Manager. (351) For the LLC, it is the Director of the Oversight Board, who is appointed by the Individual Managers. (352) Critically, in regards to these administrative financial and legal powers, the Agreements have no mention of Facebook. (353) At least in regard to administrative matters and operation, the Board and Trust largely self-govern.</p><p>The majority of the powers granted to the Trust can only be exercised if a request is made from the Oversight Board Director, but there are some important exceptions. The most significant of these is the power of the Trustees to form \"one or more companies for the purpose of effectuating the Purpose of this Trust.\" (354) \"Company\" is defined broadly as \"any corporate body (of whatsoever kind), partnership, limited liability company, foundation, organization.\" (355) This is a significant power that could allow the Trust, for instance, to create a legislative body to provide more direct user representation and perhaps issue new content-moderation rules. However, exercising this power requires Facebook's consent. (356) Moreover, it is unclear how this would be initiated as it requires no request by the Board or LLC for execution. It is therefore uncertain whether the Board, which is the entity most likely to want such a legislative body, even has the power to request it.</p><p>Once the Board is created, Facebook must also expressly delegate power to the Board itself, not just the Trust. The Charter and the Bylaws state that</p><p>[the] board's resolutions of each case will be binding and Facebook will implement it promptly.... When a decision includes policy guidance or a policy advisory opinion, Facebook will take further action by analyzing... [and] considering it... and transparently communicating about actions taken as a result [within thirty days]. (357)</p><p>The Charter also establishes the Board's obligations to Facebook: to review content appeals brought by users, or by Facebook, and issue \"reasoned, public decisions... [and] provide advisory opinions on Facebook's content policies.\" (358) The Board's unilateral authority to order Facebook to enforce an equitable remedy makes it seem to have authority akin to that of a constitutional court. Like the government in such a system, Facebook is always the defendant, and the court adjudicates its adherence to the value of free expression.</p><p>But just as with Facebook's creation of the Trust, the mere granting of some limited authority tells us little about how the Board can wield it. The strength of the Board's authority will be primarily dictated by the scope of material that Facebook allows the Board to review and users to appeal. Here, as we saw, the Charter and Bylaws set different expectations. Unlike the Charter's commitment to a broad scope, the Bylaws designate only individual pieces of content like posts, photos, videos, and comments that have been removed by Facebook as initially eligible for appeal. (359) Moreover, in order to exercise the right to appeal, the user must \"have an active Facebook or Instagram account.\" (360) Other Facebook services--WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram Direct, and Oculus--are explicitly excluded. (361) The Bylaws add that \"[i]n the future, people will have the opportunity to request the board's review\" for content reviewed by Facebook \"and ultimately allowed to remain on the platform.\" (362) But it is unclear how this promise of a broader scope in the future can be enforced. It appears that such an initiative would have to be considered through amendment to the Bylaws. Here, neither the Board, nor the Trust, nor users appear to have significant recourse. Instead, the Bylaws give only Facebook the authority to amend the relevant section \"after consulting with the board and the trustees.\" (363) Thus, although much content will be available for review, the Bylaws and their process of amendment place significant and meaningful limits on the Board's ability to self-govern and on its overall jurisdictional independence.</p><p>b. Intellectual Independence</p><p>A critical piece of establishing the independence of an adjudicatory body is ensuring that members are without, or are willing to set aside, personal bias on matters before them. (364) Intellectual independence refers to the procedural affordances made to a body to accomplish this. It is characterized by a body's freedom from external control when making decisions and its ability to avoid bias through such procedures as the selection and removal of members.</p><p>With the exception of the inaugural member-selection process, the Board's \"Membership Committee\" has \"sole responsibility\" over the recruitment, interview, and selection of new members. (365) The only method of outside input is a public portal through which members of the public, Facebook, and Board members can submit candidate recommendations. (366) As feedback from the Global Consultancy had urged, (367) any current or former employee of Facebook, and any person engaged in litigation with Facebook, is disqualified from candidacy to avoid conflicts of interest. (368) If candidates are successfully screened and interviewed by the Committee, their appointment is presented to the full Board for review, where it requires a majority vote. (369) The Bylaws seem to also give Trustees some oversight authority, instructing them that the appointment of new members should ensure \"that the board maintains geographic balance.\" (370) Feedback from the Global Consultancy expressed strong concern about the intellectual independence of the Board due to Facebook's role in the initial selection process. (371) But although the selection of the initial Board included Facebook, Facebook's exclusion from the process going forward, the disqualification of current or former employees from candidacy, and the clear procedural affordances to the Board and Trust suggest that they will be able to develop and maintain intellectual independence in the long-term.</p><p>Ensuring the Board's intellectual independence also requires giving it significant control over the ability to remove members. Feedback from the Global Consultancy stressed the need to empower the Board in this regard and to define what would qualify as a violation of the terms of appointment. (372) The founding documents implement this feedback. They vest formal removal power of Board members in the Trust. (373) The Trust can receive removal requests from \"the board, the director, or the public,\" a list from which Facebook is notably absent. (374) But it is unclear which party, upon notice of an alleged violation, is responsible for investigating the claims. On the one hand, the Bylaws give the Trust the ability to \"receive, verify, and act upon requests to remove members based on violations of the code of conduct.\" (375) On the other hand, they direct that removals \"require a two-thirds vote of the board... subject to approval of the Trustees.\" (376) Regardless, the founding documents are clear that a member may be removed before the end of a term only for violations of the Code of Conduct, and Trustees \"may not remove a member due to content decisions they have made.\" (377) The Code of Conduct, published with the Bylaws, \"sets forth the rules and guidelines that govern the personal and professional conduct for all board members... and staff\" of the Oversight Board.\" (378) It also recommends a method of internal reporting of suspected misconduct for Board members or staff*. (379) Thus, the removal of members lies entirely with the Board and Trust, and not with Facebook.</p><p>Finally, the Board must be intellectually independent of Facebook not only in its control over who is deliberating through appointments and removals but also in its ability to decide what it deliberates on. Within its jurisdiction, that is, the Board must be able to review, research, and select cases for deliberation without interference from Facebook. For user appeals, a \"Case Selection\" committee is empowered to set and apply criteria for prioritizing cases. A majority of the Committee must agree for a case to go to panel review. (380) Were this the only means of the Board reviewing cases, it would be an entirely independent process. But it is not. As we saw, Facebook also has power to seek review from the Board through \"Special Procedures.\" (381) The Charter gives Facebook authority \"in exceptional circumstances\" to \"send cases to the board for an automatic and expedited review, which the board will accept and review as quickly as possible.\" (382) Facebook also has the ability to \"request\" \"advisory\" \"policy guidance\" from the Board. (383)</p><p>The effect of these provisions on the Board's intellectual independence is hard to predict. Focusing on the Board's role as an external appeals body for users, Facebook's special powers may have no bearing on the Board's intellectual independence. However, Facebook could co-opt the time, energy, and resources of the Board in pursuit of its own issues and at the expense of the Board's mandate to consider users' appeals. Whether Facebook will use its special powers in these ways remains to be seen. But on the whole, the founding documents ensure a robust level of intellectual independence.</p><p>c. Financial Independence</p><p>Financial independence is another key component of an adjudicative body's independence. The most central worry regarding the Board's financial independence derives from the fact that Facebook provides all of the Board's funding. If members' compensation comes from the very entity that they are supposed to be critically reviewing, there is a strong conflict of interest. Members could easily feel obligated to provide decisions supportive of Facebook, in order to ensure their continuation on the Board. This is the central reason the Trust was created. Through the Trust Agreement, the Trust legally accepts the \"Initial Trust Estate\"--a gift of $130 million--from Facebook. (384) This gift is irrevocable. (385) The purpose of the Trust is to create, fund, manage, and oversee the \"structure that will permit and protect the operation of an Oversight Board.\" (386) This gives Trustees the power to set up the LLC and provide it with funds for Board member and staff compensation, expenses, and other financial obligations. (387) In addition to structurally isolating the Board from financial conflicts of interest, the Trust Agreement also establishes protections to guard against self-dealing by the Trustees. (388) These safeguards, together with the irrevocable grant of funding and creation of the Trust to administer those funds, give the Board meaningful financial independence. (389)</p><p>B. What Does the Board Mean for Global Users?</p><p>Having discussed the nature of the Oversight Board, this Section considers how the Board, as a system of adjudication, will work for users. Predictions of the Board's potential for users can be roughly categorized into three camps--corresponding to different groups of critics: pessimists, realists, and optimists. (390)</p><p>1. The Pessimists</p><p>Critics of the Board worry that it will reduce Facebook's incentives to accurately moderate content. The existence of the Board, for instance, might lead Facebook to remove more content because it can now refer frustrated users to the Board. Or it could have the opposite effect. If the Board proved to be a harsh critic, Facebook might leave up more reported content in order to remove it from the Board's jurisdiction.</p><p>From a regulatory perspective, many see Facebook's creation of the Board as a display of self-regulation in order to stave off actual government regulation. The Board might also be a purposeful distraction of public attention away from more critical technological concerns like algorithmic content management or microtargeting. Most critically, some see the Board as simply serving Facebook's business interests, describing Facebook's creation of the Board as a co-optation of principles of due process in order to shield and legitimate its capitalistic enterprises.</p><p>Perhaps the most common criticism of the Board is that it is a public-relations mechanism for Facebook to defer responsibility and does not do enough for users. This criticism goes mostly to the Board's independence. While the structure of the Board through the LLC and Trust give it robust financial independence from Facebook, its limited subject-matter jurisdiction threatens to undermine its potential impact. Additionally, while the Board's membership-selection process will eventually be entirely self-governed, it is unclear when that will occur. Both the Charter and Bylaws provide for Facebook's role in choosing the first cochairs and then working with those cochairs to \"form the initial board,\" which \"thereafter\" will become the sole responsibility of the Membership Committee. (391) But they leave open when exactly the initial Board will have been created. The Charter contemplates Facebook's involvement continuing for the \"remainder of the board seats,\" (392) which is troublingly vague--especially given that the size of the Board is fluidly defined as \"no less than eleven members,\" and when fully staffed \"likely to be forty members.\" (393) Neither the Charter nor By-laws describe an event or time that will signal the end of the initial Board's creation. The Governance Team initially envisioned Facebook's role in member selection to end upon the official announcement of eleven to fifteen Board members. (394) But the date for that announcement has been delayed and the projected number of members has changed multiple times. (395) In recent conversations, Facebook officials have projected the Board's initial size to lie above fifteen and \"in the twenties\" and have admitted that Facebook's lack of involvement after the announcement \"might not happen.\" (396) Facebook's prolonged involvement in the inaugural selection process poses significant long-term risks to the intellectual independence of the Board. (397) Finally, critics have also raised transparency concerns about the initial Board selection and the lack of public deliberations. (398)</p><p>Some of these criticisms can be addressed. For instance, the Board could remove the panels' anonymity and increase transparency and public communications by amending the Bylaws. (399) An amendment to the Charter or Bylaws could also change the scope of content for the Board's review. This latter amendment, however, depends on Facebook's consent. (400) And the same is true for other critical decisions, such as the appointment of Trustees. (401)</p><p>Missing from the amendment process is a critical voice: users. While the founding documents provide users with procedural rights, they do not provide them with direct accountability mechanisms. The rights of the user are only to use the system, not to give input on its structure, form, procedures, or underlying rules and values. Disappointment in the limits of user rights is therefore understandable. But it might be premised on an unrealistic expectation of accountability. While users might expect democratic accountability, a more realistic outcome is participatory empowerment. (402) The creation of the Board supports this thesis. It originated in Facebook users advocating for an independent appeals system and Facebook listening. Moreover, the process of creating the Board during six months of Global Consultancy likewise empowered users through participation.</p><p>2. The Realists</p><p>Many commenters expressed concern that whether or not the Board was a good idea, it simply would not work in practice. Their chief concern was scale. (403) In the second and third quarters of 2019, 30.8 million pieces of content remained down even after appeal. (404) This equates to approximately 170,000 pieces of content per day that would be potentially eligible for Board review. (405) Even if just one percent of those cases were appealed, that would still amount to around 1,700 cases a day. This is a daunting number of cases to process by a Selection Committee that forms a subset of an eleven-to-forty-person Board, even with staff support. Meaningfully processing the volume of cases submitted will be challenging--especially given the timeline of ninety days from filing to decision on appeal. (406)</p><p>Additional practical concerns arose with regard to the system's potential manipulation, for instance by trolls coordinating to submit identical or similar requests and crashing the submission system. The Board's commitment to transparency on decisions raises complications as well. The Board will provide reasoned decisions on the cases it hears and log those decisions in a public database. It will thus operate much like a common-law court, providing people with application of rules to real-life facts. But how much transparency is required? It is tempting to suggest that the decision should contain the actual piece of content reviewed. But if the decision upholds Facebook's decision to remove the content, it seems contradictory to post a copy of that very content on the Board's website.</p><p>Such contradictions are not limited to hearing cases but also include amending the founding documents. For instance, ads are imagined as coming into the future scope of the Board. But if the only appealable decisions are on content \"removed for violating the Community Standards,\" it is very hard to see how this would ever work in practice for a typical user, whose primary complaint would likely be that the ad itself violated Community Standards. This means that before ads can come into the scope of the Board's review it is likely that the scope will first have to be expanded to include \"content reviewed... and ultimately allowed to remain on the platform.\" (407)</p><p>3. The Optimists</p><p>Besides raising normative and practical concerns, the Board also holds great potential for users. At the outset, it gives users more process and ability to be heard than ever before. Even with its narrow jurisdictional scope, the procedural right of review by an independent adjudicator with the authority to instruct Facebook to restore speech is significant for global freedom of expression. It creates a tool that can be leveraged by users. Groups or organizations that disagree with Facebook's Community Standards could organize to submit large numbers of appeals regarding the same kind of removed content and thus attempt to create better odds of the Board selecting its case. If the Board selects the case, the submitting group would have an opportunity to argue not only for reinstatement of the content but for why the rule is wrong. If successful, the Board might not only restore the content, but it would ideally recommend that Facebook change the policy.</p><p>By giving users a right to appeal, the Board also tackles two of the most significant inequities in the moderation of online speech: Facebook's lack of transparency around content moderation and inequities in user access to content reinstatement. This promises to hold Facebook accountable for content-moderation inaccuracies and give users equal access to an equitable remedy. In so doing, it replaces the historically opaque private system marked by cronyism and influence. Every day, Facebook removes millions of pieces of content, and the vast majority of users have no recourse to achieve reinstatement. External message boards and third-party websites proliferate to answer users' attempts at self-help to unlock disabled accounts or reinstate removed content. (408) For most of Facebook's history, getting your content restored was simply a matter of knowing the right people. Users who had connections to people inside Facebook or Instagram, to civil-society members who maintained connections to the company, or to members of the media who could draw attention to the fact that they had been censored were the most successful at getting their content restored. Even the media pushback against Facebook's censorship was often not a tale of popular empowerment, but rather an example of real-world power manifesting itself online. Facebook had removed posts of the \"Terror of War\" photo thousands of times before that day in September 2016, when the user censored was influential and politically connected enough for the media to expend coverage. By providing every user with transparency in appeals, process, and independent review, the Board takes a small but important step in remedying this inequity.</p><p>Finally, the Board might make Facebook better at serving users. The Board's decisions and policy recommendations may help Facebook to create policies that reflect what users want to see. The Board might also improve how Facebook researches, designs, and builds its other products. The Governance Team's model of user participation in the process of creating the Board has received great interest company-wide. Beyond Facebook, too, the Board might lead to more widespread user participation in deciding how to design private systems that govern our basic human rights.</p><p>C. Impact on Industry, Government, and Global Speech</p><p>The majority of this Feature has focused on the relationship between four parties: Facebook, users, the Trust, and the Board. As discussed, the creation of the Board will likely have both positive and negative effects on these entities, but it will also have a far broader impact on industry, governments, and global speech.</p><p>The Trust Agreement in particular gives significant power to Trustees to act in fulfilling their purpose of supporting the Board. It empowers them, for instance, to form companies--such as the legislative body discussed above. (409) Or they could create a research group of experts on content moderation or an assembly of human-rights experts to advise the Board on decisions. True, Facebook would need to agree to the creation of such bodies, but the Board could exert pressure for this to happen. Finally, as will be discussed more below, the Trust's power to form companies could allow it to form LLCs for other private platforms that wish to use the insulation created by the Trust to set up their own oversight boards.</p><p>1. Industry</p><p>There are at least five possible ways in which the Board might influence how online speech platforms adjudicate content.</p><p>1. The Board has no impact at all because it fails or is never adopted outside of Facebook.</p><p>2. Platforms replicate the process of creating the Board or design their own processes (involving user participation) to create adjudicatory bodies.</p><p>3. Platforms contribute money to the Trust but, instead of creating their own boards, they request to use the Facebook Oversight Board to adjudicate appeals on their own content. In this scenario, the Board would then either have to delegate each platform's appeal review to specific members or attempt to make all members familiar with all sets of rules and values and apply the correct set of rules to each appeal.</p><p>4. Platforms contribute money to the Trust to set up their own Oversight Board to adjudicate appeals on content under their own rules and values. For this to happen, a platform would make an irrevocable grant to the Trust and relinquish its authority over the Trust; the Trust would then create an LLC to manage the platform's Oversight Board.</p><p>5. Platforms use the founding documents as models, making slight changes, and convene their own trusts and boards.</p><p>The Board's industry impact on speech varies greatly among these potential outcomes. If the Board fails entirely or remains relevant only to Facebook, the effects will likely be limited and confined to how Facebook regulates its speech. At the other extreme, platforms may decide to replicate the participatory process used to create the Oversight Board, draft their own founding documents, and create their own trust and board. Because this latter path involves user participation, it has the highest likelihood of achieving legitimacy and accurately reflecting the interests of platform users. This method also has the highest likelihood of generating diversity among platforms by opening the possibility of new forms outside the Facebook model. But unfortunately, this is also the least likely outcome given the difficulty and expense of such a process, and given the comparative ease of simply using existing structures and documents created by Facebook's process.</p><p>Of the remaining outcomes, the third is the worst for speech. The administrative and operational complexity of having one Oversight Board applying multiple sets of platform rules and values would be overwhelming. Moreover, it vests users' power of appeal in one industry-wide board. Over time, that board's decisions might standardize rules across the industry. This would likely reduce diversification in markets for different types of speech environments.</p><p>The final two outcomes are the best for speech. They involve independent oversight boards that are specifically employed to adjudicate the appeals of their platforms. Having distinct oversight boards preserves diversity in industry speech policies and optimizes opportunities for online free expression. (410) Of these options, platforms using the founding documents as models is preferable to platforms simply using the Oversight Board Trust because it allows platforms more control over customizing the structures of the Trust and Board. In the long term, it could also help produce better content moderation at all levels by creating a \"market of rule sets.\" Larger platforms that can afford to fund and create a board could make their systems available to other firms based on the scale of their content-moderation needs. In this scenario, small or nascent firms would then be able to easily and affordably choose which model of speech regulation they wanted on their platform and employ the corresponding board. The Board's founding documents were designed for this very purpose--to allow platforms to use them easily as a template for their own systems of speech governance.</p><p>2. Government</p><p>There are at least three possible ways in which governments might react to the Board:</p><p>1. Nation-states ignore the Oversight Board and future platform boards.</p><p>2. Nation-states recognize the Oversight Board or boards' decisions as precedential authority when public courts adjudicate platform speech issues.</p><p>3. Nation-states co-opt the Oversight Board or boards by requiring these private systems to adjudicate platform speech issues that surface in public courts.</p><p>The impact of the Oversight Board on governments is expressly limited, in that the founding documents exclude from appeal any content that is removed by Facebook in accordance with the law. Governments, however, could have a potentially strong impact on the Board. This of course would not be true if governments and courts simply ignored the Board and similar private systems. But that seems unlikely given the current political climate surrounding technology companies. One possibility, favorable to the Board, is that courts might recognize the Board's reasoning when the same or a similar content claim is raised in a legal action. Courts are unlikely to accept the Board's decision as precedential or give it comity, but they might consider it persuasive. Such recognition of the limited and private jurisdiction of the Board might be similar to courts' recognition of private alternative dispute resolution. The more problematic outcome both for global speech and the Board would be if governments were to co-opt this private system for their own ends. For example, courts might order the Board to adjudicate and enforce claims of a certain type, similar to the European Court of Justice's directive to Google to administer right-to-be-forgotten claims. (411) This would be especially bad for speech if a court decided to also direct the Board to administer such claims in accordance with the law in the court's jurisdiction and apply the decisions to all of Facebook. Recent cases have suggested courts' ability to use a platform to enforce their jurisdiction extraterritorially, a development that flouts national sovereignty and individual rights. (412)</p><p>3. Global Free Expression</p><p>The impact of the Oversight Board on global free expression has been addressed and analyzed throughout this piece. What has been largely unexplored, however, is the way in which the future of online speech will affect the Board.</p><p>As this Feature goes to press, the world is experiencing a global pandemic seemingly unprecedented in human history. (413) Governments have ordered people to remain in their homes, (414) closed schools, (415) banned the assembly of people in large groups, (416) and restricted travel. (417) Museums, concert halls, stadiums, operas, theatres, and even parks are empty. (418) Courts have closed and canceled civil and criminal trials and hearings. (419) Shops, cafes, gyms, malls, restaurants, and bars have closed doors that might never reopen. (420)</p><p>The realities of worldwide mass quarantine have decimated the economy and stymied government, but perhaps the most devastating and permanent effects will be social. Around the world, people have been shuttered in their homes for weeks and months, unable to gather in groups or experience social connection. Children are separated from parents, teachers are separated from students, neighbors are separated from each other. The infected, sick, and at-risk are cut off.</p><p>This real-world social isolation has exposed and deepened the essential and massive power of network communications technology. Individuals' ability to connect to each other through the internet and its platforms swiftly became a basic human right. Instead of litigating the legality of government mandates denying assembly, people sought out communities online. New Facebook Groups, Slack channels, and group texts proliferated. (421) Universities and grade schools turned to Zoom, WebEx, and Google Hangouts to hold regular classes. (422) Virtual board meetings, birthdays, dinners, and happy hours were held online. The sick and dying said goodbye through FaceTime and Skype. (423)</p><p>In the midst of the crisis, Facebook announced it would be suspending most of its human content moderation globally. (424) Unlike the billions of people working from home, content moderators must work on special screens and be supervised to ensure user privacy. In place of human review, Facebook announced it would do more automated content moderation. (425) At a normal time, this decline in meaningful human content review (426) on a prominent speech platform would raise questions of over- or undercensorship of speech. But in the midst of a global pandemic with a population never before so reliant on internet platforms, over-or undercensorship of speech is also a threat to public health. (427)</p><p>The effect of this long-term experiment without human content moderation remains to be seen. Its greatest threat is not that it gives Facebook plausible justification to remove human review but that it may groom users to accept this outcome. (428) If a long-term policy in the future were to deny users the right of human review, the Oversight Board would become more than just an exercise in user participation in platform governance; it would be a vital procedural element of protecting users' right to global free expression.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Global events demonstrate that freedom of speech can no longer be separated into two separate worlds--one online, the other offline. The Oversight Board marks the first platform-scaled moment of transnational internet adjudication of online speech. It signifies a step towards empowering users by involving them in private platform governance and providing them with a modicum of procedural due process.</p><p>The pace at which this area of scholarship and technology is changing is remarkable. Twenty years ago, Facebook did not yet exist; fifteen years ago, it was a fad website from a college dorm room; ten years ago, it was an emerging empire; today, it connects almost a third of the global population. Similarly, five years ago, few would have thought it possible that a private corporation would voluntarily divest itself of part of its power in order to create an independent oversight body. Like the past events that led to it, the future of the Oversight Board is impossible to predict, once humans start interpreting and understanding the documents and processes contemplated in this Feature. But even though the Board's founding documents have flaws and limitations and leave questions unanswered, they are a promising new tool for ensuring free speech around the world.</p><p>AUTHOR.

My conditions for this access were that all conversations were free from any nondisclosure agreement and that I must be allowed to tape all interviews. I received no funding from Facebook and was funded entirely by individual research grants from the Knight Foundation, Charles Koch Institute, and MacArthur Foundation. This level of access is somewhat unprecedented and understandably raises questions as to Facebook's motivations for allowing an individual such a level of insight into their process. When I asked this question to Facebook directly, I was told that I was the only academic or reporter who asked to embed with the Governance Team and thus the only one granted access. While this may in part be true, it seems undeniable other motives likely exist. To this I can only speculate, but I believe the motivations were centered around concerns regarding the Board's legitimacy. To that end, my reporting, research, and publication of this Feature could be leveraged to gain elite buy-in on the project and to demonstrate the platform's commitment to transparency and accountability on a project that was centrally about transparency and accountability. To the best of my ability, I have tried to remain aware and vigilant not only of Facebook's motivations for allowing me to observe this process but also of not hinging my research or writing on this access.</p><p>(18.)

Hashing works like fingerprinting for online content: whenever authorities discover, say, a video depicting sex with a minor, they take a unique set of pixels from it and use that to create a numerical identification tag, or hash. The hash is then placed in a database, and, when a user uploads a new video, a matching system automatically (and almost instantly) screens it against the database and blocks it if it's a match. Besides child pornography, hash technology is also used to prevent the unauthorized use of copyrighted material, and over the last two and a half years it has been increasingly used to respond to the viral spread of extremist content, such as ISIS-recruitment videos or white-nationalist propaganda, though advocates concerned with the threat of censorship complain that tech companies have been opaque about how posts get added to the database.\").</p><p>(32.)

Telephone Interview with Peter Stern, supra note 88.</p><p>(98.) See GILLESPIE, supra note 12, at 13,47 (\"And moderation is, in many ways, the commodity that platforms offer.\"). There are many competing formulations of what the product of Facebook is. Many argue that Facebook's product is advertising and users pay to use Facebook through the collection of personal data. See, e.g., ZUBOFF, supra note 12 (arguing that platforms' capitalist purpose is to surveil users in order to collect and commoditize their data for the purpose of selling advertising). But in a microeconomics consumer-theory framework, a product is a good or service to meet the desire or need of a customer. In this sense, curation of user-generated content is the service and product Facebook is supplying to its users, who do not pay for it in money, but instead in data. Thus, data is not the product but in fact the currency of the system of governance around content moderation. Because content curation is the product, it can also be a source of market differentiation between platforms, except if those platforms become so different in kind and dominant in their unique cultures as to preclude exit.

The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), for example, was a group that splintered off from EFF to focus on policy efforts in Washington, D.C. Other more general tech and speech advocacy groups like the Electronic Privacy Information Center, WITNESS, New America's Open Technology Institute, AccessNow, Committee to Protect Journalists, and the ACLU all began making online speech and platform governance part of their work either through the creation of new roles or new advocacy directives. In contrast to policy advocacy, a number of these groups also worked for platform policy change through litigation against platforms and governments. Reno v. ACLU, for example, formed the foundational support for Section 230 of the CDA allowing--for better or worse--the proliferation of internet platform self-regulation. 521 U.S. 844 (1997). Today, new organizations like the Knight First Amendment Institute leverage the broadening role of platforms in speech to take aim at government.</p><p>(124.)

L. REV. 1,47 (2012). Imagining the Oversight Board as a court is to invite debate. This comparison is sometimes problematic for those who think of courts in formal terms as an arm of traditional nation-state government and those who see them as a process in governance. The Oversight Board is operating in the latter sense, adjudicating individual claims made on a private transnational platform, but it falls short of formal definitions as a court or legal system. Ultimately, it is unclear whether saying the Board is a court or court-like matters. See SCOTT J. SHAPIRO, LEGALITY 223-24 (2011) (describing \"degrees of legality\" in that \"legality itself is not a binary property but also comes in degrees\" through analogy to the United States Golf Association (USGA) and concluding that \"[t]he best we can say about the USGA, therefore, is that it is like a legal system in some senses, but not in others, and leave it at that\").</p><p>(324.)

Attribution for this analogy to alternative dispute resolution goes to Jeff Gary. Unlike ADR, however, the Board does not foreclose litigation outside of Facebook within actual court systems in the way many ADR agreements do, and it does not address anything other than equitable remedies. See George Applebey, What Is Alternative Dispute Resolution?, 15 HOLDSWORTH L. REV. 20, 32 (1991). Moreover, unlike ADR's guarantee of a procedure, the Board has discretion over whether to hear a case. See Oversight Board Bylaws, supra note 201, art. 1, [section] 3.1.2.</p><p>(326.)

Facebook has made a number of other significant moves toward transparency around content moderation--most significantly, the tabulation and publication of quarterly transparency reports around content removal, appeals, and restoration site-wide, and the creation of the Public Policy Forum. Bickert, supra note 14. While these are massive efforts, they still have limitations. The Transparency Report, for instance, does not make it particularly easy to find the actual numbers and percentages of removals, appeals, and restoration. The Public Policy Forum, while publishing reports and letting in academic observers, is still generally a closed system private to Facebook.</p><p>(338.)

Ignore the public pronouncements from all sides and the spluttering outrage about Australia being picked on. Yesterday's call by Facebook will have thrown the growing push for regulation of the platforms into a holding pattern. No one can be certain about what happens next.   Moreover, it throws up in the lights the biggest of questions about the giant platforms: can they be regulated? Or, is the only solution to break them up?(Author and internet guru Cory Doctorow argues the latter in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59\">How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism</url></emphasis>, released last week.)  Here's what you need to know as we all watch what happens next with the proposed mandatory code between the digital platforms and news companies.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who'sright? Who's wrong?</emphasis> It's a war between big tech and old media over money and power. No one is right, although both are marshalling deeply moral arguments (free press! Open internet! Fake news! Journalists jobs!) to support their case.   Both are using their old tools: old media pushing its case in mastheads, Google and Facebook using their platforms; old media lobbying regulators, big tech using its global algorithms. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Whyshould we care?</emphasis> It's like the old joke about a lost driver seeking directions: if you wanted to regulate big tech, you wouldn't be starting from here. You wouldn't start by centering the interests of old media.   There are simpler models to get money. Former ACCC chair Allan Fels floated one in today's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AFR</emphasis>: a tax on all digital transactions. There are better ways to support media through the digital transition than forcing Big Tech to prop up old models. Making old media dependent on payments from the platforms could accelerate print closures.  The cost in the government's current plan is the lost opportunity of better regulation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who needs whom?</emphasis> Here's the nub of the problem: each side believes deeply that the other is a parasite.  Old media is convinced that the platforms need their content to draw users. After all, why else would you go to Google or Facebook? Big Tech says it funnels users to media companies which can make money through advertising or by selling subscriptions -- Facebook claims that's worth $200 million to Australia's publishers in the first five months of this year.  Facebook thinks that a news-free news feed will be just as -- maybe more -- profitable. It's attempting to pivot to transactions through, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/announcing-facebook-shops\">Facebook Shops</url> launched this year.   Or take millennials' social media of choice Instagram (owned by Facebook) where the response to yesterday would have been: \"Wait... Instagram has news?\"   Instagram brings in about a third of Facebook's revenues. It's trickier for Google. When you organise the open internet, it's hard to exclude news. The draft legislation has been drawn to make it all but impossible.   News snippets are one of the tools they use to keep people on their site, although they don't sell ads on news searches which they say are only a couple of percent of all searches. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why isthe government supporting old media?</emphasis> Have you met our government?   OK, as Frydenberg said yesterday: \"We want a sustainable media environment.\" (That'll be news to the ABC.) The government has been convinced by News Corp that the key to sustainability is to go where the money is: shake down big tech. I mean... errr... \"seek payment for original journalistic content\". <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So whathappens now?</emphasis> Initially, nothing. Facebook's boycott starts once the proposed mandatory code goes through parliament, (expected in December). In the meantime, Facebook's programmers will be working out how to make good on their threat. The ACCC will be responding to stake-holder submissions on the draft which closed last Friday.  Facebook have already alerted users that their terms and conditions will change on October 1: \"We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\"  The big focus remains where it's always been: in the US. That's why Facebook put so much effort into alerting US media to yesterday's announcement.   There, big tech faces a more existential question: will a Democrat administration be elected in November? And, if so, will it follow through on its rhetoric to move beyond regulation to break up big tech? </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TH-GY61-F0NT-H2MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><timeReceived>11:51:21 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ignore the public pronouncements from all sides and the spluttering outrage about Australia being picked on. Yesterday's call by Facebook will have thrown the growing push for regulation of the platforms into a holding pattern. No one can be certain about what happens next.   Moreover, it throws up in the lights the biggest of questions about the giant platforms: can they be regulated? Or, is the only solution to break them up?(Author and internet guru Cory Doctorow argues the latter in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59\">How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism</url></emphasis>, released last week.)  Here's what you need to know as we all watch what happens next with the proposed mandatory code between the digital platforms and news companies.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who'sright? Who's wrong?</emphasis> It's a war between big tech and old media over money and power. No one is right, although both are marshalling deeply moral arguments (free press! Open internet! Fake news! Journalists jobs!) to support their case.   Both are using their old tools: old media pushing its case in mastheads, Google and Facebook using their platforms; old media lobbying regulators, big tech using its global algorithms. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Whyshould we care?</emphasis> It's like the old joke about a lost driver seeking directions: if you wanted to regulate big tech, you wouldn't be starting from here. You wouldn't start by centering the interests of old media.   There are simpler models to get money. Former ACCC chair Allan Fels floated one in today's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AFR</emphasis>: a tax on all digital transactions. There are better ways to support media through the digital transition than forcing Big Tech to prop up old models. Making old media dependent on payments from the platforms could accelerate print closures.  The cost in the government's current plan is the lost opportunity of better regulation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who needs whom?</emphasis> Here's the nub of the problem: each side believes deeply that the other is a parasite.  Old media is convinced that the platforms need their content to draw users. After all, why else would you go to Google or Facebook? Big Tech says it funnels users to media companies which can make money through advertising or by selling subscriptions -- Facebook claims that's worth $200 million to Australia's publishers in the first five months of this year.  Facebook thinks that a news-free news feed will be just as -- maybe more -- profitable. It's attempting to pivot to transactions through, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/announcing-facebook-shops\">Facebook Shops</url> launched this year.   Or take millennials' social media of choice Instagram (owned by Facebook) where the response to yesterday would have been: \"Wait... Instagram has news?\"   Instagram brings in about a third of Facebook's revenues. It's trickier for Google. When you organise the open internet, it's hard to exclude news. The draft legislation has been drawn to make it all but impossible.   News snippets are one of the tools they use to keep people on their site, although they don't sell ads on news searches which they say are only a couple of percent of all searches. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why isthe government supporting old media?</emphasis> Have you met our government?   OK, as Frydenberg said yesterday: \"We want a sustainable media environment.\" (That'll be news to the ABC.) The government has been convinced by News Corp that the key to sustainability is to go where the money is: shake down big tech. I mean... errr... \"seek payment for original journalistic content\". <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So whathappens now?</emphasis> Initially, nothing. Facebook's boycott starts once the proposed mandatory code goes through parliament, (expected in December). In the meantime, Facebook's programmers will be working out how to make good on their threat. The ACCC will be responding to stake-holder submissions on the draft which closed last Friday.  Facebook have already alerted users that their terms and conditions will change on October 1: \"We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\"  The big focus remains where it's always been: in the US. That's why Facebook put so much effort into alerting US media to yesterday's announcement.   There, big tech faces a more existential question: will a Democrat administration be elected in November? And, if so, will it follow through on its rhetoric to move beyond regulation to break up big tech? </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S1-PMK1-F0NT-H1T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><timeReceived>11:51:21 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ignore the public pronouncements from all sides and the spluttering outrage about Australia being picked on. Yesterday's call by Facebook will have thrown the growing push for regulation of the platforms into a holding pattern. No one can be certain about what happens next.

Ignore the public pronouncements from all sides and the spluttering outrage about Australia being picked on. Yesterday's call by Facebook will have thrown the growing push for regulation of the platforms into a holding pattern. No one can be certain about what happens next.   Moreover, it throws up in the lights the biggest of questions about the giant platforms: can they be regulated? Or, is the only solution to break them up?(Author and internet guru Cory Doctorow argues the latter in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59\">How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism</url></emphasis>, released last week.)  Here's what you need to know as we all watch what happens next with the proposed mandatory code between the digital platforms and news companies.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who'sright? Who's wrong?</emphasis> It's a war between big tech and old media over money and power. No one is right, although both are marshalling deeply moral arguments (free press! Open internet! Fake news! Journalists jobs!) to support their case.   Both are using their old tools: old media pushing its case in mastheads, Google and Facebook using their platforms; old media lobbying regulators, big tech using its global algorithms. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Whyshould we care?</emphasis> It's like the old joke about a lost driver seeking directions: if you wanted to regulate big tech, you wouldn't be starting from here. You wouldn't start by centering the interests of old media.   There are simpler models to get money. Former ACCC chair Allan Fels floated one in today's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AFR</emphasis>: a tax on all digital transactions. There are better ways to support media through the digital transition than forcing Big Tech to prop up old models. Making old media dependent on payments from the platforms could accelerate print closures.  The cost in the government's current plan is the lost opportunity of better regulation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who needs whom?</emphasis> Here's the nub of the problem: each side believes deeply that the other is a parasite.  Old media is convinced that the platforms need their content to draw users. After all, why else would you go to Google or Facebook? Big Tech says it funnels users to media companies which can make money through advertising or by selling subscriptions -- Facebook claims that's worth $200 million to Australia's publishers in the first five months of this year.  Facebook thinks that a news-free news feed will be just as -- maybe more -- profitable. It's attempting to pivot to transactions through, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/announcing-facebook-shops\">Facebook Shops</url> launched this year.   Or take millennials' social media of choice Instagram (owned by Facebook) where the response to yesterday would have been: \"Wait... Instagram has news?\"   Instagram brings in about a third of Facebook's revenues. It's trickier for Google. When you organise the open internet, it's hard to exclude news. The draft legislation has been drawn to make it all but impossible.   News snippets are one of the tools they use to keep people on their site, although they don't sell ads on news searches which they say are only a couple of percent of all searches. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why isthe government supporting old media?</emphasis> Have you met our government?   OK, as Frydenberg said yesterday: \"We want a sustainable media environment.\" (That'll be news to the ABC.) The government has been convinced by News Corp that the key to sustainability is to go where the money is: shake down big tech. I mean... errr... \"seek payment for original journalistic content\". <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So whathappens now?</emphasis> Initially, nothing. Facebook's boycott starts once the proposed mandatory code goes through parliament, (expected in December). In the meantime, Facebook's programmers will be working out how to make good on their threat. The ACCC will be responding to stake-holder submissions on the draft which closed last Friday.  Facebook have already alerted users that their terms and conditions will change on October 1: \"We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\"  The big focus remains where it's always been: in the US. That's why Facebook put so much effort into alerting US media to yesterday's announcement.   There, big tech faces a more existential question: will a Democrat administration be elected in November? And, if so, will it follow through on its rhetoric to move beyond regulation to break up big tech? </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RT-RG31-JD6R-T3TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><timeReceived>11:51:21 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ignore the public pronouncements from all sides and the spluttering outrage about Australia being picked on. Yesterday's call by Facebook will have thrown the growing push for regulation of the platforms into a holding pattern. No one can be certain about what happens next.   Moreover, it throws up in the lights the biggest of questions about the giant platforms: can they be regulated? Or, is the only solution to break them up?(Author and internet guru Cory Doctorow argues the latter in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59\">How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism</url></emphasis>, released last week.)  Here's what you need to know as we all watch what happens next with the proposed mandatory code between the digital platforms and news companies.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who'sright? Who's wrong?</emphasis> It's a war between big tech and old media over money and power. No one is right, although both are marshalling deeply moral arguments (free press! Open internet! Fake news! Journalists jobs!) to support their case.   Both are using their old tools: old media pushing its case in mastheads, Google and Facebook using their platforms; old media lobbying regulators, big tech using its global algorithms. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Whyshould we care?</emphasis> It's like the old joke about a lost driver seeking directions: if you wanted to regulate big tech, you wouldn't be starting from here. You wouldn't start by centering the interests of old media.   There are simpler models to get money. Former ACCC chair Allan Fels floated one in today's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AFR</emphasis>: a tax on all digital transactions. There are better ways to support media through the digital transition than forcing Big Tech to prop up old models. Making old media dependent on payments from the platforms could accelerate print closures.  The cost in the government's current plan is the lost opportunity of better regulation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who needs whom?</emphasis> Here's the nub of the problem: each side believes deeply that the other is a parasite.  Old media is convinced that the platforms need their content to draw users. After all, why else would you go to Google or Facebook? Big Tech says it funnels users to media companies which can make money through advertising or by selling subscriptions -- Facebook claims that's worth $200 million to Australia's publishers in the first five months of this year.  Facebook thinks that a news-free news feed will be just as -- maybe more -- profitable. It's attempting to pivot to transactions through, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/announcing-facebook-shops\">Facebook Shops</url> launched this year.   Or take millennials' social media of choice Instagram (owned by Facebook) where the response to yesterday would have been: \"Wait...

The draft legislation has been drawn to make it all but impossible.

OK, as Frydenberg said yesterday: \"We want a sustainable media environment.\" (That'll be news to the ABC.)

Facebook's boycott starts once the proposed mandatory code goes through parliament, (expected in December).

Facebook have already alerted users that their terms and conditions will change on October 1: \"We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\"  The big focus remains where it's always been: in the US.

Ignore the public pronouncements from all sides and the spluttering outrage about Australia being picked on. Yesterday's call by Facebook will have thrown the growing push for regulation of the platforms into a holding pattern. No one can be certain about what happens next.   Moreover, it throws up in the lights the biggest of questions about the giant platforms: can they be regulated? Or, is the only solution to break them up?(Author and internet guru Cory Doctorow argues the latter in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59\">How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism</url></emphasis>, released last week.)  Here's what you need to know as we all watch what happens next with the proposed mandatory code between the digital platforms and news companies.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who'sright? Who's wrong?</emphasis> It's a war between big tech and old media over money and power. No one is right, although both are marshalling deeply moral arguments (free press! Open internet! Fake news! Journalists jobs!) to support their case.   Both are using their old tools: old media pushing its case in mastheads, Google and Facebook using their platforms; old media lobbying regulators, big tech using its global algorithms. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Whyshould we care?</emphasis> It's like the old joke about a lost driver seeking directions: if you wanted to regulate big tech, you wouldn't be starting from here. You wouldn't start by centering the interests of old media.   There are simpler models to get money. Former ACCC chair Allan Fels floated one in today's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AFR</emphasis>: a tax on all digital transactions. There are better ways to support media through the digital transition than forcing Big Tech to prop up old models. Making old media dependent on payments from the platforms could accelerate print closures.  The cost in the government's current plan is the lost opportunity of better regulation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who needs whom?</emphasis> Here's the nub of the problem: each side believes deeply that the other is a parasite.  Old media is convinced that the platforms need their content to draw users. After all, why else would you go to Google or Facebook? Big Tech says it funnels users to media companies which can make money through advertising or by selling subscriptions -- Facebook claims that's worth $200 million to Australia's publishers in the first five months of this year.  Facebook thinks that a news-free news feed will be just as -- maybe more -- profitable. It's attempting to pivot to transactions through, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/announcing-facebook-shops\">Facebook Shops</url> launched this year.   Or take millennials' social media of choice Instagram (owned by Facebook) where the response to yesterday would have been: \"Wait... Instagram has news?\"   Instagram brings in about a third of Facebook's revenues. It's trickier for Google. When you organise the open internet, it's hard to exclude news. The draft legislation has been drawn to make it all but impossible.   News snippets are one of the tools they use to keep people on their site, although they don't sell ads on news searches which they say are only a couple of percent of all searches. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why isthe government supporting old media?</emphasis> Have you met our government?   OK, as Frydenberg said yesterday: \"We want a sustainable media environment.\" (That'll be news to the ABC.) The government has been convinced by News Corp that the key to sustainability is to go where the money is: shake down big tech. I mean... errr... \"seek payment for original journalistic content\". <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So whathappens now?</emphasis> Initially, nothing. Facebook's boycott starts once the proposed mandatory code goes through parliament, (expected in December). In the meantime, Facebook's programmers will be working out how to make good on their threat. The ACCC will be responding to stake-holder submissions on the draft which closed last Friday.  Facebook have already alerted users that their terms and conditions will change on October 1: \"We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.\"  The big focus remains where it's always been: in the US. That's why Facebook put so much effort into alerting US media to yesterday's announcement.   There, big tech faces a more existential question: will a Democrat administration be elected in November? And, if so, will it follow through on its rhetoric to move beyond regulation to break up big tech? </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RK-F3K1-F0NT-H533-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><timeReceived>11:51:21 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Mike Lee \u201chas taken the side of big tech companies over your constitutional rights.\u201d</p><p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>To better understand what is really going on, please do read the following fact check of Tucker Carlson\u2019s claims below.</p><p>Tucker: \u201cThanks to a special carve out Google has received from the United States Congress, something called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, Google itself is not responsible for the content on its platform because the Congress says it doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d</p><p>Reality: Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was passed by Congress in 1996. Google didn't even exist until 1998. Since Section 230 was passed two years before Google even existed it is impossible for it to be a \u201cspecial carve out Google\u201d received from the government. Section 230 protects online platforms (like a website, app, etc.) from being liable for the content created by someone on their online platform. Under Section 230, all companies operating online platforms are responsible for their own content that they create on their platform. But they are not responsible for the content that is created by another person or company who uses their platform. The person who creates the content is responsible for the content.</p><p>Tucker: \u201cImmunity is a very nice thing to have if you are a big company, Fox News doesn\u2019t have it. But again, thanks to CongressGoogle does have immunity.\u201d</p><p>Reality: Section 230 applies to all companies equally. When Fox News operates its website, they do in fact have the exact same Section 230 protections that Google does. FoxNews.com has a comments section. And just as Google would be immune from any slanderous comments made by a commenter in a YouTube comments section, FoxNews.com is also immune from any slanderous comment made by a commenter in their comments section.</p><p>Tucker: \u201cWe would love to ask Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) about this\u2026 Why do we ask him? Because Lee chairs the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee. He is the man that could do something to protect you from Google.\u201d</p><p>Reality: Section 230 is telecommunications law. It has nothing to do with antitrust law. The Communications Decency Act is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Committee, not the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Antitrust Subcommittee. If people believe Section 230 is the key to protecting the American people from Google then they should look to amend communications law, not antitrust law.</p><p>Sen. Lee does share Tucker\u2019s concern about liberal progressive bias at Google, Facebook, Twitter, NBC News, CBS News, ABC News, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and National Public Radio.</p><p>What the NBC News\u2019 \u201cVerification Unit\u201d tried to do to The Federalist is absolutely a threat to honest and open speech in the United States. Conservatives should speak out against progressive attempts to silence conservative voices. And Sen. Lee did exactly that.</p><p>But our nation\u2019s antitrust laws, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, were not designed, nor are they equipped, to regulate political bias in technology or media companies.</p><p>If we are going to be successful in protecting Americans constitutional rights against progressive activists that want to silence Americans they disagree with, we need to be accurately informed about what the real dangers to our civil rights are. If we waste our time misunderstanding when laws were passed, why they were passed, and what they actually do, we will only make it easier for progressives to win.</p><p>If you want to read more about Sen.

Mike Lee \"has taken the side of big tech companies over your constitutional rights.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>To better understand what is really going on, please do read the following fact check of Tucker Carlson's claims below.</p><p>Tucker: \"Thanks to a special carve out Google has received from the United States Congress, something called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, Google itself is not responsible for the content on its platform because the Congress says it doesn't have to be.\"</p><p>Reality: Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was passed by Congress in 1996. Google didn't even exist until 1998. Since Section 230 was passed two years before Google even existed it is impossible for it to be a \"special carve out Google\" received from the government. Section 230 protects online platforms (like a website, app, etc.) from being liable for the content created by someone on their online platform. Under Section 230, all companies operating online platforms are responsible for their own content that they create on their platform. But they are not responsible for the content that is created by another person or company who uses their platform. The person who creates the content is responsible for the content.</p><p>Tucker: \"Immunity is a very nice thing to have if you are a big company, Fox News doesn't have it. But again, thanks to CongressGoogle does have immunity.\"</p><p>Reality: Section 230 applies to all companies equally. When Fox News operates its website, they do in fact have the exact same Section 230 protections that Google does. FoxNews.com has a comments section. And just as Google would be immune from any slanderous comments made by a commenter in a YouTube comments section, FoxNews.com is also immune from any slanderous comment made by a commenter in their comments section.</p><p>Tucker: \"We would love to ask Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) about this... Why do we ask him? Because Lee chairs the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee. He is the man that could do something to protect you from Google.\"</p><p>Reality: Section 230 is telecommunications law. It has nothing to do with antitrust law. The Communications Decency Act is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Committee, not the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Antitrust Subcommittee. If people believe Section 230 is the key to protecting the American people from Google then they should look to amend communications law, not antitrust law.</p><p>Sen. Lee does share Tucker's concern about liberal progressive bias at Google, Facebook, Twitter, NBC News, CBS News, ABC News, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and National Public Radio.</p><p>What the NBC News' \"Verification Unit\" tried to do to The Federalist is absolutely a threat to honest and open speech in the United States. Conservatives should speak out against progressive attempts to silence conservative voices. And Sen. Lee did exactly that.</p><p>But our nation's antitrust laws, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, were not designed, nor are they equipped, to regulate political bias in technology or media companies.</p><p>If we are going to be successful in protecting Americans constitutional rights against progressive activists that want to silence Americans they disagree with, we need to be accurately informed about what the real dangers to our civil rights are. If we waste our time misunderstanding when laws were passed, why they were passed, and what they actually do, we will only make it easier for progressives to win.</p><p>If you want to read more about Sen. Lee's thoughts on how Antitrust law should be applied to Big Tech, please read this interview: CPI Talks... with Senator Mike Lee</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123771173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605P-K5C1-JCBF-S54N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 19, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Mike Lee (R-UT) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of you have asked about claims made by Tucker Carlson that Sen. Mike Lee \"has taken the side of big tech companies over your constitutional rights.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To better understand what is really going on, please do read the following fact check of Tucker Carlson's claims below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tucker: \"Thanks to a special carve out Google has received from the United States Congress, something called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, Google itself is not responsible for the content on its platform because the Congress says it doesn't have to be.\"</p><p>Reality: Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was passed by Congress in 1996. Google didn't even exist until 1998. Since Section 230 was passed two years before Google even existed it is impossible for it to be a \"special carve out Google\" received from the government. Section 230 protects online platforms (like a website, app, etc.) from being liable for the content created by someone on their online platform. Under Section 230, all companies operating online platforms are responsible for their own content that they create on their platform. But they are not responsible for the content that is created by another person or company who uses their platform. The person who creates the content is responsible for the content.</p><p>Tucker: \"Immunity is a very nice thing to have if you are a big company, Fox News doesn't have it. But again, thanks to CongressGoogle does have immunity.\"</p><p>Reality: Section 230 applies to all companies equally. When Fox News operates its website, they do in fact have the exact same Section 230 protections that Google does. FoxNews.com has a comments section. And just as Google would be immune from any slanderous comments made by a commenter in a YouTube comments section, FoxNews.com is also immune from any slanderous comment made by a commenter in their comments section.</p><p>Tucker: \"We would love to ask Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) about this... Why do we ask him? Because Lee chairs the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee. He is the man that could do something to protect you from Google.\"</p><p>Reality: Section 230 is telecommunications law. It has nothing to do with antitrust law. The Communications Decency Act is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Committee, not the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Antitrust Subcommittee. If people believe Section 230 is the key to protecting the American people from Google then they should look to amend communications law, not antitrust law.</p><p>Sen. Lee does share Tucker's concern about liberal progressive bias at Google, Facebook, Twitter, NBC News, CBS News, ABC News, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and National Public Radio.</p><p>What the NBC News' \"Verification Unit\" tried to do to The Federalist is absolutely a threat to honest and open speech in the United States. Conservatives should speak out against progressive attempts to silence conservative voices. And Sen. Lee did exactly that.</p><p>But our nation's antitrust laws, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, were not designed, nor are they equipped, to regulate political bias in technology or media companies.</p><p>If we are going to be successful in protecting Americans constitutional rights against progressive activists that want to silence Americans they disagree with, we need to be accurately informed about what the real dangers to our civil rights are. If we waste our time misunderstanding when laws were passed, why they were passed, and what they actually do, we will only make it easier for progressives to win.</p><p>If you want to read more about Sen.

This wave of techno-progressivism finds its latest expression in Slate journalist April Glaser's article[1], 'Bring Back the Golden Age of Broadcast Regulation.' Glaser argues that the problems of internet discourse\u2014eg hate speech, haphazard content moderation, and conspiracy peddling\u2014are so trenchant that government intervention is warranted. She calls for applying the rules that once governed mid-twentieth century radio and television broadcasting to the internet, the most important of which was the mandate that broadcasting be done in the 'public interest, convenience, and necessity' as laid out in the 1934 Communications Act. </p><p>Inspired by that mandate, reform-minded progressives at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enacted the Fairness Doctrine in 1949, which required broadcasters to provide multiple points of view when discussing political disagreements. Glaser's proposal is light on details about how exactly broadcast rules would be adapted for the internet, but it is heavy on assurances that any such regulations would be 'light-touch.' Those who worry that inviting the feds to just 'do something' could lead to violations of free speech need not be concerned. As Glaser argues, 'For decades, radio and television followed regulations\u2014hardly heavy-handed ones\u2014meant to ensure they served the information needs of their audiences and did not actively harm political discourse.' That would be lovely, if it were true, but not a single part of that statement is correct. The belief that government regulation of internet content providers will be effective and minimally-invasive is rooted in a poor understanding of the history of broadcast regulation. That history actually suggests the opposite, that these regulations will be ineffective, highly-intrusive, and will create significant unintended consequences. In part, that is because the very idea of a singular 'public interest' has always been a convenient fiction, albeit one that wears poorly in a pluralistic society. For example, under the banner of advancing the public interest, the FCC once required radio stations to give away free airtime to religious groups (most of which went to mainline Protestants, Roman Catholics, and the larger Jewish denominations) since it seemed obvious to the commissioners that there was a singular public interest in promoting a vague baseline religiosity. Agnostics, atheists, and members of smaller religious groups need not apply. In practice, the public interest standard became a tool for advancing the private interests of a narrow, politically well-connected elite by appealing to majoritarian values and at the expense of minority interests. In one of her early newsletters, Ayn Rand excoriated the public interest standard as an excuse covering 'the right of some men (those who, by some undefined criterion, are the public) to sacrifice the interests of other men (of those who, for unspecified reasons are not the public).' ('Check Your Premises: Have Gun, Will Nudge,' The Objectivist Newsletter, vol 1, no 3, March 1962.) Rand's words were meant particularly for FCC Chairman Newton Minow, who, in what may be the only famous speech by an FCC commissioner, had described television as a 'vast wasteland' and called for limits on the number of game shows, Westerns, and cartoons aired. Sorry, kids, Chairman Minow thinks a 'steady diet for the whole country' of the Flintstones or Bonanza is 'obviously not in the public interest,' so no Saturday morning cartoon marathon for you! Minow might not have been wrong about the merits of Hannah Barbera cartoons, but the idea that he and a handful of telecommunications lawyers sitting on the FCC should have a say in deciding that question 'for the whole country' was fundamentally undemocratic. But what was most dangerous about the public interest standard was not the aesthetic preferences of a FCC commissioner or even the religious airtime requirement. The more serious danger was the routine weaponization of the public interest standard to advance private or partisan interests. For example, during the early 1940s, the Roosevelt administration pushed for a ban on newspaper ownership of radio stations, ostensibly because of the public's interest in preventing cross-media consolidation, but also to prevent anti-New Deal newspaper owners from having a radio platform from which to criticize the President's policies. The FCC during Richard Nixon's administration would use a similar rule to try and pressure the Washington Post into abandoning its investigation of the Watergate scandal. But the ultimate example of the disconnect between the well-meaning intent of the public interest standard and its abuse for partisan advantage was the John F. Kennedy administration's use of the Fairness Doctrine to silence conservative political dissent on the airwaves in the 1960s. Conservative radio broadcasting surged in the early 1960s as a result of the rise of non-network, independent radio stations that were cash-strapped and willing to air people whose politics were too radical for network radio. Conservative broadcasters\u2014the most prominent of which had as many weekly listeners as Rush Limbaugh would a generation later\u2014constantly attacked the Kennedy administration's policies, like his failure to provide air support at the Bay of Pigs, opening trade with Eastern Bloc nations, and ratifying the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The administration's plan for dealing with these conservative irritants involved, among other measures, using the regulatory power granted to the executive branch to intimidate their donors and hosts. First, a special campaign of targeted Internal Revenue Service audits challenging their tax-exempt status stemmed the flow of donations to the offending broadcasters. Then, the selective application of the Federal Communication Commission's Fairness Doctrine pressured station owners into dropping conservative programming altogether. All of this was coordinated from the Oval Office and the Attorney General's office, part of it even caught on tape. Subsequently, in July 1963, FCC Chairman E. William Henry announced a 'clarification' of the Fairness Doctrine that mentioned only conservative positions and rhetoric when clarifying which kinds of speech would be targeted. The White House promptly organized a front organization, the Citizens Committee for a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, that could lodge Fairness Doctrine-based requests for response time whenever a conservative broadcaster criticized the proposed treaty. The FCC also passed an enhancement of the Fairness Doctrine rules called the Cullman Doctrine, which required stations to not only offer response time slots contingent on the responding group paying for the airtime, but to give that airtime for free if interest groups said they could not afford to pay. (Unsurprisingly, no one ever said they could afford to pay.) With the help of the Fairness Doctrine, the administration blunted criticism of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which passed the Senate that fall. Kennedy was assassinated not long after, but the partisan use of the Fairness Doctrine continued apace. During the presidential campaign of 1964, the Democratic National Committee commissioned a team of operatives\u2014including a former FCC lawyer who had been in charge of Fairness Doctrine enforcement\u2014to garner free pro-Lyndon Johnson airtime any time a station aired broadcasters who spoke of their support for Barry Goldwater. As the lead operative later reported, the Fairness Doctrine campaign had secured more than 1,700 free broadcasts boosting Johnson and been highly effective at 'inhibiting the political activity of these Right Wing broadcasts.' From 1949 to 1963, the Fairness Doctrine had existed only on paper. It is notable that the first two actual applications of the Fairness Doctrine each expressly advanced partisan interests. Later in the decade, other liberal interest groups would also use the Fairness Doctrine to force stations to offer balanced programming or even, in the case of segregationist television station WLBT in Jackson, Mississippi, to convince the FCC to revoke their broadcasting license. But the Fairness Doctrine was never used to balance liberal programming with conservative voices. It had become entirely a tool for advancing liberal speech and political candidates at the expense of conservative speech and candidates. Later, President Richard Nixon considered using Fairness Doctrine complaints to force the major television networks to give his administration's policies more favorable coverage by, for example, being less critical of the slow pace of withdrawal from the Vietnam War. In the end, however, Nixon used other means to get what he wanted, but the fact that he had those tools at his disposal gave him leverage in back-room negotiations with network executives. The realization that the tools used to suppress conservative speech by the Kennedy administration and the DNC in the early 1960s could be used by the Nixon administration to suppress liberal speech in the early 1970s led several operatives from the earlier censorship campaign to rue their involvement. This is a crucial test for any proposed government regulation. Do not imagine only the utility that your side or your interests might gain from its application; think also about the damage that could be done by the other side through that rule when they inevitably take their turn in power. If that prospect scares you, then reconsider the regulation. To apply that test to today, imagine if the Trump administration had the same regulatory powers over the internet at its disposal as Kennedy had over broadcasting. What would a Trump-appointed FCC Chairman, told to keep internet discourse fair and balanced, currently be doing? Imagine that Chairman, after a Trump tweetstorm complaining about the Washington Post's unfair coverage, launching an investigation into the ratio of conservative to liberal reporting on the Post's website. Or consider the kind of pressure that pro-Trump conservative activists could place on Facebook or Twitter with the implicit threat of a federal investigation into algorithmic bias against conservative accounts. It is naive to think, as Glaser writes, that regulation of the internet 'wouldn't mean that the feds would decide what is and is not acceptable speech on the platforms.' That statement directly contradicts the following sentence, that it 'could mean rules against broadcasting hateful views or disinformation to large audiences.' You can either have the government play censor and ban hate speech or not; you can't have both. If intent were all that mattered, Glaser's call for banning hate speech and disinformation would at least sound plausible. The government says no hate speech, the platforms comply, badda bing, badda boom, problem solved! Yet again, realize that regulations are only as good as the regulators responsible for enforcing them. How might an investigation into the 'fake news' problem during the 2016 election look different depending on whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump was sitting in the White House today? If there is one key lesson from the history of the Fairness Doctrine to bear in mind, it is that good intentions paved the road to regulatory hell. It is entirely possible that rules meant to promote good information and discourage hate speech could be twisted to promote disinformation and protect hate speech. There is also a cautionary tale from the history of broadcast regulation about the chilling effect that content regulation has on radical political speech. During the height of the anti-Radio Right censorship campaign in the 1960s, many radio station owners confronted with Fairness Doctrine complaints didn't respond by adding liberal points of view; instead, they dropped the conservative programs altogether and simply avoided any content that touched on hot button issues. And if they did still air programs touching on 'controversial issues of public importance,' as the Fairness Doctrine ostensibly encouraged, they frequently framed any disagreement over that issue as a binary option between mainstream, respectable points of view. Radicals from both Left and Right were drastically underrepresented. A great deal of political speech that is broadcast today could not have existed under that regulatory framework. You could not have the Daily Show or the Late Show if every time Trevor Noah or Stephen Colbert criticized the President the network had to give the administration free response time. Single point-of-view editorial shows\u2014from Rachel Maddow to Tucker Carlson\u2014would be less common given the resulting obligation to provide contrasting opinions. That this kind of programming exists at all is a product of the decision in the late 1970s to exempt satellite and cable broadcasting from the kind of close regulatory scrutiny applied to network broadcasts. Otherwise, cable television would look more like network television, with a tendency to appeal to the lowest common public denominator rather than to diverse constituencies. Given the outcomes from the history of broadcast regulation, if similar rules were applied to the internet there is every reason to expect a similar chilling effect on the major platforms. The final problem that I will mention with regulating the internet like broadcasting is that the basic legal arguments for broadcasting regulation do not apply to the internet. Even back in the 1930s, the courts recognized that the public interest standard represented an infringement on perfectly free speech. First, the government decided which applicants received station licenses, choosing who got the opportunity to transmit their speech in the first place. Second, they made license renewal contingent on whether their speech was acceptable or not. These rules privileged the speech of certain groups at the expense of others. For example, early socialist-run radio stations were labeled[2] as propaganda not in the public interest and ultimately pressured into selling their stations to the major, milquetoast networks. The public interest standard was used to undermine both the Popular Front movement and anti-New Deal conservatives during the 1930s. Then in the 1960s, it would hinder the rise of both the New Left and the New Right. These infringements on the First Amendment were justified ex post facto on the basis of the scarcity principle, the idea that since broadcast spectrum was naturally finite, the government was forced to ration it out in an orderly manner to prevent signal overlap and to promote a diversity of opinion. That principle rested on several assumptions questionable even in the early twentieth century, but it was at least a plausible-sounding argument. However, the scarcity principle could not apply less to the internet. There are no natural limits on the amount of internet speech that is possible, no digital spectrum that must be divvied up and managed by government regulators lest it all run out. And so there is no reason to treat internet media as fundamentally different than any other category of media. The best corollary to the internet is not radio or television but print media. Glaser's justification for why social media ought to be regulated by the government is that 'like radio or television, social media plays a central role in providing people with the information they need to participate meaningfully in political life.' But that standard is equally true of newspapers. Think of the importance of whichever your preferred paper of record to your civic knowledge and participation. Glaser also argues that the internet is different because of the prevalence of conspiratorial and hateful nutters. But there too, you can find plenty of corollaries from the history of the newspaper industry. You cannot, for example, tell the story of the Spanish-American War without speaking of 'yellow journalism.' Across the grand scope of American history, newspapers have been as prone to conspiracy theorizing and disinformation as internet-based media is today. Yet despite the manifest failings of newspapers, we generally recognize the necessity of protecting press freedom. I cannot imagine that even Glaser would welcome applying old broadcast regulations to newspapers, whether print or digital. I certainly would look amiss at calls for the government to require Slate or any other magazine to publish a certain quota of religious or Right-of-center content in the service of promoting fairness and balance. That is because when James Madison wrote the Bill of Rights codifying the freedom of the press, he was not using the term in the sense we do today to refer to journalism. 'Press' quite literally meant the printing press. In contrast to much of Europe, where protections for speech did not always extend to the printing press, in America anybody with a press could print whatever they wished, regardless of how the British crown or established clergy or the general public felt about what they said. Among the ideals that American was founded upon was the immodest proposition that the best response to bad speech is more speech, not censorship. It is a fundamentally democratic proposition, one that is as appropriate for the digital age as it was for the 1780s.

This wave of techno-progressivism finds its latest expression in Slate journalist April Glaser's article, \"Bring Back the Golden Age of Broadcast Regulation.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Glaser argues that the problems of internet discourseeg hate speech, haphazard content moderation, and conspiracy peddlingare so trenchant that government intervention is warranted. She calls for applying the rules that once governed mid-twentieth century radio and television broadcasting to the internet, the most important of which was the mandate that broadcasting be done in the \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" as laid out in the 1934 Communications Act. Inspired by that mandate, reform-minded progressives at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enacted the Fairness Doctrine in 1949, which required broadcasters to provide multiple points of view when discussing political disagreements.</p><p>Glaser's proposal is light on details about how exactly broadcast rules would be adapted for the internet, but it is heavy on assurances that any such regulations would be \"light-touch.\" Those who worry that inviting the feds to just \"do something\" could lead to violations of free speech need not be concerned. As Glaser argues, \"For decades, radio and television followed regulationshardly heavy-handed onesmeant to ensure they served the information needs of their audiences and did not actively harm political discourse.\"</p><p>That would be lovely, if it were true, but not a single part of that statement is correct. The belief that government regulation of internet content providers will be effective and minimally-invasive is rooted in a poor understanding of the history of broadcast regulation. That history actually suggests the opposite, that these regulations will be ineffective, highly-intrusive, and will create significant unintended consequences.</p><p>In part, that is because the very idea of a singular \"public interest\" has always been a convenient fiction, albeit one that wears poorly in a pluralistic society. For example, under the banner of advancing the public interest, the FCC once required radio stations to give away free airtime to religious groups (most of which went to mainline Protestants, Roman Catholics, and the larger Jewish denominations) since it seemed obvious to the commissioners that there was a singular public interest in promoting a vague baseline religiosity. Agnostics, atheists, and members of smaller religious groups need not apply.</p><p>In practice, the public interest standard became a tool for advancing the private interests of a narrow, politically well-connected elite by appealing to majoritarian values and at the expense of minority interests. In one of her early newsletters, Ayn Rand excoriated the public interest standard as an excuse covering \"the right of some men (those who, by some undefined criterion, are the public) to sacrifice the interests of other men (of those who, for unspecified reasons are not the public).\" (\"Check Your Premises: Have Gun, Will Nudge,\" The Objectivist Newsletter, vol 1, no 3, March 1962.)</p><p>Rand's words were meant particularly for FCC Chairman Newton Minow, who, in what may be the only famous speech by an FCC commissioner, had described television as a \"vast wasteland\" and called for limits on the number of game shows, Westerns, and cartoons aired. Sorry, kids, Chairman Minow thinks a \"steady diet for the whole country\" of the Flintstones or Bonanza is \"obviously not in the public interest,\" so no Saturday morning cartoon marathon for you! Minow might not have been wrong about the merits of Hannah Barbera cartoons, but the idea that he and a handful of telecommunications lawyers sitting on the FCC should have a say in deciding that question \"for the whole country\" was fundamentally undemocratic.</p><p>But what was most dangerous about the public interest standard was not the aesthetic preferences of a FCC commissioner or even the religious airtime requirement. The more serious danger was the routine weaponization of the public interest standard to advance private or partisan interests. For example, during the early 1940s, the Roosevelt administration pushed for a ban on newspaper ownership of radio stations, ostensibly because of the public's interest in preventing cross-media consolidation, but also to prevent anti-New Deal newspaper owners from having a radio platform from which to criticize the President's policies. The FCC during Richard Nixon's administration would use a similar rule to try and pressure the Washington Post into abandoning its investigation of the Watergate scandal.</p><p>But the ultimate example of the disconnect between the well-meaning intent of the public interest standard and its abuse for partisan advantage was the John F. Kennedy administration's use of the Fairness Doctrine to silence conservative political dissent on the airwaves in the 1960s. Conservative radio broadcasting surged in the early 1960s as a result of the rise of non-network, independent radio stations that were cash-strapped and willing to air people whose politics were too radical for network radio. Conservative broadcastersthe most prominent of which had as many weekly listeners as Rush Limbaugh would a generation laterconstantly attacked the Kennedy administration's policies, like his failure to provide air support at the Bay of Pigs, opening trade with Eastern Bloc nations, and ratifying the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</p><p>The administration's plan for dealing with these conservative irritants involved, among other measures, using the regulatory power granted to the executive branch to intimidate their donors and hosts. First, a special campaign of targeted Internal Revenue Service audits challenging their tax-exempt status stemmed the flow of donations to the offending broadcasters. Then, the selective application of the Federal Communication Commission's Fairness Doctrine pressured station owners into dropping conservative programming altogether. All of this was coordinated from the Oval Office and the Attorney General's office, part of it even caught on tape.</p><p>Subsequently, in July 1963, FCC Chairman E. William Henry announced a \"clarification\" of the Fairness Doctrine that mentioned only conservative positions and rhetoric when clarifying which kinds of speech would be targeted. The White House promptly organized a front organization, the Citizens Committee for a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, that could lodge Fairness Doctrine-based requests for response time whenever a conservative broadcaster criticized the proposed treaty. The FCC also passed an enhancement of the Fairness Doctrine rules called the Cullman Doctrine, which required stations to not only offer response time slots contingent on the responding group paying for the airtime, but to give that airtime for free if interest groups said they could not afford to pay. (Unsurprisingly, no one ever said they could afford to pay.)</p><p>With the help of the Fairness Doctrine, the administration blunted criticism of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which passed the Senate that fall. Kennedy was assassinated not long after, but the partisan use of the Fairness Doctrine continued apace. During the presidential campaign of 1964, the Democratic National Committee commissioned a team of operativesincluding a former FCC lawyer who had been in charge of Fairness Doctrine enforcementto garner free pro-Lyndon Johnson airtime any time a station aired broadcasters who spoke of their support for Barry Goldwater. As the lead operative later reported, the Fairness Doctrine campaign had secured more than 1,700 free broadcasts boosting Johnson and been highly effective at \"inhibiting the political activity of these Right Wing broadcasts.\"</p><p>From 1949 to 1963, the Fairness Doctrine had existed only on paper. It is notable that the first two actual applications of the Fairness Doctrine each expressly advanced partisan interests. Later in the decade, other liberal interest groups would also use the Fairness Doctrine to force stations to offer balanced programming or even, in the case of segregationist television station WLBT in Jackson, Mississippi, to convince the FCC to revoke their broadcasting license. But the Fairness Doctrine was never used to balance liberal programming with conservative voices. It had become entirely a tool for advancing liberal speech and political candidates at the expense of conservative speech and candidates.</p><p>Later, President Richard Nixon considered using Fairness Doctrine complaints to force the major television networks to give his administration's policies more favorable coverage by, for example, being less critical of the slow pace of withdrawal from the Vietnam War. In the end, however, Nixon used other means to get what he wanted, but the fact that he had those tools at his disposal gave him leverage in back-room negotiations with network executives.</p><p>The realization that the tools used to suppress conservative speech by the Kennedy administration and the DNC in the early 1960s could be used by the Nixon administration to suppress liberal speech in the early 1970s led several operatives from the earlier censorship campaign to rue their involvement. This is a crucial test for any proposed government regulation. Do not imagine only the utility that your side or your interests might gain from its application; think also about the damage that could be done by the other side through that rule when they inevitably take their turn in power. If that prospect scares you, then reconsider the regulation.</p><p>To apply that test to today, imagine if the Trump administration had the same regulatory powers over the internet at its disposal as Kennedy had over broadcasting. What would a Trump-appointed FCC Chairman, told to keep internet discourse fair and balanced, currently be doing? Imagine that Chairman, after a Trump tweetstorm complaining about the Washington Post's unfair coverage, launching an investigation into the ratio of conservative to liberal reporting on the Post's website. Or consider the kind of pressure that pro-Trump conservative activists could place on Facebook or Twitter with the implicit threat of a federal investigation into algorithmic bias against conservative accounts.</p><p>It is naive to think, as Glaser writes, that regulation of the internet \"wouldn't mean that the feds would decide what is and is not acceptable speech on the platforms.\" That statement directly contradicts the following sentence, that it \"could mean rules against broadcasting hateful views or disinformation to large audiences.\" You can either have the government play censor and ban hate speech or not; you can't have both.</p><p>If intent were all that mattered, Glaser's call for banning hate speech and disinformation would at least sound plausible. The government says no hate speech, the platforms comply, badda bing, badda boom, problem solved! Yet again, realize that regulations are only as good as the regulators responsible for enforcing them. How might an investigation into the \"fake news\" problem during the 2016 election look different depending on whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump was sitting in the White House today? If there is one key lesson from the history of the Fairness Doctrine to bear in mind, it is that good intentions paved the road to regulatory hell. It is entirely possible that rules meant to promote good information and discourage hate speech could be twisted to promote disinformation and protect hate speech.</p><p>There is also a cautionary tale from the history of broadcast regulation about the chilling effect that content regulation has on radical political speech. During the height of the anti-Radio Right censorship campaign in the 1960s, many radio station owners confronted with Fairness Doctrine complaints didn't respond by adding liberal points of view; instead, they dropped the conservative programs altogether and simply avoided any content that touched on hot button issues. And if they did still air programs touching on \"controversial issues of public importance,\" as the Fairness Doctrine ostensibly encouraged, they frequently framed any disagreement over that issue as a binary option between mainstream, respectable points of view. Radicals from both Left and Right were drastically underrepresented.</p><p>A great deal of political speech that is broadcast today could not have existed under that regulatory framework. You could not have the Daily Show or the Late Show if every time Trevor Noah or Stephen Colbert criticized the President the network had to give the administration free response time. Single point-of-view editorial showsfrom Rachel Maddow to Tucker Carlsonwould be less common given the resulting obligation to provide contrasting opinions.</p><p>That this kind of programming exists at all is a product of the decision in the late 1970s to exempt satellite and cable broadcasting from the kind of close regulatory scrutiny applied to network broadcasts. Otherwise, cable television would look more like network television, with a tendency to appeal to the lowest common public denominator rather than to diverse constituencies. Given the outcomes from the history of broadcast regulation, if similar rules were applied to the internet there is every reason to expect a similar chilling effect on the major platforms.</p><p>The final problem that I will mention with regulating the internet like broadcasting is that the basic legal arguments for broadcasting regulation do not apply to the internet. Even back in the 1930s, the courts recognized that the public interest standard represented an infringement on perfectly free speech. First, the government decided which applicants received station licenses, choosing who got the opportunity to transmit their speech in the first place. Second, they made license renewal contingent on whether their speech was acceptable or not. These rules privileged the speech of certain groups at the expense of others.</p><p>For example, early socialist-run radio stations were labeled as propaganda not in the public interest and ultimately pressured into selling their stations to the major, milquetoast networks. The public interest standard was used to undermine both the Popular Front movement and anti-New Deal conservatives during the 1930s. Then in the 1960s, it would hinder the rise of both the New Left and the New Right.</p><p>These infringements on the First Amendment were justified ex post facto on the basis of the scarcity principle, the idea that since broadcast spectrum was naturally finite, the government was forced to ration it out in an orderly manner to prevent signal overlap and to promote a diversity of opinion. That principle rested on several assumptions questionable even in the early twentieth century, but it was at least a plausible-sounding argument.</p><p>However, the scarcity principle could not apply less to the internet. There are no natural limits on the amount of internet speech that is possible, no digital spectrum that must be divvied up and managed by government regulators lest it all run out. And so there is no reason to treat internet media as fundamentally different than any other category of media. The best corollary to the internet is not radio or television but print media.</p><p>Glaser's justification for why social media ought to be regulated by the government is that \"like radio or television, social media plays a central role in providing people with the information they need to participate meaningfully in political life.\" But that standard is equally true of newspapers. Think of the importance of whichever your preferred paper of record to your civic knowledge and participation.</p><p>Glaser also argues that the internet is different because of the prevalence of conspiratorial and hateful nutters. But there too, you can find plenty of corollaries from the history of the newspaper industry. You cannot, for example, tell the story of the Spanish-American War without speaking of \"yellow journalism.\" Across the grand scope of American history, newspapers have been as prone to conspiracy theorizing and disinformation as internet-based media is today.</p><p>Yet despite the manifest failings of newspapers, we generally recognize the necessity of protecting press freedom. I cannot imagine that even Glaser would welcome applying old broadcast regulations to newspapers, whether print or digital. I certainly would look amiss at calls for the government to require Slate or any other magazine to publish a certain quota of religious or Right-of-center content in the service of promoting fairness and balance.</p><p>That is because when James Madison wrote the Bill of Rights codifying the freedom of the press, he was not using the term in the sense we do today to refer to journalism. 'Press' quite literally meant the printing press. In contrast to much of Europe, where protections for speech did not always extend to the printing press, in America anybody with a press could print whatever they wished, regardless of how the British crown or established clergy or the general public felt about what they said. Among the ideals that American was founded upon was the immodest proposition that the best response to bad speech is more speech, not censorship. It is a fundamentally democratic proposition, one that is as appropriate for the digital age as it was for the 1780s.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122995594</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB2-13H1-JCBF-S466-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Aliens had landed just down the road, a newscaster announced, and were rampaging through the countryside. Dock grabbed his double-barrelled shotgun and went out into the night, prepared to face down the invaders. But, after investigating, as a newspaper later reported, he \"didn't see anybody he thought needed shooting.\" In fact, he'd been duped by Orson Welles's radio adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds.\" Structured as a breaking-news report that detailed the invasion in real time, the broadcast adhered faithfully to the conventions of news radio, complete with elaborate sound effects and impersonations of government officials, with only a few brief warnings through the program that it was fiction.</p><p>The next day, newspapers were full of stories like Dock's. \"Thirty men and women rushed into the West 123rd Street police station,\" ready to evacuate, according to the Times. Two people suffered heart attacks from shock, the Washington Post reported. One caller from Pittsburgh claimed that he had barely prevented his wife from taking her own life by swallowing poison. The panic was the biggest story for weeks; a photograph of Bill Dock and his shotgun, taken the next day, by a Daily News reporter, went \"the 1930s equivalent of viral,\" A. Brad Schwartz writes in his recent history, \"Broadcast Hysteria: Orson Welles's War of the Worlds and the Art of Fake News.\"</p><p>This early fake-news panic lives on in legend, but Schwartz is the latest of a number of researchers to argue that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. As Schwartz tells it, there was no mass hysteria, only small pockets of concern that quickly burned out. He casts doubt on whether Dock had even heard the broadcast. Schwartz argues that newspapers exaggerated the panic to better control the upstart medium of radio, which was becoming the dominant source of breaking news in the thirties. Newspapers wanted to show that radio was irresponsible and needed guidance from its older, more respectable siblings in the print media, such \"guidance\" mostly taking the form of lucrative licensing deals and increased ownership of local radio stations. Columnists and editorialists weighed in. Soon, the Columbia education professor and broadcaster Lyman Bryson declared that unrestrained radio was \"one of the most dangerous elements in modern culture.\"</p><p>The argument turned on the role of the Federal Communications Commission, the regulators charged with insuring that the radio system served the \"public interest, convenience and necessity.\" Unlike today's F.C.C., which is known mainly as a referee for media mergers, the F.C.C. of the thirties was deeply concerned with the particulars of what broadcasters put in listeners' ears-it had recently issued a reprimand after a racy Mae West sketch that so alarmed NBC it banned West from its stations. To some, the lesson of the panic was that the F.C.C. needed to take an even more active role to protect people from malicious tricksters like Welles. \"Programs of that kind are an excellent indication of the inadequacy of our present control over a marvellous facility,\" the Iowa senator Clyde Herring, a Democrat, declared. He announced a bill that would require broadcasters to submit shows to the F.C.C. for review before airing. Yet Schwartz says that the people calling for a government crackdown were far outnumbered by those who warned against one. \"Far from blaming Mr. Orson Welles, he ought to be given a Congressional medal and a national prize,\" the renowned columnist Dorothy Thompson wrote.</p><p>Thompson was concerned with a threat far greater than rogue thespians. Everywhere you looked in the thirties, authoritarian leaders were being swept to power with the help of radio. The Nazi Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda deployed a force called the Funkwarte, or Radio Guard, that went block by block to insure that citizens tuned in to Hitler's major broadcast speeches, as Tim Wu details in his new book, \"The Attention Merchants.\" Meanwhile, homegrown radio demagogues like Father Charles Coughlin and the charismatic Huey Long made some people wonder about a radio-aided Fascist takeover in America. For Thompson, Welles had made an \"admirable demonstration\" about the power of radio. It showed the danger of handing control of the airwaves over to the state. \"No political body must ever, under any circumstances, obtain a monopoly of radio,\" she wrote. \"The greatest organizers of mass hysterias and the mass delusions today are states using the radio to excite terrors, incite hatreds, inflame masses.\"</p><p>Donald Trump's victory has been a demonstration, for many people, of how the Internet can be used to achieve those very ends. Trump used Twitter less as a communication device than as a weapon of information warfare, rallying his supporters and attacking opponents with hundred-and-forty-character barrages. \"I wouldn't be here without Twitter,\" he declared on Fox News in March. Yet the Internet didn't just give him a megaphone. It also helped him peddle his lies through a profusion of unreliable media sources that undermined the old providers of established fact. Throughout the campaign, fake-news stories, conspiracy theories, and other forms of propaganda were reported to be flooding social networks. The stories were overwhelmingly pro-Trump, and the spread of whoppers like \"Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President\"-hardly more believable than a Martian invasion-seemed to suggest that huge numbers of Trump supporters were being duped by online lies. This was not the first campaign to be marred by misinformation, of course. But the sheer outlandishness of the claims being made, and believed, suggested to many that the Internet had brought about a fundamental devaluing of the truth. Many pundits argued that the \"hyper-democratizing\" force of the Internet had helped usher in a \"post-truth\" world, where people based their opinions not on facts or reason but on passion and prejudice.</p><p>Yet, even among this information anarchy, there remains an authority of sorts. Facebook and Google now define the experience of the Internet for most people, and in many ways they play the role of regulators. In the weeks after the election, they faced enormous criticism for their failure to halt the spread of fake news and misinformation on their services. The problem was not simply that people had been able to spread lies but that the digital platforms were set up in ways that made them especially potent. The \"share\" button sends lies flying around the Web faster than fact checkers can debunk them. The supposedly neutral platforms use personalized algorithms to feed us information based on precise data models of our preferences, trapping us in \"filter bubbles\" that cripple critical thinking and increase polarization. The threat of fake news was compounded by this sense that the role of the press had been ceded to an arcane algorithmic system created by private companies that care only about the bottom line.</p><p>Not so very long ago, it was thought that the tension between commercial pressure and the public interest would be one of the many things made obsolete by the Internet. In the mid-aughts, during the height of the Web 2.0 boom, the pundit Henry Jenkins declared that the Internet was creating a \"participatory culture\" where the top-down hegemony of greedy media corporations would be replaced by a horizontal network of amateur \"prosumers\" engaged in a wonderfully democratic exchange of information in cyberspace-an epistemic agora that would allow the whole globe to come together on a level playing field. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the rest attained their paradoxical gatekeeper status by positioning themselves as neutral platforms that unlocked the Internet's democratic potential by empowering users. It was on a private platform, Twitter, where pro-democracy protesters organized, and on another private platform, Google, where the knowledge of a million public libraries could be accessed for free. These companies would develop into what the tech guru Jeff Jarvis termed \"radically public companies,\" which operate more like public utilities than like businesses.</p><p>But there has been a growing sense among mostly liberal-minded observers that the platforms' championing of openness is at odds with the public interest. The image of Arab Spring activists using Twitter to challenge repressive dictators has been replaced, in the public imagination, by that of ISIS propagandists luring vulnerable Western teen-agers to Syria via YouTube videos and Facebook chats. The openness that was said to bring about a democratic revolution instead seems to have torn a hole in the social fabric. Today, online misinformation, hate speech, and propaganda are seen as the front line of a reactionary populist upsurge threatening liberal democracy. Once held back by democratic institutions, the bad stuff is now sluicing through a digital breach with the help of irresponsible tech companies. Stanching the torrent of fake news has become a trial by which the digital giants can prove their commitment to democracy. The effort has reignited a debate over the role of mass communication that goes back to the early days of radio.</p><p>The debate around radio at the time of \"The War of the Worlds\" was informed by a similar fall from utopian hopes to dystopian fears. Although radio can seem like an unremarkable medium-audio wallpaper pasted over the most boring parts of your day-the historian David Goodman's book \"Radio's Civic Ambition: American Broadcasting and Democracy in the 1930s\" makes it clear that the birth of the technology brought about a communications revolution comparable to that of the Internet. For the first time, radio allowed a mass audience to experience the same thing simultaneously from the comfort of their homes. Early radio pioneers imagined that this unprecedented blurring of public and private space might become a sort of ethereal forum that would uplift the nation, from the urban slum dweller to the remote Montana rancher. John Dewey called radio \"the most powerful instrument of social education the world has ever seen.\" Populist reformers demanded that radio be treated as a common carrier and give airtime to anyone who paid a fee. Were this to have come about, it would have been very much like the early online-bulletin-board systems where strangers could come together and leave a message for any passing online wanderer. Instead, in the regulatory struggles of the twenties and thirties, the commercial networks won out.</p><p>Corporate networks were supported by advertising, and what many progressives had envisaged as the ideal democratic forum began to seem more like Times Square, cluttered with ads for soap and coffee. Rather than elevating public opinion, advertisers pioneered techniques of manipulating it. Who else might be able to exploit such techniques? Many saw a link between the domestic on-air advertising boom and the rise of Fascist dictators like Hitler abroad. Tim Wu cites the leftist critic Max Lerner, who lamented that \"the most damning blow the dictatorships have struck at democracy has been the compliment they have paid us in taking over and perfecting our prized techniques of persuasion and our underlying contempt for the credulity of the masses.\"</p><p>Amid such concerns, broadcasters were under intense pressure to show that they were not turning listeners into a zombified mass ripe for the Fascist picking. What they developed in response is, in Goodman's phrase, a \"civic paradigm\": radio would create active, rational, tolerant listeners-in other words, the ideal citizens of a democratic society. Classical-music-appreciation shows were developed with an eye toward uplift. Inspired by progressive educators, radio networks hosted \"forum\" programs, in which citizens from all walks of life were invited to discuss the matters of the day, with the aim of inspiring tolerance and political engagement. One such program, \"America's Town Meeting of the Air,\" featured in its first episode a Communist, a Fascist, a Socialist, and a democrat.</p><p>Listening to the radio, then, would be a \"civic practice\" that could create a more democratic society by exposing people to diversity. But only if they listened correctly. There was great concern about distracted and gullible listeners being susceptible to propagandists. A group of progressive journalists and thinkers known as \"propaganda critics\" set about educating radio listeners. The Institute for Propaganda Analysis, co-founded by the social psychologist Clyde R. Miller, with funding from the department-store magnate Edward Filene, was at the forefront of the movement. In newsletters, books, and lectures, the institute's members urged listeners to attend to their own biases while analyzing broadcast voices for signs of manipulation. Listening to the radio critically became the duty of every responsible citizen. Goodman, who is generally sympathetic to the proponents of the civic paradigm, is alert to the off notes here of snobbery and disdain: much of the progressive concern about listeners' abilities stemmed from the belief that Americans were, basically, dim-witted-an idea that gained currency after intelligence tests on soldiers during the First World War supposedly revealed discouraging news about the capacities of the average American. In the wake of \"The War of the Worlds\" panic, commentators didn't hesitate to rail against \"idiotic\" and \"stupid\" listeners. Welles and his crew, Dorothy Thompson declared, \"have shown up the incredible stupidity, lack of nerve and ignorance of thousands.\"</p><p>Today, when we speak about people's relationship to the Internet, we tend to adopt the nonjudgmental language of computer science. Fake news was described as a \"virus\" spreading among users who have been \"exposed\" to online misinformation. The proposed solutions to the fake-news problem typically resemble antivirus programs: their aim is to identify and quarantine all the dangerous nonfacts throughout the Web before they can infect their prospective hosts. One venture capitalist, writing on the tech blog Venture Beat, imagined deploying artificial intelligence as a \"media cop,\" protecting users from malicious content. \"Imagine a world where every article could be assessed based on its level of sound discourse,\" he wrote. The vision here was of the news consumers of the future turning the discourse setting on their browser up to eleven and soaking in pure fact. It's possible, though, that this approach comes with its own form of myopia. Neil Postman, writing a couple of decades ago, warned of a growing tendency to view people as computers, and a corresponding devaluation of the \"singular human capacity to see things whole in all their psychic, emotional and moral dimensions.\" A person does not process information the way a computer does, flipping a switch of \"true\" or \"false.\" One rarely cited Pew statistic shows that only four per cent of American Internet users trust social media \"a lot,\" which suggests a greater resilience against online misinformation than overheated editorials might lead us to expect. Most people seem to understand that their social-media streams represent a heady mixture of gossip, political activism, news, and entertainment. You might see this as a problem, but turning to Big Data-driven algorithms to fix it will only further entrench our reliance on code to tell us what is important about the world-which is what led to the problem in the first place. Plus, it doesn't sound very fun.</p><p>The various efforts to fact-check and label and blacklist and sort all the world's information bring to mind a quote, which appears in David Goodman's book, from John Grierson, a documentary filmmaker: \"Men don't live by bread alone, nor by fact alone.\" In the nineteen-forties, Grierson was on an F.C.C. panel that had been convened to determine how best to encourage a democratic radio, and he was frustrated by a draft report that reflected his fellow-panelists' obsession with filling the airwaves with rationality and fact. Grierson said, \"Much of this entertainment is the folk stuff\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. of our technological time; the patterns of observation, of humor, of fancy, which make a technological society a human society.\"</p><p>In recent times, Donald Trump supporters are the ones who have most effectively applied Grierson's insight to the digital age. Young Trump enthusiasts turned Internet trolling into a potent political tool, deploying the \"folk stuff\" of the Web-memes, slang, the nihilistic humor of a certain subculture of Web-native gamer-to give a subversive, cyberpunk sheen to a movement that might otherwise look like a stale reactionary blend of white nationalism and anti-feminism. As crusaders against fake news push technology companies to \"defend the truth,\" they face a backlash from a conservative movement, retooled for the digital age, which sees claims for objectivity as a smoke screen for bias.</p><p>One sign of this development came last summer, in the scandal over Facebook's \"Trending\" sidebar, in which curators chose stories to feature on the user's home page. When the tech Web site Gizmodo reported the claim of an anonymous employee that the curators were systematically suppressing conservative news stories, the right-wing blogosphere exploded. Breitbart, the far-right torchbearer, uncovered the social-media accounts of some of the employees-liberal recent college graduates-that seemed to confirm the suspicion of pervasive anti-right bias. Eventually, Facebook fired the team and retooled the feature, calling in high-profile conservatives for a meeting with Mark Zuckerberg. Although Facebook denied that there was any systematic suppression of conservative views, the outcry was enough to reverse a tiny first step it had taken toward introducing human judgment into the algorithmic machine.</p><p>For conservatives, the rise of online gatekeepers may be a blessing in disguise. Throwing the charge of \"liberal media bias\" against powerful institutions has always provided an energizing force for the conservative movement, as the historian Nicole Hemmer shows in her new book, \"Messengers of the Right.\" Instead of focussing on ideas, Hemmer focusses on the galvanizing struggle over the means of distributing those ideas. The first modern conservatives were members of the America First movement, who found their isolationist views marginalized in the lead-up to the Second World War and vowed to fight back by forming the first conservative media outlets. A \"vague claim of exclusion\" sharpened into a \"powerful and effective ideological arrow in the conservative quiver,\" Hemmer argues, through battles that conservative radio broadcasters had with the F.C.C. in the nineteen-fifties and sixties. Their main obstacle was the F.C.C.'s Fairness Doctrine, which sought to protect public discourse by requiring controversial opinions to be balanced by opposing viewpoints. Since attacks on the mid-century liberal consensus were inherently controversial, conservatives found themselves constantly in regulators' sights. In 1961, a watershed moment occurred with the leak of a memo from labor leaders to the Kennedy Administration which suggested using the Fairness Doctrine to suppress right-wing viewpoints. To many conservatives, the memo proved the existence of the vast conspiracy they had long suspected. A fund-raising letter for a prominent conservative radio show railed against the doctrine, calling it \"the most dastardly collateral attack on freedom of speech in the history of the country.\" Thus was born the character of the persecuted truthteller standing up to a tyrannical government-a trope on which a billion-dollar conservative-media juggernaut has been built.</p><p>Today, Facebook and Google have taken the place of the F.C.C. in the conservative imagination. Conservative bloggers highlight the support that Jack Dorsey, the C.E.O. of Twitter, has expressed for Black Lives Matter, and the frequent visits that Google's Eric Schmidt made to the Obama White House. When Facebook announced that it was partnering with a group of fact checkers from the nonprofit Poynter Institute to flag false news stories, conservatives saw another effort to censor them under the guise of objectivity. Brent Bozell, who runs the conservative media-watchdog group Media Research Center, cited the fact that Poynter received funding from the liberal financier George Soros. \"Just like George Soros and company underwrote the Fairness Doctrine several years ago,\" he said, \"this is about going after conservative talk on the Internet and banning it by somehow projecting it as being false.\"</p><p>One lesson you get from Hemmer's research is that the conservative skepticism of gatekeepers is not without a historical basis. The Fairness Doctrine really was used by liberal groups to silence conservatives, typically by flooding stations with complaints and requests for airtime to respond. This created a chilling effect, with stations often choosing to avoid controversial material. The technical fixes implemented by Google and Facebook in the rush to fight fake news seem equally open to abuse, dependent, as they are, on user-generated reports.</p><p>Yet today, with a powerful, well-funded propaganda machine dedicated to publicizing any hint of liberal bias, conservatives aren't the ones who have the most to fear. As Facebook has become an increasingly important venue for activists documenting police abuse, many of them have complained that overzealous censors routinely block their posts. A recent report by the investigative nonprofit ProPublica shows how anti-racist activism can often fall afoul of Facebook rules against offensive material, while a post by the Louisiana representative Clay Higgins calling for the slaughter of \"radicalized\" Muslims was deemed acceptable. In 2016, a group of civil-rights activists wrote Facebook to demand that steps be taken to insure that the platform could be used by marginalized people and social movements organizing for change. There was no high-profile meeting with Zuckerberg, only a form letter outlining Facebook's moderation practices. The wishful story about how the Internet was creating a hyper-democratic \"participatory culture\" obscures the ways in which it is biased in favor of power.</p><p>The online tumult of the 2016 election fed into a growing suspicion of Silicon Valley's dominance over the public sphere. Across the political spectrum, people have become less trusting of the Big Tech companies that govern most online political expression. Calls for civic responsibility on the part of Silicon Valley companies have replaced the hope that technological innovation alone might bring about a democratic revolution. Despite the focus on algorithms, A.I., filter bubbles, and Big Data, these questions are political as much as technical. Regulation has become an increasingly popular notion; the Democratic senator Cory Booker has called for greater antitrust scrutiny of Google and Facebook, while Stephen Bannon reportedly wants to regulate Google and Facebook like public utilities. In the nineteen-thirties, such threats encouraged commercial broadcasters to adopt the civic paradigm. In that prewar era, advocates of democratic radio were united by a progressive vision of pluralism and rationality; today, the question of how to fashion a democratic social media is one more front in our highly divisive culture wars.</p><p>Still, Silicon Valley isn't taking any chances. In the wake of the recent, deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, a slew of tech companies banned the neo-Nazi blog the Daily Stormer, essentially blacklisting it from the Web. Responding so directly to appeals to decency and justice that followed the tragedy, these companies positioned themselves less as neutral platforms than as custodians of the public interest.</p><p>Zuckerberg recently posted a fifty-seven-hundred-word manifesto announcing a new mission for Facebook that goes beyond the neutral-seeming mandate to \"make the world more open and connected.\" Henceforth, Facebook would seek to \"develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.\" The manifesto was so heavy on themes of civic responsibility that many took it as a blueprint for a future political campaign. Speculation has only grown since Zuckerberg embarked on a fifty-state tour this summer to meet American Facebook users, posting photos of himself with livestock and unhealthy local delicacies. Those who think that Zuckerberg is preparing for a Presidential bid, however, should consider the emerging vectors of power in the digital era: for the man who runs Facebook, the White House might well look like a step down.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_0917_34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PDH-4VS1-DYWH-915G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4176\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

Instead of forceful action against the likes of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google, they say, the F.T.C. leans on rules that make it hard to impose penalties bigger than rounding errors for the companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those critics have an unusual champion: Joseph J. Simons, the man running the agency. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''We have this over 100-year-old statute that is our main authority,'' Mr. Simons said in his first sit-down interview since becoming chairman 10 months ago. ''And clearly legislators who approved that were not thinking about data security and privacy issues.''</p><p>  In the deregulatory era of the <person><nameText>Trump administration, </nameText></person>Mr. Simons, 60, a Republican lawyer who has jumped between the public and private sectors for more than 30 years, is a rare voice for strengthening the government's hand.</p><p>  Mr. Simons has urged Congress to expand the F.T.C.'s privacy-enforcement powers and allow it to impose fines more easily, write new rules and hire more experts. He also says the agency should police how all companies and nonprofits -- not just technology companies -- collect and handle people's digital data.</p><p>  But none of those changes will happen before Mr. Simons must make the most anticipated decision on data privacy in the agency's history. In the coming weeks, he and the F.T.C.'s four other commissioners are expected to conclude an investigation into whether <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>violated its promises to protect people's data.</p><p>  The outcome of the case is seen as a referendum on the government's ability to rein in tech giants that have amassed incredible wealth and power from collecting and bartering user data.</p><p>  ''The F.T.C.'s decision on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>will be highly consequential, for the F.T.C. and <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>for the tech industry, and for consumers,'' said David Vladeck, who led consumer protection at the agency during the <person><nameText>Obama administration. </nameText></person>''The commission's action will set the bar.''</p><p>  The case has taken on huge significance in Washington, where <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has become Exhibit A for an industry accused of a wide range of problems, from enabling foreign election interference to crushing competitors.</p><p>  A rising chorus of Republican and Democratic lawmakers has criticized the F.T.C. for not restraining the companies' data-collection practices, which are central to some of their businesses. The agency's biggest penalty on a tech company was a $22 million fine imposed on Googlein 2012, for misrepresenting how it used some online tracking tools. Googlereported $50 billion in revenue that year.</p><p>  On Friday, <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren, </nameText></person>the Massachusetts Democrat who is running for president, announced a sweeping plan to strengthen regulations against big tech companies.</p><p>  ''The F.T.C. has been a disappointment with its lack of enforcement in the past, which for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Googlehas amounted to a slap on the wrist,'' Senator Josh Hawley, a freshman Republican from Missouri, said in an interview. Mr. Hawley investigated Googlefor competition violations when he was a state attorney general.</p><p>  The <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>investigation is focused on whether the social network violated a 2011 consent decree in which it promised to protect user data and inform users of changes in how their data was used. The inquiry started last March under Mr. Simons's Republican predecessor, Maureen Ohlhausen, after a report in The New York Times revealed that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had analyzed the data of 87 million users without their permission.</p><p>  The agency is considering imposing a multibillion-dollar fine on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>as well as new requirements to strengthen protections on how data is collected and shared, according to two people close to talks between the agency and the company. The two sides have discussed a possible settlement for weeks, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>declined to comment about Mr. Simons and the investigation. The social network has defended its actions, saying that when it learned a researcher violated its terms of service by giving user data to Cambridge Analytica, it demanded that the data be destroyed and was promised that it had been.</p><p>  On Wednesday, the company announced plans to shift to a more privacy-focused platform. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, said <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>would invest in encrypted communications and refashion its messaging tools to emphasize private conversations.</p><p>  Mr. Simons declined to discuss the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>case. And he was even guarded about his own use of technology. He would not say whether he used <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>or two other popular apps owned by the company, Instagram and WhatsApp. He doesn't use other social media like Twitter, he said; aides write the tweets from his official F.T.C. account.</p><p>  ''I don't even know how to access my account,'' Mr. Simons said.</p><p>  His comfort zone is antitrust regulation, a major focus for the F.T.C. and an area in which he has worked for most of his career. In his meticulous office, Mr. Simons keeps handy a worn Yale Law Journal with red plastic tabs on antitrust articles. He has had six of its authors speak at the F.T.C. since he arrived.</p><p>  In one of his first actions as chairman, he held hearings on updating merger reviews and antitrust enforcement in the digital age. In late February, he announced a task force of 17 antitrust staff members to study potential problems that could arise from past tech mergers.</p><p>  ''In antitrust, you want to focus on areas where there is likely to be market power or monopoly power,'' Mr. Simons said. ''So it is not unreasonable to look at big digital platforms and say, well, that might be an ripe area to look at.''</p><p>  He is new to the world of data privacy and admits he is cramming to understand it, immersing himself in articles and grilling staff about data protection. But that, he said, allows him to bring a ''fresh perspective'' to privacy enforcement.</p><p>  ''I am willing to look at everything with a fresh eye, and to question long-held beliefs and assumptions,'' he said.</p><p>  The F.T.C. monitors whether companies like Google, Uber and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>break promises written into privacy policies. But it can't directly fine a company for a first-time offense; it can only charge a company with deceptive or unfair business practices, which the agency must prove in court. The potential penalty against <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>could reach billions of dollars because the case hinges on whether it violated a previous settlement.</p><p>  Mr. Simons argues that the agency needs more direct authority to oversee privacy practices and fine companies. He says it is too hard to prove to a court that someone has been harmed by a company's unauthorized use of their data.</p><p>  ''It's important that we get civil penalty authority,'' he said. ''For companies that have lots of money, the impact would be sufficient to deter them.''</p><p>  Privacy groups say the agency has missed numerous opportunities to punish companies with its existing powers. Many compare the commission with European regulators, which have levied hefty fines on Google, <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Amazon and Apple for violating antitrust, privacy, tax and security laws.</p><p>  Some privacy advocates are also concerned about Mr. Simon's inexperience in the area, saying it requires a deep understanding of complicated technologies.</p><p>  ''I don't think he understands the dimensions and implications underlying the consumer privacy threat,'' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.</p><p>  Mr. Simons said there were obvious differences between how the United States and Europe viewed privacy.</p><p>  ''The E.U. has this strong sense of the right to be forgotten,'' he said. ''We don't have that. We have the opposite of that. We have the First Amendment.''</p><p>  And he said the details of how the government handled digital privacy should be for lawmakers, not him, to sort out.</p><p>  ''Privacy involves very important societal and cultural values that really need to be determined by the Congress,'' Mr. Simons said, pointing toward Capitol Hill, less than a mile up Pennsylvania Avenue from his office.</p><p>  ''Not,'' he said, ''by unelected F.T.C. commissioners.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Joseph J.

The teenage distractions of the Chinese-own...</p><p>As a parent of a 13-year-old girl, I never imagined TikTok would turn into a geopolitical issue. The teenage distractions of the Chinese-owned app make Instagram look like Buddhist meditation. Now the Trump administration is weighing up whether to follow India\u2019s lead and ban it (New Delhi has outlawed 59 Chinese-owned apps). </p><p>On the few occasions my daughter has persuaded me to watch TikTok\u2019s leading personalities, such as Charli D\u2019Amelio, or Addison Rae, all I can see is incredibly well practised dance moves in 15-20 second posts. Each of these 16-year-old \u201cinfluencers\u201d has upwards of 60m followers, which must really go to their heads. But it is hard to imagine what the national security risks would be. There is a data risk, however. </p><p>In addition to scraping the private information from the app\u2019s 800m worldwide users, the Chinese could theoretically use the millions of images and videos posted on its site every day to improve its facial recognition technology, which, in turn, would feed into its Orwellian AI ambitions. That, and the fact that my daughter would be better able to read for a few minutes without interruption, has given me pause for thought. The Chinese-owned company, ByteDance, insists user data is stored outside of China. But it has yet to satisfy US legislators of its safeguards. The company has hired several allies of Donald Trump to lobby for its continued US existence.\u00a0</p><p>What would happen if the app were banned? My guess is that a US copycat would quickly take its place. In fact, the app is partly based on a previous US one called Musica.ly, which my daughter downloaded when she was about 10 (and which I quickly deleted). ByteDance bought Musica.ly and merged it with its competitor to form TikTok. But there may not be a need for an \u201cAmerican TikTok\u201d after all. According to my daughter, TikTokers have already figured a way round the potential ban. They would simply re-register their TikTok addresses in Canada. I suppose that could work \u2014 they are a clever generation. </p><p>My daughter was among the many thousands of young TikTokers who registered to attend the Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last month, which fooled the Trump campaign into expecting big numbers and resulted in a half-empty stadium. I would back the wits of her cohort against any regulator. But I am not sure I share my daughter\u2019s enthusiasm for winner-takes -all economics. Her first reaction on being told TikTok might be banned was: \u201cBut that would destroy Charli D\u2019Amelio\u2019s career!\u201d I pointed out that, at 16, Ms D\u2019Amelio would have ample time to \u201cfind something new\u201d, as Ivanka Trump might put it.\u00a0</p><p>But what about the geopolitics? The downward spiral of US-China relations would only seem slow by TikTok\u2019s standards. By any historic measure it is happening at terrifying speed. As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-07-15/china-done-biding-its-time\"> Kurt Campbell and Mira Rapp-Hooper write</url> in the latest Foreign Affairs, China is no longer a patient power. The clich\u00e9 about how the Chinese can play the long game \u2014 supplemented by that Deng Xiaoping quote about China hiding its light under a bushel \u2014 is out of date. As they argue, China is \u201cno longer biding its time\u201d. This week I interviewed Nathan Law, one of Hong Kong\u2019s leading dissidents, who has left the city state for London so that he can continue to speak out. For those interested, here is our <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXCdEIhuEiE&amp;feature=youtu.be\"> conversation</url>, which was hosted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. </p><p>A few weeks ago, China announced plans to impose its state security law on Hong Kong.

None of this is TikTok specific \u2014 it\u2019s more about the ease and illusion that digital technology gives us that we are creating something truly unique. In an age in which everyone can take great pictures and create their own music with pre-manufactured backbeats, who is really an artist? Personally, I think it engenders a certain narcissism. I\u2019d rather my son have stuck with his piano lessons. But then, I\u2019m old (and on that front, per your reference to our Swamp Note about JK Rowling and the cancel culture stuff, I\u2019m really interested about how all that tends to break down along age lines \u2014 people over 45 see it one way, those under see it another).\u00a0</p><p>As for the threat of Chinese surveillance technology, I think it\u2019s real for the reasons you\u2019ve described.

Should parents use their personal networks to get their kids a leg up in getting summer internships or job interviews? Should parents support separate private schools and pay for special test tutoring and coaching? Looking out for your own is human nature.

In an open letter[2] appearing in The Guardian, Tim Berners-Lee painted a bleak picture of the current internet -- one dominated by a handful of colossal platforms that have constricted innovation and obliterated the rich, lopsided archipelago of blogs and small sites that came before. It's not too late to change, Lee wrote, but to do so, we need a dream team of business, tech, government, civil workers, academics and artists to cooperate in building \"the web we all want.\"Lee reserves his biggest criticisms for the huge platforms -- by implication, Facebook and Google, among others -- that have come to dominate their spheres and effectively become gatekeepers. </p><p>They \"control which ideas and opinions are seen and shared,\" Lee wrote, pointing out that they're able to impede competition by creating barriers. \"They acquire startup challengers, buy up new innovations and hire the industry's top talent. Add to this the competitive advantage that their user data gives them and we can expect the next 20 years to be far less innovative than the last.\"Centralizing the web like this has lead to serious problems, like when an Amazon Web Services outage[3] took down a chunk of internet services over a week ago -- ironically, nearly a year to the day after another similar web-crippling incident[4] on AWS. But bottlenecking the internet through a handful of platforms has also enabled something more sinister: The weaponization of the internet. From trending conspiracy theories[5] all the way up to influencing[6] American politics using hundreds of fake social media accounts, outside actors have been able to maximize their manipulation efforts thanks to a far more centralized internet than we used to have, in Lee's opinion. These companies are ill-equipped to work for social benefit given their focus on profit -- and perhaps could use some regulation. \"The responsibility - and sometimes burden - of making these decisions falls on companies that have been built to maximise profit more than to maximise social good. A legal or regulatory framework that accounts for social objectives may help ease those tensions,\" wrote Lee.You know who could fix the future of the internet? Us, of course -- a group of individuals from a broad cross-section of society who can outthink the hegemony of colossal internet corporations who are mostly fine with things as they are. Incentives could be the key to motivating new solutions, Lee concluded.But there's another problem that business can't really solve: Closing the digital gap by getting the unconnected onto the internet. These are more likely to be female, poor, geographically remote and/or living outside of the first world. Bringing them into the fold will diversify voices on the internet and be, well, a moral thing to do now that the UN has decided internet access is a basic human right. But it'll take more than inventive business models to get them online and up to speed: We'll have to support policies that bring the internet to them over community networks and/or public access.

Pai said he opposes regulating tech companies like utilities, but implied he believes new regulations may be needed to require such transparency.He didn't spell out precisely what kind of rules he would support or how they would be enforced. The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is calling for new \"obligations\" to maketech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter reveal more details about how the operate their online services. In a post on Medium[1] on Tuesday, Ajit Pai said internet companies have amassed unprecedented influence over the economy and society yet lack proper public accountability to the public. </p><p>\"We need to seriously think about whether the time has come for these companies to abide by new transparency obligations,\" Pai wrote in the post, titled \"What I Hope to Learn from the Tech Giants.\" The comments by the FCC Chair, who has no direct authority over internet companies like Google and Facebook, come a week after President Trump blasted Google[2] for allegedly shutting out conservative voices. And in recent days, many on the right have been echoing Trump's allegations and calling for new rules to govern tech firms, including potentially utility-style regulations. Pai said that the tech companies policies and practices with regards to user privacy, online expression and operational transparency deserve more scrutiny. Although he explicitly said he was against regulating tech companies like public utilities, Pai called on government officials to \"thoughtfully explore\" the issues. On Wednesday, executives at Twitter[3], Facebook[4], and Alphabet-owned Google are slated to testify at hearings on Capitol Hill about topics such as transparency and foreign actors' attempts to infiltrate their services to spread propaganda influence operations on their services. \"The public deserves to know more about how these companies operate,\" Pai said. He continued: \"Just as is the case with respect to broadband providers, consumers need accurate information in order to make educated choices about whether and how to use these tech giants' platforms.\" The big tech companies have faced growing criticism in recent months and years, especially since Russian-linked groups hijacked some of the services to spread propaganda during the 2016 election. Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal this spring, growing concerns about the companies' privacy practices, and the companies' bans on comments by right-wing figures such as Alex Jones have only amplified the outcry against them from all parts of the political spectrum.Pai opposes regulating the tech companies like utilitiesIn his post, Pai said regulating big tech similarly to how gas and electric utilities are regulated is \"not the right answer.\" \"The government\u200a\u2014\u200ain particular, the Federal Communications Commission, which I have the privilege of leading\u200a\u2014\u200ashouldn't regulate these entities like a water company,\" Pai said. But he did suggest that new rules are needed to force tech companies to disclose more information about how they manage their services, particularly about how they decide which users can and can't speak and what they can post. \"Are these tech giants running impartial digital platforms over which they don't exercise editorial judgment when it comes to content?\" Pai wrote. \"Or do they in fact decide what speech is allowed and what is not and discriminate based on ideology and/or political affiliation? ... Going back to the first point: where is the transparency?\" Pai also took aim at the tech companies' privacy practices. He noted the recent controversies such as Google's collecting users' location data even when they thought they'd asked it not to and called for the companies to disclose more information about what kinds of information they are collecting from their users and what they are doing with it. \"Most consumers have no idea that their data is being shared in these ways,\" Pai wrote. \"Most consumers have no idea how this data is being used.\" Pai did not spell out exactly what kind of regulations he would favor or which agency he thought would be best placed to enforce them. The FCC has authority over broadband, telephone, and television providers, but traditionally has had little authority over website operators or app providers. His call for new regulations on tech companies comes just months after the FCC under his lead repealed its net-neutrality rules[5] that governed broadband service providers. Pai also cheered Congress' move last year to overturn FCC regulations[6] intended to restrict what broadband providers could do with customers' personal information. Pai's statement comes as net-neutrality proponents have been trying to collect enough signatures among members of the House of Representatives to force a vote on overturning the FCC's repeal of its net-neutrality rules. The Senate passed a similar measure[7] earlier this year.

Pai suggested that new regulations might be needed to force this transparency and even indicated that his agency might be the one to put the new rules in place and enforce them. But his concerns seemed to come out of left field; Pai has been as longtime opponent of regulations and recently spearheaded an effort to kill the FCC's net neutrality rules, which cut transparency requirements for broadband companies. He also applauded Congress when it repealed the FCC's privacy protections for broadband customers. </p><p>Pai's comments appear to be more about politics than policy; it's no coincidence that they come hot on the heels of President Trump's own attacks on the big tech companies.  Ajit Pai is shameless. Pai, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, would have you believe that he believes in government oversight. He want you to believe that he's a champion of transparency and privacy. In a post on Medium[1] on Tuesday, Pai took the big tech companies to task[2]. Consumers don't understand how Google orders its search results or why Twitter bans some people but not others. Google and Facebook are collecting enormous amounts of data on their customers \u2014 but those customers have no clue what they're collecting. Apple and Google appear to be kowtowing to China and censoring the internet for its citizens. Pai suggested that it was time for the government to impose transparency \"obligations\" on the tech giants. The companies ought to be disclosing how they operate their services, what they do with customers' private information, and how they decide which posts or people to block. \"The public deserves to know more about how these companies operate,\" Pai said. Pai's not wrong, of course. Facebook and Google in particular have enormous control over what sites we visit, what videos we watch, and what news we read. We ought to have more insight into how they operate their services[3]. (It would be great to know that about Twitter too, but its user base is far smaller than that of Facebook and Google and so too is its power and influence.)It's hard to believe Pai believes what he's advocatingBut it's a more than a little hard to believe that Pai actually believes what he's saying. You see, up until this point, he's made it very clear that he's a free-market, laissez-faire, anti-regulatory conservative. You may remember Pai as the guy who spearheaded the FCC's effort to repeal net-neutrality rules[4] in the face of widespread opposition, because he thought the rules were too onerous. He's such a believer in deregulation that he's questioned whether his agency has the authority to oversee broadband companies at all and abdicated pretty much all oversight over them to the Federal Trade Commission, an agency with both a much broader mandate and much narrower powers. This, despite the fact that the the FCC was created in large part to regulate telecommunications companies \u2014 a classification into which most people would include broadband providers. Pai's concern for transparency would be more convincing if he hadn't \u2014 in the process of repealing the FCC's net neutrality rules \u2014 taken a hacksaw to the disclosure requirements the agency put on broadband providers. Likewise, his worries about privacy would be a lot more believable if he hadn't cheered[5] last year when Congress repealed his agency's rules that were designed to protect the private information[6] of broadband customers. And his concerns about free speech would ring a lot truer if he hadn't completely dismissed the free speech concerns[7] voiced fromall[8] over[9] the political spectrum about the danger of killing the net-neutrality protections. Those protections barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to particular online sites or services. Without them, broadband providers are free to block or throttle access to any sites or services they like for any reason at all \u2014 including to suppress particular speakers or speech. \"It's the height of hypocrisy,\" said Gigi Sohn, a fellow at Georgetown Law who previously served as a counselor to Tom Wheeler, Pai's predecessor as head of the FCC. A representative for Pai did not respond to an email seeking comment and clarification about his Medium statement.Pai wants to regulate companies his agency doesn't overseeBut Pai's newfound regulatory zeal is even less convincing because he seems to imply that the FCC ought to have some role in imposing new rules on Google, Facebook, and other internet companies. In talking about what kinds of regulations such companies should have to follow, he repeatedly refers to the transparency rules the FCC has placed on broadband providers (without, of course, mentioning that he recently weakened them). And even in dismissing the idea of utility-style regulations, he hints at the notion that the FCC would be the agency that might put such rules in place. \"The government\u200a\u2014\u200ain particular, the Federal Communications Commission, which I have the privilege of leading\u200a\u2014\u200ashouldn't regulate these entities like a water company,\" he said. The laughable thing about all this is that his agency has no recognized authority over online companies such as Google and Facebook. So here you have an official who washed his hands of regulating the companies his agency is actually charged with overseeing seemingly suggesting that his agency ought to crack down on companies it doesn't actually regulate. As Sohn put it: \"Why is that any of your business? You regulate networks.\" Of course, if you take a step back, it's pretty easy to see and understand what's going on here. It's all political. Late last month, President Trump launched a jihad[10] against Google and Facebook, apparently after seeing an episode of Lou Dobbs' Fox Business show[11] that alleged that Google was suppressing conservative voices and positive news about Trump. The move came after Google and other companies kicked far-right conspiracy monger Alex Jones off their services[12].Conservatives are lining up behind TrumpSince Trump's attack, conservatives from all corners \u2014 most of whom, like Pai, have generally supported laissez faire policies in the past \u2014 have fallen in line and dutifully trained their fire on the big tech companies. Last week, right-wing talk show host Laura Ingraham floated the idea of regulating the tech companies like utilities[13]. On Wednesday, Republican congressional leaders harangued Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey over alleged bias[14] against conservatives. Later in the day, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced he'll meet with the attorneys general[15] of some of the states to discuss whether the tech companies are stymieing free speech and competition. Again, all this concern over the power of the big tech companies would be more convincing if conservatives had made any kind of noise about corporate power before Trump started making sounding off about it. Instead, for the last 40 years, Republicans have generally taken the stance that bigger is better[16], consolidation is good for consumers, and the market will correct any sort of monopolistic practices, no government intervention needed. (The Democrats, mind you, have only been barely better on this score.) With all the public relations hits Trump has been taken lately \u2014 his former campaign manager convicted of fraud, his former attorney pleading guilty to violating campaign finance laws on his behest, and now, the damning inside looks at his administration from Bob Woodward and the anonymous New York Times op-ed writer \u2014 it's easy to understand why he and his ideological allies would like to change the subject. Maybe some good will come of this. The big internet companies do deserve more scrutiny, not for censoring conservative voices for ideological reasons \u2014 for which there's little evidence \u2014 but because of their sheer market power and control. But if Ajit Pai is any indication of how Republicans are approaching this effort, it's hard to believe it will be anything more than a political stunt meant to appease the president and distract from all terrible stuff going on around him.NOW WATCH: We used a headset that transforms your brain activity into a light display \u2014 here's how it works[17]See Also: Twitter just dropped the hammer on

But such revolving door regulation has more subtle casualties, as well. The Wall Street Journal this week for example offered up an interesting deep dive[2] into how ISPs successfully pressure the FCC to ignore slower broadband speed test data when analyzing whether ISPs are delivering the speeds they promise:\"AT...nc. </p><p>was dismayed at its report card from a government test measuring internet speeds. So the telecom giant sought to change its grade. The company pushed the Federal Communications Commission to omit unflattering data on its DSL internet service from the report, which assesses whether providers are delivering the speeds they advertise. AT...lso didn't provide information the FCC needed to validate speeds on those customers, the test officials confirmed. In the end, the DSL data was left out of the report released late last year, to the chagrin of some agency officials. AT... remaining speed tiers notched high marks.The Journal is quick to highlight how this kind of gamesmanship results in FCC studies and data that doesn't accurately reflect reality, something that obviously excites incumbent broadband executives all too eager to obscure incomplete deployments and a lack of competition in the sector:\"Companies wield tremendous influence over the study and often employ tactics to boost their scores, according to interviews with more than two dozen industry executives, engineers and government officials. As a result, the FCC's report likely gives consumers an unreliable measure of internet providers' performances by overstating speeds.\"Hoping to use real world data to inform policy decisions (crazy, I know), just about a decade ago the previous FCC struck a deal with UK measuring firm SamKnows to measure real world broadband speeds under the creatively named Measuring Broadband America[3] program. The firm in turn began using volunteers and custom-firmware embedded routers to obtain an objective, third party analysis of just what kind of speeds users see in the wild. Not too surprisingly the Pai FCC has been trying to discontinue the program, and AT...ays it will no longer cooperate with the FCC on the effort anyway (apparently with no penalty from the FCC). Meanwhile, AT...ries to claim to the Journal that the reason it wanted its slower DSL speed ratings removed from the study is because it no longer markets the service:\"AT...aid that in its case, the company asked the FCC to remove DSL data from the report because it no longer markets that older technology, which relies on copper phone lines, used by a small percentage of its customer base. The company said the commission's own policies should have excluded the 'obsolete' internet plans. AT...lso said that it did validate the DSL accounts for the FCC.\"But we've noted for years that AT...as been a cheapskate when it comes to finishing fiber deployments the company has received billions in taxpayer dollars for, leaving vast swaths of the country with the choice of either a cable monopoly or sluggish, capped DSL[4]. AT...ould prefer it if government reports just floated the fuck over that fact, and the Pai FCC seems more than happy to oblige, with zero to no penalty for big ISPs that mislead the agency or refuse to take part in projects that give consumers an accurate view of the market. This of course isn't the first time this problem has been brought up. FCC reports are routinely assailed[5] as being rose-colored-glasses affairs designed not to inform, but to avoid upsetting deep pocketed telecom campaign contributors. The FCC's $350 million broadband map[6], which all but hallucinates competitors and speeds, and omits pricing data, is a perfect example of the end result of this dysfunction. The end goal is government reports that again hide the country's mediocre and expensive broadband shortcomings, lest somebody get the crazy idea to try and do something about it. The Journal's report likely won't get much attention, since exclusively hating on big tech while forgetting big telecom is just as bad[7] is all the rage right now. But uncharacteristically for a major US paper, the Journal does a nice job highlighting how a captured FCC is now a full throated apologist for the broken US broadband industry and its half-built, expensive, taxpayer-funded networks.Permalink[8] | Comments[9] | Email This Story[10] [ 1]: <url

But such revolving door regulation has more subtle casualties, as well. The Wall Street Journal this week for example offered up an interesting deep dive into how ISPs successfully pressure the FCC to ignore slower broadband speed test data when analyzing whether ISPs are delivering the speeds they promise:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"AT&amp;T Inc. was dismayed at its report card from a government test measuring internet speeds. So the telecom giant sought to change its grade.</p><p>The company pushed the Federal Communications Commission to omit unflattering data on its DSL internet service from the report, which assesses whether providers are delivering the speeds they advertise. AT&amp;T also didnt provide information the FCC needed to validate speeds on those customers, the test officials confirmed.</p><p>In the end, the DSL data was left out of the report released late last year, to the chagrin of some agency officials. AT&amp;Ts remaining speed tiers notched high marks.</p><p>The Journal is quick to highlight how this kind of gamesmanship results in FCC studies and data that doesn't accurately reflect reality, something that obviously excites incumbent broadband executives all too eager to obscure incomplete deployments and a lack of competition in the sector:</p><p>\"Companies wield tremendous influence over the study and often employ tactics to boost their scores, according to interviews with more than two dozen industry executives, engineers and government officials. As a result, the FCCs report likely gives consumers an unreliable measure of internet providers performances by overstating speeds.\"</p><p>Hoping to use real world data to inform policy decisions (crazy, I know), just about a decade ago the previous FCC struck a deal with UK measuring firm SamKnows to measure real world broadband speeds under the creatively named Measuring Broadband America program. The firm in turn began using volunteers and custom-firmware embedded routers to obtain an objective, third party analysis of just what kind of speeds users see in the wild. Not too surprisingly the Pai FCC has been trying to discontinue the program, and AT&amp;T says it will no longer cooperate with the FCC on the effort anyway (apparently with no penalty from the FCC).</p><p>Meanwhile, AT&amp;T tries to claim to the Journal that the reason it wanted its slower DSL speed ratings removed from the study is because it no longer markets the service:</p><p>\"AT&amp;T said that in its case, the company asked the FCC to remove DSL data from the report because it no longer markets that older technology, which relies on copper phone lines, used by a small percentage of its customer base. The company said the commissions own policies should have excluded the obsolete internet plans. AT&amp;T also said that it did validate the DSL accounts for the FCC.\"</p><p>But we've noted for years that AT&amp;T has been a cheapskate when it comes to finishing fiber deployments the company has received billions in taxpayer dollars for, leaving vast swaths of the country with the choice of either a cable monopoly or sluggish, capped DSL. AT&amp;T would prefer it if government reports just floated the fuck over that fact, and the Pai FCC seems more than happy to oblige, with zero to no penalty for big ISPs that mislead the agency or refuse to take part in projects that give consumers an accurate view of the market.</p><p>This of course isn't the first time this problem has been brought up. FCC reports are routinely assailed as being rose-colored-glasses affairs designed not to inform, but to avoid upsetting deep pocketed telecom campaign contributors. The FCC's $350 million broadband map, which all but hallucinates competitors and speeds, and omits pricing data, is a perfect example of the end result of this dysfunction.

It attempts to tackle a problem that doesn't exist (\"Conservative censorship[2]\") by attacking a law that actually protects free speech (Section 230), all to be enforced by agencies (like the FCC) that don't actually have the authority to do anything of the sort. You can't overrule the law by executive order or regulatory fiat, nor can you ignore the Constitution. The EO is a dumb joke by folks who don't understand how any of this works, and it should be treated as such. </p><p>Instead, most press coverage of the move is still somehow framed as \"very serious adult policy,\" despite being little more than a glorified brain fart. The FCC also knows the order is unworkable garbage that flies directly in the face of years of espoused (government hands off) ideology by Ajit Pai, Brendan Carr and friends. And yet, terrified of upsetting dear leader, Pai issued a totally feckless statement on Monday stating the EO would be pushed through the rule-making process, pretending as if this was all just ordinary, sensible tech policy: Today, the @FCC[3]'s Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau will invite public input on the petition for rulemaking recently filed by @CommerceGov[4] regarding #Section230[5] of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. My statement is below. pic.twitter .com/RSwm5suq9z[6]; \u2014 Ajit Pai (@AjitPaiFCC) August 3, 2020[7]This is, you'll recall, the same guy who spent the last eight years insisting that fairly modest consumer protections governing telecom monopolies (net neutrality, privacy) was a vile example of \"government run amok.\" It's the same guy whose entire policy platform revolves around the idea that hands off, limited government oversight universally results in near-mystical outcomes. The order to have the FCC regulate social media giants runs in stark contrast to nearly everything Pai professes to believe, including his adoration of free speech (since eliminating 230 would all but guarantee less of it). And yet he's completely unwilling to make so much as a cautiously critical peep. Even if Pai's worried that he'll just be replaced by Carr (whose somehow even worse about intellectual consistency[8]) for showing the slightest shred of backbone, there are ways that Pai could express his disdain for this order without upsetting King Donald (perhaps just use big words). But Pai does nothing of the sort. He's completely selling out everything he believes in to make Donald happy. Not only that, he attempts to frame the idea that we should shut down an idiotic assault on free speech before wasting everybody's time as itself an attack on free speech. As a result we're wasting agency time and taxpayer resources (during a pandemic no less when 42 million Americans lack broadband, something actually under FCC authority) to pursue an inherently dumb and dangerous idea. Now we move on to the next step in pretending this is real policy: opening the FCC comment system to 45 day of public comments. Except as we saw with the net neutrality repeal (in which the telecom industry used fake and dead people to support terrible and unpopular policy[9]), the FCC doesn't actually do much to prevent fraud or abuse. So anybody eager to see Silicon Valley saddled with additional regulatory oversight (like its ad competitors in telecom or K Street political operatives) are going to stuff the ballot box with nonsense, taking us further down the rabbit hole of pretending Trump's EO is serious adult policy making. In short we've got a garbage, unworkable proposal being shuffled through elaborate NTIA and FCC policy making system at taxpayer expense during a crisis, all \"supported\" by people too afraid of Donald Trump to show even the faintest hint of consistency or backbone. In other words, just another ordinary Monday in Washington.
